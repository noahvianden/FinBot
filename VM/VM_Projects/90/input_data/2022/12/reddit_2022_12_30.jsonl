{"title": "Tesla stock analysis and valuation - including DIY valuation", "selftext": "Well, it took a bit, but finally here's my full analysis of Tesla.\n\n***Disclaimer: I have a small position in Tesla with an average price of around $150/share.***\n\nThe post covers the following:\n\n1. Introduction\n2. Fundamental analysis of Tesla's automotive business, including cars sold, capacity, and future investments required.\n3. Competitive landscape (profitability, debt & future growth/ROIC)\n4. Historical financial performance\n5. Assumptions & valuation\n6. Valuation based on assumptions different than mine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI'd describe Tesla as a car company with big dreams and impressive technology. There are bulls and bears with different assumptions about the future, but if we look backward, there's no doubt that as a company, it disrupted the industry and accelerated the transition to EVs.\n\nIt operates in two segments, automotive (responsible for 96% of the revenue and almost all the gross profit) and energy generation and storage (attributing the remaining 4% of the revenue).\n\nNow, I mentioned big dreams. That's of course, coming from Elon Musk. Let's take a look at a few of them:\n\n1. FSD (Full self-driving capability) & robotaxis - Tesla was to some extent the first mover in this area and is likely the company with the most data. However, in my opinion, the competitors are catching up. As for the robotaxis, there's still some time until it becomes a reality and when it happens, Tesla won't be the only player on the market.\n2. The \"energy generation and storage\" segment is to be worth as much as the automotive segment - Another big prediction that so far seems to have an incredibly low probability. Its current size is insignificant, it's not a profitable segment, and in order to become a significant portion of Tesla's value, well, it will take a long time.\n3. Optimus - The humanoid robot is expected to be on sale by 2027 with a cost of $20k. This was revealed on the latest AI day and some engineers who followed the event (and are not employed at Tesla) weren't impressed. They weren't impressed by the current state of Optimus, although they were impressed by the progress made in such a short period of time.\n4. Tesla will sell 20m cars annually by 2030 - This is something that we'll come back to.\n\nOne of the jobs of Elon Musk, like any other CEO, is to be positive and optimistic about the future. That doesn't mean everything will happen nor that the timeline is accurate (especially with Elon).\n\nThere are 110k employees at Tesla, yet the tweets of one of them seem to have more impact on the share price compared to all the work the others do. It seems as if Elon has shifted from being one of Tesla's biggest assets to one of its biggest liabilities. However, this post will not be about Elon, it will focus on Tesla as a company and its fundamentals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fundamental analysis of Tesla's automotive business, including cars sold, capacity, and future investments required.**\n\nLet's zoom out for a moment. It is obvious that there's a lot of stuff going on (and who knows what else will be announced in the next decade), so in my forecast, I'm expecting that the automotive segment will account for 90% of Tesla's value, leaving 10% for all the other stuff (Optimus, energy generation and storage, etc.)\n\nTo value any car company, there are two main inputs:\n\n1. \\# of cars sold annually\n2. Margin per car\n\nFor younger car companies, capacity is also something to be looked into.\n\nIf we look at the statistics, the number of cars sold worldwide annually is pretty flat over time.\n\n2019: **74.9m;** 2020: **63.8m;** 2021: **66.7m;** 2022: **65.4m;** 2023: **71.0m (expected)**\n\nWe can round that to 70m cars/year.\n\nTesla has been growing quite fast when it comes to deliveries\n\n2018: **245k;** 2019: **367k**; 2020: **499k;** 2021: **936k;** 2022: **1.4m (expected - rounded)**\n\nSo, based on the 2022 numbers, Tesla has roughly a 2% share.\n\nIf we go back at the 20m cars/year prediction, that represents a staggering **28.5% share!** How realistic is that? Well, I'll let you be the judge.\n\nHow about the production capacity? Currently, that's around **1.9m**. So, if Tesla wants to grow, they need to invest here A LOT. How much? Let's take a look at their historical investments:\n\nThe Berlin factory cost around $5b and comes with a capacity of 250k cars. So, on average, Tesla would need to invest around $20k in capex to increase the production capacity by 1 car. Using the gross PPE from the balance sheet as a metric for all past investments ($43.9b) that led to the 1.9m capacity, we get to a similar outcome. Of course, not all of the $43.9b is related to manufacturing, there's a portion for R&D, general support functions, etc.\n\nThis gives a good idea of the future investments required. If Tesla wants to increase capacity by 4m units, they need to invest roughly $80b.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competitive landscape**\n\nIn this segment, I'd like to take a look at 10+ competitors in this industry and look into quite some metrics. I'll start with what the critics normally point out, the price of the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Company|Revenue (in $b)|Market cap (in $b)|P/E ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla|$74.9|$381.7|36.5|\n|Toyota|$232.2|$188.6|10.0|\n|BYD|$47.6|$96.3|51.0|\n|Volkswagen|$261.2|$71.9|3.6|\n|Mercedes-Benz Group|$141.4|$70.7|5.1|\n|BMW|$128.9|$58.9|3.1|\n|General Motors|$147.2|$47.8|5.7|\n|Ford|$151.8|$46.4|5.2|\n|Stellantis|$172.7|$46.1|2.8|\n|Honda|$108.1|$38.8|7.9|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's P/E is roughly 7x higher than the average of the competitors (with a few exceptions). The question that is asked over and over is, how the hell is Tesla worth so much more than Toyota when Toyota sells 10m cars a year (with Tesla 1.4m for the full 2022)? To answer that question, we need to look into 3 segments:\n\n1. Profitability\n2. Debt\n3. Future growth/ROIC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Let's start with profitability:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Company|Revenue (in $b)|Gross profit|Operating expenses|Operating margin|Operating profit (in $m)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla|$74.9|26.6%|9.9%|16.7%|$12,510|\n|Toyota|$232.2|17.0%|9.9%|7.1%|$16,511|\n|BYD|$47.6|15.1%|11.8%|3.3%|$1,547|\n|Volkswagen|$261.2|18.5%|10.2%|8.3%|$21,555|\n|Mercedes-Benz Group|$141.4|22.5%|11.0%|11.5%|$16,279|\n|BMW|$128.9|16.5%|6.6%|9.9%|$13,079|\n|General Motors|$147.2|13.6%|5.4%|8.2%|$12,025|\n|Ford|$151.8|11.4%|4.3%|7.1%|$10,696|\n|Stellantis|$172.7|20.2%|8.5%|11.7%|$20,173|\n|Honda|$108.1|20.0%|14.4%|5.6%|$6,097|\n\nThe companies are sorted based on their market cap. Although Tesla has 1/3rd of Toyota's revenue, they make almost as much operating profit! Why? It's obvious, they have higher margins. So, what contributes to that? A few points have to be noted:\n\n1. Tesla does not sell through dealerships - this allows them to have higher gross margins as there are no 3rd parties to pay.\n2. Tesla famously doesn't spend money on marketing (funny enough, Elon bought a company that depends on advertising, but anyway, let's get back to Tesla)\n3. Tesla could build factories from scratch, perfectly suited for EVs, while the big companies have to invest to re-purpose their existing factories.\n\nThere are only two luxury cars that have higher operating margins than Tesla (Porsche & Ferrari), but they're targeting a very niche audience and not the mass-market.\n\n**Let's continue by looking at the debt of each company:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Company|Operating profit (in $m)|Market cap (in $b)|Net debt (in $b)|Market cap + Net debt (EV)|EV / Operating profit|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla|$12,510|$381.7|$ (15.2)|$366.5|29.3|\n|Toyota|$16,511|$188.6|$143.6|$332.2|20.1|\n|BYD|$1,547|$96.3|$ (3.0)|$93.3|60.3|\n|Volkswagen|$21,555|$71.9|$157.0|$228.9|10.6|\n|Mercedes-Benz Group|$16,279|$70.7|$95.1|$165.7|10.2|\n|BMW|$13,079|$58.9|$83.3|$142.2|10.9|\n|General Motors|$12,025|$47.8|$89.2|$137.0|11.4|\n|Ford|$10,696|$46.4|$97.8|$144.2|13.5|\n|Stellantis|$20,173|$46.1|$ (20.1)|$26.0|1.3|\n|Honda|$6,097|$38.8|$28.3|$67.1|11.0|\n\nWhy is looking at the debt so important? Well:\n\n1. First of all, it isn't free. It needs to be repaid and with interest. The auto industry is known to be cyclical, but the debt doesn't really care about that.\n2. The companies that are better positioned from a financial leverage perspective can afford to lower prices temporarily and steal market share. Tesla is in a great position for this, while the giants cannot afford to break even (from an operating profit point of view)\n3. High leverage combined with unprofitable business leads to bankruptcy.\n\nSo, I decided to look at this a bit differently. I wanted to check how much would one pay to acquire each company debt-free and what is the return (measured through operating profit). Now, Tesla's ratio isn't 7x higher, but less than 3x higher than the average competitor.\n\nRemember Toyota? It needs 9 years of operating profit to cover its net debt! Tesla costs 367m to be bought debt-free, while Toyota 332m - quite close!\n\nP.S. I took a shortcut for the EV calculation, it's not 100% accurate (it doesn't take into account minority interest, for example), but it's quite close.\n\n**Lastly, let's take a look at the last piece of the puzzle, the growth & ROIC**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Company|Operating profit (in $m)|EV / Operating profit|NTM revenue growth|ROIC|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla|$12,510|29.3|45.0%|26.4%|\n|Toyota|$16,511|20.1|14.5%|4.0%|\n|BYD|$1,547|60.3|46.7%|7.9%|\n|Volkswagen|$21,555|10.6|5.8%|6.0%|\n|Mercedes-Benz Group|$16,279|10.2|3.5%|8.7%|\n|BMW|$13,079|10.9|6.5%|7.0%|\n|General Motors|$12,025|11.4|9.4%|6.5%|\n|Ford|$10,696|13.5|5.9%|6.2%|\n|Stellantis|$20,173|1.3|4.0%|19.5%|\n|Honda|$6,097|11.0|24.0%|4.1%|\n\nIt's obvious that Tesla and BYD are the exceptions when we look at the expected revenue growth for the next 12 months.\n\nHowever, what's also impressive is that Tesla has the highest ROIC - They're making the best return on their investments. All of that while also spending money on all kinds of side projects.\n\nIn my opinion, the culture within Tesla seems to be better suited for innovation, compared to the old-school, traditional, car manufacturers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical financial performance**\n\nTesla's revenue has increased significantly, from $21.5b back in 2018 to almost $80b in the last twelve months. At the same time, the gross margin increased from 19% to almost 27%.\n\nThe operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) have decreased as % of sales from 20% to 10%, leading to an operating margin of 17%, which is much higher than the average.\n\nOver the same period, they reduced their debt from $14b to $6b (while accumulating $21b+ in cash) leading to a net debt position of -$15b.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Assumptions & valuation**\n\nAs mentioned above, I'm expecting that the automotive segment will account for 90% of Tesla's value, leaving 10% for all the other stuff (Optimus, energy generation and storage, etc.)\n\nMy assumptions are as follows:\n\n**Revenue growth**: 35% in the next 12 months, declining to 30%, then to 25%, all the way down to 5% in year 10. By then, the projected revenue is close to **$400b (an increase of 431% vs. LTM)** \\- representing roughly 6m cars per year (8.6% share) - This also means $80b in capex over time (4m additional capacity x $20k)\n\nJust a reminder of how Tesla's deliveries have progressed over time:\n\n2018: **245k;** 2019: **367k**; 2020: **499k;** 2021: **936k;** 2022: **1.4m (expected - rounded)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Operating margin**: 10% for the next 2 years due to a recession, then recovery to 18% over time.\n\n**Discount rate:** 9.5%\n\n**Terminal growth rate:** 5%\n\nThe valuation based on my assumptions is **$563b** **(179.84/share)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Note: Adjustments have been made for cash/debt, unearned revenue as well as outstanding equity options***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, before anyone jumps on me, these are my assumptions and I could be significantly wrong. So, if you have other expectations, I hope the table below can help.\n\n**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**\n\nThe table below shows how the valuation changes (per share), based on assumptions regarding the revenue in 10 years, the operating margin, and how the market share / # of cars to be sold to get there.\n\n|Revenue/ Operating margin|16%|18%|20%|22%|Cars/year (share %)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|250% ($262.0b)|$109.5|$125.2|$139.2|$152.2|3.5m (5%)|\n|325% ($318.1b)|$129.5|$148.4|$165.5|$181.2|4.5m (6.5%)|\n|431% (397.4b)|$156.3|$179.8|$201.1|$220.8|6m (8.6)|\n|1670% (1.33t)|$445.6|$519.3|$589.2|$654.8|20m (28.5%)|\n\nThe last row represents Elon Musk's crazy scenario of selling 20m+ cars per year (without even taking into account the energy generation and storage segment to be the same size as the automotive one) For that to happen, Tesla needs to grow at a rate of 35% annually for a decade.\n\nBased on my assumptions, Tesla is undervalued at the current price levels, however, it was significantly overvalued for a long period of time.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the post and apologies for the length, I wanted to make sure to cover all the points that I find important.\n\nI welcome disagreements on everything mentioned above.", "id": "zz8vg9", "created_utc": 1672427878.0, "score": 91, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Good critical analysis, thank you for sharing.

Don't forget that Shanghai was also guided at 250k capacity. This is because ramping takes infinite time and effort+includes risk, so best to say a low number.

An area that I think is often overlooked is the addition of the Semi-truck. This opens a lot of new doors for Tesla and breaks what is possibly the biggest Market - commercial transport. \n\nIt is still early days and they only have Pepsi signed up as a sort of test case - a pretty good one all things considered.  If they can prove the Semi to be the best ROI versus traditional it’s game over for legacy who pretty much said this was impossible and do not have anything like this ready. \n\nI’m not sure what this means margins wise but this will eat into legacies share in this market, which up until now was not considered in any analysis!\n\nI am also pretty gobsmacked at the reception to FSD, I was watching the latest update 10.69 (probably) and it’s incredible. I think we are all seriously overlooking the fact that cars are now driving themselves and this is in BETA mode!  \n\nRegardless of the accidents and other issues which of course need to be investigated - did anyone actually think there wouldn’t be accidents using tech like this ‘come on man?’  \n\nThis aside, for the most part they have a product that not only works but is a subscription model and is the first to market adding new streams of income. \n\nLastly remember that all this ramping up in both scale and deliveries was during COVID where supply chains were strained and everything was considered ‘doomsday’.  Yet they still outperformed every other car maker and market expectations. In addition to this they built Giga factories, secured leasing deals with lithium mines and chip makers before interest rates went up.  So they borrowed in a low interest environment - I think this to be key in its future success. \n\nThis means that OEM’s and EV startups (all but Tesla) will need to ramp up and scale during a harder time to borrow money and a harder time to sell ‘luxury goods’ potentially let alone have comparable products. This is when Tesla will dramatically lower its prices, we are seeing this already with $7500 off before next years incentive. \n\nA side note that I think quite funny about Tesla and advertising and a negative for now. \n\nUp until now Tesla hasn’t paid for any advertising, but now musk has bought Twitter for 54 billion lol. That’s probably more than all of the legacies ad spend combined and Tesla paid for that :(.  \n\nHere’s hoping that it will have been worth it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yep, this was kind of the consensus for a long time.  Elon had some wild ideas of growth and capability that never really fit reality, and the massive growth required was a bullet point against that fantasy.\n\nAnd also yep, Tesla isn't a bad stock to get back into.  It's just that the market won't be kind to it for a little while with Elon behaving the way he has.  His name is tied to tightly with the brand for him not to cause issues.  The company as a whole though is and has been doing solid.  It's now just a question of how low will it go and when to step back in.\n\nHowever, there is a bigger challenge Tesla faces.  Many other automakers are stepping HARD into the EV market space, and Tesla no longer has the luxury of being pretty much the only EV maker capable of high volume production an non boring cars or no astronomically priced cars.  This luxury of theirs is fleeting, and they will have to transition into a real grind to fight for market share.  There's really no sugar coating this.  Telsa is effectively being forced into mainstream and now has a sea of competition.  They have to get VERY good with their design, manufacturing, marketing, everything to stay not only a leader but also to stay relevant.  If they are lazy or misunderstand what's critically important (for example, key talent) they could lose a huge portion of their market.  I bring up the example because Musk has notoriously inhumanized humans and doesn't exactly value the talent he has.  He doesn't really understand it, and he may lose everything for it.\n\nI like EV stuff, but interestingly I've never really cared much about Tesla products.  I think other brands are doing more interesting stuff, making better products.  There are some really nice bits that Telsa is doing, like making these really big chassis castings which helps a ton with manufacturing, but once the big players are in the game, they have all the resources in the world to do the same or better.  Tesla worked up to this stuff over years.  Companies like Ford can do this with a 1 second choice, and all the infrastructure and manpower is already there.  This is the same problem with other EV startups.  Companies like Rivian and Lucid have massive uphill climbs into real relevancy and retention.  All they have is uniqueness and labor talent.  This is where companies like Canoo are interesting in that they are thinking very different about vehicles, and it's in these deviations that you really separate yourself from the big powerhouses in the industry.  Seriously, Canoo might be the first EV I might actually buy specifically because they fundamentally are so different.  But even they are quite a ways off from relevance.\n\nBut all of this is getting a bit off topic.  The point is Tesla is in a tough spot.  They have a guy that's the face of the brand that's going nuts.  They have car designs that might not survive real competition from major automakers.  And they don't seem to value employees well enough to retain good talent.  They're losing the single advantage they've had for a decade.  The only saving grace is Telsa, the company, is run pretty well, and they've made excellent effort to develop the underlying infrastructure to actually make a million EV cars.  When you're competing against companies with production targets of 15,000, it's no contest.\n\nI am curious where the stock will settle to.  I am also curious what the next 5 years will be like for the brand as people and product compete against the big boys.  We'll never again see the massive growth Tesla's stock showed, but I'm curious how it will progress over 5 to 10 years.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for sharing your view :)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">  how the hell is Tesla worth so much more than Toyota when Toyota sells 10m cars a year (with Tesla 1.4m for the full 2022)? \n\nEasy - Toyota does not sell 10m EVs.  \n\nThey can't, but if they did, they'd go out of business.\n\nBYD is the real competition.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh yes another Tesla analysis!
