I would ride it a lot more if it had the boring company's average of 15 **second** wait time. I would ride my local light rail a lot more if it went to more places. I would take my local light rail more if it had longer hours of operation. I would ride it more if the average speed was higher. however, even if they improved those things, it's not going to increase ridership enough to make the construction or operating cost per passenger low enough to justify the cost to taxpayers. \n\nthe US isn't \"behind the EU\", they are different places so what works in what will not necessarily work in the other. US cities have less density, petrol prices are lower, motorway infrastructure is better, class stratification is different, etc. etc.. all of those things have an impact on the viability of different modes of transportation. one should not ignore the differences and assume that what works in Europe also must work in the US. ignoring differences is why the US has built so many poorly performing transit lines and has ended up without much support from the general public. the US's biggest failing with regard to transit is trying to too closely copy Europe. that's the whole point of the boring company's Loop system; to make transportation that is fit to it's purpose rather than trying to copy-paste a design that was successful in a dramatically different environment. \n\nplaces with ridership above what the boring company can already handle would be well served to build a subway line and use Loop to feed passengers into the line. that way, the lower ridership corridors can be handled by the lower capacity system, and all of the riders can converge into a system that can support the higher ridership. that is the most cost-effective way to get the most coverage. places with lower ridership, like the corridor in which Phoenix wants to build their light rail extension, can directly use Loop into the city center and not as a feeder line.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not qualified enough to argue, especially about country where I never have been before.

There is a learning curve, so it's only natural for first attempts to not deliver as much as you would expect.

I totally see why in EU public transport could've been failed, because look, their streets are so narrow, there is no place for busses and light rail! Yet it actually solves problem.

I remember he said something about it in some interview and quickly went to boring tunnels. Maybe he just don't want to dive into something what he can't control, and instead proposed at least some solution which can work in some situations. Tunnels won't solve most of traffic problems, but can tackle at least some subset of them. Also, I still hope and believe they don't abandon the idea of a specialized autonomous vehicles for 6(?) people to run through tunnels (like in Boring company's old CG promo video), and somewhere in the future, when there is no supply and battery constraints, they will (or outsource it) make such a vehicle to make tunnels more like mass transit system, than they are now.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think we are understanding each other better now.\n\nI think Elon is correctly identifying the problems with transit in the US. talking about the problems makes people uncomfortable. our reality is that due to social strife between classes and races, wealthier folks moved out of cities AND we have had relatively cheap cars and cheap petrol. that means\n\n1. lower density cities\n2. cities don't have as much tax revenue to build transit\n3. when transit is built, it does not outperform driving in comfort or speed\n4. since most folks who can afford a car just drive instead (because it's faster and more comfortable), then a greater concentration of poor folks ride transit, which makes people feel less safe and less comfortable, which drives away even more riders who can afford a car\n\nand so on. \n\nif we want to make a system that can get people to give up cars, it must have the following properties:\n\n1. grade separated. it will never be fast enough to pull significant portions of people out of cars unless it can bypass traffic/intersections/obstacles\n2. it must be capable of high average speeds though some combination of low wait time, high top speed, and high spacing between stops\n3. it must make people feel safe and comfortable \n4. it must be cheap enough to build a well-connected network so that people can get to/from more destinations\n\nthat's basically everything the boring company is doing. they are:\n\n1.  grade separated \n2. their wait time is 15s, they plan for high top speed (though they are just ok right now), and they plan to bypass all unnecessary stops.\n3. they are doing 2 rows of seats so that nobody has to sit next to a stranger. though, there may need to be some larger vehicle if they want to expand.\n4. they are a fraction of the cost of surface rail and they are around 10x cheaper than a subway, so they can build huge networks for the price of a single line of traditional rail. even as a supplement/feeder to a subway, their system should be great at increase the number of possible destinations", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty comprehensive and well-rounded comment :)\n\nAfaik US was built around personal transport, so it's hard to make public transport suitable in general.

I plan to keep an eye on the situation and re-enter if it corrects back down once things settle down.\n\n \n\nIn the other half of my options portfolio I have been playing $SPY put options to capitalize on the current downtrend, however last week when Canada upped their rates the Toronto Stock Exchange has seen some gains even as SPY has been falling. I exited my SPY position because I realized it could easily reverse rather than crash with the increased expectation of currency stability with FED action. Obviously though I am torn and still want to play the decline, I’m just not sure that the SPY will cooperate. Ultimately leaving my investment success in the hands of the FED is frustrating.\n\n \n\nSo here I am with a handful of cash from the supply chain issues stemming this time from global conflict instead of quarantine and another handful from the decline in value of equities in the S&P500, and it is obvious what the play is to capitalize on both ongoing situations.\n\n \n\nBlackRock makes the vast majority of its revenue from fees it charges based on the value of its assets under management. As their AUM shrinks, so does its revenue. BlackRock has also earned itself a reputation with investing in companies the US does not approve of abroad as they have poured money into China especially in the last few years as they have bought up cheap assets effected by the Evergrande crisis in China. With a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, or financial alliance with Russia or any other threat even perceived that the Chinese economy might be effected similarly to Russia’s since the invasion of Ukraine, BlackRocks assets could take an additional massive hit. Also BlackRock will have no choice but to watch these assets disappear because no one is going to buy them if they even are allowed by their governments to.\n\n \n\nAll this to say I have and am still purchasing put options on BlackRock for when these next wave of supply issues are really being felt and BlackRock suffering hard as their domestic and foreign assets shrink substantially in value.
