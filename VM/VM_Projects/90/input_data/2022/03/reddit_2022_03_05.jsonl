I was a big believer in doing more business with Russia. RSX was one of my largest positions because I really believed in your country. I wasn’t surprised that Putin would invade Ukraine, but as was convinced it would be a small quick Crimea-style annexation to get them at the negotiating table. \nWe then saw the west taking some silly measures and the market was super green after Biden his speech, because we all understood our leaders needed to show teeth, but we’re not going to bite. Then Russia starts threatening Europe with nuclear war. Seriously? After our leaders did everything to do as little as possible they are getting threatened with nukes? This where everyone understood that:ruin has lost his mind and he needs to go, because he has already decided to use them.
