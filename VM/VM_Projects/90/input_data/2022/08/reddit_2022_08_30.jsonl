Being generous, assume you got $300/call \n\nNow you have $600 in premium collected and you are down $1,800 on your position. \n\nAt this point you two options: sell more calls or hold till price recovers to your cost basis. \n\nIf you choose the second, it could take weeks or months to recover. If this happens multiple times, you make significantly less than your projection. But you will make money overall if the stock eventually recovers. \n\nIf you choose not to wait, you can either sell at a strike that is above your cost basis, but is so far OTM that the premium isn’t worth it, or you can sell $2-3 OTM as originally planned. \n\nLet’s say you do sell just $3 OTM. Now you have sold a C83 for another $300 premium per contract. If it expires worthless congratulations. But if you get exercised because AMD rips up to $95/share, you are now forced to sell at $83/share. \n\nOverall you have made $1200 in premium ($300/contract, having sold 2 CC twice) BUT you bought in at $89 and sold at $83, meaning you lost $1200 on your initial position, and now you end up breaking even. \n\nCovered calls can generate excellent cash flow if you do it right; just don’t go into it expecting to sell CC every month and make a perfect premium. I sell covered calls in my portfolio occasionally when I think a stock has ripped way too far to the upside and want to realize some gains via the call premium instead of selling the stock.

You are now looking at losses. Any injection of new funds (like 100 shares), is going to make a tiny dent on the existing position. Which means if you're sitting on losses, the new money is not going to help you average down; you're going to be sitting on losses. Which then creates the risky situation of sell CC at below your cost basis.\n\n(2) Could just be a loser CC situation\n\n\nTo illustrate:\n- you buy AMD at $150 and sell 1 CC for $1 at $152\n- AMD goes to $140 and your CC expires. \n- You sell a new CC for $1 at $142\n- AMD price does not change, and CC expires\n- You buy more AMD at $140 again and you now sell 2 CC for $2 at $142\n- Now AMD goes up to $183, you are assigned on both contracts.\n\nProfits in this scenario:\n- 100 shares @ 150 -> 142 => -$800\n- 100 shares @ 140 -> 142 => +$200\n- Sold 4 contracts -> +$400\n\nNet profit, -$200\n\nYou can also run the above scenario with a 10x larger initial position and notice that it has critical mass for the investment and is not really impacted by new money coming in.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Problem 1) what??! Dude you’re trying too hard. Soooo let’s say I believe AMD will be 200$ a share in three years. Let’s say from now until then I continuously add my premium to my share count effectively Solar cost averaging. Once I have 1000 shares I am selling 10 cc’s. If at that point AMD is 120$ and my average is Day 100$ after one year, I sell 10ccs a week. 1-2k weekly. As long as I sell CCs above my average, I never lose money. I just miss out on gains of it Day goes up 10$ in a day\n\nProblem 2) again have you done any research on AMD? Or are you throwing out speculation like I am.

It's not obvious when an account is smaller, but eventually you'll accumulate enough that averaging has little impact. If you sustain losses at that point, you won't really be able to average them away. This puts you in the position of possibly selling CCs below your cost basis. It's not trying too hard at all, it is a scenario.\n\nYou do seem to be assuming that there will be a continued bullish trend and that you'll gradually be averaging up and maintain a lower cost basis. If that happens, it'll be good for you. There is an \\*if\\* there though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRe: problem 2, I own some AMD, not as much as I'd like. I first bought AMD way back when it was $3, been following it for a long time. It's a very solid stock IMO. I recently was able to buy a lot of it around (IIRC) $180 and then had to sell a bunch when everything went down 30%. That was an example where I ran into problem #1, I found out the hard way when you have $100k invested total, averaging down can no longer be a thing.\n\nAMD has had a few relatively strong changes, IIRC there have been some $5 and $8 drops. I think your timing right now is perhaps not bad, it does seem to be at a low. Averaging into a position from here, seems okay. Though, if we don't stay at the current price for too long, and you wind up spending most of your time buying in at a higher price, and we see a fall back of 30% again, then again (problem 1)\n\n\"\\*edit\\*\"  wrong is not quite the right word. Just more, these are the negative scenarios that represent your risk. For a good stock like AMD, I personally don't think it's a bad risk. Diversifying is often a good move to reduce risk, but you will only get that by buying SPY (adding a couple more stocks tickers is not really diversifying). So again, not necessarily a bad plan all in all (just the expectations that you'll be able to successfully sell below cost basis, and/or repeatedly sell CCs without losing upside is perhaps where there is some issues).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "These make sense. I guess I should have added my rules that I’m setting for myself. (1) do not sell a call for under my cost average. This way I may lose out on gain but not on loss. (2) if I see a reason for the stock to go up, sell higher calls (3) sell my calls if they provide 80% of the premium by Wednesday. Also I am slowly averaging in my 20kish. Right now I have 25 shares at 86$ average and am hoping to see 70s soon. With this strategy of starting at what I think (may not be the case) is the bottom or close to it, I should be able to do decently at this. We will see. There’s definitely going to be a learning curve and I doubt after a lot of reading that I’ll make 300-600 a week but maybe 100-300 a week\n\nAlso I know I’ll lose potential profit at some point in this and will be buying shares back higher. I can try to mitigate that by watching the flow of the stock and hopefully selling weekly’s gives me more control. Best case, I miss time it and I lose a lot of potential gain, best case my calls are exercised at the strike and I make premium plus whatever I sell those shares ats profit.\n\nPs: if you feel bad about selling for a 30% loss try living with selling 1000 shares in 2017 for a 5k loss when you “knew” AMD would be big one day but we’re a new trader and thought you could just say trade lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "why not soxl or qqq?  wouldn’t it safer?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Cc to sell.
