If you say growth goes to 0%, you're essentially saying the company will never grow again, as if you'd be investing with an unlimited time horizon.

What matters most for valuations is earnings.\n\nEither way, even if you'd look at revenues first for some strange reason, you can get to an outcome that shows 10 years of growth priced in is nonsense:\n\nTesla's targets are 50% annual revenue growth throughout the decade with more than that in the next few years and less towards the end of the decade. Tesla's 2021 revenue was ~$54B. Add to that the 65% annual growth in 2022 and 2023 and you're at ~$150B in revenue. At their Q1 margins, that's $28.5B in net income for 2023. At their current valuation that'd be a PE 33. With an earnings growth rate of 200% annually from 2021 to 2023, that's a PEG ratio of 0.165 compared to the norm of 1 and average for large caps of 2-3.
