{"title": "What happened with GME after added onto Reg SHO list", "selftext": "Since BBBY got added to the Reg SHO a few days ago on the [NASDAQ Reg SHO list](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=regshothreshold), I've decided to take a look at what exactly happened with GME since the day it got on NYSE Reg SHO list.\n\nHere is what I found from our good old GME days: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kipthz/gme\\_regulation\\_sho\\_threshold\\_list\\_shorts\\_fked/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kipthz/gme_regulation_sho_threshold_list_shorts_fked/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The first day GME added onto Reg SHO](https://preview.redd.it/2fpvh3rhcii91.png?width=3286&format=png&auto=webp&s=a767b5d33587b865097a86054c13f7d0086dc530)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's take a look GME stock prices for a month after it is added onto Reg SHO, we a lot of small ups and downs through the month as you can see, but mostly we stay at a good range. **FYI, this is post split prices if you are wondering why it is so low. So the original stock price would be 4x.**\n\n[GME stock prices from 12\\/08\\/2020 to 01\\/08\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/xux8e6rudii91.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=13436d9ee8dbff698549a673beb5d168acaf6500)\n\n Ok, now let's look at more data: \n\n[GME stock prices from 01\\/08\\/2021 to 02\\/04\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/m98w7ce4fii91.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=5261f8bf57671f4cf7cb252559bb5914b7d88a8f)\n\nAs you can see, the stock price finally started having some upward momentum after a month. We went from around $5 to $10, up 100% in 2 weeks. Then after that, the big run has happened ($420.69 is not a meme). The reason why I picked this date range is because GME is finally off the Reg SHO list on 02/04/2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwaiv8r1hii91.png?width=3260&format=png&auto=webp&s=75887a97f9ffb801d6a38652335a80d0b083c2b5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g70j27m2hii91.png?width=3260&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8a1188668a7e435c06dd5eafa6c4f8ef23d1918\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: after seeing all the data, we now know that even after adding onto Reg SHO list. GME didn't moon right away, it still took two months for the big run to happen. **The key take away here is that GME stayed on the Reg SHO list EVERY SINGLE DAY for two months** until it mooned then it is finally off the list. With that being said, it is very crucial that we all HODL and keep BBBY on the Reg SHO list for as long as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: BUY HODL 💎 💎 🙌 🙌 , WAIT MOON 🚀🚀\n\nEDIT: *Not financial advice*.
