There's only inflation and that's not necessarily bad.", "score": -16, "replies": [{"body": "Well, that’s an interesting view.  I’ve not heard that one recently.  Thx for sharing!\n\nRe: Econ data, I submit that it’s often beneficial to not take what they feed you at face value.  Rather, keep in mind that EVERY administration will, absolutely, do it’s best to present the data in the most positive light possible.  \n\nFor example, we hear Peppermint Psaki claim that they “have created more jobs than anyone in history”, and the UEC numbers are gaining traction, so we think that’s great.  However, “all things in life are relative” and that is rarely more true than when assessing economic data.  ZOOM OUT!  Consider the data within the context of what’s going on in the world.  When we consider that we are just coming out of a nearly complete shut down of our economy, we appear to be moving in the right direction.  BUT it’s not organic.  We threw gas on the fire and we got heat.  So the numbers look good enough, for the time being, but “the market is forward-looking”.  What does it see?  It sees a tough business environment with unreliable political leadership and low consumer confidence (CCI is in a nose dive and nearly back to lockdown era levels).  If people aren’t confident, they aren’t spending.  \n\nBut if we’re all getting new jobs and wage data is “up, up, UP”, why are people not confident?  Let’s look at jobs…. Are we REALLY creating new jobs?  I submit that lockdown sent payrolls to historic lows, and people going back to work will make payroll numbers go up.  But those are NOT new jobs.  That’s not new companies starting up or even companies creating new positions.  I’ve not heard of any company whose employee count is higher than pre-pandemic levels.  That’s what’s left of our economy trying to get their feet under them again.  So the obvious argument is “Well jobless claims are going down”, and that is true.  And when we drill down into that we see that jobless numbers were at historic levels and some of those people are returning to work, but a large percentage of the change we see is people who are no longer participating in the workforce and no longer qualify for unemployment.  That’s a misleading statistic that every administration spins to lift the the confidence of the people.  It’s very definitely NOT good for the economy!\n\n“What about housing?  It’s in a bubble!”  True enough…. And “what goes up must come down”.  If we have rising rates and a challenging business environment, consumer debt rising and inflation rising faster than wages, how on earth can demand continue to outpace supply?  Answer:  It won’t.  The bubble started during “the pandemic” with people who had plenty of money looking for a safe place for it and also looking for an escape from their city apartments, so they bought 2nd homes in the mountains or at the beach.  Really, “anywhere but here!”  And there is a group of buyers who continued inflating the bubble when lockdowns were lifted.  Their pockets were full of stimulus cash, some working 2 jobs at home, and rates at historic lows.  That’s good math!  But the stimulus money is gone and rates are going up and as mentioned, wages aren’t increasing faster than inflation, and they didn’t increase faster than the price of homes, so people’s money doesn’t buy as much as it did 2 years ago.  Are you seeing the trend?  It will continue, and buyers will begin dropping off at a horrifying rate in the months ahead of us.\n\nSo economic data is what it is, and “what it is” is marginally acceptable when it’s compared to effectively ZERO economy a year ago.  But the fact is that it’s painting an illusion.  Business doesn’t expand when energy prices rise for more than a short-term spike.  Historically, recession follows periods when oil goes over $110/bbl.  Adjusted for inflation we can call that $125/bbl for 21C.  It was over that level and then came down a bit.  So there is a glimmer of hope, but it’s trying like hell to get back up there and the high demand summer season is right around the corner.  Demand UP = Price UP.\n\nThe prices of cars and trucks are through the roof!  …supply and demand.  OK, but when the cost of homes AND the cost of automobiles and other durable goods is increasing faster than wages AND consumer credit is lacking in ability to expand w/o defaults, something has to give.  People MAY continue buying for a short time and push beyond their means to repay.  But that will come to a screeching halt when defaults start going up.\n\nAnd THAT is the story of “positive economic data” that really isn’t.  It’s an illusion that probabilistically will not continue too much into Q3.\n\nUPDATE:  re: creating “new jobs” and companies expanding, a notification just crossed my screen that Robinhood is whacking 9% of employees.
