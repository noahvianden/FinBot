A common one is one where you have a cap of 12% (made up number since I don't know the current cap offhand) and downside protection of 10%.  You pick the index.  If it rises, you have a maximum profit of 10% and no loss for the first 10% of share price loss.  Every year, the SIO resets to the new EOY value of the index.  Contracts are generally 5-6 years.\n\nA SIO is constructed with options.  There are no direct fees but the insurance company keeps the dividends and pays out less than the option position brings in.  That's their profit.  If you do it yourself, for the same cap, you might get 20-25% of downside protection, depending on current implied volatility.\n\nIf you shorten the expiration, it bumps up the potential annual yield.  The higher the implied volatility, the higher the cap and the downside protection are.  I use this for large cap stocks that I'm willing to own but don't want to own them unless they're 20-25% lower. Generally 3-5 months out.  Add a little market hedging and it greatly diminishes the risk.\n\nBetween the two, I was down maybe 7% when the market dropped 35% when Covid hit in March 2020.  Easy to recover from. And that was despite owning several 1,000+ share positions in large caps that lost 1/3 to 1/2 of their value during the drop.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I lack the brain needed to understand your comments here.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for the thorough explanation!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "what about post covid? you miss out on that rally? can't you just own spy?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You can own anything that amuses you.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I read it as an annuity = a pension.
