{"title": "On $FB and the Metaverse", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I have FB as part of my portfolio (I own a ton of SP500 and QQQ)\n\nThis isn't a recommendation or a warning post. Just a collection of some observations that I've had over the past few months.\n\n1. The Metaverse already exists\n\n Everytime you login to FB/Insta/Twitter/Tiktok/Reddit/multiplayer game - you're logging into the metaverse. That's it, that's the metaverse - a virtual world where humans connect with each other and interact with each other in various ways, play games etc\n\n2. Reddit/Twitter hates FB/Meta\n\n Everytime someone even attempts to talk about Meta on Reddit/Twitter, there will be a huge list of comments that say how much they hate FB/Zuck, how it's a huge privacy risk etc. Yes, all of that might be true, but ~3B daily active/monthly active users don't seem to care. For 3B people around the world, the value that FB/Meta provides is more than any potential privacy issue. That's more than half of human population(ie excl China) and >70% population with internet access.\n\n3. Oculus Quest 2 is a sneak peek into the future\n\n You will be surprised to see how positive the reception for OQ2 is even on Reddit and Twitter. OQ2 is currently a near monopoly in the VR market. Just google/search Reddit for OQ2 reviews you will come to the same conclusion.\n\n4. Main issues with OQ2 seem temporary\n\n The two main issues with OQ2 are the lack of good content and the usability issues like disorientation etc. Both are solvable with tech and time. The tech will improve to make such headsets comfortable for majority of the users. The content library is bad right now mainly because there aren't enough devs and it hasn't been around for long. These problems will be solved.\n\n5. Project Cambria leaks look insanely good\n\n Project Cambria aka Quest Pro is supposed to release later this year. Just look at the leaks and a picture of Boz(head of Reality Labs at Meta) wearing it. It's got a thin form factor and looks cool and slick exactly like an AAPL product. I can totally see this device becoming the replacement for personal computers and the main way games are played in the future.\n\n6. Meta/FB is the only company with an iterative product in VR space\n\n Yes AAPL, MSFT, GOOG are all trying but Meta is really the only company with a successful product already out and an app store and an ecosystem in this VR space. I fully expect AAPL to give tough competition to them with a successful device but with the first mover advantage, Meta can easily become the Android of this space.\n\n7. VR is a very very important step towards AR, you cannot skip it\n\n AR is the ultimate goal. Having an AR glass that's fully integrated with the real world is the ultimate metaverse product. But to get there, you need a lot of tech experimented in the VR and iterate on how to make it work as an overlay on the real world in AR. For example, handling virtual objects, depth perception etc.\n\n8. The metaverse will definitely get more immersive\n\n Humans love interacting with each other, we love connecting with each other. That's why social media is such a huge thing in our lives, we simply cannot opt out. The natural next step will be a more immersive AR/VR experience to our current metaverse of social media apps. People love to claim that they like the real world but the huge success of FB/Insta/Youtube/Tiktok suggest otherwise. (Imagine watching a live basketball game courtside seats with a friend who lives 1000 miles away)\n\n9. Dismissing the potential of the metaverse is akin to dismissing the potential of the internet/personal computers in the 90s\n\n Every single time there was a new piece of technology that was introduced, there have been naysayers. People really thought bicycles were a bad thing once (check Pessimists archive on Twitter). Given the above observations, a more immersive metaverse is inevitable, it's just a matter of time.\n\n10. FB/Meta is probably the best company positioned for the metaverse right now\n\n Meta is really again the only company with a VR product out and the amount of learning they can do with this data will be very valuable for their AR venture. It might take more than 10 years to get to a fully functioning metaverse but their hardware division will not be at a loss for long, just because of the prospects in gaming alone. VR gaming will be the only way to game in the near future and Meta will be the biggest ecosystem there. They will take the profits from this ecosystem and improve their metaverse offerings.\n\nAbove all this, they are already a very profitable growing company with a huge cash flow from their Family of Apps, valued very very cheaply at the moment. \n\nI will setup 5 and 10-year reminders in the comments, I will either look like a genius or a fool.

The community effect lives strong in each of these 3. I do forsee this happening with quest and VR / AR. I am worried about Cambria and how It will stack up to other high end devices, and whether or not Meta will maintain it's hold on top of VR. If AAPL releases an even slimmer form factor with their logo on it, all bets are off. Is Meta the TSLA of VR? Lots of other companies do VR, but is Meta that far advanced that their Quest line will continue to dominate? I am interested and own FB only through indices, although sub 200 feels like an OK price and the bump from ER seems promising given that none of this stuff is really taking off yet. \n\n2 things Zuck said \n\n\"We plan to launch a web version of Horizon later this year that will make it easy for people to step into the Metaverse experiences from a lot more platforms, even without needing a headset.\" \n\n\"Our other focus for Horizon is building out the Metaverse economy and helping creators make a living, working in the Metaverse. We expect to be meaningfully better at monetization than others in the space and we think that that should become a sustainable advantage for our platforms as they develop\"\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts on these 2 statements. I am bullish if they really can monetize and monopolize VR/AR outside of the headset game.

{"title": "Why I'm bearish on the market right now", "selftext": "Stocks have fallen but they have a lot to fall more unless serious measures will be taken by US and EU Governments and I'm not seeing them doing that. Here is my opinion.\n\nThis is mostly a supply led inflation, it's very different than other inflation cycles we witnessed in the past because those were demand based and could be addressed by raising interest rates to curb pressure on demand. Stocks would still go up with interest rates rising because the economy was booming.\n\nThis inflation cycle is different and only have a precedent during the early '70 oil supply crisis that caused stagflation and a massive stock market crash. How bad was that crash? Well, in the US the market lost 50% of its value, in the UK the stock market lost well over 70% of its value. As can you imagine, we are just at the beginning of the crash and in my opinion the situation today is worse than in the '70 so the stock market crash can be worse.\n\nThe point is, we are seeing inflation because commodities prices are rising and those higher prices of production are then transferred to the consumers. How do you fix it? Well, you can only fix it by increasing supply of those commodities. What are we doing instead? We are boycotting all supplies from one of the biggest producer in the world: Russia. And ESG policies are also targeting local companies  so their CAPEX is very low. And you can't just increase CAPEX overnight, it takes years. Add to that that the current US Administration has very bad relations (the worst since many decades) with Saudi Arabia and UAE, two of the biggest oil producers in the world. They already said they won't increase oil production.\n\nWhat the FED can do? Well, not much in reality because the FED is very useful to fix demand led inflation cycles but they can't do much to fix supply led inflation because they don't set commodity prices. It's all about demand and supply and since the supply is low the only thing the FED can do is destroy demand to match the low supply and reach a new equilibrium. But you see where we are going? To lower inflation to 2% the FED will have to destroy demand so much to cause a big recession. Any soft landing talk is bullshit. There can't be any soft landing given the circumstances. The FED will have to raise rates so much because the sensitivity of inflation to interest rates rising (in a supply led crisis) is much lower than in a demand-led crisis. And by raising that much a recession will follow and the demand destruction will match the supply, finally lowering inflation. The stock market will crash massively with a big recession.\n\nThis is already very bad, but things get even worse when we consider Europe. They are very dependent on Russian commodities and if they ban russian oil and gas, the price of these commodities will skyrocket to over 150$/barrel. Now, Europe already is experiencing a massive inflationary cycle (same as the US, supply led) but contrary to the US they can't raise interest rates much because the very existence of the euro currency is at stake. Why? Well, because Southern European countries already have such a massive debt (and zero growth) that they wouldn't be able to finance themselves in an open market at rates low enough to keep their economies afloat and not default on their debt. Indeed after the Sovereign debt cycle the ECB one way or another bought massive amount of their debt to keep them from defaulting but that was a band-aid that only postponed their demise.\n\nNow, there is a Covid-related vast debt buying program that the ECB is doing but it's gonna end soon. Keep in mind the ECB, by charter, can't buy debt of Sovereign countries because it's totally independent and this is why a massive crisis will happen in Europe. I try to explain. Until now the ECB kept these countries from failing with different emergency buying programs and there were never inflationary pressures so interest rates were held below zero. Now inflation is above 8%, the ECB (contrary to the FED) has only one goal: to keep the inflation around 2%. So they have to raise interest rates and can't keep find excuses to buy Sovereign debt and expand their massive balance sheet because otherwise inflation will keep go higher and they would not respect their charter (by law they can't do it).\n\nAs soon as the ECB stop this debt buying program (they say it's gonna end soon) and raise rates, Southern European countries will experience big problems in financing their debt in the open market. Debt spreads between EU countries will rise and a new big Sovereign debt crisis (much bigger than the one in 2011/2012) will emerge threatening the survivability of the euro itself because Europe would need two different monetary policies (a lax one in the South, and a hawkish one in the North) but they only have one central bank.\n\nImagine a scenario with stagflation (high inflation+recession) and Sovereign debt crisis at the same time. This duo will create probably the biggest crisis in European stock market in history. Once they crash, the repercussions will be felt in the US as well because the economy is interconnected....imagine all US companies (already with the US crash I explained above) having to deal with demand destruction from a massive crisis in Europe...the recession in the US would get so much worse.\n\nSo, how do we get out of this crisis? I don't think there is a way unless the commodity inflation is taken care of and looking at the comments from various US and European politicians I don't see this scenario to happen...actually it's the opposite since they want to ban ever more russian commodities creating the condition for the scenario I explained above. The thing is, in the current interconnected world, already experiencing commodities price pressure, you can't ban the commodities from Russia (after you already did it with Iran and Venezuela) without ruining our economies too. By trying to ruin Russian economy, we'll ruin our economy and crash the stock market. Unfortunately, not many people have understood it and there is so much ignorance in this regard...so many people think they can ban those commodities and feel no effect in their countries. Economic ignorance and emotional based decisions are the biggest threat to our economies.\n\nWhy I'm extremely bearish on the stock market? Because the politicians went so far with their words that now can't walk their comments and decisions back. Every person that try to explain that boycotting russian commodities will cause a massive recession and stagflation in Europe and US is thought of as a Putin friend. The average person is just as dumb as a rock and no matter how you try to explain it, they don't get it.\n\nHow to position in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment? Well, I think going long commodities stocks, shorting the Nasdaq (with many stocks that reached very high valuations after the Covid crisis) and shorting Europeans stock indexes would provide decent results in the next year. As I said I really believe the stock market will crash more than during the '70 and back then it crashed over 50% in the US and over 70% in Europe.", "id": "ufb746", "created_utc": 1651325664.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Im permanently biased bearish and just went long.

Western Government just want to punish everybody that don't play by their rules even at the cost of ruining their own economy.\n\n2) Keep the sanctions but stop following the green agenda taking advice from a Swedish teenager and give incentives to energy and commodities companies to increase production and investments, basically doing the opposite of what Governments are doing right now trying to punish energy companies for every little thing.

You can already see the strength in the dollar.  This helps US based inflation significantly if there is a strong demand for dollars worldwide.  \n\nThe other troubling trend is that we haven't had any prolonged downturns for quite some time.  Even the 2008 crisis, equites/RE shot back up quite quickly once the government stepped in.  Since equities are falling now due to being massively overvalued during the covid pump, it's conceivable that equities/RE will stay lower for a very long time, and not just bounce right back up like they did before.

These types of things where everyone is on the same side of the boat, so to speak can be quite dangerous from a market perspective when things change.\n\nRight now energy is helping the S&P as oil prices are high due to the Russia situation, but medium term energy is going to be hit extremely hard as the world transitions to EV's.
