The IP rights to so many popular media universes; the next phases of Marvel, an onslaught of Star Wars, and rebooting of X-Men.

[P/E ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DIS/disney/pe-ratio) is still high vs what it was for many years. Streaming is expensive to produce for as evident by Netflix plunge and competition is fierce. Operating costs are high for parks and the renewed pro labor movement may result in demands for higher pay, more benefits, etc - $$$$ out of Disney corporate pockets. Management has attracted the unwanted attention of the go woke go broke moment, and Disney sentiments online seem to be shifting to badly managed and too high prices. If we soon enter a recession how many will continue paying top dollar to flock to Disney parks. \n\nSay a bear is planning to add some DIS the mix what is your ideal price target?", "id": "uerugb", "created_utc": 1651255646.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "I never used to understand the allure of Disney until I had kids and now I see their reaction to Disney content, their friend's reaction, the reverence with which Disneyland is discussed amongst the moms, and the omnichannel delivery of their content and I am a believer.

The difference is, Disney had parks closed and then limited attendance, hotels half empty, cruises sitting empty, etc. A lot of assets that require maintenance and upkeep, just not making money. They’re lower margin businesses to begin with(though Disney does a good job raising margins by being ruthless with pricing). \n\nAlso, now they’re facing additional pressures caused by being shoved unwillingly in to politics and kind of pissing off both sides. The right are boycotting Disney, to the point that Florida is about to take away many of their tax advantages.
