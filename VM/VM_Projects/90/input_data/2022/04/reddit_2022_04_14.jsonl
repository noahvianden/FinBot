While it generally never made aggressively unsafe maneuvers, its hesitation and obvious uncertainty in numerous everyday situations indicate to me that the FSD computer has a very limited degree of situational awareness, and its contingency planning is purely reactionary in nature.  \n\nThese behaviors do not demonstrate to me a firm foundation with which Tesla can build to a near-term FSD solution that includes liability in any at-fault accidents. The FSD beta software is always running on both GPU nodes as I understand it, removing the ability to have parallel processing redundancy for FSD, meaning any AP computer failure at highway speed is likely catastrophic in consequence (without an attentive driver at the ready). For this reason I don’t think any FSD vehicles delivered today will ever feature a true level 4 system. \n\nWhile they may ultimately try to push a level 2 “FSD” solution to the public eventually, the fact you will have to continually babysit the steering wheel removes the value from the feature, and means these vehicles won’t ever become robo-taxis with the current hardware suite. \n\nI could be wrong, but Elon has been wrong now for several years underestimating and over-hyping the progress of FSD.

After six months of baby sitting FSD I grew tired of the same errors, and was done paying for the monthly subscription. \n\nNote: My experiences with FSD beta are largely from my daily commute in Kansas. While our roads are generally well maintained, the vehicle constantly made errors related to outdated maps as evidenced by incorrect speed limits and old geo-data (despite having the latest updated maps data) following a road construction which completed in summer 2021. \n\nAs an example, the car would attempt to drive on this recently constructed road based on the old road data, not using exclusively vision to assess the lanes and intersections. It would shift into and out of lanes as if it were the old lane geometry. These errors were 100% repeatable and inadequate for safe operation unsupervised.  The fact this was not addressed in six months despite repeated feedback submitted shows they are not accounting for all variables equally in FSD training. \n\nWhile my use case is only one of many, it is a valid and common scenario in Midwestern USA and must be addressed and improved for any widespread rollout to the public.
