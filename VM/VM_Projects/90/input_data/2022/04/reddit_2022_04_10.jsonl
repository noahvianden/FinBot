{"title": "Physical Uranium, the ultimate hedge", "selftext": "1. SHORTage right now \n\nEvery year, reactors use 200M pounds of uranium. \n\nEvery year, miners produce 135M pounds of uranium. \n\nThat's an existing 65M pounds annual deficit. \n\nSPROTT PHYSICAL URANIUM TRUST (U.UN) takes your money, buy uranium, and hide them under a stanky mattress. \n\nThey have bought 36M pounds since 19 July 2021, and they are speeding up. \n\nIf you buy enough, they let you get 1 wank off on the mattress they keep the uranium under. \n\n2. Existing mines will run out \n\nBelieve it or not, when uranium comes out of the ground, it is no longer in the ground. \n\nMind blowing, I know. \n\n3. Everyone and their mother fucking boyfriends are building reactors \n\nCoughing (from smoke not virus, Daddy Xi pls dun spank me) China wants to build 150 in the next 15 years. \n\nRadioactive Japan wants to restart reactors because electricity is expensive. \n\nGayest Germany HATES nuclear, but they are considering extending current reactors because Russian gas gay. \n\nEuropean not gay France wants to be the nuclear BIG DADDY of Europe. \n\nGay not European UK also building new reactors. \n\nIn Best America, Elon Musk will eat FAKE NEWS radioactive vegetables to prove they are FAKE NEWS. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1500615542758985728?s=20&t=Kpd_cdUPMk9Amx-32I0tXw \n\n4. America and Europe are sanctioning Russian nuclear fuel. \n\nRussia is very important in the enrichment part of the nuclear fuel cycle. \n\nEnrichment allows you to use the base U3O8 form of uranium more effectively. \n\nAmerica and Europe are in the process of sanctioning Russian nuclear fuel, which means they have to use more U3O8 to make up for the loss in enrichment capacity. \n\n5. Equities R fuked. \n\nSPY P/E is already fucking high, 25.59 \n\nThat's 4% yield.\nWhat happens when inflation goes up, and wages stay stagnant? The economy slows, and earnings pass away. \n\nWhat happens when interest rates rise? P/E has to go lower to stay competitive. \n\nWhat happens when people start cashing out their investments to pay for food and gas? Liquidity crunch. \n\n6. Reactors stay on \n\nIn a bad economy, money flows out from stocks, but lights stay on, and people still have to jerk off to porn. Reactors stay on, and uranium fuel still get burned. \n\nThat's why uranium prices are guaranteed to go higher and will even see a fucking squeeze if the demand and supply deficit doesn't get solved quickly.\n\nCurrent positions: 1000 U.UN shares, 30K in Uranium ETF calls. 45k in Denison Mines.\n\nFuture Positions: Rotating out of my Uranium ETF calls, Denise Mines shares into a total 75% allocation in U.UN and 25% DCA in SOXS leaps.", "id": "u0bfy4", "created_utc": 1649570654.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|23|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|247|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy4gpl/426_dte_and_weaponizing_uranium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6ra26/politics_cant_stop_gme_and_math_says_pt_1000/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8354d/mental_gynamstic_russia_is_winning/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l17qso/lemons_were_meant_to_be_squeezed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6qwu3/confirmation_bias_on_the_squeeze_pt_way_over_1k/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo38ap/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3avs/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3da4/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3g44/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u0be91/physical_uranium_the_ultimate_hedge/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u0bfy4/physical_uranium_the_ultimate_hedge/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u0bfy4)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u0bfy4)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You had me when you told me once uranium is pulled out of the ground it is no longer in the ground.
