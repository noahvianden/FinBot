So, getting patients to accept and pay for treatment has been noticeably harder just these last two months.  When patients have infections, saving teeth is usually a couple grand.

Almost every data point is on-script and could be forecasted out by relating them to one another.\n\nSo in the first place, ignoring how classically reddit it is to base your opinions on anecdotal observations of how busy malls are, you should draw a fearful reaction to your anecdotal observations, not an optimistic one. This is inflationary psychology and it objectively exposes that the population does not give the Fed any credibility. Doesn't matter if it's 75, or even if 100 basis point hikes become the norm - *if they believe the Fed is going to succeed in reining in inflation, they would cool off on spending, because according to that belief, if they had it, they get to buy all of this shit cheaper a couple months from now.*\n\nCore CPI not accelerating in June vs. May (so growing at 0.6% MoM both months) -> again, a bad (but also redundant sign) this is because we know the retailer margins have taken a hammering in Q1/Q2. Meaning us not seeing higher prices than they are right now is a business decision driven by an assumption that inflation would be  temporary.\n\nHealthy household balance sheets (high savings, low debt) was given as an argument as to why recession is unlikely at the beginning of the year. But that's how inflation works: these savings get depleted. So already in January while this is happening, we know what's going to happen: in February-March we had the largest MoM growth in consumer credit (people taking on debt, to maintain their spending habits/living standards). This was already foreshadowed for us because the UK experienced the same thing, and populations always behave the same thing because it's normal psychology, when inflation is expected to continue to climb. People want to beat the price hikes and borrow more before interest rates increase. As interest rates, APRs all rise, that's going to drive the collapse.\n\nSo high vacancy/record job openings is not a good thing, because once the demand drops off (from people having much lower savings already, and then eventually not being able to afford to debt-finance their spending, layoffs reducing demand further) -> those openings go away. They are not real.\n\nWhat drives the need for labor/job openings is the consumer spending. As long as money is being spent the companies still need to hire and shell out wage increases to match inflation. What enables the consumer spending? Their savings and capacity to borrow more, which is getting gradually eroded month by month. So the spiral keeps going until it triggers recession - the customer can't keep buying at the higher prices as people get fired, they can't borrow more, they run out of savings and shift to only buying essentials, then the wage increases people have come to assume will keep coming stop, then they cut back spending and wages drop. What's how the spiral ends, barring a 40% drop in oil prices. \n\nThe good news is that wage is the stickiest price of all.
