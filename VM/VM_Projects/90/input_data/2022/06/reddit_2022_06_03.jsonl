Who, and recall that’s LAST quarter. \n\nInterest rates remaining at all time lows DRIVES inflation. It went higher and far faster on essentials than the CPI shows. In fact, one has to calculate the CPI the way it used to be calculated to notice it. It’s a cooked number if it can’t be used as a historical measuring stick. \n\nCan’t change the length of a foot or a meter and pretend it’s a meaningful measurement. \n\nWage growth is mostly at the low end, but hasn’t kept up with inflation by far. To match inflation since the last time we saw this sort of inflation, you’d need to see the minimum wage easily at $20 without any controversy about it whatsoever, along with commensurate increases in professional wages on up the scale. We are nowhere near that. \n\nThe companies reporting supply shortages are saying that through the audio, read their numbers. It’s not shortages, it’s rising costs. While the supply chain does have continued problems, real ones, it is also becoming the go to excuse for companies who did dumb things like stocking up on the wrong products who now say they’re sitting on 20% of the inventory they did order, as unsellable. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/macys-gap-and-other-clothing-stores-are-stuck-with-the-wrong-items-11654421401\n\nThat’s an indication of poor management, mixed with picky buyers who can’t snap up bargains or worse, companies who can’t afford to simply discount it and move it because they have no profit margin left in it.

You don’t gain, but you make room for more profitable products. \n\nThey’re like, nah. We can literally sit on it for a year. Nobody’s buying. \n\nWhen they say “supply chain” often it’s now not that they CAN’T order stuff. It’s that container shipping just hit all time highs. They can’t afford to order stuff. They’re waiting pretending inflation is going to reverse. That’s not happening. Judging by the Fed continuing to pretend maybe they’ll sneak up on a “neutral rate” — these folks know they truly can sit on product for a year. The consumer isn’t going to buy much of what they stock in their non-essential departments when true QT finally kicks in. Fed still hasn’t done that. They announced it, crashed all growth stock prices, but haven’t actually started demand destruction yet. \n\nThat’s the real pisser for your thesis. Yep people are still buying things they don’t need, but that’s because no significant action has yet truly taken place toward demand destruction. The pump money is still in the system. \n\nThe best stage is continued high inflation and rotation into consumer defensives and we already see numbers out of places like WalMart saying the consumer is tapped BEFORE demand destruction. Not good. That’s not a one quarter event. \n\nAre there bargain stocks to be found? Sure. Will they be even better when real large scale job losses start? Yup.

Both inflation and increased input costs can be attributed to supply shortages, which can largely be attributed to China shutting down factories due to COVID.

Heh. “Oh look I made 8% more than last quarter!”  Sometimes just a sign the consumer ate the price difference — for now. \n\nWith really only one quarter worth of data in that cycle mode, it’s exceedingly rare to see that reverse.
