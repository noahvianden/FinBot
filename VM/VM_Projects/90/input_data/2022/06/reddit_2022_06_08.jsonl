Well,... if Chinese Govt is having mainland Chinese purchase those shares from next month, it would hurt mainland Chinese more going forward.\n\nAlso, China literally has no options but to support its equity markets at this point. China has seen the problem of using housing as a retirement tool. What other options are available with that out?

Now you say that BABA ‚Äúdominates‚Äù its markets in China and that it has a greater moat, but you also say that profitability has been declining‚Ä¶ the truth is that BABA will never dominate anything in China as this country is not the US and Chinese companies will never be allowed to reach oligopolistic positions such as the FAANGs in the US, because the CCP (unlike the US govt) would never allow a private company or individual to gain so much power and extract rents in consumers.

Most Chinese citizens wealth is held in the housing sector due to limits on foreign investment in China (law).\n* The CCP cant control the Covid narrative and the population is growing tired of the lies and inability to solve it.\n* Most of the countries that China exports to are now seeing (stag|in)flation.\n* Other nations wish to wean themselves off China exports after national security weaknesses were highlighted during covid period.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "For that reason.
