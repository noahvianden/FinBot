For the last 3 years I have been building a global stock market watchlist. Here are the results. Hope you will find it useful.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Vqi0M2H8rHEOryYH6UviuqoPcCB7Fe\\_8P95CAXaYwQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Vqi0M2H8rHEOryYH6UviuqoPcCB7Fe_8P95CAXaYwQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Here are a few things before you click on the link:**\n\n· It's a huge watchlist created in Google Sheets with lots of formulas. It takes time and RAMs to load. (I am personally using 11th Gen Intel i7-11800h with 16GB of RAM with 34” monitor for a better view. My browser takes few minutes to load the whole watchlist)\n\n· You'll find there around 1600-1700 stocks from whole world sorted into 11 Stock Market Sectors.\n\n· On the very top you'll find daily gainers (top 5) and decliners (top 5)\n\n***But that’s not all.***\n\nIn addition to that, please go to the right side of the sheet where you’ll be able to find several tables. Those are:\n\n1. Companies sorted by dividend yield. Top 199 companies picked from whole watchlist.\n2. Companies sorted by my SUBJECTIVE PE from lowest to highest. Top 500\n3. Companies sorted by my SUBJECTIVE PE from highest to lowest. Up to 50.\n4. Daily price changes. DECLINERS. Top 50.\n5. Daily price changes GAINERS. Top 50.\n6. Companies sorted by market capitalization. Top 30.\n7. Companies sorted by biggest stock price declines during the last 52 weeks. Top 100.\n8. Companies sorted by smallest stock price declines during the last 52 weeks. Top 100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate. 2023.08.09 \n\nWatchlist is no longer available for public use.

I'm a bit OCD and enjoy playing around making my own little excel sheets but it's really a huge limitation for what you are looking at. P/FCF is a little better than P/E, despite your own little adjustments (which are admirable I assure you!). No real good sorting or filtering features which hinder mentally processing the massive amount of information. There are a significant amount of other things that would help from a glance as well if that is what you are utilizing this for. Esp for dividends or long term investments. Debt to Equity, or DGR% 3 or 5 or 10yr avg.. It just seems a little overwhelming to look at.

It’s how I taught myself options.  But one thing I noticed was that unless kept to one viewable page, portrait oriented monitor allowed, separate files, I wouldn’t use it.  I had the fees, the commissions, all costs factored in, my optimum profit per day with and without fees, overall percentage, all of it on one reasonably readable page.  Then what I found was that if it was simple enough to do on one page, I did not need a spreadsheet.  But I give them away sometimes and it does teach others, although probably differently because they don’t have to work out the formulas. \n\nAnyway, my overall point is that if it helps you understand, awesome.  But the real lessons are in creating the formulas of the cells.  I wish to do something similar with predictive option Greeks based on changes in the underlying across X timeframes and remaining length of contract.  I’m sure it’s been done.  Pointless because I could get that info elsewhere?  Maybe.  But I tend to intuitively know things about options already from learning as I self-taught myself with Excel.
