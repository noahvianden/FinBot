They will go from making 1.4M cars in 2022 to >2.5M in 2023. They have a good chance to double their sales volume.\n* The more sales they have, the better economies of scale kick in, and the more profitable each sale is.

Tesla has never shut down a line. They just keep building with whatever cells they have.\n\nIt could indicate that confidence in the production-readiness of the 4680 line is lower. As an example, Austin's current output is limited by production ramp, \\*not\\* by availability of 2170 cells. That's because working out kinks, optimizing production, and training are all nontrivial activities that take time.\n\nIt makes sense that, in the short term, Tesla could accelerate the production ramp by focusing exclusively on 2170 packs. But they would only do that they had less confidence in the 4680s being ready in the near term.\n\nThe more 4680 cars Tesla can make, the better. That's not for anything going on now, but like I said, the production ramp takes time, and if you look at the intermediate term (2025-2026), a 6-month delay in 4680 capacity is a much bigger deal than all current Austin and Berlin production (even discounting for the time value of money).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yeah, but he's been pretty consistent thus far and I'm sure he is taking the increased ramp into consideration.
