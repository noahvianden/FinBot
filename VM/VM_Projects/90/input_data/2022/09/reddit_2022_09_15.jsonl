The school I‚Äôm at now honestly most of the kids will have successful lives and contribute to the world. So I‚Äôm optimistic. \n\nIf I had a magic wand I would dismantle the teachers union. And pay math/science/engineering teachers at least 75K right out the gate. If someone with a B.S in Math or chemistry/biology anything like that wanted to teach kindergarten 75K right out the bat. Probably cap it off at 100K but more in expensive cities like Seattle raise the pay even more. I would try to make budget cuts in some areas‚Ä¶ administrators pay PE Teachers, English, history, art.

If you‚Äôre a 6th grade math level you should learn 6th grade math until you can move on. It makes kids feel stupid to be in a class that they have no fucking clue what‚Äôs going on.
