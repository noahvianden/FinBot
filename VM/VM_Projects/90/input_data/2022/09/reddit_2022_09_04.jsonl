{"title": "Meta isn't NFT/Crypto, It's VR and Virtual Reality", "selftext": "I know the reddit opinion of Meta isn't great, but I also think nobody understands it. It's not Crypto and NFT's, it's a bet on Virtual Reality. If you think Virtual Reality is going away, you're just simply wrong.  Everyone is bullish about Apple making $1000+ headsets for the first time, but suddently bearish when Meta makes BETTER headsets for less than half the cost?\n\nApple making VR Headsets is bullish FOR META because Meta owns all of the gaming infrastructure for the entire platform. You will be using Meta's platform, just on an Apple headset. Sure, Apple can turn it around, or attempt to turn it around, but they've already got the largest following, all of the infrastructure, and a years headstart in the VR/AR space.  Apple has a mobile games store.\n\nI have not seen a single person use a VR headset and not be blown away by the technology. You put on the headset, and it's ready to use. You can use the hand controllers but it also can literally track your hands and you can play VR games just using their machine vision and hand tracking.\n\nThey have a BETTER VR headset than Apple for half the price and all of the infrastructure, and other's are trying to take a piece of the pie. They might be able to, but I think it either benefits them in the long term, or they fail trying to dethrone the Google of VR.  They have over 90% of the market share here, and have been perfecting VR/AR since 2014 when oculus was purchased, who has been working on the tech since 2012.\n\nThere isn't any similarities to the Crypto metaverse stuff. There's no NFTs, paid avatars, or wahtever. You have an avatar that follows you through games that you play as, but its completely free to use and customize and even if you do purchase things, for example, in game, thats not new. Most games have skins to purchase. It's just like Xbox avatars, Mii's, and everything else, except in VR. It's a bit more personal because you're playing as that charecter in games like poker, certain RPGs, etc and you look down and see it's your avatar, and its more immersive, but it's not like I am spending $4000 on a monkey picture and theres some open market that hyper monetizes VR.  In fact, there's DOZENS of free games and trials and experiences you can play within it. I didnt buy a game for the first several weeks because there's so much free stuff, including watching YouTube videos from the inside of the video and some other wild stuff.\n\nIt's unpopular, but:\n\n1. 90% of the people, especially here, critical of Meta's vision of VR have never put on a VR headset\n2. He might be an alien, but Zuck is spot on with his vision of VR.\n3. Facebook, without their VR labs, is still an incredibly strong underlying business seeing lots of growth and printing money. Once VR takes off, that's only going to supplement the growth.\n\nEdit: Title - AR & Virtual Reality", "id": "x5x8mx", "created_utc": 1662324285.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "VR AND Virtual Reality!\n\nThis is news!", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "combative retire plate bear flag connect aback fearless wistful crush\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Meta is 100% ads", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Showing ads, gathering data for ads, selling data for ads.

The Apple headset buzz seems to be getting increasing, maybe a release in the next year?  For me and perhaps many others Meta is not to be trusted with personal information of any kind.  Meta’s business model seems based on corralling users and extracting as much static and behavioral information as possible, even probing reaction with channeled stimulus.  A virtual world that they own would put users in a petri dish as guests.  Apple, on the other hand, sells HW, SW, and services.   How many folks are waiting for entry into a VR world where they are just customers, not test subjects and sales prospects?  That’s my impression as a consumer, anyway", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not sure we can speculate on the nature of the Metaverse before it exists, so its all a guessing game.
