He‚Äôs really lost his way.‚Äù\n\nGeorge has spent the past 20 years studying leadership failures in the workplace, recently compiling those findings into a new book called, ‚ÄúTrue North: Leading Authentically in Today‚Äôs Workplace, Emerging Leader Edition.‚Äù\n\nIn short, George says bosses that lose sight of their most deeply held beliefs, values and purpose as a leader ‚Äî especially in the name of money, fame or power ‚Äî are doomed to fail. And after decades of researching high-profile corporate collapses, he says he sees striking similarities to Zuckerberg and Meta today.\n\nZuckerberg and Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It‚Äôs request for comment. The Meta CEO is largely responsible for his company‚Äôs meteoric growth to this point, transforming the company he co-founded in 2004 into a tech giant with a $450.46 billion market cap, as of Monday morning.\n\nIn doing so, he helped create the modern-day social media industry ‚Äî a move he‚Äôs attempting to replicate now by repositioning his company into the metaverse space. Given his past success, it might be unwise to bet against him, as CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù in February.\n\n‚ÄúI know that this is probably out of fashion, I have total faith in Mark Zuckerberg. I think Zuckerberg‚Äôs going to be able to pull off ... the metaverse,‚Äù Cramer said, adding that Meta has a track record of rebounding after stock dips, scandal and controversy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some people you have to bet on. And if you go back to 2018 to that horrible summer breakdown ... no one thought these guys could come back.‚Äù\n\nStill, George says Meta is bound to fail as long as Zuckerberg remains at the helm. Here‚Äôs why:\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/harvard-expert-mark-zuckerberg-is-continuing-to-derail-facebook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/harvard-expert-mark-zuckerberg-is-continuing-to-derail-facebook.html)\n\nMark Zuckerberg is ‚Äòcontinuing to derail‚Äô Facebook, and his poor leadership skills are slowly dragging it toward failure, Harvard expert Bill George says.

Yes they placate a vocal minority rather than giving the majority of people an equal voice.  This is the opposite of customer service when it comes to social media.  Banning people who disagree with the community guidelines on social issues is unamerican.
