Once derivatives get involved, it all goes to shit. Firms report on notional value of the total sum of all securities and financial instruments, which means a firm can buy a bunch of puts and some shares to hedge the short position and simply report the total proportional value of the contracts + shares. When it comes to short selling, both the lender *and* the short seller will commonly report ownership over the same shares. Pick a firm that historically engages in short selling and compare a few of their 13F filings. You‚Äôll notice huge changes in holdings that coincide with record profits on short sale trades because they are actively opening and closing out short positions.\n\nSeeing a huge uptick in ownership on 13Fs only tells you that securities are being traded, but gives very little insight into the actual trades themselves.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "S&P gonna hit 3900 then fall again.\n\nBear market rallies are tough shit for the bullievers, and the bears", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes but not a perma bull. 2 weeks at best to 4120 then 3500 bin August", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I was kinda interested in your thoughts until you said the 9th thing.
