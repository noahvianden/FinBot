If Tesla wanted to sell ICE vehicles, they could have done so the very first year they became a company. That isn't the goal. As you've stated, Tesla has been in the game for over a decade. That decade they spent is a competitive advantage. Because there weren't any available parts for EV's, Tesla manufactured almost everything in-house, hence, why they are the most vertically integrated auto company in the world right now.\n\nThe market is heading towards EV vehicles. The more ICE vehicles that are produced, the more corporate executives are going to fall in love with the profits and postpone EV development. This is like when iPhones came out. Nokia sold more units by far. Where is Nokia now? I'm not saying these other automakers are incompetent but they are way behind. Watch Sandy Munro on YouTube. He is one of the most respected auto engineers and breaks down vehicles and these other carmakers are simply way behind in terms of engineering efficiency and performance. Chinese companies who started EV's from scratch are way ahead of these other automakers. Ford and GM are doing way better, on paper, than NIO and BYD.
