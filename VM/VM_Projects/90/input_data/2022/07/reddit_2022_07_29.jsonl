Homes where listed and had 15 offers over the weekend, then raised the price Monday and had another 15 offers..and over list was the norm. I got outbid on several...and they raised the price Monday and went for another round of offers.\n\nI went to Lenner builders to see what they had. Remember we were in a supply crunch...so the salesman gives the story of what they are doing. They are putting packages together to build the entire street, getting locked in material prices, and contractor prices, and once that is Locked in they are going to the market with these homes at a price..no changes other than adding a pool. You want this house its 700K, if you do not want it the next down the list gets it. There was a lottery and the model I was interested in there were 30 people wanting 3-5 homes every two weeks. I signed up, but honestly the houses were way too small, and the yard was too small, but hell put me on the list. Was in the lottery for about two months and never got to the selection phase.\n\nSo I eventually after about 5 offers, I found my home and moved in. It went From 550k when I bought to it 710K on Zillow in less than a year. Over the last month it has dropped to 670k. I fully expect it to drop to 550K if not below.\n\nLeads to my email yesterday from Lenner...mind you I have not heard from the sales guy since I dropped the lottery about 16 months ago. Since I was on the waiting list for a few months with Lenner I assume I am in their database as a lead. I would call the email panic. They are going deep in there email list to see if they can get buyers. There are over 100 homes they are trying to sell in Phoenix with a min price of 500K and up..some 1.2M. The market has changed on them and with 5% rates the buyers are gone. Meanwhile they have about 10 developments in some stage of construction and contracted out. Interests have priced out the buyers....They are going to be sitting on a huge inventory with interest loans bearing down on them...thier only choice is going to be cut an run. This is Phoenix and one builder here.\n\nI have a friend who is building a 1.2M custom home from Toll Brothers. He has about 200K into them. He might have to walk away because he cannot afford/qualify for the mortgage...house will not be ready till next year and he cannot lock in a rate as they are just starting a 9 month build for him. He might have to lose his 200K and walk next year. He said he might just buy it and then refinance...might have to cash in retirement money...but then he thinks will the house even appraise at 1.2 next summer.\n\nMy father was a developer. I saw this cycle in 1984 and he went bankrupt from it...there were no buyers...at any price.

{"title": "Defining a Recession", "selftext": "There have been numerous posts and accusations regarding what is a recession. Rather than getting involved in opinion about whether someone is trying to be deceptive how about make an effort to understand the facts first.\n\n**In the US a recession is officially determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). It is not determined by any specific economic indicator.**\n\nUsing the wayback machine I have looked at the NBER's website from 10/24/2005 (about 17 years ago) and found this in their FAQs:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20051024120526/http://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html#faq](https://web.archive.org/web/20051024120526/http://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html#faq) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Q: The financial press often states the definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. How does that relate to the NBER's recession dating procedure?**  \n>  \n>**A:**: Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more quarters of declining real GDP, but not all of them. According to current data for 2001, the present recession falls into the general pattern, with three consecutive quarters of decline. Our procedure differs from the two-quarter rule in a number of ways. First, we consider the depth as well as the duration of the decline in economic activity. Recall that our definition includes the phrase, \"a significant decline in economic activity.\" Second, we use a broader array of indicators than just real GDP. One reason for this is that the GDP data are subject to considerable revision. Third, we use monthly indicators to arrive at a monthly chronology.  \n>  \n>**Q:Could you give an example illustrating this point?**  \n>  \n>**A:**On July 31, 2002, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released revised figures for gross domestic product that showed three quarters of negative growth in 2001-quarters 1, 2 and 3-where previously the data had shown only quarter 3 as negative. This revision shows why the committee does not rely on a simple rule of thumb such as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, nor relies on GDP data alone, in making its determinations, but rather looks at a broader array of statistics. In November 2001, the committee determined the date of the peak in activity in March 2001 using its normal indicators. The two-quarter-decline rule of thumb would not have allowed the declaration of the recession until August 2002, let alone a declaration that it had begun early in 2001, as in the statement that the committee made in November 2001. It was not until eight months later that revisions in the GDP data showed declining real GDP for the first, second, and third quarters of 2001.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you go to the current NBER website you can see the current definition of recession and it is consistent with the one above from 17 years ago. Nothing has changed.\n\n[https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating](https://www.nber.org/research/business-cycle-dating)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are following, nothing in the above definition determines whether the economy is good now or this period will be defined as recession by the NBER later, so if you think the economy is weak invest accordingly. No one is stopping you. All the above tells us is that until the NBER looks at numerous pieces of retrospective data and determines there is a recession there cannot officially be a recession (because officially a recession just means the NBER said so. It has nothing to do with current economic conditions rather it is an opinion of prior periods). Powell and others are simply giving their personal opinions as until the NBER determines there is a recession we can all speculate how we like about whether this will ultimately officially be defined as a recession. Powell seems cautiously optimistic that we are not in a recession, whereas numerous people here seem to believe that since 2Q of GDP decline came in we must be in recession (hmmm... what if this quarter and next there is an increase in GDP?... would that not mean we are out of recession? What exactly is a retrospective indicator going to help you today in any case?).\n\nReally the only concern anyone should really have is how your understanding of current economic conditions should drive your behavior and not whether the NBER will define this period as recession or not, which per the NBER  is something they can only define after-the-fact. If you think about it, by the time a recession is defined it is too late for you to make money trading off it.\n\nSo please can we move on from the nonsense about what is defined as a recession.
