Since I graduated college I‚Äôve been aggressively paying off my student loans and I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm half way done with only $13,000 left. I am however worried about the upcoming recession since I have nothing saved besides a couple thousand dollars in my investment account. I stopped putting money into my investment accounts a few months again to focus on paying off my loans. I am now wondering if I should allocate like $100 a week to savings and investing or should I pay off these loans as fast as I can?", "id": "w3hxse", "created_utc": 1658308912.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w3hxse)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w3hxse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Since youre asking for an investment advice on WSB - yolo your savings into weekly options obviously", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "And take out more loans and chuck it at dailies and gourd futures!", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "And post your loss porn or don‚Äôt be associated with us", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Live life like a pro. \n\nStep 1.

You can structure this to pay off the debt, which you can incur in the future again at low interest rates to access money because of the gain in credit score.\n\nBut don't be so aggressive with paying them off, people are right, anything with like a good credit score mortgage level interest is like free money.\n\nBTW Banks and Credit Unions are still offering like 2% interest on loans for \"toys\" (RV's, Boats, Motorcycles, ATV's, etc).
