Stocks go up and down and your $250K isn't going to survive swings in the stocks.\n\nFor example, AAPL is $155, so you could buy 16 sets of 100 shares.

However, with an IV rank of 94% (IV has only been higher 6% of the time in recent history), navigating this trade is going to take some nuance. If you don’t have time to read, that means I’m arming myself with bearish put debit spreads expiring July 29th ahead of $META’s earnings.\n\n**First, some facts:**\n\n* $META carries an average single-day earnings move of 10.5% over the last 5 quarters.\n* February 2nd saw a particularly brutal outcome of -26.39% — the [largest single day loss of market cap in market history](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-platforms-stock-facebook-market-capitalization-51643908656), -$232.02B.\n* $META shares recently reached a fresh >2-year low of $154.25 during the week beginning 6/21/22.\n* Prior to that, $META reached a brief pandemic low of $137.10 during the week beginning 3/16/20. \n   * How brief? The week prior (beginning 3/09/20), $META closed at $154.34 — $0.09 above its most recent June low. \n   * The week following (beginning 3/23/20) $META closed at $156.79 — $2.54 above its most recent low.\n   * Outside of the week beginning 3/16/20, $META has respected the $154 level since early 2019.\n* Since reporting earnings in February of 2022, shares of $META have remained in a technical downtrend, with a linear regression rate of roughly 0.758. \n* Despite reporting upbeat earnings and guidance in April of 2022, the stock was unable to escape the downtrend.\n* The bottom of this bearish channel coincides perfectly with $META’s pandemic low of $137.10.\n* TikTok continues to dominate Facebook, Instagram and Messenger from a growth and revenue perspective.\n   * On a list of the top grossing apps in the US, Tiktok places 3rd, Facebook places 84th. Instagram and Messenger are too low to feature.\n* Lastly, Zuckerberg himself has been blunt about the current state of Meta. \n   * [Meta slashes hiring plans.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-meta-girds-fierce-headwinds-slower-growth-second-half-memo-2022-06-30/)\n      * CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees to brace for a deep economic downturn.\n\n>\"If I had to bet, I'd say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we've seen in recent history,\" Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters.\n\n**Conclusion**: Bearish\n\nIn the wake of $SNAP and $TWTR missing earnings on the top and bottom line, Tiktok’s continued growth, a firm technical downtrend in $META shares, and a strong propensity for outsized earnings moves, there are plenty of reasons to get bearish ahead of $META’s earnings this Thursday. However, with a 94% IV rank, strong support at $154, a 10.5% average earnings move, and IV crush to contend with, it’s critical from a vega and theta perspective to utilize a put debit spread here.\n\n**The Trade Structure**: Put Debit Spreads\n\n**Safe**: Targeting the $155 support level. \n\n**Lotto**: Target the $137 support level if $META breaks below $155 and falls to the bottom of it’s downtrend, the pandemic low of $137.10.\n\nFor July 29th, **long $170 puts, short $155 puts** — Risking $5.00 for a profit of $10.00, breakeven of $165 and maximum value of $15.00 if $META satisfies its 10.5% expected move. \n\n**OR**\n\nFor July 29th, **long $145 puts, short $137 puts** — Risking $1.00 for a profit of $7.00, breakeven of $144 and maximum value of $8.00 if $META has another outsized earnings move like it did in February, targeted at the next area of support.\n\n**Alternatively**, you can combine these two trades by running long $170 puts, short $137 puts — Risking $9.00 for a profit of $24.00, breakeven of $161 and maximum value of $33.00 if $META falls to it’s pandemic low. \n\nNo matter which trade you pick, it’s important to collect at least *some* premium on this. Holding through earnings is risky business, IV crush and theta are going to be very much in play here with these short term, OTM options, which is why we want to target the ATM $170 strike for our long position. \n\n**Trade Headwinds**: \n\n* $META’s earnings report falls on July 27th, after market close — directly in between the FOMC’s next rate hike meeting (July 26th) and directly before we get QoQ GDP data (July 28th, 8:30 AM EST). That means that the market will be simultaneously reacting to both $META earnings and GDP data. If the GDP reaction is bad, that’s a big tailwind. If the GDP reaction is good, we could see extra noise on this trade which we can’t afford from a time basis.\n* Alphabet ($GOOGL) and Microsoft ($MSFT) earnings reports are due on July 26th — right before $META. A positive report from either company could prove to be a macro headwind for this bearish trade.\n\nDespite these headwinds, there are plenty of big reasons to make a bearish trade on $META ahead of earnings. \n\n**The Wrap Up**\n\nUse $170/$155 put debit spreads ahead of $META’s earnings to target the current >2 year low and an average move of 10.5% — OR — Target the $137 pandemic low if you’re looking for a larger than average earnings move (and are comfortable with more risk).\n\n**Visual Data Sources For Some of the Facts Listed Above**: [https://imgur.com/a/H6kDc17](https://imgur.com/a/H6kDc17)", "id": "w5j6hv", "created_utc": 1658518296.0, "score": 103, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "I’m worried that everyone thinks this is a no brainer", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Possibly puts on both RBLX and META.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fair case - but Facebook hasn’t come out and sandbagged like Netflix.

Price: Costs on FB have risen over 5x since last year. Typically you'd think \"wow, that's fucking great, they're making WAY more money!\" - but you'd be wrong. See, the prices may be higher but companies are spending far less and in some cases, pulling out completely. I myself have watched 6 figure monthly budgets go to almost $0 spend and pulling out to try other platforms. \n\n2.) Targeting: FB took away all of our tools. It's so difficult to express my frustration here, and if there are other marketers in this sub they'll know what I mean, but, FB cut out 99% of our \"good\" targeting options. Yes, we can still target you by A/S/L and we can still retarget you if you hit our site (at a drastically increased price!) however, we can no longer target Stacy the 36 year old MILF that likes Botox. \n\nWe actually can't target anything in healthcare anymore. Gone are the options to select \"people who like botox\" or \"american diabetes association\"; with no targeting alternative provided. \n\nBut, wait. What if we wanted to target someone for a financial offer like a credit card? \n\nNope. You're now in a \"special\" category. Limited reach for your ads, higher price. You can do it, sure, but gooood fucking luck getting approval on the ad unless you're a big brand with a huge budget.\n\n3.) ROI: Yes, there's overlap on all 3. In the end ROI is what matters, regardless of your industry or vertical. It's becoming next-to-impossible to find ROI at scale, and if by chance you do manage to strike that elusive formula between a reasonable CPM, a high CTR and high conversion rate (CVR); it doesn't last. \n\nThis wasn't true for the last 10+ years. You had endless targeting options, cheap clicks and medium-level-intent. It was good enough to scale if you were a decent marketer. \n\nNow, no level of skill is going help you. You either have a slam dunk offer that everyone is clamoring for, sharing with friends and basically leveraging their entire network to give you free organic traffic - or you fail. And you will 10 times out of 10 fail without it. \n\nYou could give away free fucking money on that platform and FB would still charge you $0.10 per impression and only show your ad below the fold! It's so beyond ridiculous. \n\nAnd this leads me to the nail in the coffin; ***brand dollars***. \n\nFB has not-so-subtly focused on big brand accounts for the last 10 years. Slowly pulling in billions from the likes of the insurance carriers, pharma, politicians and auto manufacturers of the world. \n\nOnce conversion rates drop and prices go up, ROI plummets. There's only so many negative quarters a big brand, or advertising firm is going to take before they have to pull the plug. \n\nI predict companies like GM will once again say they are ditching [FB like they did back in 2012](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/business/media/gm-to-quit-facebook-ad-campaign-worth-10-million-a-year.html)\n\nThen more major advertisers will pile on.\n\n\\--- \n\nThe worst part of this is that it wasn't even Facebook's fault. **Apple killed Facebook**.\n\nRight up until iOS14 hit things were going smooth. Companies were spending billions because they were making billions. Now? They aren't seeing positive ROI's, and if that wasn't enough you've got a pending recession, decreased funding, lower stock prices and companies have to cut something. The first to go is...well the interns and sales teams, but after that? Marketing budgets. \n\nWhy would you even bother keeping a marketing budget that isn't producing at least breakeven? You wouldn't. \n\nSo, what IS happening? \n\n**We're all shifting back to Google and testing TikTok.** \n\nFB as an ad platform is NOT producing like it used to. Plain and simple. You can only fight it for so many quarters before C-levels shut that shit down. \n\nI was a longtime proponent of FB's future, but not anymore.
