{"title": "An analysis of stocks that are still up 1000%/2000%/3000% from the Covid bottom in 2020 and buying Puts on them", "selftext": "Update #1: Added more Tickers in the table (Top 65 for NASDAQ, Top 65 for NYSE)\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nMy theory is simple, the Feds printer overinflated the value of pretty much every stock in the stock market from the covid bottom of 2020 until EOY 2021 when the market peaked. Since then,  tech has been crushed, down 26.8% YTD, S&P 500 down 18.95% YTD, and DOW down 13.9% YTD. Some of the \"top\" tech companies are down way more than that, Netflix down 71%, Shopify down 77%, Paypal down 63% etc. While I still think these stocks have room to decrease, this begs the question of are there any stocks that are still way up that have a shit ton of room to lose value and I should buy PUTS on? The answer is yes. From the Covid bottom (which to simplify things I marked as the date March 20, 2020) until when I ran this analysis on July 3, 2022, there were a ton of companies that were still up 1000%, 2000%, 3000%. Examples include RENN Up 3800%, AMR Up 3600%, AR Up 3100%, SM up 2700%, MVIS up 2000%, VTNR up 1800% etc. - Go look at their charts. I started buying PUTS on these companies and will continue doing so until they all burn down to normal levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Intro:**\n\nNo one should listen to me and this is NFA. I decided to try and go out on my own and think for myself for once and take a couple thousand dollars to throw into options. The question I had in my head that I was trying to answer was simple. Since the market is trending downward and appears to be in a bear market, and a lot of tech stocks have already lost a shit ton of value...Are there any random stocks that have increased a shit ton in value from the bottom of the covid dip but still haven't fallen in value in relation to current prices?\n\n**Process:**\n\nI got free data from [Stooq](https://stooq.com/db/h/) for the past couple decades. It's just open and close price data. Honestly not even sure how accurate it is but oh well. I did this analysis in less than a day so hopefully I didn't make a mistake. I used four dates in particular:\n\n1. The pre-covid dip date of February 14th, 2020 (the approximate date before stocks started tanking leading up to COVID\n2. The Covid bottom date of March 20, 2020, which is the rough date when most stocks bottomed out and the Fed and JPOW turned that money printer up to full speed. Everything started increasing from then on.\n3. The EOY 2021 date of December 31, 2021 when most indexes peaked and hit ATH.\n4. The Date when I ran this analysis which was July 3, 2022\n\nFrom these dates I took the closing price of these days and calculated the percent increase of every stock in the NYSE and NASDAQ from the COVID bottom up until July 3, 2022. I really didn't expect much but boy was I wrong. Note that I had incomplete data, there are a number of tickers missing from the STOOQ website because certain dates closing prices were missing.\n\nHere is a list of the top Increasing NASDAQ stocks from March 20, 2020 to July 3, 2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ztnbkltr0c91.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c7fe0a46e1b83ede15d5546a0684e6abd72d221\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqrq2o9as0c91.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=91712d99ca307a3f76a6f7412910ccd3ab48b8c2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is a list of the top Increasing NYSE stocks from March 20, 2020 to July 3, 2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxzt86yvr0c91.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8d2771a40da1972a9a0914b103d4b9721ac933b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmk0no0bs0c91.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2f80da45e85af55d885ebf2ac5818e4ec523f24\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't believe me, here are some of the tickers above with their charts provided:\n\n**MVIS: (03/20/2020 Price of 0.18 to 07/01/2022 Price of 3.95, Up 2000%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2z9i4zktyb91.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0407fadcb4dbf457d01e49099eae119df22d167\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VTNR: (03/20/2020 Price of 0.57 to 07/01/2022 Price of 10.72, Up 1800%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hzduyiltyb91.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eec84b51c52a38c3353501fcef1ffdd042cad1d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RCMT: (03/20/2020 Price of 1.17 to 07/01/2022 Price of 19.23, Up 1500%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/egdvyn1mtyb91.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f518bdc226ae828ef8c29344c376bf6531c2647\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RENN: (03/20/2020 Price of 0.75 to 07/01/2022 Price of 29.69, Up 3800%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77v13epmtyb91.png?width=1406&format=png&auto=webp&s=7749eb6a3e24d1dbc3aee5336ab7fd073935e84c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AMR: (03/20/2020 Price of 3.38 to 07/01/2022 Price of 124.87, Up 3600%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkpub0antyb91.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ba5b6469b1c6505dbeb0074245fbff9c7dedba\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AR: (03/20/2020 Price of 0.95 to 07/01/2022 Price of 30.74, Up 3100%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60rduvsntyb91.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eb0e7dbaa2de50fab2a6d2acaf09fca21f8cf18\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SM: (03/20/2020 Price of 1.24 to 07/01/2022 Price of 34.08, Up 2600%)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8f15tdotyb91.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd14f482bc5ef8b5389d4c965b750816c72f4079\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now that you know I'm not full of shit, I used these top gainers to buy puts on since there was a trend reversal.
