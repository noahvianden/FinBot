It is, as you pointed out, linked to the monetary policy.

They cannot produce at a rate anywhere near enough to make up for the lost government money. These businesses will have to cut costs in order to maintain profitability.

The actual wage numbers may grow, but adjusted for inflation the real wage fluctuates all the time.\n\nFor example, the real wages in the US were higher in the early 1970's than they were in the 1980's. That is because the crash in the 70's drove down wages in relation to productivity. The high wages of the late 60's and early 70's didn't create a new equilibrium. There was massive inflation in the 70's but the wages remained stagnant, so by the 80's people were earning less in real wages than they were before.\n\nThis is a regular cycle in the economy. It goes all the way back to Marx and the Reserve Army of Labour. As the economy grows, the Reserve Army gets smaller, until most of the Reserve Army is employed and companies must fight for employees. This drives wages up, but when the wages get too high it reduces the profitability of the companies and the economy goes into a recession, which kills off any of the less stable companies. The shuttering of those companies pushes a bunch of people back into the Reserve Army and the surviving companies no longer have to compete for employees. Instead, employees are competing for the jobs and will take less pay than they would have when the job market was much tighter.\n\nThe economist Anwar Shaikh does a great job detailing the empirical evidence for this phenomenon.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Why down vote?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I look at it as asset owners vs non-asset owners.
