Being the summer people are spending less on energy right now and enjoying the relatively healthy jobs market. Others seem to be feeling quite well off thanks to house prices going up and the attractive mortgage rates many home owners were able to secure during the pandemic.\n\nHowever, two major things will play out over the next 6-12 months. The first being the energy cap rise which will occur in Oct then again in Jan. Energy prices here in the UK are already at record highs, but they're about to double again during the coldest months of the year.\n\nIn addition to this most people here only have short-term fixed mortgage rates (generally 2-5 years) so no one is really feeling the pinch of higher rates just yet. However over the year many homeowners are going to find they'll need to pay perhaps 10-20% more on their mortgage bill than they were previously. And for most home owners their mortgage is their largest monthly outgoing.\n\nBeyond just energy and higher rates, we also have high fuel prices and the price of everything in stores is skyrocketing. Most of my family are lower income and I've heard several people in my family comment how they're already down about £100 a month just from higher fuel prices making their daily commutes more expensive.\n\nImo reality just hasn't sunk in for a lot of people yet. Just speaking anecdotally a lot of people I know have been spending the money they saved during the pandemic to go on holidays this summer. I think the US is in a relatively stronger position, but it's worth remembering that a lot of the largest companies in the US do a large amount of their business in Europe. I suspect the relatively healthy earnings we've seen so far are probably misleading because the real pain hasn't hit the consumer yet.\n\nI'm normally a perma-bull, but I'm really worried that the market isn't pricing in what's coming. I just don't see how the average person here in the UK is going to afford paying a few hundred pounds extra on energy, food and mortgage / rent payments over the next several months and I suspect other Europe countries are in a similar position with the largest European economy, Germany, being in an even worse position given it's dependency on Russian energy.\n\nJust be careful out there.

That's nearly $4 trillion in debt whose interest rates just rose yet again. Many of these companies have financed their continual low margin expansions with debt. Even the big tech companies whose revenues are linked to advertising are seeing lower profits.\n\nThere is no rational reason that rising rates will help US equities on the whole. Even if the interest rate rise helps to mitigate inflation somewhat - although I am skeptical by how much given that recent inflation was spurred by the Russia-Ukraine invasion causing the price of grains, oilseeds, oil, nat. gas. fertilizer, nickel, copper, and many other commodities to rise in price - companies will be spending as much or more on financing their debt loads anyway.\n\nPersonally, I'm invested in SPXU (ETF which is short the S&P500).
