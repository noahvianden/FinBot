The fed has printed trillions, and while that was necessary to save the markets ( to an extent ) they kept doing it because every time they tried to cut back QE stocks plummeted. The fed cannot infinitely print money, at some point it has to stop, and that stopping point should have been between 2013 and 2020, however the markets are like spoiled children and would crash and throw a tantrum every time they tried. \n\nIf we do get an even more significant downturn the fed is out of tools to use to stimulate the economy. The QE benefitted stock holders but the average consumer saw very little benefits, however when inflation ramps up because of this infinite money printing it‚Äôs the consumer who gets screwed the hardest. Average person gets none of the benefits and all of the fallout.\n\nOur economy has been fundamentally broken, it has not been a free market and it certainly isn‚Äôt capitalism. The FED has created a safety net for stocks, when something goes sideways they step in and pump money.
