{"title": "My $250 Bet We Have a Black Friday Event on Friday", "selftext": "Title pretty much says it all, the engine in my 21 year old pickup blew, I junked it, and now I'm betting half the money I got from that to see if I can get a new old pickup to drive into the ground.\n\nI finished loading into my positions today, already down, but the real test will come in two days time.  Seriously, don't follow this trade, it's at best got like a 30% chance of not going to zero.  The theory (negative GDP print tomorrow followed by big misses on AMZN and AAPL after hours) is sound, but the positions are ridiculous.\n\n2 shares SQQQ\n\n1 SPY 9/16 235p\n\n2 SPY 9/16 200p\n\n3 AAPL 7/29 133p\n\n1 AMZN 7/29 102p\n\n1 AMZN 8/5 98p\n\n1 SPY 8/3 362p\n\n3 SPY 8/19 315p\n\n2 DOG 8/19 41c\n\n1 DOG 8/19 50c\n\n(total current value $235, so I'm already down some from that big rally today, will probably be down more by end of day tomorrow)\n\nIf the market crashes on Friday, I'm a genius, if it doesn't, I'm out half my junked truck $$.  What's going to happen?  Nobody knows!  Feel free to dump on my ass if this doesn't work out, because I'll be crowing to the fucking sky gods if it does.\n\n**EDIT: haha.  Did i say Black Friday?  Green.  I meant green friday.  Totally. Leprechauns and rainbows and shit.  Ignore the headline and be astounded by my prognostications.**\n\n**EDIT2: Can you even imagine what kind of momo regarded sucka would bet against Tim Apple and Jeff Bozos?
