{"title": "I Don't Want The President to Acknowledge TSLA", "selftext": "So the hot TSLA news of the week is a wave of sentiment that the administration should Acknowledge TSLA's lead in the EV Space.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/sj16u7/in_case_someone_missed_elons_tweet_to_the/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/shlow9/petition_to_get_biden_to_acknowledge_tesla_please/).  \n\nAs title says, I think this is a bad idea.  From an Investor Standpoint and a Philosophical Standpoint.  \n\n**Philosophy Standpoint**  \nThere is no world where TSLA getting pulled into the spotlight is good.  The best case scenario is they get the acknowledgement people are looking for and then that is used to guilt them into becoming effectively a branch of the government.  Guarantee you if this administration acknowledges TSLA, that speech would end with \"and it is TSLA's duty to share and help our Union Autoworkers into the future blah blah blah\".  That's the best case.\n\nThe worse case, and more likely imo, is this pressure will cause this administration to double down on anti TSLA sentiment, maybe even take more direct measures to counter TSLA's growth.\n\nand just to bring this home.  Imagine a world where the administration acknowledges TSLA's lead in earnest, Build Back Better is adjusted to give TSLA advantages for already being all electric, and TSLA simply explodes to 2k because everyone just accepts the status quo.  Yeah I see hell freezing over too.\n\n**Investor Standpoint**  \nThis is easy.  TSLA will have a better rally if all this drama goes quiet.  Let the suckers keep thinking GM and Ford are catching up.  Let this Administration keep pretending.  A stock flies when it surprises people so the longer we keep quiet and let the naysayers live in lala land, the harder the pop when the bread comes out of the oven.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, I don't think this wave of pressure to thrust TSLA into a political spotlight is a good idea.  Let TSLA keep doing what its doing.  Let the work speak for itself.\n\nUPDATE: [so about that worst case scenario…](https://stocks.apple.com/ASTdKnxn8RqehYGBxzpCPnQ)", "id": "sjjknp", "created_utc": 1643895963.0, "score": 209, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "Yep.

I'm not signing that petition, getting the President to say 'Tesla' serves little useful purpose.\n\nI see Biden's approach more as this administration trying to get legacy auto to transform before Tesla and perhaps Chinese BEV competitors wipe out a sizable industry.  Of course, how effective that's going to be is debatable, in long-game politics this is \"putting a face on things\" - get the CEO's to commit publicly and big them up / butter them up to do so.

Maybe Biden and his administration recognize this (highly unlikely, but still interesting to enertain the idea)?\n\nMaybe Biden wants to make sure that GM and Ford don't fall behind Chinese automakers, because as it stands, things are looking very grim for GM and Ford. I think there are very few scenarios where GM and Ford survive the next decade, with or without the president's support.\n\nIn contrast, Chinese automakers like Nio, Li auto, and Xpeng are killing it.\n\nYet another perspective: Biden isn't recognizing \\*\\*any\\*\\* of the new American automakers (including Rivian & Lucid). He is only supporting the car companies that he grew up with like GM & Ford, because of what they represent (mostly the jobs they offer, which has been cited by the president a few times).

That \\*would\\* really get the boots on the ground up in revolt against him (see: coal in the 80s in the UK when \"you be fucked\" eventually, horrifyingly for many communities, became government policy).    The unspoken thing here from the administration of course is they are \\*entirely\\* aware that auto is going through creative destruction and its a matter of how many jobs can be saved / converted (arguably less than any politician would ever admit to publicly).\n\nIt's different from the Motorola situation to my mind, as this really does affect a LOT of jobs (including various suppliers) on US soil - and ones where retraining is going to be very challenging.  Honestly, it's a thankless position to be in for a President.  Biden, absolutely, knows legacy auto's days \"as is\" are numbered, and he's probably hoping that *some* transformation by the legacy's can reduce the job losses before some kind of bailout / assistance is needed to cushion the gradual legacy industry collapse.

Although it's a possibility that we both are entertaining, I think there's a very small chance that Biden is supporting GM and Ford because he feels they are **behind** in the EV transition. I think he's supporting them because he thinks they are *ahead*.\n\nI actully think that Biden truly believes that GM is the leader in the EV space. Further, he is supporting the EV transition in GM & Ford because its political points for going green, supporting century-old American companies, and supporting jobs in Michigan (which is a swing state).\n\nIt's impossible to know what Biden actually thinks about Tesla without asking him directly, which nobody has done yet.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe.
