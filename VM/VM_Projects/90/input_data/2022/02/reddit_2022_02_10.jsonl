{"title": "The big difference between 2022, 2020, and 2008. Are we fuk?", "selftext": "Let‚Äôs all hop on the retard train back to the 2008 housing crisis.\n\nBanks were retards. The Government was like it‚Äôs okay retard bankers. We understand you‚Äôre retards but you tried your best. Here‚Äôs a bailout check and we‚Äôre raising interest rates a bunch so you fuckers stop handing out housing loans to everyone. After a year and a half the market started getting back on track and moving up again.\n\nThen we look at the Covid recession. That shit lasted literal weeks. Everyone was super scared, but then these COVID powerhouse stocks started carrying the market. After Covid recession we saw a solid fucking bull run where if you lost money in the market you literally had to be retarded (no offense to the retards who lost money in 2020). The point is that this was in no way a typical recession. 2008 crash was nothing like 2020.\n\nThen we look at whatever the fuck is happening now. I‚Äôm not claiming to be a goddamn messiah and an all knowing fucking Da Vinci ass. And this post is probably going to piss you off because I‚Äôm not going to pick a side. Fuck you bulls and fuck you bears. You can make money playing both sides. The purpose of this is to explain what the fuck is happening and might happen soon.\n\nJerome Powell is not ***THAT*** retarded. He has a better sense of the economy than any of you fuckers. There‚Äôs a reason he was on the fed throughout Obama, Trump, AND Biden . If you can‚Äôt accept that he is slightly less retarded than us, fuck your feelings he can do what he wants.\n\nHe knows if he said the economy is going to shit, people would panic sell the market. His job is literally judged based on how the economy is doing. Do you think he wants this shit to crash? No. He has a fucking money printer, who doesn‚Äôt want that fucking job. That shit sounds way better than what I do.\n\nDuring the last fomc meeting, he basically said a bunch of nothing. Everything he said we expected. The reason why it was so bad is because he was completely ambiguous. He said we‚Äôre going to raise rates and we don‚Äôt know by how much or when.\n\nThis caused a lot of uncertainty. If he said, I think things are looking really fucking shitty‚Ä¶ buckle up retards. There would be a huge sell off.\n\nInstead his goal is to release bad news slowly so that we see a more moderate crash over a longer period of time. This is assuming that things continue to go to shit. If we see inflation go down, employment numbers get on track, and the economy overall is looking healthy again, this will likely be short lived. However, if it keeps going the way it‚Äôs going, prepare for fuk.\n\nTl;dr\nGo learn how to read and come back and read the fucking post retard", "id": "sowlkl", "created_utc": 1644464565.0, "score": 152, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|23|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sowlkl)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sowlkl)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This made me laugh.

{"title": "Classic WSB - Real DD - CRM $25K YOLO", "selftext": "Hey all you shitstains,\n\nI am an OG WSB and made an absolute fortune on that gaming company in December of 2019 right after Keith Gill on youtube. I have never been more convinced of another play as much as I have then... until today.\n\nSalesforce (NYSE: CRM) is an underpriced juggernaut that is poised for a huge, huge earnings on March 1st.\n\nFundamentals are staggering.\n\nEvery single quarter they exceed their targets, never a single quarter SINCE IPO in 2004 have they failed to grow. That is 79 quarters of growth, guess what, add Slack and Tableau acquisitions and guess what, it is going to grow again. But the street doesn't appreciate it all that much right? Last four ERs, -15% price drop, 3%, 3% and a 9% drop - so why is this different? Well they exceed targets, but this one is going to smash every expectation. Street says 0.75 but my heart says this will look more like August and 1.48 - nearly doubling expectations. And the stock price will balloon upwards to $250-$260 area, but also add in the fact that their 12-month performance is -8% versus similar companies like Adobe have gained 3%. So add a little extra on that for a like to like comparison.\n\nCompare its assets to its share price - $155 on 1/31/19 with $30.7B in assets versus 1/31/21 and $66B (more than 2X) and its share price, $230ish (even over the current price).\n\nCompare what it is doing with its debt to help bolster its tangible book value - $680M on 1/1/19 to $11B on 1/1/21 or 16X its actual, real value. And debt went from $3.1B to $6.2B (2X) or put another way, every time they spent a buck, they made 8.\n\nPrice to sales improving every quarter, PEG dropping, debt to equity 1/3 lower than like-to-like (Adobe), I could go on and on. This is a powder keg. Add in more dumbass analysts (33 on TipRanks that I use) and their PT average is $333.\n\nBonus X Factor: The leak of the NFT marketplace is massive. Given their huge ties to Shopify, Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, etc - they can eliminate the duplicate market for their clients, a $160B a year industry. Buy underwear, don't care. Buy Air Jordan, get an NFT for $1 verifying authenticity - poof, pure HYPE beast type stuff.\n\nTLDR: Mirror my play, make 10:1, PT is $274\n\nPOSITIONS: 230 260C 3/18 (yes this is a $25K YOLO) - photo attached as well for proof.", "id": "spho70", "created_utc": 1644528733.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|132|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=spho70)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=spho70)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Puts for march you say?", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "Seems legit.
