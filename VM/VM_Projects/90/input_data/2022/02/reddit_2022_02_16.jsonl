{"title": "The Meta verse is the inevitable future. The tech just has to catch up.", "selftext": "It seems silly right now, but that's only because VR is in its infancy. All we have are clunky immobile headsets that let us into a clearly artificial world. There's no real value to that. The novelty wears off quite quickly once you realize the limitations and how cumbersome it is.\n\nBut, once VR reaches the point of full realism, including haptic feedback realism, it will be the inevitable future. Imagine lying down in a pod and being transported into whatever world you can imagine. Millions of people would line up to escape the bullshit that is their real life. \n\nNot only that, the possibilities become endless. You could escape night, and only live in the day, or vice versa, for example.\n\nImagine VR brothels. No risk of infection or anything else, and conceivably you could bang literally anyone you wanted as many times as you wanted.\n\nThe Meta verse makes perfect sense as the future for most people. There won't be much left to do once AI is in charge of most tasks. The technology just needs to catch up.\n\nGo to work. Come home. Bust a meta nut. Bedtime. Repeat. \n\nRight now, we're just stuck with groping VR cartoon pandas.\n\nEdit to add: Holy shit, how many illiterate apes can one sub contain? Let me clear some things up since most of you can't read.\n\n1. Nobody said this is happening tomorrow or that you should load up on meta stock and calls. I thought it was implied and clear that the technology is very far away. But as usual, short sighted apes gonna read into what I wrote.\n\n2. The whole point is that the headsets are useless, which is why the meta verse seems useless. The technology is currently unattractive, but that doesn't mean the actual virtual universe isn't where the world is heading. So if your problem is the headset, then you're agreeing with me.\n\n3. All you idiots who \"prefer real life\" are taking time out of your day to anonymously comment on a stranger's post on the internet. You all have social media. You all watch porn and stroke yourselves senseless. You all spend hours on YouTube, Netflix, etc... You don't prefer real life.
