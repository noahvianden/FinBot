Tech stocks were oversold, as were finTech stocks.\n2. Capital will be fleeing markets in Russia and Ukraine, looking for a safe harbor in the USA.\n3. Given the disruption to global economics due to the war, the Fed is less likely to *dramatically* raise borrowing costs, which is very helpful to the outlook of our highly leveraged tech growth sector.  Dramatically increased borrowing costs were priced in for these highly leveraged companies, and now that outlook is tempered.\n4. ARKK invests heavily in FinTech and Pharmaceutical companies (outside of their largest holdings in $TSLA) and is *relatively* insulated from supply chain shocks caused by the war.\n\nI'm just piling into $ARKK stock.  Hoping to see it return to the supports in the low $90s that it had in December. I bought in at $63, and it is up to $70 today.  \n\n**MY POSITION:**  39 shares OF $ARKK @ a cost of $2,525 (been accumulating shares as I become more confident) and one long call dated March 18 with a strike of $74.", "id": "t3pzhh", "created_utc": 1646082496.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "As someone who got burned to a crispy bacon by ark in March last year.
