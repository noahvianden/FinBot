{"title": "Ford will sell Rivian as soon as IPO lockup expires. Q4 Earning Call.", "selftext": "1. Rivian is treated as \"marketable securities\" on Ford's balance sheet, as opposed to \"long term investments\". This means Ford has no intentions to hold Rivian for the long haul. In fact on slide 20 of Ford's Q4 Earnings presentation, it categorize its Rivian holdings worth $10.6B as \"Liquidity\". We know a company's liquidity needs to be reliable and readily available in time of need. Holding Rivian shares is not the best way to maintain this liquidity.\n2. During the earning call, analyst from JPM asked about what Ford will do with its high cash balance at $36.5B and whether Ford will sell its Rivian stake. Company said there are opportunities for acquisitions in the EV supply-chain. Given current elevated valuations for EV-related targets, Ford will certainly need to put up cash in the billions for a potential acquisition. More the reason it will sell Rivian shares to generate cash.\n3. Also the company flat out ignored the analyst's question about its Rivian stake and immediately moved on to the next question. If Ford is confident in its Rivian investment, it will surely comment positively on any future collaborations or Rivian's long-term prospects. It didn't. By ignoring the question, the company is saying its answer to the first half the question also applies to its Rivian stake, i.e. need to use cash for acquisition.\n\nFord owns around 100M shares ($10.6B/$103.69 on 12/31/2021) or 11% of total shares outstanding, imagine if they come out and say they will sell Rivian when lockup expires in May 2022, this overhang will scare current holders into selling before then driving down the value of its Rivian stake. (The $10.6B stake already dropped to $6.6B since the end of last year.)\n\nPositions: Various Jun22 Put Spreads on RIVN\n\nEarning call link: [https://services.choruscall.com/links/f220203qy3oyHse.html](https://services.choruscall.com/links/f220203qy3oyHse.html)\n\nEdit: I am short RIVIAN not FORD.", "id": "sk4024", "created_utc": 1643948391.0, "score": 268, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sk4024)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sk4024)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't disagree with your conclusion or points 2 and 3, but GAAP requires publicly traded equity securities to be recorded at fair value and therefore categorized as \"marketable securities\" and F is precluded from putting those in \"long term investments.\" So that classification is meaningless.", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for pointing that out!", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "You're taking this 40mm-sized hole in your DD very well.", "score": 145, "replies": [{"body": "It's just a flesh wound", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "Tis but a scratch.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I knaw your spreads off!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Mk19 level feedback.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "...it'll buff right out.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't see it as a huge hole in the DD.

I have seen other companies record publicly traded stock holdings as equity investment in non-current assets. For example, Bill Foley's Cannae Holdings, it holds a bunch of publicly trade companies, and those holdings show up as equity investment at fair value in non-current assets (same as long term investments), as opposed to marketable securities in current assets.
