Washington and Brussels have so far refused to make such pledges.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz was expected in Moscow later on Tuesday to meet President Vladimir Putin in a high stakes mission to avert war.", "id": "ssyn76", "created_utc": 1644915441.0, "score": 213, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "A reminder to everyone, please focus on how this is going to affect a specific stock or the stock market in general.\n\nIf your comment is pushing political agendas, memes, insults, trolling, etc then your comment is going to get removed and/or get you banned.\n\nIf you *have* to discuss just the politics, then post this topic to r/PoliticalDiscussion without linking back to r/stocks, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Based on that experience only, I am going to try to demystify Palantir's business case a bit by explaining how the tool works.\n\nFoundry, at its core, is from a class of tools that perform ETL, Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data. But Foundry is unique in class and, potentially, profitability because of the way it unifies diverse solutions and functionalities into a single platform.\n\nFoundry integrates disparate data sources. By itself, that functionality is not special. Data engineers still have to write SQL, R, and Python code to perform their data integrations and transformations. That said, Foundry has a notebook environment paired with version control that really eases the data manipulation process and adds an aspect of community participation to sharing data-related code.\n\nFoundry offers drag-and-drop tools to empower users who are not data experts, but are subject matter experts in their field, to manipulate data. Though, to some extant, this drag-and-drop functionality is a bit overstated. Ultimately, implementing Foundry effectively require data engineering competency.\n\nFoundry has a ton of native functionality. Users can build visualizations (similar to Tableau or PowerBI), and applications (though, in my opinion, this functionality can stand to be matured). Foundry can integrate with identity access management solutions, like Okta. Foundry exposes data to authorized consumers via API. Foundry is hosted on AWS, so you can literally compile, build, and deploy solutions on the platform. And then configure views so that users access the tools on the Foundry platform relevant to their business need.\n\nIn other words, Foundry is basically a combination of Jupyter Notebooks, Spark GraphX, Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, Visual Studio, git, SQL Server Management Studio, and a handful of other tools, consolidated and built on top of an Apache Spark infrastructure.\n\nFoundry is really effective in the way it visualizes data lineage and pipelines. Users can click on a data source and review metadata, the health of the data connection, when the schema was last manipulated; all sorts of information helpful for the user to understand the fidelity of the ingested data sets.\n\n**Foundry is really strong in the way that it documents data models and relationships. And, here, I think is Foundry's real beauty, in both the functionality it provides, and the value proposition for investors. I'll provide an example:**\n\nLet's say that use-case #1 requires elements of data from six different data sources. Model those data sets out and merge them together to produce a data output that is applicable for use-case #1.\n\nUnforeseen use-case #2 comes along. Often, when it does, the Foundry user discovers that the data model implemented for use-case #1 can serve as the foundation for the data connections needed for use-case #2.\n\nRepeat this process over and over as use-cases accumulate. Before long, Foundry has documented and mapped the organization's entire data architecture. The Foundry user can then start performing advanced functionality, developing data ontologies and taxonomies, building out AI/ML models, etc. At this point, Palantir has grown to become the enterprise's \"digital twin\" - i.e., indispensable.\n\nPalantir enters an organization via a single use-case at a manageable price point, is awesome at what it does, so exploits that use-case and then grows. And grows and grows. Such growth that eventually Palantir has leveraged negotiating power when contract renewal comes up.\n\nI have zero affiliation with Palantir other than being a user. But I'm a huge advocate for the company. For no reason other than its product performs remarkably well at what it does. Opponents of Palantir that I am aware of are skeptical of handing so much data responsibility to a vendor. But, to me, this isn't anything different than the delegation that enterprises hand to SalesForce and similar CRM/ERP providers. My thought is that Palantir is better at data than my own organization will ever be, so its a capability worth paying for.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "This is a worthwhile DD post tbh sir.
