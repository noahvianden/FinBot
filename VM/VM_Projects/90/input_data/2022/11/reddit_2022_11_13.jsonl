{"title": "My bullishness just evaporated", "selftext": "Yes my doomer blah blah is coming out and no I don’t have any positions yet since I only just realized this by getting caught up on current events. No this isn’t advice but looking for confirmation bias from the most hairbrained community I know. Yes mods, I now it’s about the forbidden currencies but my point is about the actual market.\n\nPSA: I’m pretty sure 🌽 currencies  are about to crash the stock market. I could very easily be wrong but the market is in the process of de-hedging because of a rumored FED pivot due to inflation coming down. The VIX and the VVIX (volatility indexes) are breaking down into bullish falling wedges. The market just had two of the craziest gains since 2008.\n\nReason why I think we will crash. FTX is a major grypto player who is going bankrupt as we speak. There is news all over for this so I won’t elaborate there. What is important is that large hedge funds and banks have been pushing for grypto ETFs and the like so investors could diversify into grypto. These ETFs, hedge funds, and the like are all about to experience a massive drop in the value of these grypto currencies.\n\nThis is exactly like 2007-2008 where the bankers created a bunch of financial products based on mortgages (supposedly stable) and the riskiness of it all caused a major meltdown. the globe has already seen an evaporation of $32 trillion and I’m pretty sure we’re about to see several more go. \n\nI’m looking at companies like COIN, GME, AMC, RIOT, MARA, and the like to be the ones to fall (yes, they are already down substantially).\n\nYou could say that grypto itself has already crashed with 🌽 being down so far from the high but it’s been relatively contained so far. We are only now in the process of uncovering how far the roots go.\n\nBe safe and God bless!\n\nTL:DR 🌽 and it’s brethren are about to take the stock market down with it.", "id": "yu4tu5", "created_utc": 1668353334.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|2962|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yu4tu5)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yu4tu5)\n    \n>TL;DR: The stock market is about to crash because of grypto", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lmao if the broader financial markets collapse because a scam sector is going down then we deserve it.
