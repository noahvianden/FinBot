{"title": "That VIX launch that occurred yesterday in the midst of a green market is a specific pattern that has foretold of major volatility increase and an imminent SPY drop in each previous occurrence. (7 for 7.)", "selftext": "Back again with anotha one. For those who haven't seen my previous posts or didn't happen to catch this happening yesterday. (Tue-11/8)   This VIX burst climb started yesterday afternoon and the conditions that it began under has become somewhat of an established pattern with a perfect 7 for 7 in predicting an imminent SPY drop and significant volatility increase within 2 trading days of being observed.\n\n**EDIT: Thanks everyone who followed me in on this and for your messages & gold!  Glad so many of us made out well today on this read.     Fun is just getting started imo**\n\n[ 11:30am on 11\\/8- with SPY at +1.7&#37; VIX climbed from 24.24 to 26.16 in 3.5 hours with several large integer leaps. ](https://preview.redd.it/l6c6l0flsvy91.png?width=1791&format=png&auto=webp&s=7123fecda786ee2636cc920667e27b796c9e76e2)\n\nWas actually half expecting this VIX release to begin this time around so I had already bought my UVXY calls on Friday.  It certainly appeared that we saw some market protective measures used on the morning of 10/13 as part of the Fed's plunge protection apparatus  The market full on fucking crashed that morning with SPY hitting 346 (-4.5%) immediately out of the gates before going on a completely normal face ripping rampage for the entire rest of the day.\n\nBut something else also happened that morning -- while SPY was still very red--you would have expected VIX to keep climbing somewhat aggressively as well or at the least be positively green... but instead it did this out of the gate:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[With SPY down -2.5&#37;  on 10\\/13--VIX collapses straight down and went negative.](https://preview.redd.it/p4u8mxeqsvy91.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0902a773b44331851cae254c7d066eaf53c72c3)\n\nThat was 3 weeks ago, I've been waiting patiently since then for it to start leaking or showing cracks as a result, and it started to do that mid day last Friday which then led to the VIX spike behavior seen yesterday.\n\n>*When the VIX spike begins you would witness an almost vertical launch formation and price climb start to happen in just minutes.  It will skip entire intervals of numbers per second ie. 11.2 -- 11.3 -- 11.8 --- 12.1 etc.  As the climb is forming  the market goes into a state of paralytic shock and most every index starts to decline and sell off immediately in response.  The rogue price jump is always such that it went against the ongoing sentiment and movement of the live market and currently trending VIX direction, (large percentage jumps occurring in the midst of a green market) which defied implicit behavior tendencies.*\n\nThis \\^ specific VIX price behavior has signaled a major market volatility increase being forthcoming within the next two trading days (\\~+20%). If history repeats for a seventh time then VIX upward pressure will be evident by mid day Wednesday with the price squirming, by Thursday SPY will have fatigued out and will start to foreshadow the next pullback as VIX starts trying to release towards EOD.\n\n**UVXY weekly calls are dicey to hold at times but will pay out this week and next if entered mid day on Weds., Open SPY/index Puts for around next week expiry when (if) you see the SPY plateau start to fatigue before Thursday. Much of the VIX movement in the past has taken place in PM and AH.**\n\nPOSITIONS:\n\nUVXY 9c/9.5c 11/18\n\nSPY 380P 11/11\n\nGood luck in your trades, don't bet more than you can risk and take profits cause this market is wild.\n\n**TLDR:  The tape and glue that the fed has employed as a means to prop up a sickly market will spring a leak occasionally giving you a glimpse at how bad of shape the boat is in-- the day before it takes on water.   An unintentional side effect of the Feds efforts in suppressing volatility to protect the markets has berthed a type of early warning alarm that seems to go off in the days before giving you a chance to get a head of it with your trades.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Previous Posts:*  \n>  \n>[Pt. 1 - (4/20/22)](https://i.imgur.com/RAoVAtq.jpg)  \n>  \n>**The rogue VIX spike that leaked out today to spark that morning sell-off has happened three other times since Corona on green market days. In all three other instances the spike has been followed by a 20% volatility increase within two trading days afterwards.**  \n>  \n>I started to notice a pattern related to the rogue VIX spikes that will appear completely out of nowhere to cause market sell-offs before getting pushed back down by the Fed to keep the markets healthy.   In the three other times that these have suddenly leaked out on green market days, there has been a VIX increase of 18-20% occur within 2 trading days afterwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>[Pt. 2 - (4/21/22)](https://i.imgur.com/LEXcCUz.jpg)  \n>  \n>**Update: That rogue VIX spike appearing the middle of a green market yesterday has foretold of major volatility increase 4 times now.**  \n>  \n>Update to my post yesterday:  I recognized something behind the scenes during trading yesterday that I had only observed 3 other times since the corona recovery began.  A  rogue VIX spike anomaly that seemingly leaks out mid day during an otherwise healthy, green market.  It appears briefly enough to disrupt the entire market momentarily before getting smothered back down minutes later.     It has only ever happened 3 other times to us during a green market, in that manner and had been followed immediately by a major volatility crash to the market.  \n>  \n>It would  now seem this is somewhat of an undeniable feature, not a glitch as It has now happened 4 times under those exact conditions and every single time it has foretold us that a major volatility increase about to take place within the markets.\n\n[Pt. 3 - Volatility, Suppression and Pattern ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xlwd2n/that_vix_spike_earlier_this_week_hasforetold_of_a/)\n\n>Previous Post:  *^((VIX 19- SPY 445)**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*)*  \n>  \n>**Pt. 3 - Volatility, Suppression and Patterns**  \n>  \n>Here's my assessment of the situation, how I picked up on the strange pattern and what I have concluded might be happening and why this would occur-- First let's get you caught up to what VIX even is:  \n>  \n>**The Volatility Index (VIX), measures investors confidence of market health and signals the level of fear or stress in the stock market—using the indexes as a proxy for the broader market—and hence is known as the “Fear Index.” --The higher the VIX, the greater the level of fear and uncertainty in the market, because of this a major increase to VIX will cause markets to systematically sell off in computerized responsive trading.**  \n>  \n>You can start to gather from this relationship as to why VIX climbing unchecked at every COVID news update could be problematic to an already tense market in recovery.  The Federal Reserve recognized this importance as well and set in motion a plan to prevent it from continuing to repeat itself.   By June of 2020 it was apparent that the monthly volatility cycles were upending investors and was going to spiral into a larger full blown crash.   As part of the Fed's recovery outline, a market recovery team was to be created, affectionately known to us as the plunge protection team.   Their algos began to routinely show themselves during trading to prop up the major indexes and provided price support to entire sectors worth of companies stock so our then feeble markets didn't appear outwardly sick in what became known to many as fed pump mornings (fed pumps, money printer go brr etc.).    This set in motion a dangerous policy of the Reserve algorithmically suppressing VIX to clamp it down and in the process engineer false market confidence to prevent skittish investors from fleeing the markets at the first sign of trouble.  \n>  \n>All of these efforts were unprecedented, it gave them a level of access and control to our financial markets that had never been seen and the unbridled ability to dictate much of the narrative driving the perception of our recovering economy. From that point on an all out market protection war to save us from ourselves was put underway.  And it worked, a little too well.  It led to one of the strongest continuous bull markets in modern history and set the stage for that V-Shaped recovery that we were so promised.. but at what cost?   The cost of lying to the markets, falsely propping it up with strings and cheating volatility as a means to suppress the truth of how bad the situation really was to everyone.  And in the process enticing confident investors to pile into positions with margin debt at levels never before seen.  \n>  \n>***\"The suppression of volatility creates a debt to the market that must be paid.\"***  \n>  \n>It was in these efforts of market control and suppression that myself, and others, began to notice cracks leaking out that could not be explained.   The exaggerated mid-day price movements into end of day collapses, pump like market behavior, inexplicable micro-crashes that dotted the recovery at every few month intervals, and of course the questionable manipulation of VIX that seemingly defied all market health indicators.  \n>  \n>To truly understand why these rogue  \"spike\" movements jumped out at me you must understand that VIX has very unique price pattern tendencies and normally travels very naturally under live trading and has reactionary impulses that correspond to the current market health ie. climbs during red markets, movement that will typically begin gradually while following a back and forth tug and pulling both directions before the next linear climb or drop interval starts.  \n>  \n>The rogue price jump was always such that it went against the ongoing sentiment and movement of the live market and currently trending VIX direction, (large percentage jumps occurring in the midst of a green market) which defied implicit behavior tendencies.  In addition there was always an immediate and successful attempt to crash the spike back down to regain market stability for the day to calm peoples nerves before giving the market the full VIX dose over the trading days immediately afterwards.  \n>  \n>**Why it matters?**  \n>  \n>In the past when we have observed this behavior under healthy green markets, it has signaled the point at which the markets are about to incur the volatility debt that the Fed has been sparing us from through their market control measures.  \n>  \n>It will be slowed down and even dialed back for periodic intervals to maintain stability and produce green markets, but its' climb will likely persist as the pressure it creates is released in a controlled manner.  Which I do not believe has fully happened, in spite of the pain this past week has wrought.  \n>  \n>The Fed is in a tightening cycle for inflation control whilst slowing the onset of a recession. They are going to continue reducing their trillion dollar asset debt that they accumulated in the wake of pumping through the corona recovery markets. The result will be the very indexes they propped up for so long continuing to bleed back resulting in a VIX that will continue to reject downward control.\n\n[Pt. 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vky4ab/the_vix_spike_that_leaked_out_on_friday_has/) \\- 6/24/22\n\n>**The VIX spike that leaked out on Friday has foretold of a major volatility increase being imminent in each of the previous occurrences (4/4).**  \n>  \n>I've [posted about this](https://i.imgur.com/HFlaEZa.jpg) bizarre early warning phenomenon a few times before, in the past this specific VIX price behavior has signaled a major market volatility increase being forthcoming within the next two trading days (\\~+20%). If history repeats for a fifth time then VIX upward pressure will start to be evident by mid day Monday with the price squirming, by Tuesday SPY will fatigue out and foreshadow the next pullback while VIX starts to release up by EOD.  \n>  \n>EDIT: Monday played out almost exactly as expected\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psc3w4gzsvy91.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2bbaa7e47fecd6f951ea9252cab02a7a3ec2405\n\n[Pt. 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xlwd2n/that_vix_spike_earlier_this_week_hasforetold_of_a/)  \\- 9/21/22\n\n>**That VIX spike earlier this week hasforetold of a major volatility increase and imminent SPY drop in each previous occurrence, 6/6.**  \n>  \n>Anyone else catch this when it happened? This is that VIX spike behavior that I've posted about several times in the past. This spike occurring during a green market has become a trading indicator that I picked up on awhile back that has proven to be extremely reliable in signaling when to enter SPY puts and UVXY calls. (6 for 6 as of today) The SPY drop and VIX climb in premarket today is proving once again this is absolutely a feature worth paying attention to. I do not believe we've seen the worst of this round. SPY is going to push right through 365 *(currently 371.5\\*\\*)* between now and Monday on its way to 355 by 10/7 and VIX will break 30 by Mon on its way to 33-35..
