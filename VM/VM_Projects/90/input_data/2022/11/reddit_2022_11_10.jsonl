Except, the listings suck because there's different numbers  (3M VHB tape) yet none of the listings tell me which model the tape is. Affects temperature and surface adhesion types. It's important, but whatever. It's also weirdly low reviews so I start reading. Maybe they got the wrong type considering none tell you product line info and are all in broken English.\n\nI'm looking and people say it's clearly been repackaged, doesn't have the markings from 3M, doesn't stick to anything, etc. I'm thinking, there's a black market for knock-off tape?! So I scroll through and go, okay, I don't want to redo this project if my tape fails and melts in 6 months. Nope. I need high heat, hence VHB tape.
