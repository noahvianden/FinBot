They’re not even cheaper than humans AFAIK, there’s a reason why all but most sophisticated companies keep employing humans - and that’s not because they love to give out sick leaves and paid vacations\n\nAnd here’s the problem with Tesla Bot - it solves wrong problem. Making balancing 2-legged robot does not make it more precise, doesn’t make it stronger and doesn’t make it more consistent. Tesla would make much better to the world if they simply put their superb AI vision tech to use and focused on grabbing robot only - mount that grabbing arm on top of Amazons Kiva and there you are, you solved a problem that requires few dozen of millions people employed worldwide. Will Tesla solve it? I doubt it, I’m pretty sure Amazon Robotics works on this for decade already with no results, but obviously Teslas AI capability might be better so we’ll see\n\nBut then going back to the topic - walking robot?

Plenty of techs enter the space with A LOT of hype and hopes.\n\nThe Internet. The computer. The automobile. The microwave oven. The quadrocopter. Who has ever said \"it'll never work\"?\n\nI don't know why you're not accepting a simple reality that this just *does* look like a hype - I'd gladly live to be proven wrong, but I just find it unlikely. Tesla Bot sounds like a toy bought by a multi-billionaire known for liking to buy stupidly expensive toys (have you heard about Twitter? :) ). Elon as many geeks probably thought that robots are cool. They are. But are they useful? That's a completely different story.\n\nAs for you post:\n\n\"More mobile\" - more mobile than what? A vehicle on tracks? Conveyor belt? As humanity we built plenty of devices that prove that humans are not really mobile. My car is way more mobile than myself, seems that rotating wheels can make device go faster than walking, eat that nature! Tracked vehicle has more grip. Conveyor belt is more energy efficient. What exactly is walking robot better with that would justify paying more (both in terms of upfront $$$ cost and machine complexity which translates to maintenance cost)\n\n\"Smaller footprint\" - not sure what you mean by that, but anyway I've never heard of \"big footprint\" to be any kind of a problem in the industry. And then I'm pretty sure in a factory or an airport nothing beats and will beat conveyor belts for next centuries. Even if Tesla Bot could fly it will likely *still* be less efficient than moving stuff over conveyor belts.\n\n\"Multiple/endless tasks\" - as I said, the actuators (robot \"hands\" if you like) would be very smart thing to build. Yes, solving vision and \"hands\" will be great invention. But then I'm pretty sure they will be mounted on flying drones or tracked vehicles - why? Because they're more mobile and more efficient. The only thing I can think of that walking solves (over tracked vehicles) is walking on stairs. But I've never heard of an industry that would ever say \"I wish our industrial robots could walk the stairs\". It just doesn't make sense, the problem of vertical movement is already solved well with elevators. Maybe the Search and Rescue operations could use it - but I believe it's already handled by Boston Dynamics and I just suspect that having robot \"walking\" on 4 legs will be better (just based on nature - 4-foot animals are more agile than 2-legged humans, 2-legged humans just save a bit on energy - important for biological creatures but is that relevant for robot?)", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Either your contradicting yourself massively or I’m miss understanding what you’re trying to say.

It can move in any direction while taking up virtually no space, speed is the only disadvantage to conveyor or wheels. To argue wheels are more mobile is completely ignoring everything outside of speed. \n\nSmaller footprints are critical to efficiency in factories. what’s better, a factory that makes 10 cars within 1000sq/f or one that makes 10 cars within 100sq/f ? Obviously the smaller factory with the same output, put that same design on a larger Footprint and you know have the same size footprint with a larger output. This should be obvious. \n\nThese robots will hypothetically be doing dangerous jobs, mobility it huge for this.

It's also the size of a human adult, so expect it to take up a fair amount of space in your home. There are also privacy concerns associated with bringing in a machine like this into your home, and I think many people will be put off by that. What will it be able to do to offset all those expenses? We already have appliances that can take care of a bulk of household labour and are orders of magnitude cheaper. It would be nice to not have to load/unload the dishwasher, washer and dryer, but is that enough? And how would it even do these things? It'd have to be able to locate things like detergent and bleach. You'd have to be able to tell the bot what can go in the dryer, what goes on the drying rack. Where do you want your clothes and dishes to go when they're dry? Every household has special requirements for exactly how all these tasks need to be done, but how would users be able to communicate this to the robot?\n\nFor me, at the very least, a robot like this would have to be able to go outside for me to even begin considering buying one for >$20K.

Also, we may very well have things like automated grocery services provided by other companies by the time Optimus becomes commercially viable, so what value does it really add at that price tag?
