The system will eventually need to be able to determine when it sees an unexpected road whether that road is an acceptable path or not. It will have to do that similar to how people do that. Such as looking at signs or other visible cues to make that determination. Once it does that, of course it can share its learned knowledge with the rest of the system to update the map on the fly but it cannot be a prerequisite that the road is necessarily mapped first for the system to safely and smartly navigate it.
