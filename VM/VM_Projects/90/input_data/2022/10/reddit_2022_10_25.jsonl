This squeezes their margins.\n\nOther than that, the biggest growth in cost of revenue was costs associated with data centres and \"other operations\" followed by hardware costs.\n\nR&D increased substantially - up something like 30% to 10billion but then \"G&A\"  (general and administrative) also increased which is about as vague as you can get.

Netflix got their foot in the door by accurately surmising it would take Warner and Disney at least a decade to transition to the inevitable on-demand model.
