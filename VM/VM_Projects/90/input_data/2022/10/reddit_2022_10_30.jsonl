Around november 2021 my stock was up to like 140k, but right now its at 90k, and that huge dip is kind of scaring me, since many people are saying we are going into a recession or a market crash or whatever. I know the general advice for these things is to just hold long term and wait until things eventually go back up, but in my situation I will need to sell like 40k minimum in the next few years, and I'm not sure if I should just wait and do that when I need it, or sell some now in case it keeps going down and is even lower when I need it.

Well somehow the idea of a 50 point hike next meeting has creeped into the odds and especially over the last week went from 5% to 17.8%. 75 is still \"expected\" but its interesting to see a window open to this idea. \n\nThe next meeting calls for 125-150 bps by the Dec meeting. The odds of 125 are going up while the 150 is going down. Well why is this and what does the market know that you don't? Lets start with the obvious: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgqaiyusgyw91.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=afd95fb2cf12131dae02f2c184c1c0f1aff47d4e\n\nSee that initial 6% rise and 8% crash? Thats the market being under the impression the fed is doing two 75bps hikes in a row. But something happened on the CPI day (the big green bar there). The CPI report was not good. It did not show CPI came down. They told you the market was \"oversold\" and \"due for a bounce\". But narratives are always built after the price action was decided. \n\nWell lets keep in mind the date the CPI report was posted \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Oct 13 for the smooth brain](https://preview.redd.it/6ntp5dqfhyw91.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=1021a7ef90945a09b36465e209ef329f9eba543c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na03sgbyhyw91.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=7499aa88531f652c774b0977b4d41737a3a801e9\n\n\"Last Friday\" was Oct 14th, the day after the CPI report was posted and the market retreated back, only to close higher and never return to this level again. How long does it take to setup a meeting? 24 hours? Whoever bought up the CPI day simply knew something we all don't. Then word gets out after the Friday meeting and the market only gets bought up. \n\nThey know the fed's next meeting before its even occurred. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pl1sbwo5jyw91.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=1863e87751ef465b2d537d8119cf729962aa67e8\n\nIf you knew the fed was going to get all flowery and use some fancy pivot language the market can interpret as bullish and run with, you would buy everything up too, especially at those beautiful lows we had. \n\nTo those paying attention, the fed is basically telling you without telling you all the way back on the 21st: \n\n [Fed's Daly: Time to start talking about slowing interest-rate hikes - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-daly-wants-to-start-talking-about-step-down-in-super-sized-pace-of-interest-rate-hikes-11666372382) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pywq80kojyw91.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a5f14a0deefb60d5ae1afbaed2d1bf5aeef315\n\nThen the bank of Canada starting giving more credence to this idea. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgzj9zdwjyw91.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5de4271ea7676f82bba69e2ac09e3c667dd1dac\n\nSo the fed does a dovish meeting. The market can't rally that hard...right?  Wrong:  \n\n\n[July 25-Aug 23. First big green bar is the July 27 fed meeting](https://preview.redd.it/1n27swtdkyw91.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=e38b5ad34742acb1667c2928a807bf04ff583a3d)\n\nJust the broader market went on to rally a good 10% from the previous days level. So what if it did it again? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7c3ox000lyw91.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a04ee4d74cee0196525bad4614ec00a8bbace38\n\nWell to get back and re-test that Aug high, you would need an 11% rally (greater than the last one), thus it is already built out to fail making a higher high and simply fall back down again later. We have no idea what number they will send the market to in front of the meeting so we can't measure it out, but one thing we can deduce is that there is some extremely heavy volume with the market being low like it was. This indicates incredible interest at these price levels. AKA accumulation for the next move.  Now are all these accumulators just going to paper hands when they just got done buying tf out of the market? No. They are going to let the sneeze play out and let short coverings/you drive the market up after the fed meeting. \n\nWhat will they do with the prices in front of the meeting? Who honestly knows. Probably send the market down a lil and then show you some fancy charts about why it was \"overbought\" and blah blah blah just for you to witness the entire market up another 5% a week from now. Probably some profit takers and re buy ins in front of it is how itll go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA rally here into at least mid November makes sense also from the standpoint this is a strong seasonal period for stocks especially around midterms. It is highly unlikely JPOW is going to get up there and call for a 1 bps this meeting and next in front of something highly political like this. Besides, Powell is already getting political pressure now: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/azmg105onyw91.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=02ce6bda4affd768e17ecbd6d6cc99d6d6c68c4d\n\nWell here is how that all went down:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itz5j2stoyw91.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=007f6a54cf0f897f932b501aad6b377254c843f3\n\nYou can see the market was going through it heading into the mid terms. But some miracle occurred that put the crash on hold between the specific dates of Oct 29th and Nov 8th there was something special about that day. Who knows what that could have been about. I just have no idea! \n\nYou heard before \"Dec is a great time to buy stocks! Its so seasonally strong! The consumer can bench press $500k worth of debt and squat another $1 milly!\" \n\nThere's an old fashioned phrase in the game called exit liquidity. These banks all calling for a recession in 2023 are not wrong. But if you got caught flat footed (we know  some already did aka credit swiss\\*) then you need to pass your bags along because all that bully the market rhetoric from Powell caught you off guard and your bags are getting a little too heavy lately. Dec was perfect last hike cycle for exit liquidity, will probably be again. \n\nI lastly leave you with the beautiful game of guessssssssssssss that chart! Can you guess what caused it to run in the first place and why it stopped?
