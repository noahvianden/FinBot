{"title": "There is no bubble", "selftext": "That's right. You read it here first. I should be more specific though in that equities aren't in a bubble. I've seen charts showing our imminent economic demise, but what I haven't seen is anyone showing charts about the value of indices adjusted for the US Dollar Index ([DXY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index)) and the money supply ([M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)).\n\nI present to you two charts; the NDX and SPX adjusted for these two factors. How do we adjust for them? If the DXY goes up, this means your dollar is more valuable, so we multiply by it. JPow firing up the money printer means your dollar is worth less, so we divide by it.\n\n# NDX\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ai120eyuty091.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca942042de2ed1925c62dcbc235155da9a01bf4\n\nWe'll start with the NDX. From '87 to '00 this blew up. We're talking 2,502% over the course of over 12 years, with the vast majority of that happening in the second half of that period. From November '87 to May of '95, it increased by 178% and then went on to gain 836% from May '95 to March '00. That's fucking wild and it's definitely a bubble\n\nLooking from the bottom of the financial crisis forward you don't see the same characteristics. There's been an orderly increase that's fairly linear on a log scale and it grew at a much more modest rate. Comparing the CAGRs between the two periods shows that the adjusted NDX grew at about half the rate for the second period. It also hasn't even reached the ATH that was set during the tech bubble. We would need to see an adjusted increase of 93% to get there.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ai4hgrgvy091.png?width=309&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3410737872b5735a7d0206dbe1c2b35dedf9c74\n\n# SPX\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/06gu7u0yty091.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=e85967aebe3c9e6489ac28c9440a76d8e3a26fcb\n\nLooking at the SPX you see a very similar story, though decidedly less dramatic. Similar parabolic rally in the first period, fairly linear growth in the second. For this comparison I took it to its peak in December '21. The SPX hasn't even hit its adjusted peak from '20 just before the COVID crash let alone gotten anywhere near the ATH set in '00. To reach the prior ATH we would need an adjusted 95% increase. We're also barely above levels from '02 to '07 and we'd need a decline of about 4.5% to get to the peak in '07.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9s2mi881vy091.png?width=308&format=png&auto=webp&s=4277fdee81b42c36459329c70684dd83b4bb7006\n\n# Conclusion\n\nEquities aren't in a bubble. What we're seeing as far as increases in the NDX and SPX is largely driven by inflation. Does this mean the market won't go to shit? Probably not. There's a lot of other factors at play. Personally I don't see a full on 2008 meltdown happening, but anything's possible. My guess is we chop sideways for a year or so while the economy normalizes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm getting a bunch of questions on why I'm multiplying by DXY and dividing by M2SL. It's based on an assumed model for a given equity E of\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23fylpeykz091.png?width=394&format=png&auto=webp&s=d418df1b04173d5b4974ccb7ab5528d39fd62b79\n\nwhere \\`b1\\` and \\`b2\\` are positive and \\`e(t)\\` is an error term based on time. Rearranging it you get the following\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jyha3nfoz091.png?width=169&format=png&auto=webp&s=afb5ead1480067a2208042a7added19fc63d59d1\n\nI'm assuming DXY is negatively correlated with price as an increase in it creates a preference for cash.
