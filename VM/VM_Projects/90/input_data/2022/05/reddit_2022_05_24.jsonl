Of course premiums varies due volatility, earnings release, etc. so that's a rough estimate.\n\nThe $429 put premium could be better if the underlying shoots up higher than the OTM call price (and the call gets assigned or rolled up+out with little net credit).\n\nNot sure what you mean about rolling puts being less risky.

Zuckerburg does anything to make his vision a reality no matter what privacy boundaries he pushes. \n\nIn the early days of facebook Mark Zuckerburg would wander into the company bathrooms and if he noticed someone sitting down in the stalls he would pop his head over and try to talk to them about their projects. Or if he was taking a poop he would host an emergency meeting and he would tell them to come over and pop their head over the stall to talk it out.\n\nEveryone just went along with it because it was either YOLO SILICON VALLEY LMAO or they were just too intimidated.\n\nThat all stopped when Michael Moritz, legendary silicon valley investor, and one of Facebook biggest early investors and shareholders, was at the campus doing research for leading a 2nd round of funding. He was doing diligence all day and at one point had to poop and that's when Zuckerburg popped his head over with a smile to ask how's the diligence coming along.\n\nMichael Moritz, not one to mince words, was apoplectic. 'GET THE FUCK OUT HERE YOU IDiiOT LIZARD LOOKING FUCKER.' Mark Zuckerburg nervously tried to laugh it off and persisted, because he really loved intimate poop conversations 'Aw c'mon Michael, it's silicon valley'. Zuckerburg finally withdrew when Moritz flung his cellphone at him.\n\n30 minutes later, Mark was in a very import meeting when Moritz walked into the conference room. 'Everyone except Mark Zuckerburg, OUT'. As intimidated as they were of Zuckerburg, at the time Moritz was the bigger deal, and they all scurried out of the room.\n\nZuckerburg, however, is not one to be intimated by anyone. Not the Winkewoz twins, not Eduardo Savarn, not Peter Thiel, and not one of his biggest shareholder Michael Moritz. Zuckerburg passionately defended his practice, but Michael Moritz was having none of that. Moritz told him that it was a ticking PR and HR nightmare, and threatened to pull out of leading the 2nd round of funding if Mark continued, which would have been a catastrophe for the company.\n\nZuckerburg pretended to arbitrate 'Ok fine, but you need to give me a good reason, because if it were normal, there would be no problem'.\n\nMoritz was flabberghasted at this response. Was this a serious question? He answered with the most obvious answer 'Because.... it's not FUCKING NORMAL'.\n\nUnknown to Moritz, Zuckerburg had guessed a conversation like this would happen as soon as he was kicked out of the toilet stall, and began formulating a strategy to counter Moritz demands. Zuckerburg knew that Moritz would have all the leverage, but Zuckerburg was a master strategist.\n\nZuckerburg went for the pounce. 'Okay, I'll lets write out an agreement, in writing I'll rescind the policy because it's not normal'. Moritz was dumbfounded, but he was used to being dumbfounded by eccentric tech founders, afterall he was also an early investor in Apple, and he still found Zuckerburg tame compared to Steve Jobs. Moritz had a long day of work so they signed the agreement so that he could go back to doing his due diligence.\n\nWhen Moritz left, a broad grin spread across Zuckerburg's face. \" 'Not Normal' eh? \" Zuckerburg said with a menacing laugh. Ever since then, Mark Zuckerburg has been on a life-long crusade to normalize poop conversations.\n\nHe had a checklist of what he needed to accomplish in order to realize this. His advisors would tell him it's impossible, but one by one Zuckerburg checked off the list. From normalizing smart phone use on the toilet (actually a collaboration between Mark Zuckerburg and Steve Jobs), to trusting Mark with their private photos, to normalizing people giving up their internet browsing privacy.\n\nIn 2015, Zuckerburg knew he would hit a wall, having people watch you while you poop was still too much of a leap. That's when Zuckerburg decided to buy Occulus, and eventually shift his company towards virtual reality. If he could coax people into having life-like conversations while they were pooping in a virtual reality, then doing it in the real world wouldn't be too big of a leap.\n\nDo you read facebook or instagram while you're pooping? Ever consider what urges you to do that? It's not your personal preference, it's by Mark Zuckerburg's design.\n\nZuckerburg only has 3 more boxes to check off before poop conversations are normalized.\n\nMark Zuckerburg wants to watch you poop.\n\nAre you going to let him?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KVq4mMF.jpg\n\nEDIT, UPDATE\n\nI just got this in my DM. \n\n>I am a ex Facebook worker. Everything you said rings true. I speak to you at the risk of consequences for breaking my NDA. When I was at Facebook I was involved in a program called Project PooPal. Mark Zuckerburg was planning on Meta entering the exploding tele-therapy space, but targeting people who are not ready to talk to an actual person. You talk to a virtual reality therapist who responds with what is described as the greatest AI (though whatever you tell it, it only responds with 'wow, tell me more'). The thing is, the virtual reality assistant has a striking resemblance to Mark Zuckerburg himself. But the most damning aspect is that it's supposed to used only when you're pooping. This feature is described as optional, though uses the most advanced AI for your phone camera to check if you're actually on a toilet, and if not, says 'It looks like you're not pooping. Please start pooping and try again'. I always wondered what is the purpose and origin of the project.

{"title": "$DG (Dollar General) is not $WMT or $TGT and is poised to pop", "selftext": "Go long on $DG before they report earnings pre-open on Thursday 5/26.  Bad news is already priced in and it's reasonably likely that $DG will report healthy earnings and outlook sending the shares back toward pre-$WMT meltdown levels of $230/share.\n\nLast week, $DG took a dive when $WMT and $TGT reported disappointing results.  See nice colorful chart with numbers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$DG took a beating at every retail earnings announcement last week.](https://preview.redd.it/7zaz0dvlug191.jpg?width=2996&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ac06aca5f8d9067afd8080e865e0a598ea2fb91)\n\n$DG serves your mom, dad, aunts, uncles and fellow Wendy's associates in small town america (or urban America).  They are a neighborhood convenience store.  Here's how they describe themselves in their 10-K: \"providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs, supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items, at everyday low prices in conveniently located, small-box stores.\"  $DG is a no-frills shopping experience where average to poor people can pick up household goods inexpensively.  They don't own expensive real-estate or obsess over curb-appeal.  Most stores are run by a crew of 3.  They have very small stock rooms and manage their own logistics.\n\nWhy did $WMT and $TGT earnings crash the market?\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sales-rise-but-higher-costs-dent-profit-11652787631](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sales-rise-but-higher-costs-dent-profit-11652787631)\n\n* Summary: Higher food costs [prompted shoppers to shift their spending](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-pandemic-was-supposed-to-push-all-shopping-online-it-didnt-11650081652?mod=article_inline) away from general merchandise, eating into profits.  Inventory levels also rose too fast, said executives, causing Walmart to put more goods on sale.  Walmart’s (chose) to buy products aggressively amid supply-chain snarls and rising demand for some goods in past quarters. Product markdowns, when a retailer sells an item at a discount, were $100 million more than expected in the quarter.  Online buying behavior has shifted back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/target-earnings-squeezed-by-inflation-and-fuel-costs-11652869800](https://www.wsj.com/articles/target-earnings-squeezed-by-inflation-and-fuel-costs-11652869800)\n\n* Summary: Sales at the Minneapolis-based retailer (Target) increased in the most recent quarter as shoppers spent more on food and groceries.  On Wednesday, the company said earnings for the April quarter were hurt by higher markdown rates and inventory impairments, and lower-than-expected sales in those discretionary categories (kitchen appliances, television sets and furniture).  Target said that while some prices had risen, wider price increases would continue to be the last lever it would pull to improve profit because it was aware that its customers were seeking affordability.\n\n$DG is NOT LIKE $WMT or $TGT!  Why?\n\n1. The majority of $DG sales are from consumer essentials (75%).  Both $WMT and $TGT showed demand for these goods are up.\n2. $WMT and $TGT inventory woes are due to appliances, electronics and furniture.  $DG goods rarely exceed a $10 sticker price.  $DG is not paying for premium warehouse space to sit on TVs and furniture that they will mark down in the future, like $WMT and $TGT.\n3. $DG does not have a large online shopping infrastructure like $WMT and $TGT.  This means they won't see the pull back in online shopping and incremental costs like $WMT.  Let's be honest, $DG's customers shop online at $WISH (Calls on $WISH).\n4. $DG stores are located close to the consumer.  Their store placement is driven by getting close to where the consumer lives, works and goes to school.  If gas is too expensive, you can walk or ride your rascal to the local $DG.\n5. Both $WMT and $TGT are hesitant to raise prices on consumer essentials because they know their shoppers would just go to $DG who has very low operational costs and can afford to offer the lowest prices on these goods.\n6. Here's some real world DD.  Look what you can get from $DG for $20!  You can feed yourself for a few days here.  Take your earnings from Wendy's and go shop at $DG when you get tired of Chicken Nuggets.  \n\n[Feed your whole family for $20!](https://preview.redd.it/1bq14vpsyg191.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23447cd1497e0bb56cface540df55503e9f3ad75)\n\nThe receipts:\n\n[Go ahead and use the survey code.
