{"title": "Dumping my entire savings into chip stocks", "selftext": " Hello, I'm a 25 year old PhD student. I have 2-3 years left and make enough money from my stipend to live and save small amounts. I have that juicy intergenerational wealth, about 20k in my savings. I've gotten my toes wet with investing over the past two years, (had in about 3.5k but that's now 2.5k :) ). I want to go all in on chip stocks, but I'm not sure when to buy. I'm most attracted to intel because it has a dividend and is a safe-ish stock. But I also have a stake in nvidia, amd, and tsmc. I would like to increase my stake in all of these. What things should I take into consideration when buying these stocks during this crash?", "id": "ugzbcx", "created_utc": 1651524510.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|17 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ugzbcx)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ugzbcx)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Safe?

You're putting all your money and faith into a single industry that could very well change over the next few years. On top of that, diversification across a whole sector is not something intelligent investors do. You're better off narrowing your investment in semiconductors down to 1 or 2 companies that are showing more promise than the others. Take everything into consideration: growth prospects, diversity of income/revenue, PE ratio, trend, future plans, debt, etc.\n\nIntel is probably dead in the water, for example. I'd scratch that from the list immediately. TSMC is facing huge risk with the CCP. They're undervalued but that is for very good reason. In all likelihood, the US will probably expand their own semiconductor capacity in a big way over the next few years. That will take share away from a company like TSMC which, at the moment, manufactures 92% of the world's supply of chips.\n\nYou should probably dig deeper into the chip industry and make more informed decisions on which companies stand out to you. For my money, it's AMD and Nvidia, but that is reflected in higher prices too.\n\nJust be careful about putting all your eggs in one basket. Having a portfolio that spans multiple sectors is a very good idea, particularly in this fiduciary environment.

INTC has terrible sentiment in the market and its stock has taken a beating (good for cuurent buyers), and it has a low single digit PE, great revenue (multiples of its chip design competitors), and in an industry that is expanding over the decade. They are now spending billions a year on fabs and r&d. They didn't in years past and are paying the price now.

Definitely don't invest in the fabless companies with high PE priced to perfection (AMD, NVDA); those companies are reliant on China/Taiwan with massive geopolitical risk.
