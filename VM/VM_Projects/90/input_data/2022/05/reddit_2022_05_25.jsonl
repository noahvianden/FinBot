If the mortgages get paid, then investors get interest payments on the capital they put at risk.

So it's like a hedge for the bank that has those mortgages in its portfolio.\n\nThere are different tranches available depending on the risk that investors want to take on.  For the highest tranches, all the underlying mortgages would have to fail before the investor would lose money.  At the lowest tranche, only one of the underlying mortgages would have to fail.  The tranches have different yields depending on the level of risk involved.\n\nMBS's are popular because real estate is seen as a fairly safe underlying asset, and bundling several mortgages together provides some diversification as well.
