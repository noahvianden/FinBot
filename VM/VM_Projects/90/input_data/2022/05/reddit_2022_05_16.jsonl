I’m not looking to hold cash long term (which I haven’t said anyway). I am NOT holding cash as an investment. I am holding cash because I can see that the market sentiment has shifted to the downside and cash happens to be the medium of exchange to buy a stock….

Because the market for business & personal electronics was saturated in 2020 & 2021 due to the pandemic, that means the choice to upgrade/buy new in 2022 & 2023 will be mainly due to a trickle of new smartphone/computer users & people with a lot of discretionary income who like to upgrade to new shiny models even though they don't really need to. With inflation in electronics & the Fed tightening likely to cause recession there's not only a likely stiff drop in discretionary income but also maybe some hardship coming.
