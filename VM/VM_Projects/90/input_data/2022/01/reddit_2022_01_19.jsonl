Wednesday’s losses brought the index 10.7% off its most recent record close in November 2021.\n\nNasdaq’s pullback from its November high has been lead by growth stocks whose valuations ballooned during the pandemic. Shares of Peloton are off more than 80% from their highs. Zoom Video has shed about 65%. Moderna, DocuSign and Paypal have all tumbled significantly from their highs.\n\nThe rate spike has hit the tech-heavy Nasdaq disproportionately as tech stocks’ future earnings look less attractive when rates are on the rise. Tech companies also rely on low rates to borrow for investing in innovation.
