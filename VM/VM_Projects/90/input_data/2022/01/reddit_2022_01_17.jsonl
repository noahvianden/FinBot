Most companies that try to stretch vertically end up with mediocre results or just fail and that include fellow blue chips. With Amazon, it seems almost everything they touch turns to gold. This is probably what they have that others do not. Like him or not Bezos is extremely good at projecting future demand for products and services. He has very good vision and unlike most ego maniacs, knew when to step down which showed wisdom.\n\nBut to show how far they have come and how wide their breadth is: They started in retail and succeeded. Seeing they had retail and marketing, they used that to build their own electronics and sell those (Kindle). Using the tools they developed their digital distro, they developed their own server infrastructure and commercialized it (AWS). Once they had those services nailed down, they made even better electronics and started offering other tech services (streaming). Now they are using AWS for other things like developing robots (Astro), going into gaming (gaming division), improving delivery (internal delivery services) and even changing how retail is done in person (Fresh stores).\n\nThe point here, is look at that verticality and how well they integrate things into their business. There is almost no waste. Its not just random crap strung together by a thread. It really is amazing. Other companies try this all the time but almost always fail never mind becoming leaders in such things. Hell it usually hard to integrate something you already do into your business but to step into a different industry and actually being the leader in much of it?
