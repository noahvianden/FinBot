{"title": "Let’s talk about Wednesday.", "selftext": " 1/26/22 14:00 is coming. I hear a lot of people saying a lot of things but I wanted to have some chats with team r/options and maybe we can all get some wrinkles together. I’ll try to leave any commentary to a minimum and simply state some facts to use as a basis for discussion. This of course won’t be an exhaustive list so feel free to add in the comments.\n\nIMO two things may end up happening on Wednesday: stocks will take off and the market will relief rally because rate hikes won’t be as bad as expected or things will crash because JPowell comes out as a massive hawk vowing to defeat inflation with an iron fist.\n\nFirst, let’s talk objectives:\n\n“**What are the goals of monetary policy?**  \n The Federal Reserve Act mandates that the Federal Reserve conduct monetary policy \"so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\"[1](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-what-are-its-goals-how-does-it-work.htm#fn1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can use this as our guide regarding what the fed’s objectives are before we discuss what their new policy may look like. Now, let’s figure out how they’ve been doing with these objectives in the last year/several quarters.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)\n\nOn unemployment: According to the BLS, unemployment YOY is declining steadily. Of course, there’s no way to know how many of these people are gig workers responding to surveys as employed, but a drop from over 14% (last January) to 3.9% would lead me to believe we’re at least going in the right direction. It also appears that nonfarm payroll employment and employment in every sector is up and job growth has averaged 537,000 per month in 2021.\n\nA few things stand out though:\n\n“The number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed at 5.7 million in December. This measure decreased by 1.6 million over the year but is 717,000 higher than in February 2020. \n\nAmong those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally attached to the labor force was essentially unchanged at 1.6 million in December. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was also essentially unchanged over the month, at 463,00”\n\nThe unemployment rate affects inflation, and the more people that are employed the worse inflation gets. According to Reuters there is a current increase in unemployment claims but the expectation is that this is due to Omicron and will be temporary. There is some conversation in the following article though that there is a huge demand for workers and again, that will cause inflation to go up.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-amid-omicron-surge-2022-01-20/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-amid-omicron-surge-2022-01-20/)\n\nUnemployment is looking good, but what about stable prices? According to the BLS, inflation is 7% across every category and nearly 30% for energy YOY. The largest percentage changes right now are Gas, Vehicles, Energy, Utilities and Meats/poultry/fish/eggs in that order. The more consumers have to pay for the essentials like rent and gas (to commute to work), the less they’re spending on their NFLX subscriptions and AAPL phones. We want some inflation and the fed’s target is usually around 2% (give or take) but 7% is not good for obvious reasons.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/cpi/](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)\n\nAnd what about interest rates?\n\nAccording to BlackRock, treasuries are being bought by a variety of parties including foreign investors, large institutions and “momentum players”. While yields are coming down since the beginning of this month, they’re still trending upwards since the last six months. Recently, the spread on the 2yr vs the 10yr is flattening out and the yield on the 30yr has been consistently below the 20yr.\n\n[https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/negative-real-rates](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/negative-real-rates)\n\n[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX/)\n\nOn balance, I’ll leave that to the team to decide.

As you eluded to earlier there's no doubt supply chains are greatly contributing to inflation, but maybe even more so is the increase of money supply through policy and the direct consequences of easy policy. Raising interest rates does a ton of thing to the money in supply. It decreases bond prices and means banks have to raise rates as well, when rates increase the cost to carry loans increases meaning fewer loans and higher repayment on debt = less supply of money. Interest rates go up more people save instead of spending = less supply of money. Reserve requirements increase meaning banks have to legally hold more money = less supply of money and fewer loans. Ex. Policy and interest rates have been so low the amount say blackrock can borrow and service debt to buy property is literally nearly endless. Once interest rates are increased and banks tighten blackrock decrease spending because it has to service debt and banks arent loaning them money. Meaning they can no longer gobble up properties directly attributed to rates and policy. It's really not complicated you have supply-money and demand-product.
