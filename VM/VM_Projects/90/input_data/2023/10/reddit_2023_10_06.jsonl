I bought a lot of shares when they announced that investment. I like it when companies invest into their core business, things that aren't questionable. (Example, Metaverse.)\n\nThe stock went down on that day of the announcement, but yeah.\n\nAlso, the lowered prices for children tickets is a positive move imo too. It's a great way to get parents thinking that Disney is cheaper now and to go visit the parks. They charge you up the ass for all the other stuff. The ticket price is just to get you in the door, and it's only for children anyways.\n\nI also think the Disney + price increase will be a positive thing for the stock. They will lose some subscribers initially over the shock, but I think they can gain those back over time. The important thing is that Disney still has a core base. Mom and Dad aren't going to cancel Disney+ over a price increase. (They will over political issues tho, but Disney is moving away from the politic culture debate, which is another positive for the stock)\n\nI don't think Disney will shoot up from here. It got a nice 3% gain today because it was just massively oversold imo. It's really that simple.
