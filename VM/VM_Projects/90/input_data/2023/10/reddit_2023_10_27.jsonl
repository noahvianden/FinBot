Not everyone has moved beyond dividends.\n\n**How to invest using Warren Buffett’s ‘Secret Sauce’**\r  \nYou don’t have to be a great stock picker like Warren Buffett to take advantage of dividend-paying stocks. That’s good to know, since in his latest annual report, which was released late last week, Buffett credited his success with dividend-paying stocks as his “secret sauce.” His stellar knowledge of stocks might scare and intimidate you, but Warren Buffett wrote in his 2012 Annual Report that, \"We truly relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns.\" **Buffett rakes in a collective $4.84 billion in annual dividend income from the dividend paying stocks in his portfolio.**\r  \n \r  \nThe Oracle of Omaha, who hosted some 40,000 investors last weekend at his famed annual meeting in Omaha, clearly likes receiving dividends -- nearly 90% of his portfolio is in dividend stocks. So why exactly does he buy them? The answer lies in understanding optimal capital allocation, or simply just put your money to work for you. Your primary goal in investing should be to buy income producing assets. Instead of thinking that the burden is all on you, and that you yourself must perform admirably, and become a savant stock picker, why not boost your portfolio’s performance with dividend-paying stocks, just like Buffett.\r  \n \r  \nBerkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE: BRK.A and BRK.B) portfolio includes energy stock Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which is riding a 35-year streak of increasing its base annual dividend payout. **Chevron gives a big boost to Buffett's bottom line with nearly a cool billion ($964,107,966) in annual dividends.**\r  \n \r  \nThe Oracle of Omaha and his investment team love bank stocks. In particular, they've really piled into Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), or BofA for short. **Over the next 12 months, Berkshire Hathaway will collect almost $909 million in dividend income from BofA.**\r  \n \r  \nLast year, Buffett and his investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) oversaw the purchase of more than 194 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). While these common shares are netting Berkshire Hathaway $101 million in yearly dividend income, it's the $10 billion invested in **Occidental preferred stock yielding 8% which is providing the bulk of dividend income from this company ($800 million annually).**\r  \n \r  \nAnother big-time income producer that should come as absolutely no surprise to most investors is tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding by a considerable amount, and **Apple is on track to provide Buffett with $842 million in dividend income this year.**\r  \n \r  \nBuffett and his team are also raking in a boatload of annual dividend income from beverage stock Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coke is Berkshire Hathaway's longest-held stock (since 1988), and it'll likely be increasing its base annual dividend payout for the 61st consecutive year in 2023. **Coca-Cola pays Buffett $704,000,000 in annual dividend income.**\r  \n \r  \nConsumer staples stock Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) is one of Berkshire Hathaway's riskiest investments (and possibly Buffett worst stock, Kraft Heinz's balance sheet is weighed down by debt). Yet, the company behind such brands as **Kraft, Heinz, Cool Whip, Kool-Aid, and Oscar Mayer, pays Berkshire Hathaway $521 million in yearly dividend income.**\r  \n \r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \n**Coca-Cola IPO Lists on the NYSE**\r  \nIn 1888 businessman Asa Griggs Candler purchased the rights to the Coca-Cola formula for just $2,300, and the Coca-Cola Company (KO) was subsequently incorporated in 1892. Then, in 1919, a group of businessmen led by Ernest Woodruff purchased The Coca-Cola Company from Candler for $25 million. Later that year, Coca-Cola made its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for $40 per share.\r  \n \r  \nCoca-Cola’s long history of stability has positioned the company as one of the world’s most recognizable brands, with overwhelming consumer loyalty – not to mention consecutive dividend increases – which has helped the company remain popular with investors for decades. As of the 2016 annual report, Coca-Cola shares have risen so that the company’s market capitalization is roughly $180 billion, and has had 53 consecutive dividend increases. **At the end of 2015, one share of KO stock purchased in 1919 (with dividends reinvested and stock splits) would have been worth $12,748,802, an annual growth rate of 14.11%.**", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Exactly.
