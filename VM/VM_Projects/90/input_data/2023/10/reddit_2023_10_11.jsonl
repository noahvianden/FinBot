Legacy automakers are shitting themselves right now. They've gone from \"shutting down production except for their most profitable vehicles\" to \"all US automakers on strike\". They need Tesla to advertise to drive up vehicle prices.\n\nThe brutal truth is that if Tesla advertises right now we will see wait times and prices go up. Increased demand with same supply means price increases.\n\nIn my opinion: the plan is to wait for the fed's evil central banking cabal to decimate the global economy. More wars, a different black swan event, or some macro \"financial crisis\" to cause a market crash so that rates can be lowered. Then the friends of the fed will swoop in and buy assets on the cheap. Cheaper than the land they got during Hawaii fires. Cheaper than the land they're getting in Democratically run cities as they fall apart. Cheap TSLA shares as the world falls apart.\n\n\"Only the paranoid survive.\" -Elon Musk", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "What? The quote is from Steve Jobs.
