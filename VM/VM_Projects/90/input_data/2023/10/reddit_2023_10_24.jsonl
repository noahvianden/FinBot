{"title": "Meta sued by 33 state AGs for addictive features targeting kids", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/bipartisan-group-of-ags-sue-meta-for-addictive-features.html\n\n* A bipartisan group of attorneys general is suing Meta over its addictive features aimed at kids and teens.\n* The lawsuit represents the broad bipartisan interest in protecting kids and teens from online harm.\n* Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege.\n\nA bipartisan group of 33 attorneys general is suing Meta\n\nover addictive features aimed at kids and teens, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in a federal court in California. The support from so many state AGs of different political backgrounds indicates a significant legal challenge to Meta’s business.\n\nThe lawsuit represents the latest legal challenge for the company and is another demonstration of the bipartisan priority that state law enforcers have placed on protecting kids and teens from online harm.\n\nIt’s also not the first time a broad coalition of state AGs have teamed up to go after Meta. In 2020, 48 states and territories sued the company on antitrust grounds, alongside a separate complaint from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nMeta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege. According to the federal complaint, Meta did this via the design of its algorithms, copious alerts, notifications and so-called infinite scroll through platform feeds. The company also includes features that the AGs allege negatively impact teens’ mental health through social comparison or promoting body dysmorphia, such as “likes” or photo filters.\n\nThe federal suit also accuses Meta of violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal data on users under 13 without parental consent.\n\nThe states are seeking an end to what they see as Meta’s harmful practices, as well as penalties and restitution.\n\nMeta was well aware of the negative effects its design could have on its young users, the AGs allege.\n\nFormer Facebook employee Frances Haugen caused an uproar among lawmakers and parents in 2021 after leaking internal documents from the company that revealed internal research on its products. One set of documents about Instagram’s impact on teens found that “thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,” The Wall Street Journal reported before Haugen made her identity known. Following the report, Instagram said it was working on ways to pull users away from dwelling on negative topics.\n\nSeveral of the practices the AGs focus on for Meta are similar to those exercised by other social media businesses, such as designing algorithms to keep users engaged.\n\nAmong the states that filed the suit are California, Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska, New York, South Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin.", "id": "17ffxf2", "created_utc": 1698162458.0, "score": 614, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "Setting aside personal beliefs regarding whether or not the lawsuit *should* hurt META, and focusing on whether or not it *will* hurt META is probably more appropriate in the context of investment.\n\nFrom my view, social media's negative impacts on the psyche have been obvious for a while. People who reject the notion that it can be addictive are either in denial, or they are aware of it but simply don't care (hell, lots of people smoke cigarettes, they know they're addictive, but they do it anyways). There's a third group who truly do not believe social media can be addictive or have a negative impact on social skills, mental health, political polarization etc -- but IMO that group is shrinking over time as the evidence becomes more undeniable. **Edit:** and I think it's worth making clear that I used the word \"can\" intentionally. Social media *can* lead to these outcomes for people, that doesn't make it a universal evil or something like heroin that will always lead to addiction.\n\nThus, this lawsuit really doesn't stand to change all that much. Some fines maybe, and some more features META might implement to make themselves look good, such as mental health surveys and recommending people take a break if they aren't feeling so good. But beyond that, unless you see some reason that global populations will give up social media en masse, this seems relatively meaningless. And I've seen absolutely nothing to indicate global populations will leave social media en masse.
