Geopolitical and economic forces have an unpredictable timetable — they may unfold over months, or years, and are nearly impossible to put into a one-year forecast. They also have an unpredictable interplay: For example, the geopolitical situation may end up having virtually no effect on the world’s economy or it could potentially be its determinative factor.”\n\nSo here’s what Dimon said in his letter about inflation, interest rates, and QE/QT:\n“All of the following factors appear to be inflationary:\n\n - ongoing fiscal spending, [“…occurring in boom times – not as the result of a recession – and they have been supported by quantitative easing, which was never done before the great financial crisis.”]\n- remilitarization of the world,\n- restructuring of global trade,\n- capital needs of the new green economy,\n- and possibly higher energy costs in the future (even though there currently is an oversupply of gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack of needed investment in the energy infrastructure. “\n\n“Interest rates looking out a year or two may be predetermined by all of the factors I mentioned above. Small changes in interest rates today may have less impact on inflation in the future than many people believe.”\n\n“There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure and battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher rates than markets expect.”\n\n“It seems to me that every long-term trend I see increases inflation relative to the last 20 years. Huge fiscal spending, the trillions needed each year for the green economy, the remilitarization of the world and the restructuring of global trade — all are inflationary. I’m not sure models could pick this up.”\n \n“If long-end rates go up over 6% and this increase is accompanied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress — not just in the banking system but with leveraged companies and others.\n\n“Remember, a simple 2 percentage point increase in rates essentially reduced the value of most financial assets by 20%, and certain real estate assets, specifically office real estate, may be worth even less due to the effects of recession and higher vacancies.

Why pretend like you know what you’re talking about here?\n\nYou claim in the prior post that t bills are what we’re talking about. Did you look at the earnings statement in the post? Of the $131 billion in unrealized losses, $107 billion(!) is held in mortgage backed securities. These idiots basically took a gigantic portion of their cash when mortgages were paying 2.5% and said we’ll take the other side of that trade and lend it so people can lock in low mortgage rates. There is simply no argument to be made that that was a smart idea. Now they are paying the price. The stability in the economy with rising rates is largely at the expense of these banks because all those low interest loans everyone locked in, well these idiots are on the other side.\n\nYou said in the follow up that the unrealized losses are theoretical and just represent the lost opportunity cost. This is where you demonstrate your ignorance on this topic. They hold a portfolio of bonds. Those bonds have now lost $131 billion of value (up from $99 billion six months ago). That is very real. I’m pretty sure based on your comments that you don’t understand that bonds trade with a market value just like stocks. They absolutely rise and fall. Just because you locked in a particular rate doesn’t mean the bond can’t lose value in the interim. If I borrow $100k and buy ten year treasuries when yields are 1% and yields rise to 2%, my $100k bond portfolio is now worth $50k and I assure you my creditor isn’t waiting ten years for me to collect the payments to put up collateral. Yes, at the end of ten years I’ll collect back $101k, but the point is that I’m required to maintain margin while I collect on that that requires the value to remain at some level.\n\nThe only reason they don’t count it in bank earnings is because they aren’t required to by accounting rules where losses aren’t marked to market until they are realized. But to say that loss isn’t real is like saying someone’s stock that dropped 30% didn’t lose any money because they didn’t sell.\n\nIf you disagree then let me ask you simply- what would happen if rates went to say, 12%? Are you saying they can totally absorb losses of upwards of $300-400 billion without realizing them?\n\nYou argue that bonds are different because they can simply be held to maturity. But they bought the bonds with money that wasn’t theirs. So if rates continue to rise those losses will continue to mount while giving more and more people incentive to take money out. At some point they are forced to sell and realize losses to meet reserve requirements. They also don’t operate in a vacuum. If any other bank is forced to realize losses there could be a bank run that would very quickly draw down their cash levels requiring them to sell off more bonds and realize those losses.\n\nThere’s a very real reason why these stocks have done so poorly.
