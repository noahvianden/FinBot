{"title": "What is the future for Berkshire Hathaway after Buffett departs this world?", "selftext": "First off, I'm a relatively novice investor, having only started in the process during the pandemic, and while I did get my initial interest from some of the hype stocks when starting, I quickly realized I did not know enough about what I was doing with my money, so I've been trying to learn as much as possible to make wiser decisions.  I'm 42, most of my investments are in ETFs, with a little AAPL, GLW, WCC and LEVI.  I also have a small chunk i've been building on in BRK.A and I am realizing that I know little about what would happen if Warren were to pass away (or become no longer capable of running things).  What would happen under those circumstances?  Would it go to his kids?  Does Munger take over?
