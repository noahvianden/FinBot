ARM Powers billions of devices and will power more. Why? Compute power per watt and cost.\n\n* ARM is in over 99% of smartphones\n   * you will have to upgrade to get all the new AI features and services that will come out.\n* Apple is 100% ARM in all of their products (except that one trash can desktop thing but...)\n* Apple will release an AI powered device that will need new hardware with new ARM NPU chips to power the on device AI\n* Every other device that comes out that wants to use GAI/AI/Inference will run on ARM\n* VR devices that are portable run on ARM\n* ARM runs on EV's and Cars in general\n* IoT runs on ARM\n* ARM runs on smart [toilets](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/application/industrial/building-home-automation/smart-toilet#overview)\n* ARM runs on your [refrigerator](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/4-door-flex/28-cu-ft--4-door-flex-with-21-5-in-connected-touch-screen-family-hub-refrigerator-rf28n9780sg-aa/)\n* ARM runs on your Television\n* ARM runs on smart watches\n* GPU's that need compute and cuda core busing runs on ARM\n* Microsoft runs on ARM\n* Google runs on ARM\n* AWS Graviton runs on ARM\n\nARM is the silicon designer for anyone who wants a custom designed chip for their hardware use case.\n\nForget everything you knew about ARM pricing and EPS based on historical records. The new new pricing royalties and actual collection of profits from new and innovative design will come into their revenues.\n\nThey don't make hardware, instead they will design and get a cut from almost every device you can think of.\n\nThe AI boom stands to benefit them in new ways as AI devices that will require low power and less/no heat to run will be a vital aspect of all devices coming into the future.\n\nYes Intell is a competitor but like most intel products that have come out they are slow to move and come out with inferior products. Look at their GPU lineup (why did they even do anything if you were going to do something so benign).\n\nRISCV is a competitor that is arguing open source but let's get real here. They are requiring royalties too and the IP now stands with ARM and will increasingly stand with ARM.\n\nIs ARM a trillion dollar company in 10 years? I say yes, easily. Mark my words.\n\nThey will continue delivering custom chips more and more and more and they will be mostly, if not all, through the ARM and NPU chipset designs.\n\nThe future is bright for ARM. Get in on the ground floor now.\n\nWhat makes ARM so amazing? Compute power per watt and heat transfer. It's why your new Macbooks don't have full blowing old school fans that are running to cool down your pc every 2 minutes. The fan is not even directly on the chip die. Microsoft will soon release all of their Surface lineup on ARM going forward. Mark my words. They have to compete with Apple and Apple is ahead on this. Increasingly, all of Azure data centers will increasingly run on ARM because it's cheaper and more cost effective.\n\nIt's compute that is specific for the actual use case. Not the x86 legacy use case of trying to run on and do everything. It's(x86) is not power efficient and power efficiency is ultra important to hardware processes rather than trying to have a chip that does everything but only needs to do 1 or 2 things.\n\nARM specializes in designing microprocessors, SoC (System on Chip) solutions, and related technologies. They develop the architecture and designs for various types of processors, including those used in smartphones, tablets, embedded systems, and increasingly in servers and desktops.\n\n[https://circleci.com/blog/is-arm-the-future-of-cloud/](https://circleci.com/blog/is-arm-the-future-of-cloud/)\n\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25466063](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25466063)\n\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35941183](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35941183)\n\n[https://linustechtips.com/topic/1295196-is-arm-really-more-efficient-than-x86-64-or-is-it-much-more-about-optimization-from-top-to-bottom/](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1295196-is-arm-really-more-efficient-than-x86-64-or-is-it-much-more-about-optimization-from-top-to-bottom/)\n\n[https://www.azurefromthetrenches.com/net-5-arm-vs-x64-in-the-cloud/](https://www.azurefromthetrenches.com/net-5-arm-vs-x64-in-the-cloud/)\n\n>The ARM instance has completed around 20% more requests than the nearest x64 instance, with a 18% improvement in average response time and at 80% of the cost.  \n>  \n>And if we push this out to 20 clients per second (my largest scale test) the ARM instance looks better again:  \n>  \n>The Setup  \n>  \n>Within AWS I created three EC2 Linux instances:  \n>  \n>t4g.micro – ARM based, 2 vCPU, 1Gb memory, $0.0084 per hour  \n>  \n>t3.micro – x64 based, 2 vCPU, 1Gb memory, $0.0104 per hour  \n>  \n>t2.micro – x64 based, 1 vCPU, 1Gb memory, $0.0116 per hour  \n>  \n>Its worth noting that my ARM instance is costing me 20% less than the t3.micro.  \n>  \n>You can see from this that our ARM instance is performing much better under this level of load.

ARM is special because if they dissappear, the industry will lose trillions of dollars *starting today*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA background on the company- They license their chip designs and let other people use them in their own silicon. That's why everything IOT runs on Arm now, and the reason that Apple's chips are so insane. They can put their whole media/neural engine/whatever on the *same die* as the CPU, which is an insane performance advantage. Currently, Intel and AMD don't want to allow anyone to license their designs like this, meaning that ARM is the biggest and best dog in this game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think ARM will be a $1T company because there is potential for there to be a bidding war over it. Think about it like this- Apple makes $300B PER YEAR in revenue from the IPhone. If some other company or actor, Mr Musk for example, decides to come along and buy ARM in order to exclusively license the technology, then Apple is completely fucked. Obviously there are other ISAs they can license for their devices, or they can start designing their own CPUs, but it will be a long and incredibly expensive process and their whole IPhone program would be set back for years, and result in hundreds of billions in losses to Apple. Likewise, nearly every company that relies on Arm is in a similar position. The company may be valued at $75B right now, but if it went away today, the industry would lose trillions.
