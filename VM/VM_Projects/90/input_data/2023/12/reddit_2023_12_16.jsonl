She asked chatgpt how to do it and it gave her the answer of just go sand it and re-stain it. This is 100% wrong but she believes because the chatbot told her that she was correct. The real answer is the surface needs to be cleaned with a power washer, reason being that if you sand the wood it will smooth the surface and stain will not be able to work its way into the wood grain properly and it won't dry or look right. When you power wash wood it will leave the wood grain intact and also will have a secondary benefit which is called water popping which is when you apply water to wood it will open up the pores of the wood grain so that stain will better adhere to the wood. \n\nHuman information has always been passed down from experts to learners, or person to person. It has never been compiled the way chatgpt is doing it and there is no one to say what parts of that information are correct and what is just other idiots on the Internet saying something they know nothing about but because the bot takes everything it takes the idiots ideas and doesn't know the difference.
