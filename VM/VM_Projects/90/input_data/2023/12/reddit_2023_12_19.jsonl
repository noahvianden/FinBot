Why?\n\n\nIMO, it looks like NVDA troubled themselves with talking to geneticists/enzymologists/designers/developers to understand what it was they were trying to do, and then took that home to HQ to make sure that those people/use cases were satisfied - not with the compute, but with the complete experience. For non-hyper-scalers, compute per dollar is much lower on the list than \"how much will this multiply my productivity/abilities/output\".  To satisfy this is not free in either the mental or fiscal sense, so it required deliberate intent in the company to pursue.\n\nOTOH, it looks like AMD focused on absolute margin and compute efficiency, with particular experiences by the wayside. Because if you need cost efficiency, and you design hardware, why would you waste margin on any more software development than you need? AMD never cared to be first for a technology like DLSS/FSR, they cared to make hardware that could kind of do it for the lowest up-front cost possible.\n\n\nSo, fundamentally, I think these companies are pursuing nearly completely different goals. While some of the products might look similar (androids and iPhones are pretty similar looking on the surface), the internal processes and dogmas followed to get there are drastically different, and results in a stark divide between the customers they attract (most Android people would never want to go to iPhone, and vice versa).\n\n\n\nBut - this field is so complicated, and while I've made a lot of efforts to know and understand as much as I can, there is so much more.

Why can NVDA demand such premiums on their products? Why is NVDA always the first to push new graphics technology, while AMD always plays second fiddle (eg. DLSS vs FSR)?\n\nTo me, it can all be explained as: if AMD was going to win AI, they would be winning. We observe the ChatGPT breakthrough, in November 2022 on NVDA cards, because it was the only way it was going to happen in November 2022 - the availability and capability of compute in the years leading up to it determined their hardware choice, and the capability and availability of that compute was determined by the compute years before and compounded by individual firms choices as dictated by leadership, all leading up to the fact that it happened as it did.\n\nWhy would it suddenly change to \"Theres no way NVDA can maintain\", when it has been over a decade of maintaining? If anything, the ChatGPT moment has compounded their prospects as they now have even more resources to continue their progress.\n\n\nA company is never too large to have their legs swept, that's for sure. But in a weird twisted way, it feels like many have set this as the base case expectation, when it really would be the exception. NVDA is not sleeping at the wheel.\n\n\nETA: Here's a fun thought experiment that works with that anthropic-principle-like lense: why did China not end up overtaking USA as the defacto superpower and market? There was a lot of speculation in the early 2000's that it was coming/inevitable/etc. They also technically had all the resources and political capital to do pretty much anything.\n\nBut they didn't. I would say it has something to do with the inherent differences between the two countries, with personal liberties perhaps being a top factor, and how those differences propagate through everything and everyone they interact with. \n\n\nThings are very complex, and why something happens even more so. But at the end of the day, things happen for reasons, and the reasons will often be intrinsic. Extrinsic is easy to spot anyways.\n\n\nETA2: Another way of saying the same thing, this time borrowing from the mathematicians: a company's success not a state function, it is a path function.

Hence, yields are much higher than in monolithic architectures.\n\nPatently untrue. It is standard practice in the chip world to laser off sections of the chip that are unusable/not up to specification to produce lower tier products. It's called chip binning.\n\nA lot of the consumer hardware sharing chips with the enterprise hardware is often a binned version of the enterprise chip.\n\nYou could make the argument that Nvidia doesn't sell its H100/H200 (among others) silicon at the consumer level, and you would be correct. However, consider Nvidia's gross and net margins - in spite of wastage, the company is still raking in cash hand over fist and will continue to do so for as long as CUDA is viable.\n\nThe questions to ask then are:\n\n1. Just how good/bad are Nvidia's yields?\n2. How much money is Nvidia losing on these bad chips? (clearly not much, given their huge margins)\n3. What kind of hurdles can we expect in newer process nodes? How will they drag down Nvidia's balance sheets?\n\nYou say that the industry has moved to pytorch. However you seem to have made a huge misinterpretation on what Pytorch is and what CUDA is. CUDA is not an AI framework. It is an API used to program shader processors to work Nvidia's graphics hardware. Instead of programming graphics shaders, CUDA is used to program general purpose compute tasks in a highly parallel manner. This language can be used literally on any Nvidia chip starting with the G8x series of chips released all the way back in 2007-2008, all the way to today. So the backend are guaranteed to be mature and mostly trouble-free, and developers with sufficient experience should be easier to find. At that point, if you need CUDA you have no choice but to buy Nvidia chips.\n\nBy comparison, Pytorch is a higher level framework that sits on top of CUDA and other lower level APIs. So for the customer deciding between AMD and Nvidia chips the following considerations will be made:\n\n1. Is it more efficient to roll our own AI technology or to use Pytorch or some other library? Most of the times, Pytorch or its peers will make a strong case for themselves.\n2. Now that we know what we want to use, do we buy Nvidia or AMD hardware? Over here the customer, depending on their position in the value chain, will consider performance, price and space. The order of priority will depend on their needs.\n * For example, a company making huge datacentres will want to fit the highest performance in the least amount of space at the lowest cost possible.\n * A company renting hardware from one of these datacentres to develop AI will only care about the performance:cost ratio, because they can just rent more capacity as needed.\n\nCompanies that run AI-assisted services but don't do any in-house AI development will likely go with the cheapest options that service their needs. In this space I believe AMD and Nvidia may both be at a disadvantage because Google already has excellent AI inference chips and are renting them out to clients via their cloud services. Amazon and Microsoft have also made significant investments in this sphere and have deep pockets so they cannot be ruled out in the long term.\n\nHowever, in spite of all this, Nvidia still will lead because it will take a lot of work to actually produce products that can comprehensively beat Nvidia at their price points.\n\nAnother thing people seem to forget is the performance bottlenecks that chiplets introduce. When you have multiple compute chips tied together using a chiplet design, you necessarily need to wire them to each other either via a PCB or via another chip (as is the case with AMD's Infinity Fabric). This can actually cause noticeable bottlenecks in inter-chip communication. Given that GPUs are by design highly parallel and AI LLMs necessarily take a lot of parallel processing to be trained efficiently, the chiplet design may or may not be the best way forward.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Check OP's history and this obvious superficial pump posting becomes obvious.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "AMD hasn't taken marketshare from Nvidia in Gaming GPUs, I wouldn't hold my breath for them to take it in Datacenters where it's more difficult.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "AMD is riskier than NVDA.\n\nIf you look at their non-GAAP profits, $1.1bn in the recent quarter which would be 4.5bn annual, against their 229bn market cap, they are priced for high growth.\n\nNVDA's market cap of 1216bn versus their 10bn qtrly profit or 40bn annual, means they are trading much lower than AMD.\n\nIt's better to hold the incumbent unless the challenger is already taking share.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Pytorch and Cuda are 2 completely different players in the AI stack.

I wish they put that much effort into their dGPU division.\n\nIn order for them to truly disrupt Nvidia, they'll have to bring out a convincingly superior product AND for CUDA to fade away into irrelevance.

Rising tides and such.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I believe there is a third more important element at play here. Manufacturing, neither company has the ability to fab any of its own chips, both being tied to the whims of TSMC. Apple proved with its 3nm M series chips that they can pay there way to the front of the line and gain an edge on their competitors. Nvidia I believe is in a similar position, they have a much higher market cap, more cash on hand, and a faster development cycle. I think that even if the GPU compute playing field was leveled today AMD will always be at the mercy of TSMC and won't be able to get orders in fast enough or competitively enough to beat Nvidia.\n\nTo make matters worse Nvidia has a pretty decent lead in performance per watt on the GPU side which is really all that anyone serious about AI cares about. Finally AMD doesn't offer data center cards that can compete with anything Nvidia is doing right now, the war isn't occurring between a 7900xt and a 4090 it is between the H200 and.... nothing else.\n\nFor AMD to compete they would need to leap frog Nvidia and have N2 node designs ready late next year or early 2025 and an order size that Nvidia can't compete with. They would also need to pull off the same with Samsung to get memory to match. Then have an enterprise card that can compete with the H200 or better by 2026. Then also have a very well developed CUDA substitute also ready and in the wild because AI alone won't justify the massive investment AMD is going to need to make.\n\nMeanwhile I have a suspicion that Apple may enter the AI segment with a vengeance. M3 Ultra will likely come with 128-256gb of on chip memory with AI compute performance that bests either AMD or Nvidia at the workstation level. There is a chance I believe that Apple enters the server space again with the M4 series. They almost certainly would love the win of not relying on x86 chips for their own cloud services while the top tier M3 and future M4 won't sell enough in volume to keep margins high enough. For apple this is a win win. Higher margins, better yield, and a new predictable market to re-enter.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "No one mentions and I guess no one understands \nXilinix .
