Heck motors and sensors drift overtime which means that an AI model that works for a robot today may not work for it tomorrow without constant retraining . \nLarge models also require predictable responses to their input, which surprise again, no real world motors or sensors behave that way, which is why people use PIDs, and believe me , making models work with PIDs is not an easy task. \n\nSo do pray tell how does using an LLM based model puts them ahead of the competition.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for all of that.
