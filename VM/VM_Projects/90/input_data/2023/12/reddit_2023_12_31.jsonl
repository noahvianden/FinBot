{"title": "Why Hershey’s Candy Empire is set to Flounder", "selftext": "For the first time in a long time we are seeing a new major competitor gobble up market share reaching an estimated $200 million in sales after 2 years of operations and this is likely to limit the growth of industry incumbents as they continue to gain share.\n\nThe candy business is difficult for 3 reasons. \n\n1. Mindshare - Brands like Hershey, Milky Way, M&Ms (some of my favorites) are well known across the globe. Given these strong and generational brands, shelf space is often reserved for these staple brands.\n\n2. Distribution - should you earn shelf space, getting it from the factory to the store profitability takes scale and years of investment and/or earning room on a truck with partners.\n\n3. Scale to operate profitable - Finally larger companies have economies of scale to produce candy at a lower unit cost\n\nThese 3 barriers make for a formidable moat for established players and is likely a large reason why they have stayed entrenched. \n\nThe company with the torrid growth is Feastables. Mr. Beast and his team have started to monitize their subscriber portfolio of video content and simply added the candy to their content and made it available online. If you’re not familiar with Mr. Beast, the TLDR is they make over the top videos about every 2 weeks that have total views that are often as large as the Super Bowl and they have around 500 million subscribers across all platforms. This publicity has been able to fuel the growth and now Feastables are available in Walmarts, Targets and many other retailers. Feastables was named to Fast Company’s most innovative companies list.\n\nIn a recent interview Mr. Beast said “…By the end of next year (meaning 2024), we could be in 40,000 or 50,000 locations…” for comparison Hershey Ice Cream is available at 33,000 stores.\n\nIn the US, 25% of the market is owned by Mars and roughly the same by Hershey (HSY). Should Feastables continue their rapid expansion, it is likely that this will become a headwind for the legacy players. Given the torrid pace we have seen so far, the expansion plans in new stores with additional products and continued mindshare gains, it’s hard to see this threat going away. \n\nIt’s also not all about Mr. Beast, but their success may produce additional competition that attracts capital to the space meaning additional competition. It’s a kin to Tesla scaling and making a major dent in auto and then BYD, Rivian and others have followed. Candy and cars aren’t exactly growth markets so as a new player gains traction simply means lesser growth or declines in revenues for incumbents. \n\nFinally competition is coming from a completely different angle, Ozempic. This and other drugs have shown significant declines in snacking. “Truveta Research specifically examined health-care data on roughly 18,000 adults who are overweight or obese and first started taking Mounjaro or Ozempic between May 2022 and September 2023. Nearly 52% of those patients had Type 2 diabetes. Researchers found that patients taking Mounjaro were three times more likely to lose 15% of their weight than those on Ozempic. Patients on Mounjaro were also 2.6 times more likely to achieve 10% weight loss and 1.8 times more likely to lose 5% of their weight.” - CNBC\n\nDo I think we will have a world without Hershey? Of course not. Do I think Hershey will be a solid investment going forward, no. Limited growth, new competition with arguably more firepower in marketing is not a recipe to outperform.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThe math of the impact of feastables\n\nHSY USA Candy Sales $8.4 billion. \n\nThey own ~25% of market\n\nTotal Candy market $33.6 billion\n\nLet’s say that market is going to grow by 3%?\n\nThat is ~$1 billion in new sales\n\nFeastables is has taken about ~$200 million or 20%\n\nNext year and the following year that is likely to grow and therefore HSY’s growth would continue to be reduced\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/294497/us-confectionery-market-share-by-company/#:~:text=U.S.%20confectionery%20market%20share%202021%2C%20by%20company&text=With%20a%20share%20of%20almost,under%2023%20percent%20that%20year.\n\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/list\n\nhttps://www.mrbeastchannels.com\n\nhttps://feastables.com (lists retailers at bottom)\n\nMounjaro is more effective than Ozempic for weight loss, real-world study says https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/mounjaro-superior-to-ozempic-for-weight-loss-study-says.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard", "id": "18uvvb2", "created_utc": 1703986523.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.36, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Mr Beast will take down Nestle?

I don't believe these will be a popular bar under the register of every cashier in America, but will be found at many larger stores chains buried in the candy aisle. AKA, no real threat to the demographic that purchases Hershey's. Anyone concerned with organic ingredients would not be buying Hershey's anyway.\n\nIMO if you have bottomless pockets and throw enough money at any product you think of, of course you'll sell some.\n\nWho do you think of when you think of chocolate?

We’re talking a YouTube influencer who probably won’t even be relevant in 10 years from now with a $200mln grossing business and a multinational corporation grossing $4.5bln. $200mln… you act like that’s meaningful. Chocolate alone is a $21bln industry…. That’s a drop in the bucket. This is nothing but hype. \n\n1.\t⁠Hershey has the advantage of economies of scale being as large of a manufacturer as it is, it has secured contracts with raw materials suppliers and is able to acquire significant quantities for less than small niche operators.\n\n2.\t⁠Exclusive brands such as Kit-Kat, Reese’s, kisses, heath bars, paydays, rolos, and others are so deeply entrenched in consumer psychology that it gives Hersheys an informational advantage of scale, meaning consumers will go to their favorite and disregard the non-brands.\n\n3.\t⁠Hershey stays abreast of consumer changes, producing both sustainable and healthier snack brands in the N.A. Salty Snacks segment which only enhances brand loyalty as the company taps into the additional market share.\n\n4.\t⁠Without a niche or specialization this influencer does not have the ability to compete on price. He does not move anywhere near as much product, or over hundreds of successful brands, so he has not the volume to secure key supplier and buyer contracts needed. He has zero hope of competing on a price, or cost basis.\n\n5.\t⁠Hershey can leverage their portfolio of various brands and related snack products which means they have an edge relative to a small niche operator who has not tapped into the related markets and thus cannot subsidize against competition.\n\nYouTubers and influencers run on hype. They are very fad-based and sensational moving from thing to thing as they try and stay relevant and entertaining.\n\nThe influencer industry is high fractured. You have thousands of people adding zero value to the economy. Very high redundancy, and no real strong differentiation from other influencers. At the end of the day influencers are extremely niche. And every generation has its own “influencers” and all it takes is about 20 years and the next generation will drive what is popular, and those who you remember as famous won’t be popular anymore.\n\nSo in order to take market share from the multinational corporations like Hershey, you’d need wide appeal for products. “Deez nuts” and “delicious AF” are not how you create wide product appeal. \n\nBeyond this, he would have to have a passion for the chocolate business, and it would need to be his sole focus, but it’s just another income stream with his burgers and clothing lines and whatever else he has going on with his diworsificstion into ventures that have nothing to do with each other.\n\nWe also claiming that Beat Burger is taking down McDonald’s market share too? Like what is this crypto hype 2.0 or something? $200mln isn’t even half of what Hershey has on hand in cash. \n\nWhen Hershey installed their manufacturing facilities in Canada, they spent 5 years before the stone grinders could replicate the taste. They obsess about the quality of their brand and tapped into gourmet and organic chocolates and healthier snack brands you wouldn’t even know Hershey owns. I don’t think you even understand the competition here. \n\nThe weight loss stuff? As if people eat chocolate as a food group? People eat chocolate around the holidays, why do you think chocolate companies sales spike in Q3-Q4? That’s during the holidays. Nobody eats chocolate for dinner, a diet won’t change chocolate consumption. It’s like soda, everyone has their favorite go to, and every time they eat candy or soda they go to that, diet or no diet.

So I don’t shoot very often.\n\nIt’s quite possible the stock could go down and as crazy as it sounds, ideally that’s what I’d like to see in the near-term. \n\nFor one - it offers the investor with a long term mindset more buying opportunities.\n\nFor two - the dividend yield is higher the lower the price. They’ve been paying long enough for me to conceptualize it as locking in a yield that will only grow over time.\n\nFor three - every dollar of capital put towards share buybacks goes further as the price is down. So your ownership and earnings per share increases with no tax penalty. \n\nI expect that we have yet to see the worst of cocoa prices. To me this is the only true risk, and it’s not an issue with the company, rather, an industry issue. So their earnings could be impacted in 2024-2025, but I don’t expect it to go beyond that.\n\nCocoa takes about 4-5 years from planting to bear fruit and start producing. Main harvest is from October through March. The second harvest is May to July. So it’s harvested twice a year. It’s the main harvest that has been impacted. \n\nFrom what I have read, it does not at all sound like crops were ripped out of the ground (I’m thinking similar to almond orchards where entire areas are uprooted) and it sounds more like beans rotting and being ruined by pests (I think more like table grapes having rain during harvest, and that ruining a single years crop). Cocoa exports have fallen by 37% out of the Ivory Coast. To me that’s not doom and gloom levels. But I also know HSY has other regions it sources from, it has high bulk inventory or stocks it can already utilize as a buffer, and has the ability even still, to raise prices. \n\nSo to me all this noise seems very short term. I could be wrong of course, but I know cocoa won’t be at its current levels for 45-years straight.

And Coke generates over 100% of its net fixed before taxes whereas Pepsi was around 47%. Instantly realized Coke is much more efficient. Not sure why, if that has to do with Pepsi’s venture into snacks and what not. Pepsi clearly isn’t going anywhere and I do enjoy their products, but for me, If a peer has more efficient operations I’ll wait to buy the peer at the right time. Coke beats Pepsi both pre and post tax. \n\nThe reason I looked at earnings to net fixed, is because they’re both manufacturers. So the key asset that directly controls the scale of the business and material growth of earnings, is their equipment and plants. The more factories they have the greater the scale and output capacity of operations. These are also the assets they’ll have to put in the most capital to maintain over time. Working capital as well as inventory just keeps their factories running, it doesn’t directly impact growth and scale so much as it keeps things moving. So looking at earnings against key assets tells you just how efficient the company’s operations are. \n\nFor a retailer though, I’d be looking at earnings against their net quick assets (cash, ARs, and cash equivalents). A retailer will only expand their scale if their liquid working capital expands. Their business model revolves around inventory turnover and not production. Plant and equipment in their case doesn’t generate product, it just houses their inventory and or services. So different emphasis on key assets depending on the type of operation.
