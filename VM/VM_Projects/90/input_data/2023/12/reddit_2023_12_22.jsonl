Hence, the largest 10 companies change a lot when you roll the data over 10 year periods.\n\nProfit margin eventually grows thinner, P/E tends to converge towards the average market P/E, and market cap growth slows/declines as a result.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this:\n\n1) The larger you are, the more competition you will inspire. Every large company has a huge target on their backs. \n\nFor e.g. Tesla could rise to the top mostly unchallenged as most doubted the viability of EVs. Them proving the viability of EVs allowed them to reap the rewards of being \"right\", skyrocketing them up to the top in their industry in terms of market cap. \n\nNow if you look at what is happening, every legacy car marker (Volkswagen, Hyundai) is innovating to compete, and there are new EV companies (BYD) spawning every year. As a result, their market share growth is declining and the market is getting more saturated. This led to price cuts and shrinking global EV market share. \n\nCase for it staying as one of the largest company - a new innovation such as Full Self Driving coming into fruition. This would reset the cycle.\n\nA more historical example is AT&T.\n\n\n2) Scalability. There's only so many people you can sell to, and so much you can extract from each one of your customers. \n\nFor e.g. the growth rate of Facebook (Meta) users, percentage wise, has dropped from high double digits to low single digits today. Understandably, the focus shifts to revenue generated per user thereafter.\n\nThe % growth rate of the amount you can extract out of a customer gets harder and harder. For e.g. Netflix charging 10 dollars a month to 20 dollars a month might almost double its revenue with not many users cancelling. 20 to 40 is gonna be a vastly different situation. Willingness and ability of consumers to pay gets harder the more you stretch it.\n\nCase for Meta being one of the largest company in 10 years time - metaverse / something else that restarts the growth engine.\n\nUnlikely, as they are already looking at significant cost cutting, and stability seems to be the focus now, rather than growth at all cost, in line with all innovative large companies of the past.\n\nI'd say, most, if not all of the companies you're betting on to be the largest stocks will be wrong in 2030.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed.
