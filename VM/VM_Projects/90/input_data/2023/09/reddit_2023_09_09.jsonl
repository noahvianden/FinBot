Consider what's required for solving FSD.\n\nYou effectively need 3 key components.\n\n1) a very large fleet capable of data collection, it's not enough to do it in select cities like SF of Phoenix, you end up overfitting your model and it won't generalise well.\n\n2) a powerful data engine. I see very few people discuss this on this sub and reddit at large. Having a ML stack that autolabels your data is crucial to solving autonomy, FSD will probably end up being trained on hundreds of millions, if not billions of examples when all is said and done. This isn't a human achievable task.\n\n3) you need an insane amount of compute. The march of 9s will still occur with end to end. It would not surprise me if Teala is talking in the zetta flops range by the end of the decade. I could see it by 2027 even.\n\nSo with these considerations, which competitor has any? Simulation data complements accuracy, it does not substitute for real-world examples.\n\nCurrently no competitor has fleet collection sufficient to solve FSD, no one is even close.\n\nNo competitor has any kind of data curation engine that we're aware of, and no competitor has access to that amount of compute.\n\nNo competitors other than Nvidia (maybe) even has capital and the executive level will to spend the capital.\n\nSo if Tesla is first, and the rest are still internally arguing if vision alone is even viable, they then need to partner with a large volume OEM to build out an autonomous platform (camera suite, onboard compute etc), then once that begins, they need to wait multiple years for enough of these cars to exist to be able to query that fleet in meaningful volume.\n\nRemember, Tesla will already be making robotaxi fares while this project occurs. This will put incredible pressure on OEMs to license it from Tesla. Why would you partner with competitor b, who isn't even a sure thing, which will increase the cost to manufacture your vehicles, which will take 5 years to complete in best case scenario... when you can partner with Tesla today, Tesla who has a working solution.\n\nCompetitor b still needs to create the ML data engine stack, and they need to spend multiple billions on compute.\n\nI don't think the incentive structure even works for a second place finisher, it's too capital intensive over to many years for an uncertain outcome.\n\nIt's not unlike semiconductors in terms of incentives, there's a reason the number of foundries producing bleeding edge chips has progressively diminished over the decades, it's incredibly hard, it's incredibly capital intensive, and the outcome is far from a sure thing, FSD shares these characteristics.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Companies are working earnestly with legacy OEM as we speak on this.

We've heard this before - Elon is an unrepentant optimist, everything is just round the corner and doable.\n\n2)There's a Silicon Valley groupthink that believes they have changed the world through technology when to date all they have done is make current businesses more efficient in the \"virtual\" world.  Because they've made a ton of money doing this they think they are gods and break the rules of physics simply by throwing money at it.  (Some are throwing large amounts of money in an attempt to live forever for example).  Driving is a messy unpredictable experience with multiple changing priorities where the \"right\" course of action is vague and maybe even impossible.\n\n3)Humans are crappy drivers.  Training AI to drive like humans is training them to drive like crappy humans.  I just read an article about Chat GPT being asked to solve a captcha - it asked a human contractor to do it and LIED to the contractor (without previously being trained or guided to do that) by saying it was a vision impared human, so assuming AI will drive better than humans by training it with human data is a reach\n\n4)AI will be held to higher driving standards than humans.  Every incident will be blown out of proportion for news clicks to a suspicious public who will lap it up.  Given Tesla's approach to QA how will they ever prove it works ? - testing in the field won't cut it.\n\n4)This breakthrough talks about using a new technique to get to where we are today faster.  I'll be impressed when it gets to beyond where we are today faster.\n\nI don't doubt Tesla are leaders in this.\n\nI don't doubt that this could be a real money spinner.\n\n... but just as to discard the potential out of the stock price is wrong then to believe blindly it's going to take over the world/make trillions of dollars is just as wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add :\n\n\"Test Ready\" - there's a phrase that makes those of us who work in technology shudder.
