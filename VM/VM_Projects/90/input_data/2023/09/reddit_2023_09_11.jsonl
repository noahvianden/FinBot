The Wall Street bank believes Dojo could add up to $500 billion to Tesla's enterprise value, primarily by accelerating the development of robotaxis and network services. This optimism led to a more than 5% surge in Tesla’s premarket stock price and prompted the bank's analysts to upgrade the stock from Equal-Weight to Overweight.\r  \n\r  \nDojo is aimed at enhancing Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology, positioning the automaker at an \"asymmetric advantage\" in a multi-trillion dollar market. The bullish outlook by Morgan Stanley provides a welcome lift for Tesla, which had faced a volatile stock performance and recently cut prices on some models.
