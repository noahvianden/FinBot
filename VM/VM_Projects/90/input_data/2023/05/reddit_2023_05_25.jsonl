I hate navigating it, at least on desktop. I suspect that's holding back a lot of people - they'll use it very casually, but not seriously.\n\nI think reddit would have been a better choice.\n\nBut regardless, the media is very concerned about what Twitter will do to their viewership, and what other kinds of sites might follow.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not sure man.
