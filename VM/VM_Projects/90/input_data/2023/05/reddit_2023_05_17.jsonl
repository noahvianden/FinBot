{"title": "What I'm doing for CSCO earnings tonight", "selftext": "Cisco Systems (CSCO) is set to release its third-quarter fiscal 2023 results today, on May 17. Analysts are estimating an earnings of $0.972 per share as opposed to earnings of $0.870 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. The company anticipates third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues to increase in the range of 11-13% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be between 96 and 98 cents per share.\n\n**Factors Likely to Influence Q3 Results**\n\nRemember when the world's supply chains were fucked? Well Cisco’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to benefit from the easing supply chain constraints. Its extensive product portfolio and varied end-user base are also expected to have positively contributed to its top-line growth.\n\nThe company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to benefit from strong demand for the Catalyst 9000 family, Cisco 8000, Wireless, Meraki, ThousandEyes and Duo solutions. If you guys have never heard of any of these things, it doesn't really matter. That's why I'm doing the research for you. \n\nCisco has been witnessing robust demand for its 400-gig products and the trend is expected to have continued in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, the availability of Microsoft Teams on Cisco meeting room devices is expected to have driven demand for these types of devices.\n\n**Payment Plan To Boosts Revenue**\n\nEarlier this month, Cisco launched its \"[Capital Business Acceleration Program.](https://futurumresearch.com/research-notes/cisco-capital-business-acceleration-program-rolls-out-buy-now-pay-later-financing/)\" It allows customers who place orders before July 29 to defer payments until 2024. Anyone know who Raymond James is, the analyst from Simon Leopold? He mentioned that \"Cisco Capital flexes its muscle on occasion, so this is *not* a new play,\" in a note to clients. \"Bears may see the move as a sign of weakness. Bulls will look at it as (Cisco) leveraging its balance sheet advantage versus competitors.\" So here, are you a bear or a bull?\n\nThe deferred payment plan likely will help boost orders in the next quarter, analysts say.\n\nAt Barclays, analyst Tim Long said also in his note to clients: \"We expect a decline of 25% to 30% in orders year-over-year for the April quarter.\" Yikes. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall said in a note: \"Heading into Q3 we expect backlog to continue to provide support to revenue, putting more risk on the orders number as checks continue to point to softer enterprise demand.\" Marshall expects federal government orders to be strong.\n\n**Order Decline Expected In April Quarter?**\n\nHeading into the Cisco earnings report, the company owned a Relative Strength Rating of 65 out of a best-possible 99, according to [IBD Stock Checkup](https://research.investors.com/). \n\nIn addition, Cisco has shifted away from its core business of selling network switches and routers. With acquisitions, Cisco has aimed to increase revenue from software and services.\n\n\"Orders were likely soft during the April quarter,\" CSCO stock analyst David Vogt of UBS said in a note. \"While we expect in-line fiscal Q3 revenue and EPS as improving supply chain drives a faster backlog drawdown, product orders could be down 15% to 20%, versus minus 22% in fiscal Q2.\"\n\n**What do I expect during their call?**\n\nI expect Cisco’s revenues for the quarter to expand, driven by the previously mentioned easing of supply chain constraints which are helping the company to clear its backlog for its networking products. Gross margins could also see a slight improvement, driven by easing inflation and improved supply. Last earnings, the company indicated that new orders have also been strong, noting that it saw double-digit sequential order growth from the commercial and enterprise space, with demand from the public sector also rising. Cisco is also likely to remain a key beneficiary of rising spending on cloud computing. Cisco has been increasingly pushing toward a recurring revenue model with its software subscriptions and services contracts, and we will be tracking the company’s performance on this front. Over the last quarter, total annualized recurring revenue stood at $23.3 billion, up 6% year over year.\n\nI believe the Cisco stock is undervalued at the current market price of about $47 per share. I think the company will perform better than its big tech peers in the event of a potential economic downturn given the secular spending trends on digitization and networking. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock hit high 50s in the short term. \n\nFor Earnings, I'm getting a call spread. I'm going to buy the 5/19 48c for $88 and sell the 50c for $27. This means I can get the spread for $61, offering a max profit of about 228%. That is, if the stock can go up ~5.3%. Last earnings, it went up over 6%, so let's see. That being said, now that I've actually put out this post, I wouldn't be surprised if CSCO crashes. But bare in mind, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we should be looking at before making any sort of earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.", "id": "13k7f0x", "created_utc": 1684342533.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|184|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13d0gwm/guys_abnb_earnings_are_today_how_are_we_gonna_get/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13dytg2/my_lotto_play_for_diss_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13byuhu/what_im_doing_for_pltr_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13bzvbn/why_im_getting_pypl_calls_for_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/135v8qm/your_lotto_play_for_amds_earnings_tonight/) \n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/CalmGains, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Im sorry but i have to inverse you.

{"title": "The ultimate bear trap… 5/17/23 SPY/ ES futures, VIX and DXY/10YR Yield Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well if someone would have told me EOD yesterday that we were going to see 415+ on SPY today I would never have believed them… however, that was one impressive and incredible intraday rally which led us to where we are currently. Now the question is after the brutal bear trap yesterday… is this a bull trap in the making or is this the breakout of the range? \n\nNote- I am no longer including Supply and demand in my TA… as I mentioned that was an indicator that was not available to the public. I was blessed to use that indicator while I did. I am however out of my testing period of it and not able to access it anymore. I will be spending my weekend doing some extensive backtesting and revamping my indicators to fill the void of that. \n\nI am hoping by end of the weekend (planning to spend a sizable amount of time on this) I will have some sort of supply and demand to share with you guys. I have a few things I want to test out just need to spend the time actually testing them… just wont have the time intraweek to do that. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3099h52ndg0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6a86d195b6685997fb511ca7bb8a5786067f04b\n\nYesterday was the ultimate bear trap in that we closed below the 7 day range of 410.9 to 413.9. However, as today would show that was clearly a bear trap and a fake break down. Now if you watched the charts intraday today you would see that from 1130a until 145pm SPY went on a massive rally of almost $4. What truly is impressive about this a few things… Apple until EOD didn’t join the rally at all, we didn’t really get any noteworthy news that would explain this run up (biden said the next talk was Sunday but gave no concrete evidence of a debt ceiling solution), the dollar AND the 10yr both rallied today. \n\nSo the question would be was this a shorts covering/ squeeze rally or is this a sustainable rally starting here? \n\nThe biggest thing I note here is while we did break that 410.9 to 413.9 range… we did not break through 415.9 resistance established on 4/28. Not only that but we did fill the 415.27 gap today and pretty hit a brick wall with a retrace EOD off these levels. \n\nNow usually I would say this is a top and a clear rejection where we should expect a retrace. However, this daily candle reminds me a lot of previous shorts covering rallies that made no sense from a technical stand point. In general these are usually two day rallies. \n\nFor me here in order to be bullish and expect further upside (target would be 419.5+) I would want to see bulls continue this rally tomorrow and close over 415.9. \n\nHowever, there is a sizeable chance since realistically nothing has changed the last 2-3 months of trading that we actually are still in the bigger broadened 404.3 to 415.9 range. All eyes will be on 415.9 at close tomorrow. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Support- 412.3 -> 410.2 -> 408.9  \n Resistance- 415.9 -> 416.9 -> 419.5\n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7ps5lnndg0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ced975193c78795f6629ae3338590b85a60d91ad\n\nFutures daily actually had the clearest lower highs trend that was going on since May 1st peak, however, today big move up went ahead and negated that. We are now seeing a massive bullish engulfing daily candle on futures. However, it has come into contract with the 4179 resistance and hard rejected. This area would be similar to that 415.9 area I mentioned. \n\nFrom here the question will be are we still trading in a bigger broad 4190 to 4075 channel or did we see a drop in order to find a new higher high? \n\nAs of right now much like SPY I find it hard to be sustainably bullish until we see a daily closure over this 4190 resistance and top from May 1st.\n\nIf we break through that and more importantly close over it then I would start to target 4212 and 4237.\n\nHowever, if this is still the broad channel 4179-4190 should hold as resistance and we should look for a retrace back to 4154 and 4125 support area. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Support- 4154 -> 4125 -> 4110  \n Resistance- 4173 -> 4179 -> 4190 -> 4212\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjaae35odg0b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a483aeb249c2760e28b38805e9c5064537cf27\n\nOn the VIX daily I have been watching this 16.79 to what was 17.73 channel resistance for just as long as we have been watching the channel on SPY.\n\nThe VIX daily did come up and make a nice double top rejection off 17.97 today so that now is our channel resistance. What I find most interesting is that the VIX came down and tested 16.79 support EOD and did manage to close over that level at 17.3.\n\nAs I have said for a little while now… the VIX has been pretty on point with SPY price action. If we were to see the VIX lose 16.79 support tomorrow and make a push for the 15.72 area then my anticipation would be that we do indeed break through 416 and look for 420 area… However, if the VIX can put in support here and start a push back to the high 17s or even 18s tomorrow then I would feel fairly confident that a SPY will respect this upper limit of its range with a closure under 415.9 which would then make our target once again that 411/4153 magnet area on SPY/ Futures. \n\n**DXY/ 10YR YIELD**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5d9owimodg0b1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2644d0616f227122d8370f9ee708e7b014556e5\n\nI actually think what is the most interesting thing about today is the fact that the Dollar found strength once again and did push for a new recent high. In general one should not expect stocks to be rallying with the dollar… and perhaps that’s why Apple for most of the day showed the weakness it did.\n\nAlso today we saw strength return to the 10yr and it continues on its breakout channel here. \n\nFrom a correlation stand point the last time the VIX was at 16.86 was 5/12 and SPY closed at 411.59. The last time DXY was at 102.882 area was 4/3 when SPY closed at 410.95 and the last time the 10YR was at 3.577% was 5/1 when SPY closed at 415.51.\n\nThe 10YR would be pretty correlated here with SPY closing at 415.23, however, VIX and DXY would suggest that an equivalent closure at $411.27 would be more appropriate. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3tzn70pdg0b1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ef939838b36b6239c85be708b871fcb192e7341\n\nOverall not a bad day of trading even with my lotto swing put that closed at a full loss I was able to secure a green day today. I missed out on most of that intraday pump as it was just so wild to me that I never felt like I had a confident and non FOMO entry.
