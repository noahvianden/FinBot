{"title": "SoFi is up 28% in two days!", "selftext": "28% gain in two days! And Up 91 cents (+15.09%) today; not bad at all! I think we will see another substantial positive gain if the House votes yes to the Debt Ceiling Deal tonight. All SoFi stockholders should see significant gains in the long term.\n\nSoFi's total deposits grew by a record $2.7 billion in Q1 2023. While US banks lost $472 billion in Q1 2023 deposits. The All-in-one app, Flywheel, Fintech banking with minimal overhead, investment division, 2M FDIC insurance, and loan business (including Student loans !) are all starting to fall into SoFi's vertical integration. There is the expected positive earning this year and the future \"AWS of Fintech\". The strategic acquisitions of Galileo, Tachnisys, Wyndham Capital Mortgage, and Golden Pacific Bank secure SoFi's leadership in Fintech banking. SoFi's future is looking brighter every day.\n\nUpdated as of May 31st, 9:20 PM: The House passed The Debt Ceiling Bill by a huge margin.\n\nSoFi still has another near-term positive vibe with the probable Senate approval that seals the deal to the President's desk.  It would be unwise to vote against SoFi in the near term and definitely not in the long term.", "id": "13wxj7e", "created_utc": 1685565988.0, "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "Good, now I’m only down 50%", "score": 159, "replies": [{"body": "Damn", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I need it to reach $18 to break even...:(", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "$13.14 for me", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "22", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "We will never financially recover from this", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "We will just give it 10 years lol", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Me too", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Didn't average down at $4?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I tried selling my blood every few days for money to average down but I got dizzy.Hey I admit it I shouldn't be listening to Reddit for stock picks.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I did got down to 8:50", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "$16.36 for me.
