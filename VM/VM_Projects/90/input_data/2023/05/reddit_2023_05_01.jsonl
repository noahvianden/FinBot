Prices of everyday goods stays too high and just too many Americans can no longer stay afloat. Credit card debt is at an all time high right now. People are putting gas, food, vacations, etc on credit cards and not paying it off. Many people I know are not even paying the minimum owed each month because they cannot afford to because rent just went up another $300 in the last few months. Want a used car? Good luck even with an outstanding credit score of finding less than 6% interest - oh and that used car is marked up in value over 40% what it was selling for in 2021.

No. Apple has always had a history of beating peoples expectations and it would not surprise me if hardware sales do not decline as much as Microsoft’s due to the strength that the Apple ecosystem has shown in the past.\n\nApple has also been moving more towards subscriptions and financial services. Very high margins and so far has been growing every single quarter. This can probably also soften the blow if there is a decline in the hardware side of their business. \n\nThe way I look at it is whatever happens happens. If we see a beat I am ok with it. If we see a decline I am also ok with it. I can see it going both ways however I want to lean more towards a miss.
