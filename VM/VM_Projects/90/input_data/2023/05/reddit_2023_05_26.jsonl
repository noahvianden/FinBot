{"title": "0 DTE SPY Trade Preparation for Fri 26 May 2023", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Key SPY Price Levels](https://preview.redd.it/3t2ralxk842b1.png?width=3834&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5f4c24f6282a2f042e4024a3e0b5777602f0859)\n\nHi, all.\n\nAs of 9:00 pm ET on Thu 25 May 2023, S&P e-mini futures are -0.18%. If this holds up pre-market tomorrow, we're likely set for a pullback in SPY.\n\nAbove, I've drawn what I believe are the critical price levels for 0 DTE trading. It's possible that SPY will bounce on the dashed green trend line, but I suspect that it's more likely that the horizontal purple line (\"Important\") will be the real battleground.\n\nSPY hasn't been moving very much, so tomorrow could turn out to be a not-so-great day for 0 DTE trading. What we want to look for tomorrow, ideally, is a large, powerful move that pushes against a major resistance line, and fails. Should that happen, it would make sense to try a *Long Put.* Try not to spend more than $150.00 on a contract.\n\nIf the price action tries to break above the orange line, but fails, and then gives us a **LARGE and SUDDEN** red candle, we'd want to enter with our put. If, on the other hand, the price drops to the purple line, but holds, and pushes up with a **LARGE and SUDDEN** green candle, that would be our trigger to enter with a *Long Call*.\n\nI would use a striking price that's about $1.00/share OTM, but no more than $2.00/share.\n\n**Hints:**\n\n* **Important**: Unless there's at least a $2.00/share swing high or swing low, don't trade this time. Remember: we need a trending SPY, not a choppy one, or we'll almost certainly lose money.\n* Use RSI to guide you. You ideally want to see a powerful swing high or swing low, perhaps some consolidation, and then a **LARGE and SUDDEN** red or green candle to trigger an entry. If RSI is above 70.00 or below 30.00, this should give you additional confidence to enter.\n* Look for high-level patterns, namely the *Double Top* or *Double Bottom*, to confirm your thinking about potential entry.\n* Try to wait at least 15 minutes after the open before considering a move. We want to give the market a little time to settle after the opening moves.\n* Enter near the support/resistance lines, not somewhere in the middle between them.\n* Horizontal lines are far more important than sloping trend lines, such as the dashed green line. Trend lines get violated frequently.\n* Target a 10% to 20% gain, depending on how conservative you are. (We're not trying to make a killing, just see if we can achieve some consistency with positive expectancy, i.e. an edge.)\n* Use just a single put or call contract. We're just trying to learn to ride, not make a killing‚Äîyet.\n* If you're ever in the red by 20%, exit *immediately*. Do *not* hesitate. Some trades will fail. Don't make this worse by holding and hoping, or you'll go to $0.\n* If you enter and the price action flatlines, don't stay in for longer than 30 minutes. Just exit and live to fight another day.\n* Fire up TradingView and look at how FTSE (the UK's S&P 500, but with only 100 companies) is doing. Since they start trading before we do, seeing how their market behaves can give us a clue as to what we might want to plan for. It can help to clue us into a likely direction. (As with any single factor, there are no guarantees; we're just trying to compound as many probabilities in our favor as possible.)\n* Most of the macroeconomic catalysts for tomorrow will be released one hour before the market opens, so we won't need to worry about macro-driven unpleasant surprises mid-day.\n* Unless you see a clear setup near a major support or resistance line, don't trade. Only trade after a sudden and extreme move happens, so as to try to exploit mean reversion (i.e. reversal). This will maximally tilt the probabilities in our favor.\n* Whenever possible, prefer a *Long Put* over a *Long Call* play. It's generally easier to walk down a mountain than up it.\n* Don't let a green position turn red!\n\nFinally, a poll:\n\nShould I:\n\n* Keep posting these (if so, please upvote); or\n* Go and jump in the river (in which case, I await the hailstorm of downvotes)?\n\nIf you run a trade, post your results and let's analyze to see what went right or wrong.\n\nGood luck, boys!", "id": "13rzuac", "created_utc": 1685065446.0, "score": 204, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "keep posting, it's always interesting to see how people trade.", "score": 30, "replies": []}, {"body": "Go and jump in the river! üòâ", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "The green river (?) lol this made me laugh.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Good luck!", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Keep posting!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hey, I have the same level as your purple.

The lines don't attempt to do that.\n\nTheir purpose is to show us where to look for SPY's actual behavior. Will it break above a particular line, or fail to break above it and show signs of reversal? If the latter, we can try to take advantage of that.\n\nThe lines, and observing price action (along with RSI) help us to understand when the probabilities are *most* in our favor, so that we enter (and exit) at the best possible points that we can identify.\n\nThink about being an archer trying to shoot an arrow at a target.

Nothing can. They help to focus our attention so that we can get a good entry, once we see that the price action is non-random.\n* Most of the time, price action is random, which we can't trade. It would be gambling.\n* During those times when price action is non-random (which we know by observing, to see whether it comports itself to the lines that we've drawn), the odds are in our favor of being able to exploit it by making use of the line structure that we've drawn.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nArtem", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It starts and stops with \"past performance is not a predictor of future performance.\" Every one of your little tricks, hints, and analogies are \"works til it doesn't.\"", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Let's think about that statement: It works until it doesn't.\n\n* Starting your car will work until it doesn't.\n* Your heart will keep pumping blood until it doesn't.\n* Your iPhone's battery will keep delivering power until it doesn't.\n* Your Internet connection will keep working until it doesn't.\n* The bus will arrive on time until it doesn't.\n* Carlos Alcaraz will keep winning tennis matches until he doesn't.\n* The lightbulb will keep working until it doesn't.\n* The sink will keep draining until it doesn't.\n* Your glasses will give you 20/20 vision until they don't.\n* It will keep raining until it doesn't.\n\nThis doesn't tell us anything, other than that x happens, and then Ôø¢x happens. \n\nTo make money, we need to know at what point p(x) is highest, and when p(Ôø¢x) is highest.

If you only have a satellite map (the chart) to work with, good luck. If you have a labeled political map, you can do it easily. We're trying to create a political map. We're drawing lines of different colors and types to express what *we believe* represents the market structure, which you can think of as a history of recent battles.

That's why we **don't** fool ourselves into thinking that these lines predict the future. They do **not**. No one can. \n\nWhat good are they, then? They allow us to do two things:\n\n1. Test whether our map is accurate; and\n2. If it's accurate, exploit the map to navigate the terrain.\n\nIf the map isn't accurate, we must reject it and not trade. If it's accurate, and the terrain (price action) conforms to the map, exhibiting non-random behavior, then we can try to use the map as I've suggested previously, to identify areas where the price action breaks above a certain level, or fails to break above a certain level, and then indicates a reversal as the result of a high-level pattern, low-level (candlestick) pattern, RSI extreme, etc. Ideally, we want to combine all of these factors to stack the odds in our favor.\n\nIt is true that x works until Ôø¢x.\n\nI'm in the business of identifying *when* x, and *when* Ôø¢x, are most likely, using my map-making skills (technical analysis) **and** observation of price action. \n\nIt's all about:\n\n* Trend-following;\n* The identification of extremes;\n* The assumption of mean reversion; and\n* Trading only at the extremes, when there's an indication of reversal, never \"in the middle,\" to maximally tilt the odds in your favor.\n\nIf you want to trade successfully, it's crucial to not stop with a superficial statement such as \"It works until it doesn't,\" but think about the true nature of the problem before you, and what a potential solution would look like, *given* that we're playing a probabilistic game.\n\nThe Devil is always in the details, but I hope that I've given you an idea of what an outline of a potential solution *must* look like. The map is not the terrain. But the closer that it corresponds to the terrain, the better you'll be able to navigate the terrain.\n\nAll of this matters *only* if it enables a trader to generate alpha, profit above and beyond buying and holding SPY.\n\nDo *you* have an accurate map?\n\nDo you believe that developing an accurate map is possible?\n\nIf you had an accurate map, would you be able to exploit it to generate alpha?\n\nSuccessful traders don't parrot unsuccessful traders who, within the echo chamber of a trading subreddit, parrot, \"It works until it doesn't.\"\n\nWe make maps, identify periods of non-random price action, and exploit these to generate alpha.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "there's some level of randomness yes, but within constraints. institutional orders dictate those constraints, and you can infer where those orders are based on price action. as you said, we're not predicting the market, but inferring where price needs to go when institutional orders fill and crowd out market orders", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lot of words to convince yourself that your tea leaf \"analysis\" of charts has any meaning whatsoever", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I like your skepticism.\n\nWhat I've written is useful for only a very specific type of trade, and I'm confident that descriptive statistics will prove the utility of it.\n\nDo I recommend trading by using colored lines as if they could somehow predict the future?

If it's non-random (that is, if the map I've made is useful), which can only be assessed through observation, an accurate map will give you an edge.\n\nWhether any method has an edge or not comes down to the product of the (win rate) and the reward-to-risk ratio.

We want a large move either to the upside (a swing high) or downside (a swing low) *before* we even think about doing anything.\n\nWhy do we want that?\n\nDuring any given day, there will be an opening, closing, high, and low price level. We can imagine drawing a horizontal line representing the mean price for that day. Half of the prices will be above it, and the other half, below.\n\nIf we were to enter a trade close to that mean line, anything could happen. The price action could move up, down, or nowhere at all. We don't have an edge if we do that.\n\nInstead, if we get a significant *deviation* from the mean, that's a signal that tells us: **Get ready!**\n\nAt that point, we need to check the nearest major price level, and keep watching the price action. Will it break above that level, or try and fail? We need to look for signs of continuation or reversal.\n\nIf the price action goes *way up* very quickly, but looks like it's topping out, there is a high likelihood that it will soon reverse. The converse is true, with all else equal. Let's say that the former is true. All we need to do is look for a **LARGE and SUDDEN** decline, a red candle that *jerks* downward, notice that RSI is above 70.00, and decide that it makes sense to run a *Long Put* with a striking price that's 1.00 or 2.00 OTM.\n\nWhen we enter, we set up a bracket order, such that if we ever turn red by 20%, we exit, and if we gain 10% or 20% profit, we also exit. That's the simplest way to stage the trade.\n\n*Unless* we first get a large swing high or swing low, there's no reason for us to believe that SPY won't remain choppy, which would be fatal to a potential trade.
