{"title": "TSMC warns of deepening chip slump as AI boom fails to offset economic woes", "selftext": "The world’s biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, has warned of a deepening semiconductor slump, as the boom in artificial intelligence fails to offset global economic woes and China’s delayed recovery.\n\nTSMC now expects its 2023 revenue to drop by 10 per cent, rather than the less than 5 per cent it forecast three months ago, the Taiwanese company told investors on Thursday. This would translate into a 15 per cent revenue decrease in the second half of the year, compared with the same period in 2022.\n\n“Three months ago we were probably more optimistic, but now [we are] not. The recovery of the Chinese economy is weaker than we thought, so end-market demand is not as we expected,” said CC Wei, chief executive. “Although we have very good AI end-market demand, it is not enough to offset [that weakness].”\n\nThe warning comes as the growth of large language models behind generative AI services such as ChatGPT is boosting the need for high-end processors for data centres, with TSMC making chips for Nvidia, whose AI processor business is booming.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/f433971d-fd8e-4ed3-91e9-e25a96284ea0", "id": "154x3ti", "created_utc": 1689873491.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "Since apparently no one read the full article.\n\nTLDR:   \nAI related chips are in a shortage  \nLow End Chips (Cars, Phones, Devices) have had a very significant decline", "score": 176, "replies": [{"body": "this guy reads...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nor is this chat gpt?", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe it's Maybelline", "score": 40, "replies": []}, {"body": "In that case ^ he chats", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> Low End Chips (Cars, Phones, Devices) have had a very significant decline.\n\nWait, I thought chip shortages on cars were affecting sales, right [VW](https://www.motor1.com/news/630675/vw-chip-shortage-impacts-2023-sales/amp/)?\n\nOr is just an excuse to say you don’t sell cars", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "I mean that was 6 months ago.
