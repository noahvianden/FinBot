Trading at a fraction of their pre-COVID stock prices on the very cusp of their golden age, leading to the opportunity for a **400%+ return**.\n\nTried and failed to cut this down, **scroll to the end if you want the TLDR**, or just read the sections of interest. Took weeks to put together and I think I've accidentally stumbled into something huge.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjq2gqjegpbb1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=15c42fab9ccb8b1eae70917bc5a30ed037d5dcb8\n\nAlso for those who‚Äôve been asking; yes I held my Rivian. My portfolio is up 172% year to date. Yes I see it going higher still, yes I haven‚Äôt sold a cent. Still leveraged. Still autistic.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rb3240ghgpbb1.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc7773872abf5cd425a2580882793dba1ed14ac2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What‚Äôs A REIT?\n\nIf you don‚Äôt know what a REIT is you‚Äôre not knowledgeable enough to do this trade, stick to $SPY.\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), are stocks that hold real estate and pay out the majority of the rental income as dividends. Basically they‚Äôre high yield dividend stocks, with moderate capital appreciation as the real estate they own goes up. Typically they are servicing a lot of debt from buying the properties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Happened To Commercial Real Estate? ü§Ø\n\nCommercial real estate has been destroyed, particularly for inner city offices. Vacancy rates are soaring, work from home is shrinking office footprints. Interest rates are hurting the mortgages and commercial REITs are down 50-70%.\n\n[Office vacancy rate](https://preview.redd.it/d7fps6yigpbb1.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=52f0d0e2c5c411bcf03d6a1ebe8bdf8bf7156211)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Are Hotel REITs?\n\nHotel/hospitality/lodging REITs own hotels and resorts, usually franchised from brands like Hilton or Marriott. The revenue from visitors, after service costs, renovations and mortgage repayments is paid out as dividends.¬†\n\nUnlike other commercial real estate, their ‚Äúrental‚Äù income is day to day, not multi year contracts, which means they have incredible ability to adjust pricing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# üè®üè® The Grand Hotel REIT Mispricing üè®üè®\n\n# Hotel REITs Are Performing Like Hotel Businesses\n\nYou would assume there‚Äôs a strong relationship between hotel brands like Hilton, and businesses like ‚ÄúParks Hotels & Resorts‚Äù that franchise Hilton.\n\nBoth respond to the same leisure market, with the franchisor enjoying high margin and less downside during the bad times, but the low margin franchisee receiving more upside in the good times. We can see this holds true during the last few tough COVID years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pkkruemgpbb1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=10d2e37526e5695d34cd628f4f273fab4a5ba0b8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29q2174ngpbb1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=69999f619576849e8d94c0116be17af48e737165\n\nHilton has done better through the tough times (as expected), and debt is better serviced by profit, but overall they‚Äôre directionally headed the same way. We‚Äôd assume that Hilton definitely deserves to be performing better, particularly during the rough COVID years, but as leisure normalises the performance gap will narrow.\n\nBut performance has **only grown wider**. $PK is trading *50% lower* than it was pre-pandemic while $HLT is trading *30% higher*. A dollar invested in $HLT pre pandemic is worth 2.6x what one in $PK would be. Hilton now trades at a market cap of $39b, Parks at just $3b.\n\n[Hilton: Blue | Parks & Hotels: Purple](https://preview.redd.it/r3o6krjqgpbb1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1a8b4cc48c0e3e4d7dec102faf373f7fa2d341c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hotel REITs Are Performing Like Hotels... But Trading Like Office REITs\n\nWhen we throw in an Office REIT ($BXP) it becomes clear what‚Äôs happening. The recent performance of $PK and $BXP look like two snakes fucking:\n\n[Hilton: Blue | Parks & Hotels: Purple | An Office REIT: Light Blue](https://preview.redd.it/p49pdwqvgpbb1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=1be74b787af7680ea0f4d28618ab0a6caa81c408)\n\nHotel REITs are trading in step with Office REITs, but the market drivers for offices and hotels are *completely* different. Offices are facing headwinds, but hotels are the complete opposite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Leisure Demand Is BOOMING\n\nWe are about to surpass the demand for leisure seen in 2019, after years of pandemic. Even better, demand is predicted to continue to rapidly increase:\n\nGiven years of weak demand and tighter credit, there‚Äôs signs hotel construction has slowed, which means higher demand will meet undersupply. Hotel REITs swing on the margin, expect greater pricing power and occupancy rates, significantly boosting profit.\n\n[Leisure \\(hotel\\) demand](https://preview.redd.it/jstqn9lzgpbb1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb474bb5d17b84eaa9b80af16545e5e5d3ccd5b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Future Is Bright For Bougie Vacations\n\nLuxury upmarket resorts benefit from many tailwinds.¬†\n\nAI will deliver productivity gains in the midterm, increasing wealth and free time. This leads to more interest in leisure activities and drives demand further up the price curve.\n\nResorts don‚Äôt suffer from the reduction in business travel from video conferencing. Or the reduction in asset valuation that the inner city faces from WFH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Interest Rate Panic Is Subsiding\n\nDespite the intense panic, inflation is continuing to moderate and the fed is making more dovish moves. The end is in sight for rate hikes, there won‚Äôt be the need to push to ludicrous levels. This is the primary fear for panicky REIT investors, as REITs have large interest rate sensitive mortgage burdens. As this situation improves they will return.\n\n# \n\n# Great Depression Panic Is Subsiding\n\nWe may have a recession, but if so it‚Äôs looking like it‚Äôll be mild. Economic indicators keep coming out strong. The reason we‚Äôd have a nasty recession is the fed pushing rates higher and that is less likely now. The second major fear for panicky REIT investors is an economic collapse destroying both property income and valuations. As this situation improves they will return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Property Valuations Are Too Low\n\nHotel REITs are valued ‚Äúper key‚Äù or per hotel room. Hotel REIT Hersha recently sold off some of its properties ranging from $360k/key to $455/key, with the higher end being more indicative of its portfolio. Yet market cap put the per key valuation of Hersha at $300k/key.\n\nHotel REITs are trading below their shareholder equity, Hersha has over $700m in shareholder equity, yet trades at a market cap of $300m.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hotel REITs Are Seeing Insider Acquisition\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bhml9z2hpbb1.png?width=1592&format=png&auto=webp&s=22e30cc9cbe8d2e3f412d157bd83fbde58979be8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Bad\n\nREITs have high debt to market cap which makes them vulnerable.\n\nIn the case of a severe recession REITs will suffer from reduced income and reduced asset values. They will have to sell assets to cover interest repayments at artificially low prices. Given they‚Äôre low margin businesses, they‚Äôre more vulnerable in downturns.\n\nIf the rate hike cycle has much further to go, repayments will increase and valuations will fall. Although most hotel REITs are partly hedged for the next few years.\n\nIn the case of unexpected environmental disasters like wildfires or hurricanes, hotel REITs suffer significantly from damage to their locations, closures and reduced demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR - The Coming Hotel REIT Golden Age¬†üè®\n\nOk so you scrolled past my autistic ravings and just want to know what stonk to buy?? Rude.\n\n[TLDR](https://preview.redd.it/ygivwu96hpbb1.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ece82de5b142790a80c4b938f36b562711af555)\n\nHotel demand is skyrocketing. Hotel supply has been constrained, due to tough COVID years and tighter credit. The outlook for hotels with productivity driven wealth growth and reduced work hours is amazing. The economic fears that kept REITs down are abating.\n\nThis has caused hotel stocks to surge, yet the stocks of Hotel *REITs* are trading as if they own offices, down 70%+. Offices have genuine headwinds, in contrast to the tailwinds for leisure.¬†\n\nThe hotel valuations are artificially low, with Hotel REITs trading at half their shareholder equity. They‚Äôre priced like they‚Äôre offering submarine trips. The apocalypse is already in this price, so it‚Äôs difficult for them to go down much further and very easy for them to go up much higher.\n\nGiven the golden era we‚Äôre about to enter, I expect profits to soar and hotel valuations to soar, leading to Hotel REITs exceeding their 2019 highs. This represents a 400%+ increase on current prices.\n\nThis is a sector play and most Hotel REITs will do well. I believe the REITs that do the best will have less exposure to inner city business travel and more exposure to vacationers. Upmarket will outperform value accommodation.\n\nFor that reason **I‚Äôm personally buying** **Parks Hotels & Resorts ($PK)** for its smart management. I'm also buying a REIT with a portfolio focused on upmarket luxury resorts and aggressive acquisition strategy - but it's currently just under the $500m limit so unless mods tell me otherwise you'll have to do your own research.\n\nThis is the grandest mispricing I‚Äôve ever discovered. Stumbling upon this and gradually realising the size of it was such a thrill. Putting this together has been a blast, even if I have come across as a madman to my friends/family these past weeks.\n\nThanks to everyone who has read my hot takes over the years, special thanks to those who didn‚Äôt even call me a regard.

In some respects buying a REIT is akin to investors buying a bond or taking an LP position in a real estate deal. However, the underlying valuations can swing based on asset class market dynamics (e.g. office not being so great right now) and capital markets dynamics (i.e. high interest rates impacting refinancings and also cap rates for valuation) so there are some real opportunities for some WSB-style plays on small-yet-quality REITs.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Same guy who never posted his RVN positions (protip he probably was too early and lost money)", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "dude said \"year to date\" gains LMAO. dude is down big\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhey OP, GTFOH", "score": 17, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Why would you leave it up just because he didn't mention it?

You spent two weeks on *this*? You've vomitted all over the white stallion, and it looks just like the Kool-Aid they served at Jonestown.\n\nThe most notable aspect of your confused rant was the three sentences you spent on economic analysis. Those carefully constructed sentences eloquently ignored around 90,000 data points, strengthening my faith in the success of Dave Thomas' red-haired brainchild.\n\nNow,\n\nIt's true that offices are facing headwinds due to changing work dynamics and remote work trends, whereas hotels are benefiting from increasing leisure demand. However, this doesn't guarantee that Hotel REITs will automatically outperform or that the pricing discrepancy will close rapidly.\n\nDuring the pandemic, leisure travel was significantly restricted, and many hotels faced substantial declines in occupancy and revenue. As travel restrictions eased and leisure demand started to recover, one might have expected Hotel REITs to quickly rebound and outperform. However, the actual performance varied among different Hotel REITs.\n\nConsider an example: Ashford Hospitality Trust (AHT) is known for its ownership of upscale and full-service hotels, primarily located in urban and resort destinations across the United States. Despite the overall increase in leisure demand, the REIT faced challenges such as high operating costs and debt burdens. As a result, the financial performance and stock price has not experienced a rapid recovery or caught up with the broader market. In other words:\n\n\\- The performance gap between Hilton and other Hotel REITs doesn't necessarily indicate that the gap will narrow as leisure demand normalizes.\n\n\\- The valuation of Hotel REITs is a complex process that takes into account various factors such as property locations, cash flows, debt levels, and market sentiment.\n\n\\- Economic indicators are *not* strong, and investors are understandably *not* confident.\n\nMarket participants clearly have concerns about the sustainability of the hotel industry's recovery, potential headwinds, or the company's ability to generate future earnings and cash flows. You insist that this sentiment is blatantly unjustified, and economic concerns are sedated by bottom-up analysis. But even this leaves much to be desired.\n\nWheres the in depth assessment of financial performance? FFO, AFFO for starters? Comparing these indicators can provide insights into their profitability, cash flow generation, and overall financial stability.\n\nWhere's the comprehensive discussion about balance sheet strength? Strategic ignorance of debt levels, leverage ratios, interest coverage, and liquidity can mask the financial health and resilience of any given company.\n\nOccupancy Rates and RevPAR? No commentary regarding operational performance to this end, either.\n\nProperty quality? Brand recognition and market positioning? Management expertise? Crickets, pretty much.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n1. While it's true that Hersha recently sold off some of its properties at a higher per key valuation, the market cap of the company is determined by a vast number of factors beyond just the value per key.\n2. Hotel demand and supply constraints: Supply constraints can have various reasons beyond just tighter credit and tough COVID years. It's crucial to consider factors such as construction timelines, regulatory approvals, and market dynamics that impact hotel supply.\n3. Outlook for hotels and economic fears: The current economic conditions pose challenges for the hotel industry. Rising inflation drives up costs for hotel operations, squeezing profit margins. Moreover, a declining GDP suggests slower economic growth, leading to reduced consumer spending and lower demand for hotel accommodations. Changes in consumer behavior, like increased saving or shifting spending priorities, can also impact the industry as people may prioritize other essential goods and services over travel.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "This guy hotels!
