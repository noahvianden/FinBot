{"title": "What's your honest opinion on longevity?", "selftext": "Hello 👋   \n\n\nI've actually never posted here but been a long-time shareholder since 2016. My roommates at the time were interning at Tesla and just from the sheer willpower the guys put into their internships I realized that Elon and his mission for Tesla to succeed was built DIFFERENT. At the time it was almost a no-brainer that Tesla was in the lead because no other automakers really took EVs seriously. You had the Nissan Leaf, Bolt, and some other EV versions of ICE cars, overall terrible alternatives.  \n\n\nTesla has come a long way since then but so has the \"competition\". I bought my Model Y in 2021. But now others my age (25-28) legitimately take into consideration other brands like Rivian, Hyundai, Polestar, and Ford when looking for EVs.  I'm obviously biased but for me, Tesla is the better product in every aspect.   \n\n\nI live in the bay area but I'm visiting my parents now in Michigan home of the Big 3 (GM, Ford, Chrysler) and I've surprisingly seen a decent amount of Ford Mach-Es and Rivians over Teslas. I sometimes wonder if Tesla is almost TOO much of a behavioral change for most people vs going for an Ice brand EV option.  \n\n\nTLDR: What is the longevity you think of Tesla and its brand? Do you think that Tesla's brand perception is the one Achilles heel it has or is there more?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm very much a product-minded individual and to me, Tesla similar to apple was at the pinnacle in its category and am wondering how long will they be able to keep that prestige if so what will be that catalyst?", "id": "107gpso", "created_utc": 1673276984.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "I think Tesla will do well for bag holders in the next 5 years, I do.

While I obviously regret not selling at the top, I'm happy with it for now. It's still a forward-looking price based on expansion and growth, but it's reasonable based on their forward-looking plan.\n\nI don't see any obstacles to their \"core\" business of vehicles, batteries, and megapacks. If that continues to expand 40% y.o.y, I'll be happy. If they actually solve FSD, or figure out wtf they're doing with solar, then we should expect a large bump in price, but for now, I think both of those products are fairly minor in their market evaluation, because they are not working as expected (based on Elon's estimates).\n\nThere are three big problems Tesla is facing going forward:\n\n1. Charging Stations. Lineups are a great advertisement for a roller coaster at Disney World, and a terrible advertisement for an EV. People are already wary of waiting 15 minutes to charge. As these stations are opened up to other brands, this problem is going to compound. There is often a huge lead time on getting the permits and the land to build a station, so this isn't something that can be expanded quickly. Tesla needs to get ahead of the curve (and maybe they are), and start expanding their coverage. Their proprietary charging connector in North America is restrictive, which didn't matter at first, but as third party fast-chargers start to enter the market, people are going to start complaining more. Tesla had several opportunities to abandon their plug design, but they keep doubling down, so I suspect it's not going to happen without regulatory intervention (which also isn't going to happen).\n\n2. Service. It's okay in some places, and awful elsewhere. I'd expect this is a simple task to solve - it should be a lot easier to expand than their supercharger network - but Tesla doesn't seem to have allocated any resources towards making it better. The longer this is a problem, the more bad-will is built up against Tesla, which leads to the last point:\n\n3. Brand Perception. This is currently at an all time low, but it can certainly go lower. People are spreading misinformation about the company all over the news and Reddit threads. Stuff like \"only profitable because of carbon credits\", or \"build quality issues\", or \"battery fires are more common in EVs\". This stuff is incredibly easy to disprove, but it's human nature to just latch on to the first confident \"fact\" they see, or the \"facts\" that line up with their preconceived notions, and disregard everything else. On the other hand, Elon is not doing the brand any favours.

That is massive expansion and I guess it could accelarate exactly by adding more stalls so it won't be as time consuming as permits etc (new locations are also importants but it depends which region).\n\nBeside Tesla has telemetry on every stall I guess they exactly know where are the problems so they fixed California but now there is China/Asia and EU.\n\nI feel pretty good about it.

They may delay adoption.  However, this will likely only drive up demand for EVs back to those long waiting periods we saw and will push ICE margins even tighter than they are.

Just like there are some people who still ride horses.  The problem is this: once the number of people who \\*want\\* an ICE car starts dropping, the \\*incremental costs\\* for those cars go up. Meanwhile, the EV costs continue to sink as efficiencies pile up on each other.  Just how much do you think people will pay for the honor of driving an ICE car?\n\nAdditionally, you better believe that taxes are going to pile on ICE cars like drunk wrestlers.  \n\nTo add even more misery, what do you think happens to gas stations when only 10 or 20% of the cars on the road are ICE cars?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I hope I don't have to wait until 2030 to see those prices again?

But I look at a company with the engineering talent, the drive, the money, and \\*no debt\\*, with at least three huge projects that could each mean trillions in cap, and I can only stare at wonder at the current valuation.\n\nBut we may have to wait some time.  Or it could pop tomorrow as everyone realizes that that crazy stock market did it again.  Who knows?  \n\nBut my honest feeling is that we will not have to wait until 2030 to see big gains in the stock again.  Two possible things that might cause the stock to move up again would be the interest rates coming back down (for some reason this seems to be tied to Tesla's fortunes) or when the first big legacy OEM kicks the bucket.  \n\nOr maybe when FSD looks like it really is around the corner.  Or maybe when the Cybertruck beats expectations.  Or maybe when the TeslaBot makes \"unexpected\" progress.  Again, who knows?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When would be a good time for an investor to sell all his shares.\n\nTwo reasons to sell:\n\n1. You simply cannot take the roller coaster anymore.  This doesn't have to be tied to emotions; it could just be that you are getting near retirement and cannot afford the risk.  Tesla is going to volatile for some time.\n2. When you do your own valuation and come up with a number that is below what the stock is now.  The models I use show a good chance that Tesla will be worth trillions in 2030, so this drop feels like a present.  If you have a model that says that Tesla is only worth, say, 250B in 2030, then it might be a good idea to sell.\n\nA big point here is that you should never try to time the market.  We are way too far removed from the systems that can do a better job of this in times that are sub-millisecond.  I mean, do whatever you like with your money, but trying to time the market is gambling without the booze.\n\nSo just try to figure out a way to model the company that seems right, do some risk management analysis to figure out where the scary bits are, and if the model turns hard against your investment, look to see if you can find a better place to park your money.

My own take is that, such a \"settling down\" would only occur once their car production is more saturated and equally important, once they have successfully expanded into all of the energy and technology sectors that they've hinted at.  In other words, before they branch out and saturate all those industries they have hinted at... Most likely the stock will experience wild swings.

At this time you can still be reasonably optimistic analyzing Tesla as a car company, analyzing Tesla as a car company + autonomous vehicle company is still a gamble.
