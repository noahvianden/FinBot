DNA when in room temperature exposed can last several days while RNA will see degradation as soon as 30 mins when exposed. \n\nDNA was evolved b/c the oxy in RNA is reactive and can easily bind with other molecules thus breaking RNA apart.  So for control of RNA vaccines, natural degradation of the molecule will break it down and eventually stop production of spikes. \n\nAs for the spikes itself, again, just like those sloppy Chettos or Mountain Dew you degenerates like to consume, they get broken down by the body.  In this case WBC will break down these foreign proteins since they don‚Äôt carry and antigen that is native to your body.  Those antibodies you make will bind to excess spike calling in complements and WBC to destroy them.  So excess spike proteins aren‚Äôt even a possibility after RNA breaks down.\n\nAs far as excess death, could be any reason.  Being old or unhealthy doesn‚Äôt mean you become immune to death b/c you got a vaccine.  I mean if you want to cook numbers like that, 90%+ of population have the MMR vaccines and 100% of those people will die eventually.  Does that mean MMR vaccine have a 100% kill rate?

Poly A tails aren‚Äôt as useful for RNA stability as more for physical signals to end transcription and translation.\n\nI‚Äôm not saying that these mRNA vaccines are so fragile like your ego that they will break down in an instant, but the fact that -80 C and -20 C fridges are needed to store these product would mean these vaccines also have to worry about thermo stability.  Most of us have around 37 C, but a fat ass regard like your highness might be running around 45 C what with all those high Cheetos intake.
