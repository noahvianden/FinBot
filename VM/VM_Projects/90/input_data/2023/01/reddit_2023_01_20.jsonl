DNA when in room temperature exposed can last several days while RNA will see degradation as soon as 30 mins when exposed. \n\nDNA was evolved b/c the oxy in RNA is reactive and can easily bind with other molecules thus breaking RNA apart.  So for control of RNA vaccines, natural degradation of the molecule will break it down and eventually stop production of spikes. \n\nAs for the spikes itself, again, just like those sloppy Chettos or Mountain Dew you degenerates like to consume, they get broken down by the body.  In this case WBC will break down these foreign proteins since they don’t carry and antigen that is native to your body.  Those antibodies you make will bind to excess spike calling in complements and WBC to destroy them.  So excess spike proteins aren’t even a possibility after RNA breaks down.\n\nAs far as excess death, could be any reason.  Being old or unhealthy doesn’t mean you become immune to death b/c you got a vaccine.  I mean if you want to cook numbers like that, 90%+ of population have the MMR vaccines and 100% of those people will die eventually.  Does that mean MMR vaccine have a 100% kill rate?

There is also a long PolyA tail at the end of the sequence.

Poly A tails aren’t as useful for RNA stability as more for physical signals to end transcription and translation.\n\nI’m not saying that these mRNA vaccines are so fragile like your ego that they will break down in an instant, but the fact that -80 C and -20 C fridges are needed to store these product would mean these vaccines also have to worry about thermo stability.  Most of us have around 37 C, but a fat ass regard like your highness might be running around 45 C what with all those high Cheetos intake.  Either way, any mRNA that aren’t taken up by cells would breakdown due to temperature or immune system. \n\nmRNA tech have been in development for several years, far longer than this pandemic.  I used to work with clients that used AAV platform to design custom antibodies, so this mRNA vaccines aren’t that far off.  Looking back during the first polio vaccine, there were idiots that thought the vaccines were going to kill them too or that it didn’t work.  Well we are 70+ years later and seems the idiots were mostly wrong as expected.  Are there bugs and other issues that might pop up in maybe 10 years?  Maybe, but we also have close to 100 years of research and data that would help us design and produce more safe vaccine than when Salk made his polio vaccine.
