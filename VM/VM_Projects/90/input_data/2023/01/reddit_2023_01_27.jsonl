Only Prime members can use the Amazon Fresh delivery service, although anybody can shop at an Amazon Fresh grocery store.\n\nAmazon previously guaranteed members of its $139-a-year Prime service free delivery on Fresh orders over $35.\n\n“This service fee will help keep prices low in our online and physical grocery stores as we better cover grocery delivery costs and continue to enable offering a consistent, fast, and high-quality delivery experience,” the notice stated.\n\nThe move comes as Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has embarked on a wide-ranging review of the company’s expenses as it reckons with slowing sales and a worsening economic outlook. Amazon has eyed laying off 18,000 employees, frozen hiring in its corporate workforce, and paused or canceled some projects such as a sidewalk robot and a telehealth service.\n\nAmazon has previously recalibrated its approach to online grocery deliveries, a business that is notoriously challenging from a cost and efficiency perspective. In 2021, Amazon added a $10 service fee for Whole Foods delivery orders to Prime members, after previously offering them for no extra charge.", "id": "10mzeth", "created_utc": 1674861732.0, "score": 203, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "“ Benefits” for prime seem to be shrinking like the stock.", "score": 272, "replies": [{"body": "And the price is going up.

Rumors also mention the possibility of an interior re-design.

It implies that all immortals must fight and kill one another until only one remains standing; this \"one\" shall receive The Prize. Some investors have theorized this could somehow be interpreted as reference to the single piece-castings or the structural pack, but in my opinion the link is tenuous at best.\n\nBut today i read Adam Jonas' most recent Tesla investor letter, which you can read here: [https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1619019889896988673](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1619019889896988673)\n\nTo be honest, i think this is Adam Jonas' best letter ever and i really appreciated the history lesson.

One year later, Ford succeeded in cutting assembly time from 6 hours to just 93 minutes! It was these advances in *manufacturing* that made the Model T accessible to everyone, reducing the price from $850 to less than $300. Read more here: [https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/moving-assembly-line-at-ford](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/moving-assembly-line-at-ford)\n\nSo i think Adam Jonas might have accidentally cracked the code.\n\nIt seems obvious to me now, Tesla's secret Project Highland is a reference to Frod's Highland Park which dramatically increased production efficiency and reduced costs of building Model Ts.\n\nAnyway, that's all, just a fun little tidbit. We all know that Tesla has been planning to eventually upgrade Model 3 manufacturing and design with all the improvements mentioned at battery day, and this is the reference to the codename.\n\nHope y'all found this entertaining.\n\nEdit: This could also be about the Gen 3 platform. I'm not sure if it's clear that Highland is a reference to Model 3, or Gen 3 platform. If you look at what Ford achieved with the production rate and cost of the car reductions at Highland Park, that seems more in-line with what Tesla is trying to acheive with the Gen 3 platform.

They already had to put the 2 for the Y in the car park. \n\nAny expansion would require the construction of a casting hall at least the size of the one in Berlin which isn’t exactly a small building and there is no sign of any permits let alone construction. \n\nWe do know that Fremont has some smaller presses which they used initially for the Model Y to create the 2 piece rear casting but then when the 6k ton presses showed up they switched those smaller machines to the corner castings for the new Model S. \n\nThere also isn’t a whole lot of space in Shanghai for more presses to switch the 3 to castings, the existing casting hall is basically full so a new building would be needed here too, which isn’t happening, nor is there enough space on the current site for one to be constructed. \n\nElon has previously mentioned that it’d be tough to add castings to the 3 while they’re running at capacity. They’d need multiple machines delivered, assembled, and commissioned all at once and IDRA seem to be able to ship at a rate of only a couple machines a month tops and usually less than that. \n\nSecondly, there isn’t anywhere near enough volume of 4680 for Model 3. Currently, Fremont consumes the ~40kWh of 2170 cells from Nevada, plus LFP for standard range. \n\nKato Road has a capacity of 10GWh and couldn’t supply enough volume for this. The 100GWh 4680 capacity announced for Nevada would theoretically be a replacement but given they haven’t even started construction, that supply won’t be online until at least mid-late 2024 which doesn’t appear to line up with the timeline for Highland. \n\nI’d bet we’re in for a smaller refresh on the level of the Model S 2017 mid-life facelift with some similar tweaks to performance and a nose job.", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Love the Highland tidbit you uncovered about Ford. It’d make sense Elon code named that Highland considering the origin of the Model 3 name. \n\nHere’s my take on Highland:\n\nThis is my WSB-level DD that has me gigachad bullish. What I am about to share comes from various sources which are unconfirmed and just random ass people and my tying them all together. If the lack of anything definitive and unsubstantiated rumors bothers you, stop reading.\n\nSure, there’s a big chance all of this is fake but I believe parts of it will happen, if not all of it. It makes too much sense.\n\nI started writing this at 3am and it doesn’t flow as nicely as I’d like but I’m just trying to dump some info.\n\nMy theory: In Q2, Tesla will announce LR and P (Ludicrous) versions of 3 (and maybe Y but prob just 3,) will now have 400-miles of range and likely some other upgrades.\n\nPrices for those will go back up. This is the reason tesla mostly stopped selling LR3. They know that if they introduced a new, 400-mile 3 one day that all the recent buyers would be angry. This way, the people buying 3s now won’t be able to be as angry because they got smoking deals with the current price cuts and the new ones will be more expensive.\n\nHere is a rumor from one of the megapack gigachads - https://twitter.com/jpsartre_noexit/status/1616967623664885760?s=46&t=W9v2axE24K_IyIX5w_L-Rg\n\n“But the standard range will be likely same as current long range, software delineated\n\nMy guess is the Standard range will be current “long range mileage” @ $53k\n\nThe new long range will get to almost 400miles & MYP”\n\nWe know Highland 3 is coming. When pics of that first leaked, a random Reddit commenter who in other comments says he’s an employee and he shares a lot of info that leads me to believe he is an employee said, “Finally! It’s been gonna be ludicrous when it comes out,” which corroborates the idea that higher tier 3s are coming.\n\nEmployee comment about Ludicrous 3: https://reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/zcblt9/_/iywqny8/?context=1\n\nOther comments about 3 from him:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/z743aa/_/iy6i92u/?context=1\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/z7187w/_/iy6iwby/?context=1\n\nCould that reddit user be fake? Sure, but for the sake of my DD, I want to be leaf.\n\nA refreshed, ludicrous 3 and LR 3 with near 400-miles of range and faster charging due to 4680s would allow Tesla to bring back higher prices for those variants and then they could play around with the other tiers that sit below it. The BMW I4 M50 has better high end speed than a P3D and has beaten it in the quarter mile. This is not ok and Tesla will reclaim the spot atop fastest EV in its class with a refreshed, Ludicrous 3.\n\nJP (megapack brah) also said his source tells him something “big” is coming for 3. This would be something big and it lines up with some of the reddit comments by the alleged employee. We’ve seen the sales data. We hear the reports that competition, especially in China is compelling enough that Tesla needs to improve the 3 to ensure the value proposition separates Tesla from everyone else.\n\nThis could allow SR vehicles with 275 - 300 miles of range to retain current prices or allow them to drop prices even more on a RWD 3.\n\nA new lineup with a 400-mile-range LR and P 3, plus SR versions with killer prices (maybe lower than where we are now) and close to 300-mile range would help keep margins high, help keep interest in the 3 and would help units fly.\n\nRumor recently that a retail store employee told someone that the “old prices” would be coming back at the end of the quarter. Can’t find the tweet but I know the lounge talked about it recently. This could easily be the new 400-mile range LR and P variants and tesla keeps these current lower prices for SR vehicles.\n\nRumor that Tesla has been stockpiling 4680 packs. I think Joe Tegmeyer (spelling?) has footage of stacks of 4680 structural packs recently. I’d assume these would be needed for the 400-mile-range 3s.\n\nEveryone has been very confused as to why Tesla hasn’t said more about how it will handle the tax credit. This theory would explain it all. Tesla can’t come out and say all this ish; otherwise, it’d cannibalize sales. JP also said his source tells him they want to get a 3 down to low 30s after tax credit with giga castings/structural pack.\n\nBy introducing a higher range, refreshed 3, tesla could likely have the 3 price start at like $38,000 before tax credit for RWD SR and then price the new ludicrous version perhaps back up over $70,000.\n\nThis new lineup would basically shit all over competition. Entry level 3s would be better than some of the highest tier cars from the competition for a massively lower price. They could price the LR and P variants much higher to keep demand in check knowing that 4680 packs, if these use 4680s, are not coming out as fast as they’d like. Meanwhile, they continue to push as many units as possible of the lesser trims.\n\nTesla could even decrease the range of the SR vehicles to be like 250 miles or maybe even a bit less to help we the resale value of current LR and P owners. The brand new ones would have longer range and other new things, current gen LR and P who saw their resale value dive  with the price cuts could sit above the lower-range SR vehicles to create a new “middle” price range between the LR and P 3 and the lower range SR vehicles.\n\nTLDR: Tesla may have a 400-mile-range LR and Ludicrous 3 coming. Entry level, gigacasted and structural pack 3 targeted for low $30,000s after tax credit. STONKY GONNA BE HAPPY!\n\nThe other thing I didn’t bring up is the Tom Zhu factor. My guess is Elon told him he needs him to ramp the refreshed 3 like he ramped Shanghai initially.\n\nThis also might also explain why Elon has been quiet about Tesla despite all the complaining from investors. He knows the hammer is about to be dropped. He “won’t let us down.”\n\nDisclaimer: I know parts of this could be wrong or all of it. Maybe they aren’t using 4680s for the structural pack 3s, maybe it’s all fake, but a wise man once told me if there’s smoke, there’s likely fire and all these little clues has me thinking a few Chevy bolts parked nearby…\n\nEDIT: The new 9,000 ton gigapress that was shipped to “Asia” could be front and rear or single casting for Model 3.
