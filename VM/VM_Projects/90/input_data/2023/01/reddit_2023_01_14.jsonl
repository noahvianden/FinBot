{"title": "Tesla's Market Cap Drop Is Bigger Than the Legacy Car Industry", "selftext": "https://www.statista.com/chart/29002/tesla-market-capitalization/\n\nShockingly, Tesla’s drop in market capitalization, roughly $800 billion from its peak, is bigger than the combined valuation of pretty much any legacy car manufacturer you could think of. As the following chart shows, the combined market capitalization of Toyota, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, GM, Ford, Stellantis (Fiat Chrysler and PSA), Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan and Renault is still more than $100 billion shy of Tesla’s market cap decline.\n\nSo what caused that extraordinary fall of one of the best-performing stocks of 2020 and 2021? Firstly, Tesla was always valued as a high-growth stock, meaning much of its valuation was based on its future potential. As the economic outlook darkened throughout 2022, so did Tesla’s potential for future growth, especially considering that inflation and high interest rates will eventually affect consumer spending on big-ticket items such as cars.\n\nSecondly, Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter is clearly playing a role in Tesla’s recent decline. Not only did Musk sell billions worth of Tesla shares this year to finance the deal, but he’s also been tied up in leading the social media platform since the deal was completed at the end of October. His very public approach to overhauling Twitter has left many Tesla shareholders wondering whether he’s still fully focused on his role as Tesla CEO.\n\nMusk himself offered a different explanation for Tesla’s decline on Tuesday: “In simple terms: As bank savings account interest rates, which are guaranteed, start to approach stock market returns, which are *not* guaranteed, people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop,” he tweeted, not explaining why Tesla has underperformed the overall market significantly this year.\n\n---\n\nJust a note, this article was from Dec 2022, so there's been a further drop in TSLA since then.", "id": "10c4fme", "created_utc": 1673739820.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "This is quite deceiving as the rest of the auto industry has also fallen significantly. \n\nFord: -50%,\nGM: -40%,\nVW: -50%,\nToyota: -25%,\nHyundai: -35%,\nEtc.\n\nIt’s effectively comparing Tesla’s past market cap with legacy auto’s current market cap.", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "It's even worse for legacy if you drag the stock price chart back to pre-COVID.

{"title": "Are the bulls or bears in control… 1-13-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Weekly Market Recap and Analysis", "selftext": "After the bulls had the perfect opportunity to take spy into the 400s yesterday with a great CPI print the bulls absolutely fumbled. With the opening this morning nearly 1% red many of us would have suspected that we were set up for a repeat of last CPI where we failed to break out and started a massive leg down. However, the bulls came back full force today with an impressive recovery to not only close green but to close higher than yesterday and to close back over the daily 200ema. So the question remains where are we? Where are we headed next? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a1o6kj4e0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7808a5470b4b69f28e85e7fb390676eebf6726b\n\n**Daily time frame bull vs bear case** \n\nBull case- today despite a massive retrace we established the daily 8ema as support once again. The daily 20ema has now crossed back over the daily 50ema, the daily ema crossed back over the daily 100ema also. IF this trend was to continue we could very well Tuesday end up with the daily 8, 20 and 50ema over the daily 100ema for the first time since January 2022. That’s correct… exactly one year ago (to the month) was the last time the daily 8, 20 and 50ema were crossed over the daily 100ema (currently at 390.5). The crossover is extremely bullish especially on that many time frames. \n\nThe bulls broke spy back into the 390.1 to 405.3 channel and with out losing support of that 390.1 today when it was very possible we are finding ourselves looking for a push back to that 405.3 channel resistance. I mentioned last week that my pivot was 390.1 and if we hold over that we should look for upside. This is also the first closure over the daily 200ema since Decembers CPI. \n\nBear case- despite the bullish appearance when we look at the last 4 days of trading have been very slow going. Most of these days have had an impressive sell off that and big morning volatility followed by a low volatility, low volume bull push. The momentum is definitely slowing. \n\nThis is now the 7th time we have attempted to recover over the daily 200ema since August. Only two of those 6 previous times were we able to break through the daily 200ema without having a meaningful pullback. The first time we broke through it was in August with the help of CPI and the other time we broke straight through it was November 30th. If you remember that was the day JPOW did a interview and the markets roguely rallied 3% intraday. The days that immediately followed that resulted in a retrace. Actually looking back since January where we did lose the 200ema for the first time there are very few times we have broken straight through the 200ema unless we had a major catalyst (usually a fed day) when we tested the 200ema). \n\nThere is also as I have mentioned since last week a cup and handle formed on the daily time frame that cup is represented by this blue rising wedge. If we lose that support (396 on Tuesday) we will see a retrace. Most cup and handles result in a 33% retrace which puts us down near 390-391 before we could see a bounce. That level is as you remember my pivot level. \n\nFrom a daily stand point bull to bear case… I favor bulls barely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tc35dne0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=326a7b20fbe975b67c2e1104693d851b587808e8\n\nLets take a look at the bull vs. bear case on the weekly. \n\nNow im trying to show this the best I can here with arrows but its tough cause it clutters the chart. No one will argue that 2022 was a bear market… however, while by a technical definition we are still in a bear market… the question remains will we trade line a bear market or will we trade like a bull/ neutral market. IF we are transitioning to a neutral/ bull market then we should see a push to a high followed by a retrace and then we should push to a new high (this is represented by the blue arrows). However, IF we are still in a bear market trend and the technical will follow as such then we look to the black arrows and will look for this week to be the short peak before the next leg down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n2g0staf0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7700b6f48e5ec9b1e1860df033f0c5e6d62ec7ad\n\nThe current bear market cycle (waves) is represented here in this chart… as you can see in general we start a leg down -> that is followed by about a 55.6% recovery -> followed by a 1.74x drop of the short peaks recovery -> followed by a 1.09x recover of the final drop. The average total drop from peak to trough is 18.6%. \n\nIF we are following the black arrows and IF we are still in a bear market trend and IF technical will follow we COULD see a total drop of 18.6% from the 410 peak the week of November 28th. That means we could see a low of 334 before this cycle is over… Total peak to trough bottom is about 61 days on average which would put us from the November 28th peak at about middle to end of February. \n\nIf you believe we are still in a bear market and you believe in the cycles… now is your time to open march DTE puts… \n\nBull case- from a weekly stand point here you can see that this is the first time we have closed a full candle body over the weekly 8/20ema since the week of December 5th. There also is a clear 8/20ema crossover. With the red channel I mentioned last week of 375.6 to 408.8 with 390.1 being our pivot… since we retook our 390.1 pivot point we SHOULD see a push to 408.8 before we see any meaningful retrace. The bulls also closed us over the weekly 50ema (by about 30 cents). Near 2022/23 bear market resistance is at 403.5 (1.2%) and officially ending the whole bear market is sitting at 417.74 (4.8%). Both are very within reach. \n\nIf the bulls can break through 403.5 which is the new bear market resistance line I would effectively say the trend of higher lows and the bear cycle is over. \n\nResistance levels- 398.5 -> 403.5 -> 408.8 -> 417.7 -> 427.5\n\nBear case- Despite what many are calling a bullish week we are actually seeing that bulls struggled almost all week long. The cycle analysis here says that from the now of 374.77 we should see a bout a 6.5% recovery which puts us at 399.13 before we would see the next leg down. The high of the week was exactly 399.1. If the bear market trend and cycles continue this was the short peak before the next leg down and bears are going to look for the next leg down of about 11.31% (353.9) within the next 17 days. \n\nWith the banks this morning all giving pretty awful guidance and opening deep red (despite this intraday rally) we could look for big tech earnings which most of big tech will start presenting earnings the week of 1/23 to 1/27 and then more followed the week after. In addition on 2/1 we will have a FOMC meeting. Currently there is a 64% chance of a 25bps hike and a 36% chance of no bps hike at all… In my opinion the markets expecting a 36% chance of a 0bps is beyond insane and if and when jpow drops a 25bps or possibly a 50bps (he has said numerous times hes not ready to slow hikes).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c46wygvf0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb26c04b49546227a9eedb47f7afbc16a18145c\n\nHere is a flash back to a few things JPOW said at the last FOMC… now could this negative MoM CPI reading provoke him to slow hikes and do a 25bps? Its possible… however, with CORE MoM going up there is definitely a chance JPOW sticks with a 50bps… a 50bps would send the markets tumbling (much like June with the surprise 100bps leak). In addition IF JPOW says we will NOT pause after this February FOMC that also could send markets dumping… the final piece of the puzzle would be CPI in February… apparently the metrics for how they calculate CPI will be updated for this next release. If CPI rebounds that also would send markets in quite the spiral. \n\nIn short bears wanna see: bad earnings -> FOMC bps -> CPI rebound\n\nSupports for bulls to watch- 390.1 -> 383.1 -> 375.6\n\nAm I bullish or bearish? Honestly im Switzerland right now… I have been trying to be a bull the last 3 weeks and have been let down every single time. The biggest issue with the current trend is that the way the technical are presenting themselves is that we are getting clear cut setups and by the time the set up displays itself the move is done and we reverse. There is a severe lack of continuation. \n\nI am going to be taking a break from swings for a while until we get more of a sense of direction. The risk to reward has severely dropped. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9p14qbbg0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a3ecaea37d17d30f11db09a0ffd3564ac8123f4\n\nTaking a look at the futures daily here the rising wedge is just beautiful. As someone who likes TA a lot… this is about as textbook of a rising wedge as there can be… realistically until we break the support of that rising wedge you should not be shorting this and I also with how tight the peak is do no think we should take a long here either. \n\nFutures the bulls for the 2nd day in a row closed over the daily 200ema. The last time that happened resulted in a -2.57% sell off.. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vyd2petg0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb2c7d30698d16abf8354a09a2fb8f75276857a5\n\nOn the futures weekly chart we are actually trading within a pretty massive diamond pattern… for those who don’t remember a diamond pattern is essentially a massive breakout or breakdown pattern. \n\nMuch like our 375.6 to 408.8 channel futes has its own 3770 to 4090 channel. With the pivot being 3920 and bulls this week closing us over it this SHOULD present an opportunity to test 4030 next week. IF bulls can break through 4090 then we very well could see a push to what im calling the channel extreme of 4280. However, IF the bulls were to lose 3920 this week then I would feel more confident that this is a fake peak and that we are going to see a drop back to 3770. \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that the JPM collar call is at 4030 too… and puts are at 3600. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxq7hr9h0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3db5b5daf5ae62e54f4fee3c5f5618b7c0481c\n\nTaking a look at Tesla let me tell you I was highly disappointed and got absolutely crushed playing calls on Tesla over night. The pattern looked beyond ripe for a huge breakout today and what happened? Well we got news that trumped the technical and caused it to go spiraling into the ground. Impressively Tesla managed to recover almost all of the loss before close. \n\nEffectively Tesla broke the black bull channel and broke through the rising wedge at the same time. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om0vdlqh0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea19583c8fa2d2c5d482e53ce6a18387abe36f9\n\nNew Tesla daily looks something like this… we now have a new daily red rising wedge and a 3 day long black resistance line. We also have the blue bear channel stick intact. Despite the fact that we opened nearly 5% red we actually managed to rally and close back over the daily 8ema. This is now only the 2nd time that here has been 5 closes over the daily 8ema since September. IF we were to close a 6th candle over the daily 8ema this would be the first time since September for that to happen. \n\nSupport- 118.2 (red rising wedge) -> 116.4 -> 113.2\n\nResistance- 120.9 (black resistance) -> 122.3 -> 126.4 -> 129.5 (red rising wedge and blue bear channel)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5waq2l5i0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a73a15a78437eeebb620bef21529957887343fea\n\nOn a weekly time frame we are actually forming a convincing V bottom here. This is now the 2nd week in a row to close higher. However as you can see we ended up closing right at that 122.4 resistance. \n\nSo if we look at the last 3 weeks of trading 112.9 is clear support and 122.5 is clear resistance. We have essentially a 3 week and $10 long consolidation period here. The question is will the v bottom hold and we break out or is this a double top off 122.5 and we are headed lower…\n\nWe have two falling wedges here. We have the first black short term (Started in December) falling wedge that has a resistance of 112.8 for next week. That means unless tesla was to open -$10 Tuesday this falling wedge is broken. We also have the next falling red wedge at 124.2 for next week. If tesla can break through that level this wedge which dates back to September when this sell off began would effectively be broken. \n\nIf we see Tesla break through both of these falling wedges I would feel fairly confident in a temporary bottom being put in and that we are going to see a bounce of some decent weight over the next few weeks. There is a case to see a rally into earnings which takes place on 1/23/23. If earnings were to come in friendly we could see a continuation rally, however, a miss on earnings is most likely going to result in the next leg down. \n\nKey weekly support- 118.7 -> 112.8 -> 102.1 -> 94.5\n\nKey weekly resistance- 122.5 -> 150\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjr5eq9j0xba1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=310c18349818e40bf28439c9960db216fce3d26d\n\nTaking a look at the VIX… This is officially the lowest level the VIX has touched and closed below since 1/13/22… exactly one year ago today. \n\nThe VIX has absolutely without a care in the world unwound. I still believe the VIX Is not a great metric anymore for making plays and I do not think that the pervious trend and previous ways we have used the VIX to trade SPY is valid anymore…\n\nWith that being said IF the bulls can continue the momentum on SPY we very well could see the VIX tract back in the 15s for the first time since 2021. My red zone on the VIX is 16.6 to 19.7. This is previous where the VIX has bottomed out all of 2022 before the next leg down for SPY has started. Highlighted by the blue arrows you can see every time previously it touched 19.6 or below we reversed and started the next leg down on SPY. \n\nSo the question which I posed back up in the beginning is this… are we trading within a neutral/ bull market again and effectively will find ourselves using different technical than we did for all of 2022 OR are we still in the bear market and the previous trends/ technical from 2022 will remain valid…\n\nIF you believe we are leaving bear market territory then we should continue to see the VIX unwind. Why? Well the VIX essentially measure fear… how does it measure that? Well it measures it by how many people are hedging with puts (aka downside protection). The more people with puts the higher the VIX goes. As you can see since October the VIX has steadily unwound and since the December CPI to present CPI we were trending down slightly but holding steady. Since the current CPI just printed we have unwound completely and even leading into it. \n\nSo IF we believe bear market is over we SHOULD expect the VIX to return to its normal mean. Which prior to 2022 bear market would be 15 to 19.7 with a outliers above and below. Most of 2021 (after March) was spent within these two levels. We should effectively find the VIX holding at these levels and find SPY to trend slowly upwards. Remember we are not in a 2020 bull market/ QE market. \n\nHowever, IF you are on the side that we are STILL in the bear market and will remain there until 2023 is over or for at least the foreseeable future… then right now you are being presented with the opportunity to of a life time to start piling into puts. IF you believe this is the bottom of the VIX and that much like all of 2022 we will spike back to the 2022 bear market mean which is 23.8 to 28.3 then now is your buying opportunity. I would IF you are bearish and believe the earnings, FOMC and next CPI will start a bearish catalyst and bearish dump in the markets… I would recommend some March or June puts right here… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ua2iz7uj0xba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=49c2d0f3f63bb9139875fd575a9a22dd32aca288\n\nThat leaves me… where am I at? What is my prediction? I remain under the conviction that we will for most of 2023 and possibly even into 2024 depending on the economy, recession, FOMC, CPI, etc. etc. trade within this 375.6 to 408.8 channel… I believe we will see the occasional outlier at 360 to 428 but any touches there will be short lived. I honestly believe that the bottom IS IN… I do think that 348.11 on October 10th WAS the bottom and will remain the bottom for the foreseeable future. \n\nThe only thing that in my opinion would change my mind on that is IF we were to see back to back to back bearish catalysts. Bears are going to need the perfect end of January into February bear storm… they are going to need to see two weeks straight of big tech and heavily weighted companies miss on earnings AND give poor guidance, we also are going to need JPOW to have a backbone and give one last 50bps hike, after that bears need to see a rebound in CPI (especially CORE). This would be three big bearish catalysts from January 23rd until February 14th. That is 4-5 weeks of catalysts that COULD drive the narrative downward. \n\nIf you remember the SPY cycle above I mentioned that the final leg down of this current bear cycle would end the end of February and COULD reach as low as the 330s. \n\nPersonally I believe at some point we are going to get enough of a run and momentum to break through 417.74. That level is what signals that we are BACK in a bull market. However, I do not think we will just slow climb back to ATHs. I think 2023 and possibly even 2024 depending on what happens with the economy, recession, CPI, etc. etc. etc. will be very much so range bound. \n\nI also would not be shocked to see hedgies rally us just hard enough and just convincing enough over that bull market line to trap people in calls and pull the final downside hedges off before we finally see the last leg down put in. \n\nAlso you have to remember that historically the bottom bottom comes AFTER the FED pivots… While we DID slow rate hikes from 75bps to 50bps and COULD slow to 25bps here in February… we have NOT officially pivoted until we get a 0bps… That at max will come at the March 22nd meeting. That means most likely if I had to guess the last leg down will be put in during the summer of 2023. The question is will we put in a new 52 week low or will we revisit the 360s and start the recovery. \n\nSomething else that keeps me up at night (just kidding but it really makes me wonder) is that IF this truly is the bottom and this is truly just going to be range bound until we slowly start the next bull market… we have not had true capitulation… sure there was a few days in a row of huge sell offs in a row. Some really long streaks of red days in a row but I do not think we had capitulation. We also never got our VIX to 50+ Spike. The highest the VIX ever got was 38.94 on January 24th (very early on before we even were officially in a bear market). We also have not had a circuit breaker…. \n\nWhile there is no official requirement for VIX 40-50, a circuit breaker OR for capitulation (which could be seen as the VIX spiking or a circuit breaker)…. It would be very odd to see an official bear market like this without them. There was definitely some very convincing days in June that I would have thought had the potential though…. \n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxvkdzek0xba1.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=d96dbea6a79f33ac13b6901c1bcd4538411e9eec\n\nI unfortunately found myself on the wrong side of the news today with Tesla which of course being a 0dte resulted in a total loss. Today was my sons birthday and I was off most of the morning and by time I got back I just couldn’t find anything I really wanted to trade. Ended up taking a pretty sizeable red day today and unfortunately put my first red week of 2023 in too. \n\nSomethings I learned this week that I plan to implement going forward. \n\nThis week is now the second week in a row where I had a great Monday and Tuesday and playing a major fed event like CPI or FOMC minutes has resulted in a significant loss. I used to play every major FED day (cpi, FOMC, FOMC minutes, unemployment data, etc. etc. etc.). However, the thing I am finding to become increasingly true is that I have been correct however the market has not reacted how I envisioned it too.. For example last week I played puts on Unemployment data expecting a full on -1% red open and I got the exact numbers in order to do that… and market algos decided that for the first time ever wages were more important than overall unemployment missing by a huge shot… Just like CPI my prediction for the actual CPI numbers was damn near perfect.. however, despite playing the highest probability play I could (a strangle) the markets decided on some of the best inflation numbers we have had yet to open flat. Going forward I am going to be stepping back from playing any big data days or big fed days. The risk to reward is just not there anymore. \n\nWith that being said we have now reached some of the worst theta decay and IV crush that I have ever seen. \n\nIV crush- the one thing that an option player wants to see is HIGH IV after they are in a play… why? Because I high IV pumps premium prices AND means a huge move is expected… however, the issue lately on SPY is that the MM have priced spy options so damn well with premiums and IV that the reward side of the risk is very low. For example for the last two weeks now (especially this week) previous moves that would have netted 10-15% gains are barely netting 3-5% gains. I noticed this actually on a macro scale from about September until November previous scalps and level to level plays stopped paying as well.. Scalps used to be literal free money… as long as you had the direction correct and played the techncials correct you could net yourself a 15-20% win in literal seconds (think 3 seconds is my record)… however, now those same scalps are barely giving you 5% before premiums move against you. In addition with IV being so well priced when we do have huge data days the IV pumps so well on SPY that the move doesn’t give you anything. For example last week on that unemployment data I know some people played SPY calls and a near .8% move I believe it was on 0dte SPY contracts barely netted 30% on a swing play… a 0dte moving nearly 1% should EASILY be a 100%+ gain… \n\nThe only plays lately that I find to be even worth while are weekend swings… I am not quite sure why (And I would love someone to chime in here… ) but I have noticed since thanksgiving weekend that every Friday into Monday (and especially into 3 day weekends) that the next DTE after the weekend IV drops into almost the single digits… however, nearly every single day of the week SPY has opened with an IV of 25-35%. For instance tonight the IV on 1/17 SPY puts and calls closed at 8.2% and 9.9%... that is incredibly low IV considering IV should open around 25-35% on Tuesday. The best risk to reward if you have very strong conviction for a move over the weeks comes in here… If I take a swing this is what I will look for is IV near 10-13% the day before and a VERY convincing technical move… otherwise the risk to reward on swings is shit again too…\n\nLastly is theta decay- I noticed that pretty much since November (when 0dte everyday started) the theta decay (and mind you there are other factors here but im just saying theta cause that’s what most call it when prems lose their value) has been extremely aggressive. For instance today… we had a VERY slow bull trend all day long moving us up. But the issue was that SPY would move up 50 cents -> immediately drop 40 cents -> move up 60 cents -> immediately drop 40 cents -> move up 50 cents -> immediately drop 75 cents -> move up 80 cents… etc etc etc… what effectively ended up happening is that every time we would push favorable you barely saw on a very short DTE (anything but 0dte) any profits, however, that move against you comes and by time price moves even more favorably in your direction your contracts value is less than it was at the same spot… I have noticed for the last 4 days this is exactly how premiums have moved pretty much all day long… I have barely most days been able to get any sort of sizeable win out of anything over 2dte because of this. And if you fail to take profits on the first push you are left either getting stopped out or left with even less profits the next time. \n\nNow add in this theta eating movement with the fact that we are seeing IV open at 35% and slowly all day long drop down to close out under 20% and well unless you have a VERY strong aggressive trend… 99% of the time you already lost just taking a trade.\n\nWe are in a very tough time to trade right now and honestly I do not forsee it getting any better. We have to weigh the risk to reward every single trade… we also have to accept that unless we see a big move coming and a bigger trend to play out that honestly you might find yourself sitting out some days and not even trading them. \n\nIn the end its like I have said all of 2022… capital preservation is the number one goal until we truly are in our next QE fueled bull market.

Well, when the bear market started last November, the question was just the opposite. Where do you think the money that pushed Bitcoin to $70k and QQQ to $410 went after sellers got out? The basic answer is two places: commodities/energy and overnight RRP facilities along with some bond-market shorts (TLT guaranteed to go down as the fed hiked).  So, if anything, collecting these interest rates for the last year on money should lead to higher-highs, the big boys have just been doing the fed's job to bring inflation down by keeping the market down. arguably the algorithmic correlation between MBS and Apple has been enough for the fed to actually control market prices, but the idea that they buy/sell Apple stock is conspiratorial, so it depends how you see it.  \n\nThe biggest players are not going to miss the dip on the $35 trillion long bond-market though. No way, they're happy to play along to get inflation psychology down, that is, you just need to break the expectation that prices keep going up, but you can't miss the move on 5yr-20yr bonds that had their worst year since 1929.  \n\nThe bond-market is not controlled by the fed, only loosely influenced. They react to the data and that's it, there is far too much money involved to play the games that stocks do.  Will inflation be under 3% in the next ten years? then you need to buy TLT today. It's only out-of-control inflation that disrupts the bond market. Noone thinks the fed won't get closer to their target (2%) at this point and that's all that matters.  Once the 10yr yield bottoms out is where it gets more interesting. getting below 3% might be more difficult than you think, therefore they should create a multi-month period where long-run inflation looks to be over 2.5%.  \n\nThat is, the long-bonds will imply a decade of controlled, higher than before inflation, in which case stocks should go to the moon with a 3% 10-yr, because there is going to be this moment where everyone says \"Wait a minute, if the price of everything is going to stay and go higher faster, then stocks must go up.\"  The compounding effects of even 2.5% for a decade means stocks go up bigly.  Well, does that hold up? Do you believe the fed will stop before 2% because the recession it will take to get from 3% to 2% isn't worth it? I'm not too sure, but the likely scenario is that we hold in this goldilocks scenario for a few months where everyone prices in long-run inflation over 2%, then in the summer the actual effects of 2%+ rates start hitting the earnings reports. then next fall you likely have this situation where 3% inflation hits the lagged 3.5%+ rates and the market turns deflationary.   \n\nTLDR:  Long TLT to $120-$135, pump QQQ when 10yr sticks at 3%. run away and buy puts when the 10yr yield breaks below 2.75% because that will be the beginning of actual deflation where the slip doesn't stop at 2% CPI--we start going negative and the fed lets it happen for a bit.

Realized vol was 18.98 on Wednesday, and 18.25 on Friday, using 21 day realized, which is the \"underlying\" to the VIX.\n\n2 - But how about other timeframes? Well, the 10 day is looked at as a leading indicator of where 21 day will go, and therefore where VIX will trend. It was 18.68 on Wednesday, 15.6 on Friday.\n\n3 - What does that mean? It means there was a classic \"vol crush\". Vol crushes actually happen to IV, which VIX is a pure measure of. VIX fell from 21.09 to 18.35 as hedges got unwound. It didn't fall further likely because a) people are still stuck with thinking it's a bear market (which may be correct, no argument there) and b) the three day w/e made people think they should maybe keep some hedges in place in case something happens they won't be able to react to until Tuesday morning. But that fall in the measures of realized vol isn't at all consistent with a bear market rally. It's far more consistent with a bull, where vol is low but prices keep going up, and, as is happening on this sub, everyone questions the rally.\n\nOpinions are nice, but if you're going to last in the stock market, you need to gather data. Lots of it. And then figure out the historical context to where you are now.
