{"title": "ChatGPT is Indeed the \"Iphone Moment for AI\" - Some Thoughts on Microsoft, Alphabet and AI.", "selftext": "With ChatGPT AI is finally superior to my monkey brain in every way. The day when white-collar jobs are replaced by a big silicon brain is fast approaching. But at least now we have the extraordinary opportunity to invest in the technology that will soon replace us (especially Microsoft, but also Alphabet). My thoughts on this are below.\n\n# Summary\n\nTransformer-based neural networks, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 behind ChatGPT, will fundamentally change the way we interact with computers and develop software. Microsoft and OpenAI have already launched Github Copilot, a self learning AI code generator. OpenAI's technology will enable Microsoft to offer unrivaled services to businesses. While Alphabet is likely to have similarly advanced technology up its sleeve, Microsoft is now in pole position to drive and profit from the AI revolution. In contrast to this, the potential threat to Alphabet's Google Search by the integration of ChatGPT into Microsoft's search engine Bing is overestimated. A head-to-head race in AI between Microsoft and Alphabet will gain momentum and produce mind-blowing technologies. Microsoft is currently ahead of the game, but both stocks are great long-term investments.\n\n# A Whole New Way to Interact With Computers\n\nOver the past few decades, computing power has gotten cheaper, while the demand for programmers has exploded. This explains the rapid rise of high-level programming languages like Python, which make programming easier and faster than low-level programming languages like C++, sometimes at the cost of efficient computation. However, even \"easy to learn\" programming languages require a lot of theoretical knowledge, practice and experience. As a result, it often takes armies of highly paid software developers and significant investment to turn ideas into market-ready software.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig. 1: I asked OpenAI's DALL-E 2 to paint \\\\\"an oil painting about how artificial intelligence will change the way we live\\\\\" \\(DALL-E 2\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1lthm3ejb1da1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=58f13f4eb09c471797a8811659f3b6708e7f00e4)\n\nIn 2017, the invention of transformer-based neural networks by a team of [researchers at Google Brain](https://research.google/pubs/pub46201/) sparked a second revolution in artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models are based on this technology, culminating in the release of the state-of-the-art GPT model [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/) in late November 2022. ChatGPT's impressive ability to write prose and even poetry reached [one million users](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599668808285028353) within a few days of its release.\n\nIn the following, I will focus on a single capability of ChatGPT that has not yet received the attention it deserves: ChatGPT is able to program in common programming languages like Python or C++. ChatGPT is therefore able to translate any idea you formulate in natural language into source code. This will speed up all parts of software development and fundamentally change the way we interact with computers. But let's just ask ChatGPT for its own opinion:\n\n>ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate code quickly and accurately can help developers and organizations automate repetitive tasks, speed up development and deployment, and ultimately drive innovation and efficiency in the tech industry. (ChatGPT, OpenAI)\n\n# What ChatGPT Can Already Do\n\nTo make a long story short, ChatGPT's programming skills blew me away, but let me show you what I mean. Since the Internet is full of code examples, I assumed that ChatGPT has seen an enormous amount of programming problems when it was trained. I asked ChatGPT to write a completely useless and therefore unique program in the Python programming language that would be able to web scrape the P/E ratios of all profitable companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and plot them against the length of the stock tickers (e.g. 4 for \"AAPL\" or 3 for \"JPM\"). ChatGPT did the job in a few seconds and wrote the program in 31 lines of Python code (PEP 8 standard, including comments). The first version returned an error message. When I told ChatGPT about it, it automatically identified the error and corrected the program accordingly. In the end, the program returned the desired plot, even with the correct axis labels (Fig. 2). Not only does ChatGPT produce surprisingly elegant code, it also adds informative comments to improve readability (e.g. \"Define the Dow Jones Industrial Index tickers\"). Comments are non-executed annotations in the source code of a program to explain to a human reader, for example, what a piece of code is supposed to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig. 2: A useless program developed by ChatGPT: DJIA P\\/E ratios vs. stock ticker length.](https://preview.redd.it/5mdvjmarb1da1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=c50a5d2bd310241d53dbef0ba8ca1b5fb3102120)\n\nThat was impressive, but more of a script than a real program. Hence task number two: I asked ChatGPT in plain English if it could write an ant simulation with the following specifications: The simulated ants should start from random positions and move randomly across the screen. They should leave a scent trail (which dissipates after a time *t*) and be able to smell scent trails within a radius *r*. If an ant smells a scent trail, it will follow it. It took ChatGPT three attempts to solve this task in 89 lines of Python code (PEP 8 standard, including comments), but the result was stunning (Fig. 3).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig. 3: An ant simulation in Python using Pygame developed by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The ants \\(black dots\\) leave a scent trail as they move \\(light grey\\).](https://preview.redd.it/yup6wi5ub1da1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5fcc7c7cba183a295a71cc6cf46a170d3fcba17)\n\nOf course, programming is more than just formulating correct commands in a given programming language: Programs should be designed to be clear and maintainable. A whole discipline (software engineering) deals with the proper design of software. Today, object-oriented programming is by far the most widely used concept for structuring programs. Don't think that ChatGPT wrote some [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). On the contrary, the ant simulation was based on an arbitrarily extensible ant class (classes are a basic concept in object-oriented programming).\n\nI think it's becoming clear what we're dealing with here: ChatGPT is a giant step towards a completely new way of developing software. While until recently a programmer had to strictly follow the rules and syntax of programming languages, ChatGPT allows you to convert plain English into computer programs. This will make it exponentially faster and cheaper to implement new ideas. Programmers will be able to work with breathtaking efficiency and will be able to focus more on other tasks, such as optimization, since large parts of the software can be written automatically.\n\n# OpenAI's Technology Puts Microsoft in Pole Position\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) invested [$1 billion in OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/microsoft/) in 2019, without disclosing its stake in the company. Considering OpenAI's advanced technology, it was a brilliant move. A year earlier, Microsoft [acquired Github](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/) for $7.5 billion. You can think of [Github](https://github.com/) as a giant \"database\" of source code, which of course can be used to train AI. Microsoft has already built its own AI application using [OpenAI's Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) and trained it with the \"billions of lines of code\" stored in Github repositories: [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), which was announced in 2021 and released in 2022 as a plug-in for Microsoft's own Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) or others such as Jetbrains IDEs. Once installed, Github Copilot integrates intuitively into a programmer's workflow: she simply needs to write a desired functionality as a natural language comment in a program's source code, and Copilot will automatically generate code accordingly. As if that weren't impressive enough, Copilot learns and adapts to a programmer's unique style. While ChatGPT is not yet monetized, Github Copilot is already available as a paid service for both individuals and [businesses](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-business). Using OpenAI's technology to enhance Github Copilot is the next logical step, which is another reason why it shouldn't surprise anyone that Microsoft is reportedly planning another [$10 billion investment](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html) in ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI.\n\nWith the launch of Github Copilot for Business, Microsoft offers a B2B solution for automated code generation. Considering the global shortage of skilled programmers and the current cost-cutting and layoffs in the tech industry, automated code generation is an attractive way to increase efficiency. This creates a whole new market for Microsoft.\n\nIt should be mentioned here that AI code generation also raises new copyright issues. The first [copyright lawsuit](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446821/microsoft-openai-github-copilot-class-action-lawsuit-ai-copyright-violation-training-data) was filed against Microsoft, OpenAI and Github in November 2022. Since every AI model currently in existence must ultimately be trained with pre-existing human-written code, this could result in copyright problems. On the other hand, there is a huge amount of open source code available under very permissive licenses that can be used to train an AI. Moreover, the same problem exists with human-written code. There is a running joke among developers that programming consists mainly of assembling code snippets from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (a very popular site for solving programming problems). Every new disruptive technology raises fundamental ethical and legal questions. I doubt that technological progress can be stopped in the long run, even if there is a risk here in the short to medium term.\n\n# What about Alphabet?\n\nWhile everyone is talking about ChatGPT, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) continues to develop its own AI code generator away from the public eye. That doesn't mean Alphabet doesn't have advanced algorithms up its sleeve. In 2014, [Alphabet/Google acquired DeepMind](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind), one of the market leaders in artificial intelligence at that time. In December 2022, DeepMind researchers published their progress in developing AI code generation and made the [cover of the prestigious journal *Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq1158). DeepMind's AI AlphaCode reached the top 54.3% in programming competitions. It should be noted that this paper was submitted in April 2022, so the presented results reflect the state of development at least about 9 months ago.\n\nAlphaCode solved competitive tasks on the Codeforces platform, which are posed in longer texts (Fig. 4), and produced better results than 54.3% of human participants. If we assume that rather experienced programmers participate in such contests, this result is overwhelming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fig. 4: DeepMind's AlphaCode in action solving the \\\\\"Running for Gold\\\\\" problem. The expression that AlphaCode is currently focusing on are highlighted. \\(https:\\/\\/alphacode.deepmind.com\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dhxzrcq5c1da1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d06a43a7a90908006f3600740447716c28a7388)\n\nTo compare AlphaCode with ChatGPT, I asked ChatGPT if it could find a solution to the \"Running for Gold\" problem in C++ (Fig. 4.). ChatGPT immediately found a solution - a correct one as far as I could test it. However, I do not know if ChatGPT has seen this exact problem and solution before during its training.\n\nWhile AlphaCode's ability to solve algorithmic problems is impressive, the majority of programmers' daily work does not involve creating fancy algorithms. Today's mobile or web apps are mostly built using open source libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), where a lot of functionality is already built in and does not need to be written from scratch. Github Copilot has been trained on huge amounts of source code from applications using these libraries and is already fluent in them.\n\n# Microsoft's Bing is Unlikely to Challenge Google Search in the Short Term\n\nMicrosoft is reportedly planning to use the technology behind [ChatGPT to improve its Bing search engine](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-working-on-chatgpt-powered-bing-in-challenge-to-google?irclickid=14syV4RjKxyNWT9W9ywHf2h8UkAwMeVfcQCh3A0&irgwc=1&utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=cpa&utm_campaign=10078-Skimbit+Ltd.&utm_term=businessinsider.com). Given the popularity of ChatGPT, this would be a major attack on Alphabet's Google Search, but I would be cautious here. A single dialog with ChatGPT currently causes compute costs in the [single-digit cents range](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599671496636780546). OpenAI founder Sam Altman recently called the computational cost \"[eye-watering](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665)\". Using ChatGPT to improve Bing may be a way to create a great search engine, but probably not a profitable one. With Google Search, Alphabet operates a search engine of unparalleled scale. It is questionable whether Microsoft could scale ChatGPT and make this technology available for every search query on Bing at the scale that Google Search is used in the short term. And in the long run, I expect Alphabet to be able to build a comparable transformer-based neural network model into Google Search.\n\n# Microsoft Has Just Begun to Integrate OpenAI's Technology Into Its Ecosystem\n\nIn October 2022, Microsoft announced that it would integrate OpenAI's [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) image generator into its new [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/) app. Just as ChatGPT can translate plain English into source code, DALL-E 2 can translate plain English into images. The results are impressive, there seem to be no limits to digitally depict the human imagination. In addition, you can have your own images processed by DALL-E 2 using the [Outpainting](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-introducing-outpainting/) feature. In the long run, Microsoft could attack even Adobe products like Photoshop with its Designer. If you think about it, there is hardly any software in Microsoft's ecosystem that could not be revolutionized by OpenAI's technology. Out there are now countless good text editors, presentation editors, and spreadsheet programs, many of them open source. Aside from cosmetic changes, the development of these ubiquitous tools has stagnated in recent years, and Microsoft has been able to maintain its market position only through its sheer size. With OpenAI's technology, Microsoft could once again make its software unrivaled, as it last did in the 1990s. Imagine Microsoft Outlook responding to your emails with a short command, Microsoft Word autocompleting your text ideas, and Microsoft PowerPoint presentations magically coming together. The technology is there, or as William Gibson once said: \"The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed.\"\n\n# Conclusion\n\nConsidering the future possibilities of AI code generation, Microsoft's acquisition of Github and its investment in OpenAI has put the company in a superior position. While Alphabet's AI code generation models are still in the research phase, OpenAI's technology has long left the ivory tower and is already available as a commercial plugin for Microsoft's widely used Visual Studio IDE via Github Copilot. In addition, OpenAI's technology will allow Microsoft to improve every niche of its software ecosystem and provide unrivaled services after years of stagnation. On the other hand, I don't currently see Google Search threatened by an integration of OpenAI's technology into Microsoft's Bing, given the wide technological moats, e.g. in terms of scaling.\n\nEven though Microsoft is currently ahead of the game in AI text and code generation and OpenAI has already developed products to market, while Alphabet is still holding back on its AI technology, I doubt that Alphabet won't have the capabilities to catch up in the foreseeable future. If I had to choose between investing in either company, I would currently prefer Microsoft, but at its current valuation Alphabet is also a fantastic investment. So I have long positions in both companies.\n\n**This is not financial advice.**\n\nMy positions:70 x Microsoft (MSFT) bought for 213.11‚Ç¨ per share on 01/11/202350 x Alphabet A (GOOG) bought for 84.35‚Ç¨ per share on 01/03/2023", "id": "10g7orf", "created_utc": 1674149538.0, "score": 107, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "I recently used ChatGPT for the first time and my mind was blown (it's scary honestly).

Here is the response,\n\n\n\n> ChatGPT is a language model that can generate text based on the examples it has been trained on and the context provided by the input. While it can generate code snippets, it does not have the ability to create original code or understand the logic or meaning behind the code it generates. It can only generate code based on patterns and examples it has seen during its training.
