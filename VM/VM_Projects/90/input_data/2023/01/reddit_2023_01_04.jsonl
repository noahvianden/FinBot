{"title": "$TSLA: Is Now the Time to Invest?", "selftext": "Despite the recent turmoil in the stock market, electric car company Tesla's share price has plummeted about 70% in recent months, making it the second-worst-performing stock in the S&P 500. This marks the sharpest decline in Tesla's history, and six analysts have downgraded the stock in just the past two weeks.  \n\n\n**But is this downturn a once-in-a-decade buying opportunity? Or should investors steer clear of this troubled stock?**\n\n## On the bear side\n\nTesla has faced several challenges recently. The company missed its delivery estimates for the third quarter. While management previously projected 50% growth in annual deliveries, the CFO recently stated that this goal would not be met this year. Tesla attributes the problem to its batch shipment strategy, which has led to logistics bottlenecks at the end of each quarter. The company is working to resolve this issue by smoothing regional builds and distributing shipments evenly throughout each quarter. \n\nHowever, investors are concerned that the delivery shortfall may indicate weaker demand. These concerns were only exacerbated when Tesla doubled its Model 3 and Model Y discounts. In addition, Tesla has temporarily closed its Gigafactory in Shanghai due to a surge in COVID-19 cases in China following the government's relaxation of zero-COVID policies. As the largest factory by car output, according to The Wall Street Journal, the closure of Gigafactory Shanghai may lead to even lower fourth-quarter deliveries than previously expected. \n\nFinally, some analysts have expressed concern about CEO Elon Musk's focus on Twitter, suggesting that he may need to pay attention to Tesla and its shareholders at a time when the company needs strong leadership.\n\n## On the bull side\n\nhowever, it's worth noting that Tesla has sold more fully electric cars than any other automaker in the first nine months of the year, capturing an 18.5% market share. In addition, the company reported an industry-leading operating margin in the third quarter, thanks to its continued focus on manufacturing efficiency.  \n\n\nFurthermore, Tesla is poised to become even more efficient in the future. The company already pays less to manufacture battery packs (the most expensive part of an electric car) than its competitors, and its new 4680 battery cells are expected to cut these costs in half. Tesla is also increasing output at new plants in Texas and Germany, with the Gigafactory Berlin expected to significantly lower logistics costs in the European market, the second-largest electric car market in the world.  \n\n\nDespite the current delivery setbacks and softening demand, Tesla still believes it can achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over the long term. This puts the company in a solid position to take advantage of the expanding electric vehicle market, which Transparency Market Research predicts will reach a total of $1.9 trillion by 2031, with annual growth of nearly 30%.\n\n## My opinion\n\nUltimately, while the bear case for Tesla is compelling, it centers on short-term issues. If the company struggles with weaker demand, it is likely due to high inflation and rising interest rates rather than a fundamental problem with its vehicles. As such, demand should recover as economic conditions improve. Additionally, the Gigafactory Shanghai will reopen, and Musk plans to step down as CEO of Twitter. For these reasons, now may be a good time for investors to consider buying into Tesla stock.  \n\n\n**Despite its recent stock price decline, Tesla still has a market capitalization of $355 billion, making it worth nearly twice as much as the next largest automaker. With shares currently trading at 5.2 times sales, a significant discount to the historical average of 11 times sales, the sell-off may present a good opportunity for investors willing to take on risk.**  \n\n\n*I'm considering starting to build a position.
