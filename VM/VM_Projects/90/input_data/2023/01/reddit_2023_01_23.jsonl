So extrapolating valuation over the last couple decades makes no sense.\"\n\nThe world economy is shifting away from a high-growth bull environment and undergoing macro, secular changes that will drag down stock valuations in 2023 and beyond, according to Tim Gramatovich, chief investment officer of Gateway Credit Capital. \n\n All this is poised to hinder global growth, Gramatovich warned, which leads him to believe that stocks should be trading closer to 10 times earnings, rather than today's multiples of 18 or 20. \n\n \"When the tide goes out, large companies with lots of liquidity tend to be very aggressive on pricing to cover their fixed costs, crushing smaller competitors,\"...But while stocks are poised for a downtrend, the outlook on debt is brighter.

Zuck obviously knows the problems with his traditional platforms that I listed above, hence he renamed the company and is betting the farm on VR (personally, I believe is he is fedup at being at the mercy of the App Store and Google Play.

I think there is immense potential for VR access to sporting events, concerts, etc - imagine putting on the goggles, logging in, and being courtside with your friends around you or in a VIP box, while watching the match or performance. that would be so fun.

{"title": "Bulls continue to show unbullievable strength… 1-23-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "I hope everyone had a great weekend. As I mentioned last week and really for the last 2-3 week I am bullish on the markets and the bulls notched another win today. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jof46q5c2vda1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3e464437d6c200ef44ec315613e465d7e15a85\n\nDoing a slightly zoomed out look today on the daily chart to show you a few things I am eyeing. The first is the “we are here” tag from back in November. If you remember in October we did a ton of consolidation before we started out leg up. That was followed by an aggressive pullback and then that led to a bigger push up before we entered the consolidation in December around CPI. I believe we are in a similar time period. \n\nWe have FOMC next week and as of right now it seems all but ensured that we will get a 25bps hike. This is bullish for markets and I believe many are expecting the fed to pause after this hike. A pause come when we go to no rate hike or decrease of rate hikes. Now this is NOT the pivot yet as we need a negative bps for that… however, if JPOW next week confirms after this meeting we are going to pause (0bps) and see what the inflation does… I think we are without a doubt going to tag that 417.74 bear market pivot line and break into a new “bull market.” That is my current thesis and currently what I believe is that we are on a road to at least 410 and we very well could breakout as high as 427 before FOMC next week. \n\nHowever, on the of chance that JPOW says we need additional 25bps or like some of the other fed members mentions that they still want to see the federal funds rate higher and the wanna continue with 25bps for a while… then I think that will top our rally and bring a bigger retracement much like what happened in September and December post FOMC. \n\nOne very bullish thing to note today is that we had a breakout triangle on the daily formed and we clearly broke through that resistance today. Many people cited that the previous bear market trend line (green on my chart) that was at 399.7 was still valid and would reject us… however, we have clearly broken through that and we are clearly over that line with another close… the last bears defense comes at the red line which is the current bear market resistance line. That level is 402.6 tomorrow. If bears can hold us under that line then there is a chance we come back down to 390. However, the bulls were able to close over the daily 200ema finally. If they can close a full candle over that 398.1 level tomorrow that will be very bullish going forward. If the bears take back the daily 200ema tomorrow at close I will re-evaluate the road to 410. \n\nKey support- 399.1 -> 396.8 -> 395.9\n\nKey resistance- 401.5 -> 405.2 -> 407\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e46e5tqc2vda1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=44f7ba3679f086038a5aae2785a1908acba09fce\n\nFutures also look incredible bullish with a nice support bounce off the daily 8ema and closure back over the daily 200ema with a break through of that triangle. Bulls wanna try and close at 4035 if possible in the next 45 minutes. \n\nOne key note here is we broke out and touched 4055 and rejected hard there earlier today. That level is the December CPI resistance. That will be a key level we watch tomorrow. \n\nSupport- 4020 -> 4008 -> 3985 -> 3965\n\nResistance- 4035 -> 4055 -> 4080\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/532kmw7d2vda1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=51cf3410f4d76dfbf1db6f2979d5d70a663e6c29\n\nTesla looked extremely bullish today and extremely strong today. Tesla came out swinging putting in a nice 7.74% green day. Tesla has officially closed 10 candles OVER the daily 8ema…. This is the first time it has accomplished that since the September sell off began. It has not closed 11 days over its daily 8ema since July. \n\nThere as a red rising wedge on the daily, however, bulls pushed through that and now turned that into the current blue bull channel. With a closure over the daily 8ema and a presumptive 8/20 ema crossover on Tesla I am very much so still expecting some upside. However, much like last week after a big push up we very well could expect a retrace to retest support before we continue this push upward. \n\nWith earnings on Wednesday Tesla really is a wild card. \n\nSupport- 139.5 -> 136 -> 133.4 -> 128.7\n\nResistance- 143.8 -> 146 -> 150\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1aq3jh8e2vda1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab4cd6718a04b98fa547ffae37fb8a18ed4d972\n\nThere is a potential bull flag formed here on the daily chart of the VIX. However, we closed lower than Friday and we did break the support line. We are still holding that 19.7 support and do not seem to want to hold under neath that for very long. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nStarted the week off right with some nice wins on SPY and Tesla 4dte swing calls… closed them unbelievably early but I don’t like to mess around with swings especially short dte… that is the hard thing about swings. IF you are right it’s a win and you pretty much have to take that win right at open or be ready to lose it all. The best way is always to recognize the win or loss and reposition with what the intraday gives you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpfj6lse2vda1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a790fe6e1c0dc394b4c1a76cf29f2a1650ca3b1\n\nNice green day to start the week off right. This is now my 5th green Monday in a row! I was interested in some SPY 18dte calls overnight for a play for that 405 to 410 touch but decided to sit cash and see what tomorrow brings. \n\nI am slightly concerned we could retest the 200ema which would be a better entry for longer dte calls.", "id": "10jo277", "created_utc": 1674509323.0, "score": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4073|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10bc8s6/are_the_bulls_or_bears_in_control_11323_spy_es/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/109jd7z/cpi_prediction_and_analysis_11123_spy_and_tesla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxm2pi/is_the_santa_rally_over_122822_spy_es_futures_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zhbkpu/12922_spy_weekly_market_analysis_and_recap_plus/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/107r60k/the_fake_breakout_1923_spy_es_futures_and_tesla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zazoex/is_the_bottom_in_or_is_the_next_top_in_12222_spy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Expecting a push to 410-417 before FOMC next week.
