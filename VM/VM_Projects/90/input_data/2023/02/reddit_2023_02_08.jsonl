The service shed 2.4 million subscribers as the company raised prices, bringing its total to 161.8 million. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected 162.7 million.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share came in at 99 cents for the fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 31, beating the Refinitiv consensus estimate of 78 cents.\n\nRevenue hit $23.512 billion, ahead of Wall Street estimates of $23.4 billion.\n\nNet income came in at $1.279 billion, below analyst estimates of $1.429 billion.\n\nChief Executive Bob Iger, who came out of retirement in November to run Disney for another two years, is under pressure to improve financial performance at the Mouse House.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/disney-earnings-beat-estimates-visitors-crowd-theme-parks-2023-02-08/", "id": "10xb6g2", "created_utc": 1675891293.0, "score": 251, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "They also announced they're bringing back the dividend before the end of the year.

Say they have to issues 10% more shares after a 35% share price drop.\n\nSo now you’ve sitting with the same total share count, with no cash in your pocket, and a company in a weaker position.\n\nThat’s the downside of buybacks.
