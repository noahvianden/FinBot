SOFI currently offers [3.75% APY on savings and 2.5% APY](https://www.sofi.com/banking/checking-account/) on checking when members set up direct deposit. JPM is offering [0.01% APY](https://www.chase.com/personal/savings/savings-account/interest-rates) n their savings accounts, and the largest APY that [BAC offers is 0.04](https://media.bac-assets.com/DigitalDeposit_NY_NY_Tri_State_Area.pdf?cacheBuster=8627)%.\n* SOFI faced tremendous adversity with its student loan business. This became a make-or-break moment, and SOFI rose to the challenge and reinvested its business from the ground up.\n* SOFI is delivering and GAAP profitability is around the corner\n* The question becomes, what will SOFI accomplish in 2023 and 2024 when synergies between Galileo and Technisys are recognized, student loan originations are back to normal, and the Fed Funds rate is lower, which will make purchasing homes more attractive? \n* Mr. Noto will deliver large amounts of capital appreciation for long-term investors", "id": "10qxbhu", "created_utc": 1675264950.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "I am bullish on SoFi and have shares.\n\nThat being said this post really falls short of being informative. \n\n1.
