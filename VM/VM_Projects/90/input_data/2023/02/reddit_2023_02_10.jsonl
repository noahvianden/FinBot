What are stocks hiding?", "selftext": "If you had asked me 6 months ago if we would be in a full blown recession right now in February I would have said \"100% absolutely\". 75 basis point hike after 75 basis point hike, and yeah we only raised raised by 50, then 25 basis points recently.

Why is it that every single one of my friends, who all make between $60k-$100k are all spending on credit cards like crazy, hell EVERYONE including me has some credit card debt and I live frugally [https://www.cnbc.com/select/us-credit-card-debt-hits-all-time-high/](https://www.cnbc.com/select/us-credit-card-debt-hits-all-time-high/). The sharp increase we saw in oil prices in early/mid 2022 did not do much damage. J Powell trying to get inflation under control probably likewise will not do much damage. \n\nIs there going to be a recession? I am really good at stock picking, but looking at the forest and not the trees sometimes is hard for me. What am I missing? Is it that Q1 and Q2 numbers need to come out this year to prove we are in a recession? Everyone is spending like crazy, going on vacations they cannot afford and just putting it on credit cards. I called my bank last week to get a quote for a car loan and they said to me \"As of last Monday we no longer do car loans.\" My head is spinning. I know the market is forward looking, but the market cannot possibly be up as high as it is right now come end of June 2023 - if it is, or even higher, I will second guess everything in life going forward. \n\nMy food for thought: Q1 reports come out in the next several weeks and we just before that time see how up a creek companies actually are. It is revealed that the job cuts were to soften the blow of how bad many companies are doing right now. People hope for a speedy recovery, while J Powell just keeps raising rates by 25 basis points, maybe even throwing another 50 basis points here and there. Q2 reports come out and things are even shittier than before - markets begin to tank (slowly) similar to 2009. We have a recession that goes into 2024 and once everyone, myself included, thinks the sky is falling, the market begins to slowly creep back up and we all go on with life.", "id": "10ysbew", "created_utc": 1676036573.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "“How are we not in a recession”?\n\nWell - we have had positive GDP growth in Q3 and 4, and record low unemployment.
