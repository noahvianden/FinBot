{"title": "\"How Tesla Fumbled\" by Wendover", "selftext": "This is a heads up that \"How Tesla Fumbled\" by Wendover Productions is about to be released on YouTube. Currently it is only available with a Nebula subscription, and generally they will release videos to the public in a day. Their channel has about 4M subscribers and their videos typically get up to 10M views.\n\nThe content of the video seems mostly factual, but I do consider it an example of fairly biased reporting. Watching it felt like watching a bear that just took a TSLA short position and tries to highlight everything from the most negative perspective.\n\nThe dialog starts with the line \"Tesla has never been good at building cars\" and after that mostly talks about Tesla's low quality and shitty support, how they were failing to scale, long wait times, FSD is just driver assist, how they don't understand the Chinese market, and how they failed to be first with an EV truck. This video felt noticeably different from the standard Wendover style because it did not seem like he was trying to fact-find and explain why certain things may have happened, but just wanted to paint Tesla in a negative light.\n\nWhen this video drops on YouTube expect some massively increased bear talk. A lot of it is the same old FUD we are used to, but it seems the narrative has changed from \"competition coming\" to \"competition already here and winning\".\n\nDo with this information what you want, I'm just trying to give a heads up to my fellow TSLA bulls. ;)\n\nFor those with Nebula here is the link: [^(https://nebula.tv/videos/wendover-how-tesla-fumbled)](https://nebula.tv/videos/wendover-how-tesla-fumbled)", "id": "1198fur", "created_utc": 1677093400.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "Just watched it. Here are my thoughts on each talking point in the video. \n\n**EDIT: Updated as the original was unprofessional and I wanted it to not be condescending and more polished with sources.** \n\n1) \"Consumer Reports was objective.\" It has been debunked for years now that they do not differentiate between cosmetic reliability and operational reliability, rather lumping cosmetic problems in with operational problems. Early Tesla production did have quality issues, but it is rare now that they have gotten better at it. Not only that, it's weird to say Tesla makes bad cars *just because* of cosmetic issues, ignoring all the benefits. Every product has pros and cons. \n\n2) The 2018 production ramp was bad because they were behind. This is true but is weird to call out like it is still a problem. If anything Tesla's production has skyrocketed. Last year the produced and shipped around 1.3M vehicles and aim to do around 2M this year. Also it's worded as if no production ramp before Tesla has ever gone poorly or not on schedule. Lucid and Rivian are having the exact same issues that Tesla had, yet he uses Rivian as an example as a good manufacturer in the video. Lucid just posted pretty terrible guidance around growing production yesterday. If you want the best example, [GM delayed their goal of 400k](https://www.businessinsider.com/gm-delays-north-american-ev-production-goal-batteries-2022-10) to, you guessed it, they can't source and/or make batteries fast enough. So to highlight this problem as a current and Tesla-specific issue is very weird. \n\n3) \"Mach E is better than a Model Y\" That whole segment comparing specs is misleading and ignores the elephant in the room of better software, better charging, and ignoring price haggling from dealers. It also ignores Tesla's much better efficiency. A Mach-E may have more range on certain trims, but only because they use a much larger battery to get the same or better range as a Tesla. This means that Tesla can use a smaller battery to get the same range which leads to less real charging time, less raw materials per car and more cars overall from the same amount of raw materials. They do way more with less.\n\n4) \"Ford F150's closest competitors being Chevy Silverado and Ram trucks showing the EV versions\" Could the subliminal messaging be any more blatant. Both those EV trucks are not slated for release until late 2024 or even 2025.\n\n5) Hummer EV, Rivian, and Ford Lighting \"massive scale\" in 2023. Maybe Rivian, if they get their costs under control. Legacy auto simply does not have the planned production capacity even through 2025 to catch Tesla, even if Tesla was standing still. If he meant massive scale relative to initial production then that would be accurate but Sam states no explicit figures here. I forget who said it, but one of the analysts covering Tesla said something along the lines of \"many automakers are trying to hop on a flight from gas car city to EV city, while not having the plan to build the airport, runway, wings, engines, and training pilots\". \n\n6) \"First moves matter.\" This is naïve because it's not the only thing that matters with examples being Sony Betamax vs VHS, or Blu-Ray vs HD-DVD. Usually the best product for the best price matters, and even at that if it is available. A good example of that the GPU market. You cannot get anything high-end right now as it is unavailable, so at that point the new features and performance are moot. So even if someone introduced a better vehicle than Tesla, if they cannot produce it at scale, economics says that it will not succeed. \n\n7) He leaves out that Cybertruck starts shipping in Q2-Q3 of this year, with volume production next year. I predict Cybertruck production capacity will quickly exceed the F150 Lightning in 2024. That does not mean the F150 is a bad vehicle, nor do they compete with one another. People who have always bought an F150 will buy the lightning and people who want a recreational truck will buy a Rivian or the Cybertruck. People often make a fallacy that EVs only compete with each other, which is where this tribalism of similar brands and products comes from. EVs overwhemingly compete with gas cars. \n\n8) BYD figures include PHEV. This is publicly available information on their earnings reports and other websites. So no, they are not the largest BEV manufacturer. It just shows laziness or incompetency on his research. In terms of just BEV production (battery electric vehicles only), Tesla is the clear dominant leader in not just china but also the world. \n\n9) \"Tesla will always be a secondary player in China\". Tesla isn't even a secondary player now. Tesla is planning a true low cost mass market EV to release in a few years when which will release in China first where they are designing it. And even if they were China is massive. To even be successful as a foreign company is a massive achievement in itself for the reason he himself outlaid in the video. \n\n10) Tesla dropped Mobileye, not the other way around, because they did not offer a solution that fit their goal of FSD, not because of safety concerns. Tesla famously designed it's own Self-Driving computer because no chip manufacturer had a product that fit their needs of a low power, high efficiency computer for their specific use case of machine vision based driving. \n\n11) The FSD part is the only one I give him slack on and partially agree with. Yes Tesla has delayed many times, but it also costs him nothing to criticize it because no other company is as close as Tesla, only Tesla knows how far away they are from the end product. So to say they are \"far from it\" is guessing at best. Tesla is trying to develop a true Level 4/5 self driving system that drives using eyesight just like how we do, and can be dropped anywhere in the world and figure out how to navigate like humans do. It does not use LIDAR like Waymo or other self driving companies, with the goal of being able to be easily and rapidly scaled and low cost like any piece of software can to its fleet once complete. It does not require HD maps or at the very least only requires minimal GPS locating unlike LIDAR or radar based systems. So to compare it with other companies is moot because they have completely different approaches and problems. \n\n12) \"Tesla's ruined reputation from FSD has to have an impact\". If this was true then they would not be selling so many cars. Sure there are some disgruntled customers and I sympathize with them but it has been clearly labeled as an unfinished product. It is their risk as an early adopter of unfinished tech that it is still not done. I think Tesla should allow refunds or transfer of the software to new vehicles as it would be a good middle ground compromise. \n\n13) Tesla's favorability among Democrats in Oct-Nov plummeted because of Twitter. A cherry picked stat that has nothing to do with the execution of the company and is not a 1:1 indicator of sales. We saw that in Q4 earnings their sales were not affected by the Twitter takeover like many thought would happen, yet he ignored this in his video. \n\n14) \"Republicans don't buy EVs.\" Another misleading statement. *Most* people don't buy EVs. It is still below 10% market penetration in the US and has a lot of headroom to grow. \n\n14) Conflating Musk with Tesla is a dead horse at this point. Reddit has hated Musk for years now but their sales continue to grow. No other company has such controversial CEO. I don't defend him for his actions on Twitter or his sometimes divisive viewpoints, but the average person does not care about Musk and again just wants the best product for the best price. Much of the criticism I see online for Tesla is actually just criticism for Musk. \n\n15) \"There's nothing that separates Tesla left.\" Despite listing several things that separate them from others in the video that he just used to criticize them, I guess there is indeed nothing that separates them left. Oh except maybe the charging network, superior efficiency and tech, and overall better ownership experience for an EV. \n\n16) \"Legacy acting like the adults in the room\". This is a funny statement because many of those companies lobbied for years to stop EVs from happening and even flat out cheated on emissions tests (cough VW cough). It's only when Tesla started threatening their bottom line did they suddenly embrace them. Also Musk is arguably the only one not acting like an adult not Tesla. \n\n17) \"They could have been Ford GM and Chrysler.\" No because if they did then they would have failed. Why emulate legacy when disruption comes from doing things differently and innovating where they don't?\n\n18) The EV company market share graph is stupid and misleading. No one expects Tesla to maintain 80% market share, even hyper-bulls on this forum. What matters is absolute unit sales. It is mathematically impossible to maintain 80%, or even 50% market share. If there are 100 million EVs made annually in let's say 2035, and Tesla makes 20 million of them, that is only 20% market share, yet that is still 10x more EVs produced than this year's projections.\n\nIn summary, the video is either willfully ignorant or knowingly malicious. It reads like a dog whistle for Tesla bears. I am getting the same vibes from this as I did from that guy [who was confidently incorrect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w__a8EcM2jI) in predicting that the Tesla Semi would fail and was not possible (which he has still not reneged on). This video takes all of the uninformed layman talking points and changes some vocabulary and adds filler to make it seem \"smart\". But even a polished turd is still a turd. The conclusions being drawn at the end do not match up with reality.

And if you did, you would see that Tesla has a massive advantage, still.  \n\n1) You go on about the quality of Tesla vehicles. Those were earlier concerns. Largely, most of those concerns have been fixed and are practically non-existent in newer factories. From a manufacturing standpoint, of course Tesla was going to have issues. Their production is largely in-house, meaning, they are more than just a parts assembly plant. They actually manufacture most of the parts used for their own vehicles.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) You bring up Chevy Bolt. The same Chevy Bolt that GM warned customers not to park inside their garage because it can explode? The same GM that stopped Chevy Bolt sales because of that same reason for over 8 months? In terms of value per dollar, yes, the Bolt on paper is more economically priced than a Tesla. And yet, Tesla Model 3 sales are far higher than Chevy Bolt. By over 7x the unit sales of the Bolt, actually. Clearly, consumers would rather have a Model 3. So what is your point, exactly? To demonstrate that people are much more willing to pay a higher price for a Tesla than a more economically priced vehicle such as the Bolt?   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Next, you talk about the pickup truck segment. There's a reason Tesla didn't focus on the pick-up segment. Batteries in pickups and margins for EV pickups are not the same as ICE pickup margins. For Tesla, the bottleneck was battery production. They simply didn't have the capacity to produce a new vehicle class. The Cybertrucks will largely be designed for the American market. Model S3XY are designed for global sales. That is why Tesla focused on the global market first. Ford chose to produce the Lightning because pickup trucks ARE their brand. They can't risk the negative PR that would inherently exist if they allowed another manufacturer to do so. For Tesla, it wasn't as important for logistical reasons. For Ford, it was on the top of their to-do list from a branding and marketing perspective.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) You're comparing an auto manufacturing plant for a new product in vehicles going to China to Amazon and Home Depot? More on 10 o'clock news, retailers will have a more difficult time succeeding in a foreign country than an automanufacturing plant. Google didn't succeed in China for obvious reasons (security). Macy's? Brother. Macy's has been a failing business the past decade. This has nothing to do with China. BYD is a large player in China. So is Tesla. No one ever made the claim that Tesla would be the only EV manufacturer in China. You are correct that Tesla missed an opportunity with lower priced EV's in China but the goal of Tesla shouldn't be to dominate just the Chinese market but to be successful enough to where they are producing meaningful numbers. Funny enough, you don't mention the European market which Tesla is dominating in various countries. I guess you were too lazy on that one which is something I don't say often in your thorough research on other videos.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) I agree with your take on FSD. Musk and Tesla have both pushed it earlier than possible. However, they are still way ahead of their competitors. WAYMO, probably their biggest competitor, is geofenced technology. FSD is designed to be used anywhere. I estimate that it will take at least another decade for FSD to actually be implemented. The ROI for current users likely isn't worth it but if you keep your Tesla with FSD ($15k) for eight years, that's \\~$2k per year. It does really well in highways which is where most of the traffic comes from. Saving an hour per day, 300 days per year (working days), you're saving 300 hours per year not having to really control the vehicle. City streets, it needs a lot of work. Again, FSD has not been as successful as Tesla has touted and Musk certainly should tone his language down. What you also ignore or probably don't know much about is the fact that the government should be working with self-driving technology to improve the road and signs so it could work in-sync with this technology. Self-driving will inevitably be part of the future. A lot of self-driving failures has to do with poor road construction work and misplaced signs that cause confusion even with a human driver. NHTSA investigating Tesla? What else is new? They're still calling software updates to improve the vehicle function as a recall. NHTSA is outdated. FYI, you also didn't mention that drivers with enhanced AP+FSD have 8x less accidents than your average driver. Maybe you want to add that in if you are interested in the full details.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n6) Market share going down was always going to happen but the goal of Tesla isn't to dominate the market share of only EV vehicles sold (but that would be favorable, obviously) but to take market share from TOTAL auto vehicles sold and if you take a look at that number, it is INCREASING. Only a fool would believe that Tesla's EV market share would continue to increase. They had first mover advantage and other auto companies, as expected, will enter eventually. This isn't rocket science.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, you make great videos but leave the 'market analysis' of a company to others who cover it FULL-TIME managing billion dollar portfolios next time. The issue is branching to subjects that aren't your cup of tea. You don't see people covering companies all of a sudden making videos about cooking. You also didn't mention Tesla's supercharging dominance (the U.S. government is practically begging Tesla for help with their supercharging network) or Tesla's dominance in the energy storage and deployment sector, either. Again, two hurt parts of their company that you seem to not care or put any value into. This is not to say Tesla handled everything perfectly. They could have done things better. But consider that they had no experience producing any vehicles to producing the most amount of EV's and being the only auto company being massively profitable doing so (most profitable automaker in the U.S. in just five years whereas GM/Ford have been in operation for nearly a century), they didn't 'fumble' anything.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "🔥 🔥 🔥", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I like their videos, but this sounds like karma farming, but let's see how it will be perceived.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah one thing they pointed out was the declining popularity of Tesla, so they may just be trying to ride a zeitgeist wave?

I really dig deep in the potential $$\n\nIn my post I narrowed it down to be potentially Amazon project Kuipar. which is a huge satellite fleet that would result in Billions of dollars worth of these parts over the next 10 years.\n\n(IM PROBABLY LOSING YOUR INTEREST BECAUSE U DONT KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS, READ TO THE END I PROMISE U ITS WORTH THE TIME)\n\nWell Im fucking doubling down, here is fucking why.\n\nAdam Spice (Rocketlab CFO) a few days ago attended an event and did a presentation on Rocketlab\n\nAn investor asked about the new reaction wheels and he answered this and in his response he said two things that caught my eye\n\n\"our new 12ms reaction wheel is much bigger than we've ever done and is really targeted towards that one megaconstellation customer we haven't be able to name, but hopefully once they start launching those satellites, we will be able to disclose who they are\"\n\n\"and now we enter into an agreement with a mega constellation customer, were its THOUSANDS of reaction wheels per year, and much bigger reaction wheels, and what that does is allow us to build a dedicated, high volume production facility in New Zealand\"\n\n([Video of CFO talking about it](https://twitter.com/NutscapesNFT))\n\nHere is the info we ALREADY KNEW about this constellation. (please read my other post or you might be a bit confused as I might reference some info from their)\n\n\\-But in a nutshell these reaction wheels are designed only for satellites 600-650KG (this isn't roughly, it NEEDS to be precise),\n\n\\-Obviously a large customer if they built a facility + designed new product for this customer\n\nNow here is where Adam Spice fucked up. Just because he is not a satellite expert, does not mean us internet regards aren't. He gave way too much information and I have narrowed it to who it could be\n\nSo First off I went through every mega constellation planning to be launched (or already launched and sorted by the size of the satellite from 600-650KG\n\nThis really only fucking narrows in down to Amazons project Kuipar (Amazons starlink competitor), this is an abnormally large satellite, the only other sat that resemble the size range include the following (see my other post for exact breakdown)\n\nIn the video Adam Spice stated that they have not yet launched their satellites yet, which even further narrows it down to project KUIPAR (they have not launched yet)\n\nAdam Spice also said \"once they start launching those satellites, we will HOPEFULLY be able to disclose who they are\". THIS IS HUGE, THIS TELLS US THEY CANNOT DISCLOSE. they want to disclose the customer, but they cant\n\nWhy aren't they able to disclose it on their own terms?\n\nBecause the company they are launching for is a fucking public company.\n\nIf it was a private company they sold to, why would the private company give a flying fuck? also they won't be legally bound to not disclose it, it would be THEIR OPTION as manufacturer. (unless the private company made some weird confidentially clause, which would be very unusual and bizzare as a private company.\n\nAso we already knew it was going to be a huge contract given they made a new product and facility for it, but Adam nailed the cherry on top. \"We will be making THOUSANDS OF THESE for this customer\"\n\nNow each sat is different but its roughly 4 reaction wheels per satellite, (not much of a range, some could need SLIGHTLY more or less)\n\nThousands (PLURAL) of reaction wheels PER year IS A FUCKING HUGE FLEET\n\nwere talking A BASE Of 250 satellites per year (Its MORE, im just using 1000 per year as a starting)\n\nI went through Wikipedia, looked at all the data from satellite fleet size, if they have already started launching or not, public or private, size of satellites (Mass in KG)\n\nNot only does Amazon project Kuipar meet the criteria for ALL of these facts that we know, but all of them simatenaously. VERY FEW of these satellite fleets meet 2+ of these criteria, I could only find a few other other satellites fleets that even resembled the size (off by 50KG in sat size, but even then its hypothetical as reaction wheels must be put in place for exact size of sat), never mind the other conditions.\n\nSome other honourable mentions include\n\nTelesat constellation which satellites are 150KG oversized, and total fleet wouldn't even need 1000 reaction wheels total. (also planning to launch in 2025 lol)\n\nEVEN FUCKING SCRAPPING ALL THE CONDITIONS I LISTED ABOVE, from the video it sounds like the satellites will be launching soon\n\n[Project Kuiper launching sometime \"early 2023\"](https://www.satelliteinternet.com/providers/project-kuiper/)\n\nLets do some more fucking MATH!\n\nif they do supply reaction wheels to project KUIPAR.\n\n3236 Planned satellites to be launched\n\n100-120K per reaction wheel\n\n[Pricing sheet](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Uploads/Rocket-Lab-12-Nms-RW4-RW5-reaction-wheel-datasheet.pdf)\n\nLets go low end at 100k Per reaction wheel\n\n4 reaction wheels per satellite\n\n3236 Sattelites, (keep in mind Leo mega constellation sats die every 5 years roughly and will be replace with new reaction wheels)\n\nWere talking 1.3 billion of reoccurring revenue.\n\nAlso even if its not Amazon project Kuipar, which I really do think it is. There really isn't too many mega constellations planning to be launched anytime soon lol\n\nCFO at least confirmed with us that they will be making thousands of reaction wheels per year for this one mega constellation customer (IM TALKING ABSOULUTE BARE MINIMUM)\n\nHe said thousands as in plural\n\nso 2000 reaction wheels\n\nhe said per year\n\nso lets go 1 year\n\n1 years of manufacturing 2000 wheels per year for one customer = 200million $\n\nWhat are your guys thoughts? It seems clear as day to me. Can anyone point to who else this would be, im open to counter arguments?  is it just lack of knowledge on the sattelite parts and space industry the reason this hasn't reacted yet?

Call it $12.6bn without the restructuring charge.\n\nWithout these cuts, you have a declining business at 35x earnings (443/12.6).\n\nCut 25k people, save $7.5bn a year, and you have $20bn of earnings, assuming the core product offering's attractiveness doesn't further deteriorate.

Then they leave.\n\nSo you end up spending nearly half your time working with new leaders. This is apart from the time spent on boarding new employees. As you can imagine such teams have no direction as senior management are no better than laymen at taking strategic decisions. Team members are equally uninformed about their products and perform for the managers rather than customers.\n\nA large part of this change will be removing layers where they arent needed, focusing on few but important projects and ensuring they get done. Also stricter internal hiring processes ensure that you dont have unmotivated engineers who keep team hopping. So overall you should have a reasonable increase in efficiency while reducing costs. But reducing costs is not really the point, increasing efficiency is.\n\nAlso metaverse is an important investment for meta. So it doesn't make sense to cut costs.
