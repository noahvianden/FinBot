The awareness induces companies and consumers to take risk-mitigating actions, such as increasing savings and avoiding major investment projects ‚Äî which bode well for the economy.\n\nAnother boost to the economy is coming from the job markets, where the current excess demand for labor means laid-off workers will likely find new positions more quickly than usual. In addition, he said, given the largest job cuts so far have been in the tech sector, those highly skilled recently fired workers are also not apt to be unemployed for very long.\n\n‚ÄúIn science we use models all the time, and they‚Äôre simplifications of reality,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd part of the skill of the scientist is to know when to deploy the model and when not to or, in other words, to know the limitations of the model. And maybe I‚Äôm in a good position of knowing the limitations, given that it‚Äôs my model.‚Äù\n\n[CEO Confidence Picked Up in Q1, but CEOs Remain Pessimistic; Confidence Improved from 2022‚Äôs Lows, but Still Signals Caution](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/CEO-Confidence)\n\nIs the economy bad where you are at?

These are *not* typical. \n\nFed bankers have tunnel vision, and after Powell sensibly held out a bit hoping to give workers a bit of a moat, Feds did the only thing they even know how to do: dick around maniacally with rates.  They're like Will Farrell with a triangle.  They *have* to hit it incessantly, whether they should or not.  If they're not slashing rates they're jacking them up. \n\nAny sane observer, plus myself, could have told them that jacking up fed funds rate wouldn't cure covid, wouldn't grow replacement food, wouldn't make oil cartels actually produce enough energy, wouldn't unlock supply chains, wouldn't imprison corporate gougers, and wouldn't stop Putin.\n\nSo with each massive rate hike having no effect, I said... \"See?  Of course it didn't, because why would it?\"\n\nBut upon seeing no effects, they just banged their triangle harder.  With no effect.  And again, and again, and again.\n\nThere *are* solutions for each the actual cases of the present inflation, but indiscriminate rate jacking isn't one of them.\n\nThe Feds of the world will not realize this, and they'll harmfully overshoot.  They probably already have.  And they're been cheered all the way by vocal yokels.\n\nThe one benefit is that at least they've come off zero rates, so if and when rates need to be cut to more organically sensible levels, they now have some headroom to do that.  \n\nAlso, the current inflation isn't the boogeyman that bond billionaires and lemming-pundits have made everyone believe, anyway.\n\nYes, it sucks watching corporations gouge us.  But the macro picture is that everyone who wants a job has one.  And that means that even with fuel and food costing more, people are (mostly) able to pay for it.  Yes, it's squeezing them out of vacations or discretionary purchases.  And yes, it's probably hurting savings and retirement plans.  But it's not like how it would be if we had *normal* inflation, and especially not if unemployment were bad, instead of being at 70 year lows.\n\nThere's demand, productivity, and record low employment.  How I was trained, that's actually not too bad of an economy.  Yet, to hear pundits and redditors and news anchors and cocktail party waiters, this is the Great Depression times a hundred. \n\nSo I agree with the author, that this scenario *is* different.
