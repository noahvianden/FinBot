The reason for my post is that motorcycles are a luxury item for most and Harley is one of the most expensive based on cost of entry.   \n  \nInventory at dealers rose by thirteen thousand units from the same time in 2021 after they had spent years trying to knock down those numbers. Sales in the US are down nearly nine thousand units. HDFS, their financial services arm, set aside 51m in Q4 for losses which brought 2022 up to 145m in total.\n  \nFor a brand whose point of entry is over sixteen thousand and typically is in the high twenty thousand range these are continuing to be not good signs. Sales is not be helped by the fact they are continuing their supply chain surcharge which is a thousand or more on their most popular units.\n  \nhttps://investor.harley-davidson.com/news/news-details/2023/Harley-Davidson-Delivers-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-Financial-Results-Successfully-Completing-Second-Year-of-Hardwire-Strategic-Plan/default.aspx   \nhttps://s201.q4cdn.com/697889289/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/HOG-Q4-YE-2022-Earnings-Slides-2.02.23-FINAL.pdf    \n  \nI have no position in their stock, I am just a former owner of their motorcycles and likely a future customer should they choose to remove the surcharge. Dealers are going to be struggling this year and seeing sales decline in the US yet again while inventories are up will put pressure on the dealer network even more. \n  \nOh, on top of all that they will be importing a motorcycle (X350) designed and built in China with only their emblem added to the bike for their riding academy.
