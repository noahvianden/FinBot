I own a real estate firm. Technically there are times that an individual can get a higher dti ratio. We've seen as high as 50%. It isn't as common, but my point is that the dti info is misleading, it can easily go above 44% and does frequently enough, that it isn't surprising. I've seen 55% in some cases.  An average of 44% sounds excellent for the lenders. And in my experience the lenders are very strict and any exception is required thorough documentation and verification.  Generally the people that are going above the standard percentages on their dti have dual incomes and only one of the incomes can be counted because they just got a new job and the income can't count because they don't have two years of income in the same career field. Or they work under the table, are still going to school, or have another reason that makes sense. Those buyers don't mind absolutely maxing out their dti because in reality they have a better financial picture than the lender can recognize in their process.  Overall the average buyer is paying just as much or more in their rent than their mortgage to be.  This is my perspective coming from the Pacific Northwest.  So it does not apply to the entire nation as real estate is very local. That being said I haven't heard of or seen any lending standards that deviate from my experience in the northwest.

I am no expert on what the national forecast looks like for real estate, but I can say that I am a subject matter expert on the holistic outlook of what the real estate market looks like for the Pacific Northwest, specifically the Western Washington market. We have extremely low inventory and relatively high demand, even in this extremely unattractive interest rate climate. I would add that I am not bullish on housing, especially on the national scale. I have a bearish outlook overall . Before the year started our firm released a forecast that stated that we anticipated a 10% drop in the market overall. We saw 4.5% percent drop to start the year off and we anticipate another four to five percent drop in the remainder of the year. That being said, few people expect that rates will remain this high going into 2024. If they do, we probably can see another slight drop in our market of 3-5%.
