A better use for self driving capability is autonomous trucking, where Tesla has not shown any success and likely won't without a major acquisition.\n\nAlso, that margin decrease this quarter shows that there are some cracks in their ability to maintain levels of revenue growth.

It seems more the product of an inability to think than a meaningful product.\n\nMyself... I do look at all these numbers and more and also think about things holistically as well.\n\nFrom a holistic perspective, on Tesla's investor day they laid out a path to building a global sustainable energy economy and came up with trillions in net savings doing so. Now without getting into whether the numbers add up or not, it has long seemed obvious to me that moving to sustainable energy will be a massive net economic boon. So when I think of Tesla, single quarter results are of little meaning, because I view them as leading by far in an area where the rewards or riches in the coming years are far greater than what we have seen so far. I think that they have a very high chance of succeeding in capitalizing on those riches and we should expect long-run, Tesla's financial results to be very strong.\n\nAnd from a financial perspective... They are increasing production and selling the cars. This rapid growth will at times not align with short-term changes in supply and demand. Further, they have a path to cutting costs substantially over time, but the timing of those cost reductions may also not align with fluctuations in supply and demand. The natural result is we should absolutely expect to see weaker quarters profit-wise as they grow. So long as they are profitable and the outlook remains cash-flow positive the short-term fluctuations should not matter that much.\n\nAs to regulatory credits... From a theoretical standpoint I think they are irrelevant. I just view them as additional revenue and when they phase out, it will mean that production of ICEV's has declined sufficiently that the competitive landscape does not require them anymore.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hahaha consider deleting this post regard.

If you’re going to say Tesla is a cash burning machine, it’s a good (I’d say mandatory) idea to include the Statements of Cashflows (SOCF). Most companies have negative investing and financing activities, but negative operating activities is generally a bad sign. \n2. Looking into the operating activities is also smart. What expenses are the driving force behind negative operating cash flows? It will give you questions to ask and things to look for in the other statements. \n3. It’s also a good (again, probably should be mandatory for a DD post) idea to look at the Income Statement (IS). That can show you how revenues are rising or falling, along with cost to produce a product for sale. Now, if gross margin is negative, (others call it gross profit, it’s mainly before all the other expenses are deducted) that’s a terrible sign. It means it cost more to produce the product than the company sells it for. Negative operating income is generally not a good sign, but could be due to a lot of different things, and is something you should investigate. \n4. It’s also a good idea to glance at a Balance sheet (BS) and see if you can spot trends that may be worth investigating further. For example, if accounts receivables (AR) is piling up, maybe their having problems getting payment from customers. If payables are increasing, are they having liquidity problems and not able to pay vendors? Is inventory piling up and not selling? What do equity look like? \n\nThese are all basic DD you can do by simply looking at the financial statements, either Tesla’s year end or most recent quarterly. From there, you can get more things to investigate, look at, and pursue to see if your theory of Tesla being a cash burning machine, is accurate. \n\nOr you can just do crayon-drawing level DD and post it to WSB.
