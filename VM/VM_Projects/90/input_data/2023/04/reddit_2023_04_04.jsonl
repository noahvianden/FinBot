Churning out 4mln veichles more would not help at all (and the cheaper you make a car, the less you earn on it).

They are obviously not the best and below both the 2170s and 18650s used in Tesla vehicles. But they are better than any LFP cells and better than many commercial Li-Ion cells. The 4680s are at 244wh/kg. Most Li-Ion cells available for private purchase are between 225-250wh/kg. LFP is usually around 140-160wh/kg, though they are improving. \n\nTesla is also making these to be more structural, so a higher weight was expected. While it doesn't seem like they are there yet, the plan is to make the car lighter instead of focusing on the battery alone. If you can take weight out of the car by adding a little to the battery, that can be a net positive. An easy example is looking at pouch cells. They are super lightweight, hitting close to 300wh/kg. But they have no protections.
