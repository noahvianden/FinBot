{"title": "Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) has tremendous risks. And why GTA 6 is an even bigger deal than you think", "selftext": "TTWO jumped on news of GTA 6 release, and it may seem obvious, but let's figure out why this matters to analysts so much.\n\nFounded in 1993, Take-Two consists of three wholly owned labels, Rockstar Games, 2K, and Zynga. The firm is one of the world's largest independent video game publishers on consoles, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. Take-Two's franchise portfolio is headlined by \"Grand Theft Auto\" (345 million units sold) and contains other well-known titles such as \"NBA 2K,\" \"Civilization,\" \"Borderlands,\" \"Bioshock,\" and \"Xcom.\" Zynga mobile titles include \"Farmville,\" \"Empires & Puzzles,\" and \"CSR Racing.\"\n\nThey have had a checkered EPS history, with low and wildly varying EPS from year to year.\n\nYear         EPS\n\n2023 (TTM)\t-$7.29\n\n2022\t-$2.25\n\n2021\t$4.56\n\n2020\t$4.31\n\n2019\t$2.98\n\n2018\t$3.24\n\n2017\t$1.73\n\n2016\t$0.17\n\n2015\t-$3.68\n\n2014\t-$0.90\n\n2013\t$4.01 (GTA V Release)\n\n**Sony Acquisition**\n\nLet's make one thing clear - an acquisition by Sony is clearly their only way to return capital to their shareholders.  They have been courted by Sony in the past, and more recently under dubious circumstances it was \"leaked\" that they were going to be acquired by Sony for an estimated $20 billion. This has proven to be false, per Sony. However, Sony is the ONLY possible acquirer of a company like TTWO, and so let's figure out how a sale to Sony could occur.\n\nThe most recent sale of Activision to Microsoft gives us the most recent multiple for a potential sale to Sony. Activision sold with a sale price of $68.7 billion, with a TTM revenue of $7.528 billion. This gives us a revenue multiple of \\~9.12x.\n\nBungie was acquired by Sony in 2022 for $3.6 billion, with revenue of only $200 million, implying a multiple of 18x. This comes with a heavy asterisk of analysts saying that they vastly overpaid, which is true by our other examples below.\n\nZynga was also bought by TTWO for $9.5 billion on $2.8 billion of revenue, giving us a multiple of 3.4x.\n\nEpic Games' June 2020 financing valued it at $17 billion based on an estimated $5 billion in revenue, which is also a 3.4x revenue multiple.\n\nElectronic Arts trades at approx a 4.5x revenue.\n\nPlaydemic was acquired by EA for $1.4 billion, with revenue of $211 million in revenue, giving us a multiple of 6.6x.\n\nIf we were to assume that TTWO sells to Sony based on their TTM revenue of $5.35 billion with a floor multiple of 3.40x and a high multiple of 9.12x, this gives us potential sales prices of between $18.2 billion and $48.8 billion, quite a range but plenty of more room on the upside. Compare this with their current $22.8 billion market cap.\n\nHowever, there are a few things wrong with this assumption, namely GTA 6 and Sony itself.\n\nFirstly, the multiples we established were based on TTWO's TTM revenue, which doesn't take into account a massive title release like GTA6 that would not be captured in their revenue. In fairness, neither does any of the other mulitples we used. However, I would ask you about Epic Games, Zynga, EA, Bungie, and even Activision... did they have any titles coming out (before their sale) that are as hotly anticipated as GTA6? The answer is no, and so I think it is fair to not give as much weight to the floor as we should to our ceiling price.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly, a potential sale can only occur if Sony has the resources to fund it. And my fat conclusion is **no. They cannot buy it.** Firstly, while the MSFT acquisition of Activision has opened up the acquisition from the regulatory side, Sony simply does not have the funds or the ability to acquire it. They only have a cash balance $14 billion.\n\nAnd if you don't believe me, their CFO stated their company has only around $5 billion left to spend for acquisitions, which means they are most likely in the hunt focusing on smaller studios. They don't have the warchest of MSFT.\n\nWhat this means for TTWO is that they have no possible exit unless Sony's cash pile swells to a significant degree, because there are simply no other possible acquirers. And importantly, TTWO **simply does not generate significant free cash flow to their shareholders.**\n\nTTWO has to rely on cash flow generated from operations because they will not have a reasonable exit in the next 5-10 years. This means GTA6 and their other upcoming titles have to do a lot of work to bide them time for a Sony acquisition. No one thinks GTA6 is going to flop, but this industry has been mired in flops the last few years from major studios.\n\nDon't take it from me, take it from their 10-K:\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto and certain of our other titles, such as Red Dead Redemption or NBA 2K, are \"hit\" products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. Grand Theft Auto products contributed 14.6% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and the five best-selling franchises (including Grand Theft Auto), which may change year over year, in the aggregate accounted for 52.9% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. If we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful \"hit\" titles or sequels to such \"hit\" titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our \"hit\" titles or their sequels, our revenue and profits may decrease substantially, and we may incur losses.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGTA 6 is even a bigger deal than you think. If this flops, they don't make money. TTWO right now is a bet on GTA 6, full stop because they have no alternative but to continue independently, with no prospect of any suitors. They have to continue to deliver on big titles every single year.\n\nTheir historical EPS doesn't suggest a market cap of anywhere near $24 billion, even taking into account post GTA 5 years. There is tremendous risk at these prices in this company, it assumes they will never produce a flop.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "17qrtyt", "created_utc": 1699467447.0, "score": 250, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "Calls it is  \n\n\nEveryone will buy GTA6 no matter the price.

Iger, CEO, expressed optimism about the company's trajectory. He emphasized the foundational work done over the past year, which positions Disney to move from a period of restructuring to a phase of growth. Iger outlined four key areas for future success: streaming profitability, ESPN's digital transformation, film studio output, and parks and experiences growth. He's bullish on the opportunities ahead and is focused on creating lasting growth and increasing shareholder value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nEarnings Call Just in:\n\n\\- Board recommends instating dividend at the end of the year.\n\n\\- Pricing for Disney+ are expected to go up as they look towards growing the digital streaming business. They mention bundeling Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN. They also want to counter account sharing, similar to what Netflix did.\n\n\\- When competing with Netflix, Disney believes their IP and its quality gives them the ability to dial down expenses on marketing and 'series expenses', improving their margins compared to competitors\n\n\\- Disney plans to lean more into ESPN, stating it is the 'most popular brand on TikTok'. They are quite bullish about it.\n\n\\- FCF growth improvement is dedicated to decreased content spend. Whether or not they can keep up this trend is anyone's guess.\n\n\\- Disney does not want to license their core IP to Netflix. Even if licensing would provide some 'quick bucks', they think it undermines their value proposition and long term strategy for Disney+\n\n\\- Outlook on parks and cruises: Disney expects the performance of the parks and its cruises, both domestically and internationally, to keep growing. They mention not seeing any impact on the numbers from tougher economic conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it! Thanks!
