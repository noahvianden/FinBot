But not to say that this couldn't \"someday\" play some sort of meaningful role. Fiber comms has already mostly replaced cable in all the important areas.\n\nTo be fair, here they seem to be operating directly on light before it gets converted to digital for the first few layers of a Computer Vision network, which might circumvent that need for memory at least in those first few layers. I'm still VERY doubtful of their headline claims, but sure, at least it looks like some sort of progress.\n\nMore importantly, I wonder whether they are associated to Lightelligence.
