The market may be worried PayPal is losing market share. PayPal‚Äôs transaction take rate has steadily declined (in large part due to Braintree‚Äôs growth outgrowing higher margin branded checkout). In addition, new ceo and much of executive team has a lot of execution uncertainty‚Ä¶ can they pull a turnaround of PayPal‚Äôs operations and somewhat reckless capital allocation (overpaying for useless acquisitions in the last few years). \n\nPros: \nTransaction take-rate should stabilize as PayPal Braintree pricing should have some pricing power as it continues to take share and build out its economic moat - stabilizing and ultimately increasing transaction take rate. I see their competitive short term Braintree pricing as similar to Amazon‚Äôs strategy of super low prices to drive away potential competitors, then raise prices. Regardless of new competition, PayPal‚Äôs market share has stayed extremely strong thanks in large part to its fantastic portfolio of consumer apps and customer loyalty. PayPal and Venmo are easy to use, super apps, and are extremely popular with younger to middle aged consumers.
