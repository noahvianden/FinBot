Startups in stealth mode operate out of the public eye for various reasons, such as to protect intellectual property or avoid distractions. Gameplanner.AI will accelerate some of Airbnb’s AI projects, according to Airbnb.\n\nGameplanner.AI was cofounded by Adam Cheyer, one of the founders of Siri. When Siri was acquired by Apple, he worked alongside Steve Jobs. Cheyer later co-founded Viv Labs, which would become the foundation for Samsung’s voice assistant.\n\nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky has said that generative AI will radically change the platform and that he wants to use it as a “travel concierge” that learns about users over time and enhances their travel experiences -- for example, matching users with the right rooms or homes. \n\nThis deal is Airbnb’s first acquisition since 2019 and could pique some interest on Wall Street as to whether Chesky’s M&A strategy is shifting, potentially making Airbnb a more attractive acquisition. The company is profitable on a GAAP basis and held $11 billion in cash and liquid assets as of the end of September.\n\nAirbnb’s news follows reports that Google is in talks to invest hundreds of millions into another AI startup, Character.AI, which in March raised a $150 million at a $1 billion valuation in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup lets people create virtual characters or chat with AI versions of celebrities like Elon Musk or Albert Einstein.", "id": "17v7wnr", "created_utc": 1699984419.0, "score": 408, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Kind of insane the company was founded in 2020 and sold for $200 million just 3 years later", "score": 374, "replies": [{"body": "[Wiz was founded in 2020 and is valued at 10B in Feb 2023.](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/cloud-security-startup-wiz-now-valued-at-10b-raises-300m/)\n\nMy post was meant to be serious but upon typing it I realized there could be \"nobody beats the Wiz\" jokes about their name.", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "What do you mean no product?
