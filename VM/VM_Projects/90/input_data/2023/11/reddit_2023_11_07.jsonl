{"title": "As much as I agree with bears on macros, interest rates, bond yields, and the housing market, I think they might get burned one more time.", "selftext": "Here are the factors that could bite the bears in the ass one more time, and make a Santa Rally more than just a self-fulfilling prophecy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**- The American consumers is still greedy and still buying.**\n\nWhile consumer confidence has waned in October, it hasn't gone down too much, and hasn't actually stopped the buying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ay1wlzf25zyb1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d7fb00747462b0107000321c71004734756c47e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSurprisingly, the actual retail sales were up 1.8% mom for October.\n\nMedian household in the US spent 5.5% more yoy, as of the data from last August.\n\nDespite gloomy consumers and waning confidence, and almost every survey showing Americans are claiming to be spending less, it hasn't stopped them from buying more. And they are spending more than last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wz3uzrbl5zyb1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c661c3f8ab6651e6eca258d4115bbde9fc4b409\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**-The American consumer is still not shy with using debt.**\n\nQ2 for 2023 saw a rise of 4.5% consumer debt compared to Q2 of 2022. This could be a ticking time bomb, but it might have to wait until after Christmas shopping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-**Consumer habituation to inflation, and inflation cooling.**\n\nInflation is becoming business as usual now, while also cooling off. Things they really noticed like price of eggs going sky high, is going back down. Things that are still going up aren't going as noticeably high as before, or has become part of expectations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**- Oil prices haven't been able to break above $100, and are about to enter their low season.**\n\nWe are back down below $80 a barrel.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia has been trying to cut the output to increase the price, not all of oil producers have been doing the same cut backs. That's because many were already under the quotas. On top of that, Russia still desperately has to sell its oil. On top of that, China's economy isn't doing too great in case you haven't heard. Cutting down on one of the biggest oil demand.\n\nAnd now we're entering the low season for oil demand. All translating to less pain at the pump. Still some wiggle room for the American consumer. And CPI not getting too hot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**- Americans still have a strong job market.**\n\nThis is a double edged sword (as are many things on this list) and could come bite bulls back later.\n\nBut for right now, that means Americans could still be comfortable buying during the holidays. There's plenty of job opening to negotiate higher pays or move to a better paid position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-**The market got a boost of confidence with the perception that Fed hikes may not be around for too long.**\n\nMarkets might have taken a little too much comfort in the Fed pause, and the idea that the end to the hike is not too far now. While it might be true, it created a jump in confidence, pricing in the final rate hike for somewhere in 2024. Of course, it doesn't seem like they priced in the delayed impact of those hikes, even if they do end soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**- Too much doom and gloom narrative for too long, created a boy who cried wolf situation.**\n\nThere's been maybe too much doom and gloom narrative for almost 2 years.\n\nYou don't suddenly get a crash in the market, when there's already been so much doom and gloom, so much fear priced in, and you just add just a little more to what's now the usual doom and gloom.\n\nIn fact, historically, you get a crash after some big rally or the market throwing caution to the wind and getting too bullish.\n\nDoom and gloom has been too much business as usual now, and hasn't resulted to the expected downturn. Markets were expecting things like Evergrand to be Lehman bros 2.0, on an even bigger scale. Of course, this might just be a delayed fuse like everything else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion TL;DR:**\n\nWatch out bears, because Santa's Rally just might be coming to town and burn you one more time.\n\nWe not only have the right recipe for it, consumer greed is still ripe while getting accustomed to inflation, markets got a boost in confidence about the future of rate hikes, employment and oil won't play in your favor short term, but all the doom and gloom narrative you peddled, and all the expectations of a downturn, might have further delayed any real crash or downturn.\n\nBulls need to get high on their own supply at least one more time before we can expect anything resembling new lows, or any major stock crash. And it might not happen until the housing market implodes.\n\nBut don't worry, bulls and bears will all get their turns getting fucked sooner or later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "17q25w4", "created_utc": 1699385145.0, "score": 333, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|286|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Santa Rally might be coming just to fuck you bears one more time.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "As someone holding a calls in Jan I approve this message", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Short term bullish, mid term bearish, long term bullish.", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Too reasonable, ban please", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "Not reasonable.
