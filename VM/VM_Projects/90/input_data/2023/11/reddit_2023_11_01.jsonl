A 37 per cent increase in phone sales for Huawei, whose smartphone business had been written off as doomed since it was battered by US sanctions in 2019, is a victory for Beijing as well.\n\n…\n\nThe biggest challenge for Chinese smartphone makers wanting to become a serious contender in the global high-end phone market is stable access to advanced chips — which are in increasingly short supply because of US export bans. Even before US export controls went into effect last year, Taiwan’s TSMC had stopped producing advanced 7nm chips for Huawei in 2020 in response to US sanctions. \n\nWhat differentiates Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro models from local peers is that it is equipped with advanced 7nm chips that use homemade designs and manufacturing. That suggests a breakthrough in China’s semiconductor industry, producing advanced chips using existing older machines.\n\nThe latest chip industry trends are now stacked in Huawei’s favour. Growing demand for higher computing speeds from the artificial intelligence sector amid a global shortage of advanced chips has led to the rapid development of new chip packaging technologies. This allows chips to be stacked three-dimensionally in a high-density package offering higher performance while using existing chips", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "You think fundamentals matter anymore?
