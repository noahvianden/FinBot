{"title": "Microsoft stock hits all-time high after hiring former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman", "selftext": "Microsoft's stock reached an all-time high after the company announced the hiring of Sam Altman, the former CEO of OpenAI, to lead its artificial intelligence (AI) innovation leg. The stock rose 2.1% to close at $377.44, surpassing the previous record of $376.17. This surge followed Altman's ousting from OpenAI, which is the biggest stakeholder in the company with a $13 billion investment. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and left after Altman's firing, is also joining Microsoft. Analysts view this move positively, with some stating that it strengthens Microsoft's position in AI. The hiring of Altman and Brockman is seen as a significant win for Microsoft, reinforcing its standing in the AI industry.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/investing/microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai/index.html", "id": "1803y6d", "created_utc": 1700526930.0, "score": 428, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|115|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yay.
