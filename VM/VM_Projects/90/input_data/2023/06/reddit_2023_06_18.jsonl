{"title": "Anyone just selling far OTM Naked puts on margin account?", "selftext": "I have been doing this for several weeks now. I have mostly been selling puts on COIN (Current price fluctuating between 52-55). The premiums for even far OTM strike like 45-47 cc have been pretty decent.

I have taken few losses as I had to roll a CC but haven't had to roll any puts till now. I understand that since this is a neutral/slightly bullish market that my selling puts is working. In a bear market, it wouldn't be so wise and the stocks could just go lower and lower.
