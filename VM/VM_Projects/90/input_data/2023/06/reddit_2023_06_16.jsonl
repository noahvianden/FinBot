U.S. indexes enjoyed a broad rally, following the Federal Reserve’s announcement Wednesday that it would hold off on increasing interest rates.\n\nAI has been a hot topic all year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in November released the ChatGPT chatbot, which quickly went viral. Tech companies have rushed to embed the technology into products and features and have boasted their ability to use AI to drive cost savings as recession concerns persist.\n\nMicrosoft is a major beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and tangential products. On top of its hefty investment in OpenAI, the company provides the underlying computing power. Microsoft also has an exclusive license on OpenAI’s models, including the GPT-4 large language model that can spit out natural-sounding words in response to a human’s text input.\n\nMicrosoft has incorporated OpenAI tools into its Bing search engine and even the Windows operating system. At the company’s event in February to announce its Bing Chatbot, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said “it’s an exciting time in tech.”\n\nInvestors want to see what it all means for Microsoft’s earnings and revenue.\n\nIn April, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said she expects fiscal fourth-quarter growth for Azure cloud of 26% to 27% year over year in constant currency, with 1 percentage point of it coming from AI services. On Monday, in a public discussion with Microsoft technology chief Kevin Scott, Hood provided more specifics, saying that “the next generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.”\n\nIn the past four quarters, Microsoft has generated almost $208 billion in total revenue.\n\nScott went deeper on Hood’s prediction.\n\n“Because it really is a very general platform, we have lots of different ways that $10 billion of ARR is going to first show up,” he said. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue.\n\n“There is all of the people who want to come use our infrastructure, whether they’re training their own models, whether they are running an open-source model they’ve got or whether they are making API calls into one of the big frontier models that we’ve built with OpenAI,” Scott said.\n\nFollowing the event, JPMorgan analysts lifted their price target to $350 from $315.\n\n“While MSFT continues to encounter a broad wave of cloud optimizations weighing on Azure growth, we see it planting the longer-term seeds for success across Security, Teams, Power Apps and now the forward-looking OpenAI/ChatGPT investments,” wrote the analysts, who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock.\n\nWith Microsoft’s 46% rally this year, the stock has recouped all its losses from 2022, when investors rotated out of technology in anticipation of rising interest rates and economic headwinds.\n\nNegative sentiment around cloud growth and a contracting PC market led to pessimism on Wall Street last year. But the excitement around AI in addition to the cost-cutting measures that tech companies implemented produced a renewed bullishness.

{"title": "Reddit will be one of the easiest shorts of the decade", "selftext": "CAVA has demonstrated that euphoria is back in the IPO market. Shares doubled from initial price talks just because growth is surging indiscriminately every day. Reddit will do the same and may even double as well since 90%+ of braindead retail investors will think it’s a good idea because the site gets so much traffic. But Spez’s interview today cemented why the platform is doomed to fail in the long term. \n\nBy forceably ending the boycotts and installing their own mods a lot of subs will enter a death spiral. The platform already has tens of thousands of unique moderators willing to moderate entirely free and is going to ostracize them. Plus Reddit isn’t even profitable and will probably have to pay off any scabs it implements. No valuation currently makes sense for Reddit because they couldn’t make money even when they had tons of mods working for free. \n\nIf third party apps were so unimportant then Reddit should have been profitable off the desktop site and official first party app, but it’s not. Forcing third party app users to convert to the official app is not going to move the profitability needle at all, especially when considering how many will quit using Reddit altogether. I’ve been on Reddit for 12 years and moderate many subs and would potentially consider leaving entirely. I know there are a lot more like me as well. \n\nIn summary Reddit is one of the rare slam dunk shorts should it even manage to convince an investment bank to pursue a traditional IPO. The other option is a direct listing which would also be disastrous. VIX right now is at 2 year lows meaning puts (namely LEAPS) will be cheap at the outset, and will look even more attractive if Reddit surges day one.", "id": "14ahtm4", "created_utc": 1686874119.0, "score": 258, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|7 years ago\n**Total Comments**|9824|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/Gaston44, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Reddit is a terrible investment and will likely tank soon after going public.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "wait for the initial pump... then eventual dump... got it", "score": 167, "replies": [{"body": "Ride the pump, ride the dump.
