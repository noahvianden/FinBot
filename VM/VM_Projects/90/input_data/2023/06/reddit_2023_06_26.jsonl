Some things I thought about, and you probably did too.\n\nBraintree - People are extremely worried margin compression and they should be! Stripe and Adyen both have 20% net revenues in this segment, which tracks to gross profit margin for Braintree based on PayPal's accounting. Given the growth of Braintree, it makes sense that gross profit margin has fallen from 66% to 50% over the past several years. But Adyen has a 10% operating profit margin given that its primarily a fixed cost business, so 50% of gross profit flows to operating profit. So that gives a pretty solid floor for PayPal's operating margin in a steady state scenario. I know from reading the developer docs Risk as a Service is live and Fx as a Service is on the way, hopefully will see these services have a nice effect on gross profits.\n\nBNPL - Its small now, but its the highest growing segment of PayPal given management's disclosure. A little back of the envelope calculation, the fee structure is 3.49% + 0.50, with 80-90% of funding being ACH. If we assume 1 month funding costs and credit loss rate is 1% (from recent 10k), and you lose 0.50c to ACH, you have a 60% gross margin, pretty good and should lead to margin expansion in the long term.\n\nVenmo - No idea if this is profitable yet based on PayPal's disclosure but the checkout should be primarily ACH funded given the setup process. The fee structure is 3.49% + 0.50, so if you lose 0.50c to ACH, you have 80%+ gross margins on pure checkout! Unfortunately this is also the highest cost segment with the fact that P2P transfers require the ACH fee.  I really would like to see transaction expenses broken out for this segment. Though I have noticed that my friends and I are more likely to leave money in Venmo and treat it like cash, so Venmo does have the tailwind of being able to earn interest on this money and it reduces the need to continuously pull ACH transfers to Venmo.\n\nHoney and Rewards - I really hope that PayPal does something interesting with rewards. I know that Dosh powers rewards on Venmo and PayPal, so they get a 33% revenue share (1/3 goes to the user, 1/3 goes to PayPal, 1/3 goes to Dosh) which is pure profit. We have no idea how Honey is doing, but they were growing revenues at 100% YOY back in 2018, so hopefully they kept up this momentum. The reason I think rewards are so important is that if the user uses rewards for checkout, that 3.49% + 0.50 fee flows 100% to gross profit.\n\nZettle - I'm really curious to see PayPal break out their in store data. The last time we had information about this was in 2017, where Zettle's founder Jacob De Geer stated they had 6 Billion in TPV growing at a 70% rate YOY in an interview. But this was before Zettle entered the US and in the recent management call, PayPal noted they were working on in store capabilities for large enterprises which perhaps refers to Zettle. All we know is that it gets sorted to other transaction processing which is 10% of TPV, so thats the max it processes.\n\nFedNow - I don't know how FedNow will affect the payment space in the long run but I think it would be really beneficial to Venmo. FedNow costs 0.05c per transaction vs ACH's 0.5c per transaction. If FedNow replaces ACH as the funding mechanism for Venmo, then the P2P transaction expenses will ideally drop 90%. Venmo processes $250 billion in TPV and if we assume that we have PayPal's average transaction expense of 1% thats $2.5 billion. Best case scenario, transaction expenses will become $250 million for Venmo and it achieves gross profitability! Of course, since PayPal doesn't break out this information there is no way to know if this estimate will come to pass. But even a 50% reduction in transaction expense would push Venmo to profitability.\n\nApple Pay - It gets lost in the narrative, but Apple Pay has an interesting dynamic with PayPal. Apple Pay definitely steers people away from PayPal's checkout button which is unfortunate, but they have some advantages too. Merchant's who use PayPal can accept Tap to Pay through their phones without extra hardware. Additionally, management says that this year you will be able to add your PayPal and Venmo credit/debit cards to Apple Pay, so PayPal can start earning interchange fees on this. As the partnerships get worked out, I think the best way to consider the relationship is that Apple Pay will help drive volume to PayPal at the in store POS at the expense of margin. I'd like to see the relationship develop a bit more before making judgements.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Honey and Zettle are both a dud.
