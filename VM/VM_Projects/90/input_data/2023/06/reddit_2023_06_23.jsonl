It is basically play money for the spoilt brat that is MBS, who has sole oversight of the fund (currently over $650 BILLION). So if you wonder why tech stocks are going up recently, its because of idiots like MBS and his ilk who are sitting on far too much cash don't know what to do with it.\n\nWell, lets have a look at one of their worst bets: LUCID.\n\n[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/cciv](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/cciv)\n\nThey bought in at a fantastic $22.59 back in 2021 (even though everyone with half a brain knows it was a scam), so now they own 65% of that useless company.\n\nNow they trade at $5 a share (LOL)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlp770tvks7b1.png?width=1431&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4c2b91d36edda5de3c07eee6f239a6cb7d4f7af\n\nSo they are currently bagholding their $36 billion investment at $9 Billion, thats a $27 Billion dollar loss!\n\nSo as the morons with too much money figure out what to splash their money on (say Ronaldo, Newcastle United etc.) they pump asset prices one last time.\n\nMeanwhile oil prices continue to decline despite Saudi's voluntary output cuts, and a global economy pushing itself into recession because they central bankers think theres a wage price spiral not a corporate profit surge.\n\nGood luck MBS on your other horseshit investments.", "id": "14h2nbz", "created_utc": 1687536912.0, "score": 179, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|24|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: MBS buys $65Bn worth of useless electric cars and $36 Bn worth of bitcoin last year.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This isn’t really accurate.
