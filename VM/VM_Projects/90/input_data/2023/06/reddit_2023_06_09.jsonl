{"title": "All eyes on CPI and FOMC next week… 6-9-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Weekly Analysis and Recap", "selftext": "So I want to first start this off by clearing a few things up… Wednesday I made a post looking for $400 basically by middle of July… then what happened over night? Well yesterday markets called for a pump so I had to be bullish for today… there is a very different time frame to have on some of these posts… that $400 target is a 30-45dte target… however, I still have overnight and intraweek moves that may inverse that… This market is ruthless and can not make its mind up for more than a minute sometimes…\n\nWith that being said I am bearish for Monday… based on todays technicals… we will get to that but lets talk about CPI and FOMC first… \n\n**EVENT CALENDER** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vdvc1xsra25b1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=856d68d20c8024195ae60ded1065d4eb330bc50d\n\n**CPI/ FOMC**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pb5ceqdsa25b1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=65a0d5f3c8f957fc36b9ba995afd4e1d5014f011\n\nI am waiting on bloomberg terminal numbers right now… hoping to get them this weekend (if anyone has access DM me… if not I gotta wait on one of my other sources)… but the way im seeing it right now is that cleveland fed nowcast and consensus are all pretty much spot on… the biggest thing to note here is that CPI is calling for a print in the 4s… we even if all goes well could see a print in the 3s! that would be wild to be honest… also note for next month nowcast is already calling for a 3.3% CPI print!\n\nSo the question is how do we trade this and what is the market going to do? Well I would NOT trade this at all… why? Simple… its been months since we have had a decent reaction that would make the risk to reward of the payout worth it…\n\nNow how will the market react? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrpc2wqsa25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ace0c7cad3059aaf407f893cf154eed7453e57\n\nAs you can see here the last month things have been very up and down… but as of current time of writing this… the markets see the highest odds of a PAUSE at this meeting next week… now this is where I still think the markets have it wrong… there has been ZERO indication for JPOW about a pause… pretty much every time JPOW himself has actually spoken he has ALWAYS said he is going to do a 25bps hike and that there is NO RATE CUTS this year… now this is really where I think markets have it all wrong…\n\nThe markets were pricing in 75bps of cuts by EOY… Impressively… the markets now have the highest odds of NO RATE CUTS by end of year.. I do think the markets finally have this correct… however, while the odds may be correct now…. I do not see the markets reacting correctly… \n\nI do think if JPOW hikes 25bps on Wednesday (which is highly probable in my opinion) that we will see a negative reaction to that… but I do see that as a likely call entry opportunity whenever that sell off stops… \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlrqya6ta25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a445f6d02a1ef279bea32f5dd85c06c04a358bf\n\nWell after putting that 426.6 demand in we have now immediately turned around and put a new supply in at 429.13… however, do you see the issue with it? We are imbalanced.. why? Simply because today we are going to close higher than where the supply is put in… that means markets will need to come back down OR immediately turn around and make a new demand Monday… \n\nOne interesting thing is that since pretty much April 26th SPY has not broken through a previous demand after establishing a supply… what do I mean… I mean lets take that 410.2 demand… after markets put that in and put in a new supply (was around 420) the markets held that 420.1 demand and did not close below it… we have been stair stacking (bullishly) new demands since 404 area. \n\nHowever with 3 supplies here at this 428-430 area now this has become one extremely strong resistance… \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0h22ylta25b1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=328ae274417d5ac3e16365177fb9e9712cae77b8\n\nThere is actually no changes to the weekly time frame here… we closed over previous supply and did not put in a new supply… DMI remains overbought and SPY remains ready to put in a new supply on any red week… \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le6b011ua25b1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd6d6c3daaaa61ceb3925b29efad98934592944b\n\nSPY daily here remains in this black bull channel that it has been in since May 23rd… we also have the bigger broad red/blue bull channel since March 8th…\n\nNow this is a CLASSIC bearish reversal pattern with this evening doji star closure… we also once again failed to close over 430.. We did close higher than the august 16th closure but we did not close over 430 yet again… this would be 4 failed rejections in the last 5 trading days from closing over 430. \n\nI would not be surprised to see price come back down to 426.5 demand (support) or perhaps 428 supply on Monday… however, I do forsee it still being bullish… honestly until this black bull channel is broken and really until we close under the daily 20ema this remains bullish and dips remain call opportunities… \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8l2cfofua25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c964c3f964cfed75a2628c52e62a6eb262a4d85\n\nI think this weekly chart clearly shows the overall trend and shows everything the best… \n\nHere you can see since the beginning of march we have been in this blue bull channel. Until SPY breaks under that weekly support (419 for next week) as you can see by the wicks this remains a buy the dip market… we also have a large red/ blue rising wedge that we have been trading within since middle of September… that resistance sits at 436.1 for next week. \n\nSPY WEEKLY LEVELS  \n Supply- 416.08 -> 427.35 -> 453.23  \n Demand- 411.57 -> 381.74  \n Support- 428.2 -> 422.1 -> 418.6  \n Resistance- 430 -> 436.9 -> 444.3\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uxbf4bwua25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffeb1ba116d722e6249efb70eb79a7c2be07a8c8\n\nNot surprisingly here futures followed suit of SPY and also put in a new supply at 4298. We actually are imbalanced on futures which does not usually happen. So that will be interesting to watch get sorted out over next week.. as of right now futes minimally needs to close under 4299 in order to be balanced. \n\n4312 is the supply and resistance from the august high and we once again failed to close over that level… it is safe to assume for now 4312 is strong resistance. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzs6k4eva25b1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=41dd38c5f847267a5a71b3c335710331cfa4c030\n\nNo changes to futures weekly supply and demand… we are attempting to make 4284 into a support, however, it is not set up to turn it into a demand which would be incredible bullish. \n\nNOTE ON FUTURES- on tradingview (where I primarily chart) the contracts rolled over night and when that happens the charting is always messed up for about a week because there was about a 100pt gap up due to that… there is a way to adjust for contracts but none of my levels are adjusted for that so it would throw everything off… for now I wont be including Futes daily or weekly price action until things normalize some… I will not include support/ resistance either as it is incorrect.\n\nFUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS-  \n Supply weekly- 4193 -> 4284 -> 4540  \n Supply daily- 4240 -> 4292 -> 4298 -> 4312  \n Demand weekly- 4130 -> 3921  \n Demand daily- 4273 -> 4188\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7f36vzwva25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79268ef4aa2a961783ffdd614855c0d01ec87c7\n\nNow I said yesterday I was VERY bullish on QQQ and that I was looking for 358-361… we ended up coming super close at open with hitting 357.66 but we did come up and retest that 357.09 supply and once again failed to break through and close over that level… we actually have really turned 354.95 supply into a major resistance here with this being the 5th rejection in 6 days at this level… \n\nNow we did put in a new demand at 349.06 today… however, I will say I am VERY bearish on QQQ for Monday… \n\nI would not be surprised at all to see QQQ come back down to at least 351 on Monday… If you look at QQQ objectively since 5/26 it has been holding within a 347.93 to 357.09 range for 10 closes in a row now… this right now is our consolidation period/ range… \n\nQQQ likely could drop down to 350-351 Monday and could possibly put in a new supply at 354.5 area.. if it did that then we absolutely would look for 348-349 to bounce us and look to long it back to 357. However, IF we can retrace to 349-351 and not put in a new supply I would actually be even more bullish and would look for 361.7 demand to be taken out next week. \n\nNow daily DMI is waving up which is bullish and we did hold the daily 8ema today… however, that massive evening doji star bearish reversal candle certainly should result in a drop… daily also broke extreme bull momentum… \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vub7bdwa25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=468c5bed6bc49e77f5eebc021727384b98e5ced4\n\nNow on QQQ weekly here this is looking far more bearish… we just put in a double top with back to back dojis with a weekly supply at 354.65. This is our first supply since the first week of May. \n\nNow only that but we also have a weekly DMI wave down forming here on QQQ. I will say though that despite this bearish set up that we have here… QQQ weekly remains in extreme bull momentum (despite the daily losing it) which means the weekly 8ema likely will be support on any retrace… that weekly 8ema should sit somewhere near 340 next week. Impressively QQQ weekly has NOT broken through the 8ema since the first week of may (5 weeks in a row) and we have not closed under the weekly 8ema since the week of March 6th. \n\nAs you can see we are working on a yellow rising wedge since the week of December 12th. \n\nFor me we have that 330.67 supply to keep an eye on next week… However, that would not only break the weekly 8ema but would also break the 6 month long rising wedge support… I do not think QQQ has seen the weakness and top to do that… likely weekly support will sit at 337.7 at the lowest next week but I will look for 339-340 to be a bounce point. \n\nOn the upside if we immediately bounce higher next week we actually could turn this weekly 354.65 supply immediately into a demand which would be incredibly bullish. Upside resistance of the wedge sits at 359.94 and we have a weekly supply at 361.85 to keep an eye on. \n\nQQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  \n Supply- 330.67 -> 354.65 -> 361.85  \n Demand- 322.47 -> 316.18\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1n41wwa25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=544aa2aba58196017243902170ee9f97fc4fe80f\n\nEven though it looked like the VIX would never recover and was just going to keep falling and falling and falling…. We actually did it… we actually put in a new daily demand (support) on the VIX at 13.62! \n\nThis is our first demand the VIX has put in since May 18th… \n\nFun fact about the VIX and putting in Demands (taking the move from low to high of when VIX puts in a demand till its next supply)…  \n March 6th= VIX +65.6%, SPY -6.5%  \n March 14th= VIX +34.1%, SPY -2.5%  \n March 21st= VIX +16.9%, SPY -2.3%  \n April 4th= VIX +8.1%, SPY -1.42%  \n April 6th= VIX +9%, **SPY +0.71%**  \n April 18th= VIX +20%, SPY -2.9%  \n May 1st= VIX +37.2%, SPY -3.3%  \n May 11th= VIX +9.6%, SPY -0.6%  \n May 18th= VIX +29.9%, SPY -2.6%\n\nThis is becoming my new favorite thing to do… What does this show? \n\nOn average over the last 9 times the VIX has put a new demand (support) in it has bounced 25.6% and SPY has fallen -2.38%. There is one time in April though where SPY did randomly push higher despite the VIX pushing up 9%... \n\nBut what does this mean? Well this means that if this plays out like normal the VIX will see around $17 and SPY could drop to $421.7 before we put a new supply in on the VIX (I will calculate that out once that happens). \n\nNow thre is always the chance with low daily volatility and daily/ weekly extreme bear momentum that we do not do that and immediately turn around and put a new supply in… but I will say since November there has not been a time we have seen with the supply indicator this low that we have immediately turned around a put a new supply in…\n\nThe highest probability is that we see a bounce here on the VIX and drop on SPY… we also broke the 12 day long bear channel today… the next step is for bears to close VIX over the daily 8ema and this should breakout. \n\nNext week with CPI and FOMC truly could be really spicy… \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lim9sh9ya25b1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b9623f764a2b1248dd8a16aae5fc1e87e8751ff\n\nWell I wasn’t supposed to be trading today… but ended up getting home earlier than expected and was able to get some solid trading in today. Today was a refreshing breath of air after getting absolutely wrecked yesterday… today was perfect trading and felt perfect to trade, however, after about 145 I will say that we once again say internals not matching correctly… \n\nOverall I failed to reach my weekly profit goal but on an extremely positive note here I was able to break the curse of Fridays by putting in a green day (even after realizing my tsla loss). \n\nThis close out as a nice green week and I am not too upset with the results especially after how brutal yesterday was. \n\nI have now been green for the last 10 weeks in a row which is one week shorter than my longest weekly streak in 2022! \n\nI hope you guys all have a great weekend and I will see you guys next week!
