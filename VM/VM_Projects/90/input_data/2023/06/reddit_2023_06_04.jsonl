{"title": "Trillion-Dollar Treasury Vacuum Coming for Wall Street Rally", "selftext": "This will be yet another drain on dwindling liquidity as bank deposits are raided to pay for it — and Wall Street is warning that markets aren’t ready.\n\nThe negative impact could easily dwarf the after-effects of previous standoffs over the debt limit. The Federal Reserve’s program of quantitative tightening has already eroded bank reserves, while money managers have been hoarding cash in anticipation of a recession.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou estimates a flood of Treasuries will compound the effect of QT on stocks and bonds, knocking almost 5% off their combined performance this year. Citigroup Inc. macro strategists offer a similar calculus, showing a median drop of 5.4% in the S&P 500 over two months could follow a liquidity drawdown of such magnitude, and a 37 basis-point jolt for high-yield credit spreads.\n\nThe sales, set to begin Monday, will rumble through every asset class as they claim an already shrinking supply of money: JPMorgan estimates a broad measure of liquidity will fall $1.1 trillion from about $25 trillion at the start of 2023.\n\n“This is a very big liquidity drain,” says Panigirtzoglou. “We have rarely seen something like that. It’s only in severe crashes like the Lehman crisis where you see something like that contraction.”\n\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trillion-dollar-treasury-vacuum-coming-135944792.html", "id": "140dsrx", "created_utc": 1685886877.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "I think this is more a way to bully the Fed into pausing rates than it is a real threat.
