{"title": "Polestar is the latest EV maker to announce a move to Tesla’s North American charging standard", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/polestar-moves-to-tesla-charging-standard.html\n\nSwedish electric vehicle maker Polestar said Thursday that it has signed a deal with Tesla that will allow drivers of its EVs to charge at about 12,000 Tesla charging stations in North America starting next year. New Polestar vehicles sold in North America will come standard with the Tesla-designed North American Charging Standard, or NACS, plug starting in 2025. Owners of existing Polestars will be able to charge at Tesla’s Supercharger stations with an adapter starting in mid-2024.\n\nPolestar’s deal follows an identical one announced by corporate sibling Volvo Cars on Tuesday. Ford Motor, General Motors and Rivian have also announced similar deals with Tesla in recent weeks. “We salute the pioneering work Tesla has done to speed up the adoption and increase the popularity of electric vehicles, and it’s great to see the Supercharger network being made available in this way,” said CEO Thomas Ingenlath. “This move will greatly increase the rate of EV adoption in a key automotive region.”\n\nMost non-Tesla EVs and charging stations in North America use a plug design called CCS, which stands for Combined Charging System. Recent studies have found that CCS charging networks have much lower reliability than Tesla’s network. Critics have also noted that the CCS fast-charging plug is significantly larger and heavier than the NACS plug, making it difficult for some older or disabled drivers to use.   Tesla EVs can use CCS chargers with an adapter, but currently only Tesla EVs can use Tesla chargers. Tesla’s plug design was proprietary until November, when the company published the technical details of its system and made it available to other automakers and makers of EV chargers.", "id": "14m7146", "created_utc": 1688050310.0, "score": 324, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "Love to see tech winning on its merits rather than lobbying", "score": 91, "replies": []}, {"body": "so Tesla will be one of if not the market EV leader while also, potentially, controlling the standard EV charging network in north america.

What matters is share of the *total automobile market*, including ICE. And there, Tesla is growing while others are shrinking. More worrisome, this means the ICE profit centers for Mercedes, VW Group, and other legacy brands are declining while they are having to invest heavily into EV technology.\n\nBut let's just say for the sake of argument that these other manufacturers did have credible paths to selling 10M to 20M EVs per year in ten years' time. I'm not suggesting they do, and in fact their own stated goals are far lower. But let's pretend they could do 10 to 20M EVs per year in ten years.

The only way a North American or European competitor could match today is by losing money.  See the Ford Mustang Mach E, GM's offerings, etc.\n\nAs for the Model S and X, Tesla has previously said these continue to exist not as meaningful profit centers but because customers have asked for them. The low volume of that luxury price tier was a great place to establish themselves, but it is not the long-term focus of the company.\n\n> Legacy manufacturers have already caught or are catching up on range so I’m not sure what will make people pick Tesla anymore.\n\nHigh range numbers can be achieved, and usually are, by using large (read: expensive) battery packs. This inefficiency is one of many reasons why EVs from legacy companies are not profitable.\n\nAlso, with good charging networks, a clever manufacturer finds that higher range numbers provide diminishing returns.  Ford's Farley has realized this, and evidently plans to follow Tesla's lead of slightly smaller packs (less range) paired with the Supercharger network. Thus yielding a combination that works for more customers: lower price and strong road trip ability. (My understanding is that this learning is being applied to Ford's next-generation EVs.)\n\n> They might end up solidifying a 5-10% market share but they could just as easily get squeezed out totally.\n\nWe shall see. No one can say for certain what the future holds. But I expect Tesla to have significantly higher market share, around 20% US share, in 10 years' time.\n\nI feel that expecting them to no longer sell cars on a time horizon less than 20 years is wishful thinking from those who simply don't like Tesla, for whatever reason.
