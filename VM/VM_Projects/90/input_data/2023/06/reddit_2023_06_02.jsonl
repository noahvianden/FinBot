{"title": "Do options actually have \"TlME value\"", "selftext": "TL;DR - Time isn't a tangible quantity in options trading and if there's only two market participants then the entire options trade will break even, neither having made any money. The thought experiment demonstrates the market neutrality of the market maker and excludes the bid-ask spread which is their true payment because there's really only two participants in this example and everyone understands the bid-ask spread to be the market maker saying \"pay me 2 cents per share to make you a market.\"\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe most challenging of Greeks to explain away is Theta because, well, there's a whole gang devoted to it. I'll try to simply explain why it doesn't really exist.\n\nThought experiment, there's only 2 market participants.\n\nExample using $AAPL $180 strike June30 puts.\n\nCost of puts: $4.00 (mid-price at close)\n\nWhy is it $4.00? For argument's sake, AAPL currently being $180.09 the strike is out of the money. It could be volatility or theta, some combination, etc.\n\nOrrrrrrrr....it could be that a short seller sees what I see (in my thread on shorting AAPL) and wants a $4.00 stop loss. They are willing to pay $4.00 to lock in that stop loss without having to be right or wrong.\n\nIt's defined risk, the short seller who buys puts defines their risk by paying the short put seller to take his risk. You the short-put seller acquires this risk.\n\nIt's a payment. **Like buying a can of baked beans.**\n\nIn this case, what does price do when there's only two people? This is how a market is made. And it illustrates why Theta is imaginary.\n\nThe price agreed upon is $180 (the strike price). The short put seller agrees to buy...AT THAT PRICE. He is credited $4.00. And the long put buyer will get to buy at whatever the market price is at the expiration and sell those shares to the put seller at $180 (obviously).\n\nThus the price immediately falls to $176 and it stays there for the entirety of the life of the option if no other market participants enter this market.\n\nThe option expires at $176 with $4.00 intrinsic value and a break even price for both parties.\n\nThere never was any real \"time value\" in the option what-so-ever.\n\nHere's the basic math of it in a nutshell.\n\nThe put buyer has $4.00\n\nThe put seller has $176.00 (to cover the price of the shares) + $4.00 premium to buy them at $180.00 which is the put buyer's agreed borrowing price. The put seller is the only one with $176.00, however, so why would the put seller buy shares at any more cost to themselves than the bare minimum affordable? Since they agree to a $180 strike they will attribute $4.00 to that and buy the rest of the shares with the remaining $176.\n\nUnderstand? If you don't understand that basic principle then sorry for not explaining it better.\n\nYou are making the market for the counter party (in this case bearish long-put buyer).\n\nWe can do this with calls so you understand the short/long a bit better.\n\nWhen a market maker makes you a market short position they buy shares and agree to sell them to you at a higher price. This makes sense because the market maker is guaranteeing you there will be a market if no one else participates. They do it for a price. Since you're short, that price is necessarily at a loss to you and a gain for the market maker. Thus the price is somewhere higher.\n\nWhen you buy a call you want a long position but you're SHORT shares. You agree to buy shares but you don't actually have them. Thus you are short shares until you do buy them. I hope that makes sense. The reason this isn't immediately apparent is because the call gives you a right to buy them at a certain price. That's all. You still don't have the shares.\n\nThe covered call seller owns the shares, they are \"loaning\" them to you just a long-share holder loans shares to short sellers for an interest rate.\n\nThe covered call seller thus \"buys\" the shares for you. This is a buy-write.\n\nThat buy writer wants the MOST money he can get for his market price, in this case; the price being $180 (strike price) what happens?\n\nHe takes the $180 he needs to hold shares at that strike, + $4.00 and buys the shares at $176.00.\n\nWhy would they do anything less? He's the only buyer, he'd set the price at lowest cost to him. There is no spread, again there's only these two market participants.\n\nSo the price goes to $176.00, instantly.\n\nUnless someone else comes in and bids the price higher it just stays there.\n\nSo what's the point of this thought experiment?\n\nEverything here is logically correct. The price would not sit at the strike price it would instantly go to the actual paid-for price.\n\nThere's no time value in that any more than there's time value when you buy a can of baked beans.\n\nWhen the expiration date comes, if no other market participants enter the market, the market was made. How?\n\n* The short put seller who bought at $176 + $4.00 you were willing to pay; hands you the shares at $176 and returns the shares to you at $4.00 under the strike price of $180. He keeps the $4.00 you were willing to pay; you broke even.\n* The short call seller who bought shares at $176 +$4.00 keeps the shares he bought for you at the price of $176.00 and keeps $4.00 cash.\n* The short call seller makes obvious sense when you think about it because a short call seller essentially \"sells some amount of shares equal to the delta of the option\" or in other words, sells some price as a cash dividend. Same difference.\n\nI hope all this has made sense.\n\nThe part that's absent in this entire thought experiment is the \"time value\". It's just not there. Again, it's not there any more than you can say there's a time value to the price of a can of baked beans.\n\nOf course there's a time value in the philosophical sense that someone thinks their time has value. What's time worth to you? An interest rate is \"time value\".\n\nBut it isn't some tangible thing that ticks down until expiration. If there's only two market participants then the entire options trade will break even.\n\nThe cost; in all cases, is in fact a defined risk price paid by a long-option holder who wants someone to define their risk for them.\n\nIt's a payment for a can of baked beans.\n\nIt's not an interest rate, it's not a loan, it has no time value.", "id": "13y0r25", "created_utc": 1685673157.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.22, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "This is a good example of how simplifying a problem to make it easier to explain can lead to an incorrect conclusion, because important facts were left out in the simplification process.\n\n**TL;DR** - The assumption of a two-person market where only one contract is traded is the flaw in the logic. Time value arises when you compare **two trades in time that are otherwise equal**. Since there is only one trade in this example, of course there is no time value. Contriving an example that eliminates time value does not prove that time value doesn't exist.\n\nIt's easy to reveal this flaw by introducing a second identical trade whose only difference is that it happens at a later time. Same contract specs -- underlying, strike price, expiration, put type, etc.\n\nSo now then, given that their are two identical contracts in the market, which one should the new (second) buyer buy, the old existing one or the new one? Is there a difference between them? They have identical terms, so why should there be a difference in value? Should it matter that the original buyer bought it for $4? Does that have any bearing on what it is worth now? No, the previous value of the first contract makes no difference to the new buyer. What matters is what the contract is worth now.\n\nLet's assume that the contracts should have equal value. It's provable why they should and why an arbitrage would arise if they didn't have equal value, but for the sake of brevity, let's just take this claim on faith.\n\nTo make this super obvious, let's assume the second contract will be traded 1 second before expiration and AAPL's price is the exact same $180.09 it was when the original put was first traded. How likely is it for a buyer to pay a full $4 of premium for a $180 put 1 second before expiration when the contract would be $.09 OTM? Zero chance, right? That put should be next to worthless now.\n\n**So if the second contract is no longer worth $4, what happened to the value of the first contract?** Applying our assumption on faith, they should have equal value. Therefore, the $4 value of the original put has been lost. One might even say that $4 of value has decayed away, and since the only difference between the two trades is time, calling that decay \"time decay\" and the value lost \"time value\" seems to make sense, don't you think?\n\nWith two points in time established, it should be intuitive why intermediate points in time would have intermediate amounts of theta decay.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I commend your reply, finally one that is a good counter analysis. However the starting point and ending point of the thought problem as it currently stands is that regardless of time all transactions will break even.\n\nThe cost basis will be adjusted to reflect that point. At any given point in time there's the illusion of a difference. That is true. Time does exist (as a thing); it does not exist as a value. It's unquantifiable or as I'd rather say; it's a constant and not a variable.\n\nA constant is dropped from the equation.\n\n>To make this super obvious, let's assume the second contract will be traded 1 second before expiration and AAPL's price is the exact same $180.09 it was when the original put was first traded. How likely is it for a buyer to pay a full $4 of premium for a $180 put 1 second before expiration when the contract would be $.09 OTM? Zero chance, right? That put should be next to worthless now.\n\nThere's a phenomenon that occurred in the Chicago commodities exchange once that actually is a great counter illustration to this point. Your thought experiment appears to give value to time because as rational people we all know the probability of AAPL going from $180.09 to $184.09 in one second is so low.\n\nThat's not because time has value, it's because our experience suggests to us this is the case.\n\nBut his name is lost to me now but there's a curious case of a fool pit trader who ended up becoming the ONLY person trading his pit's underlying and he didn't realize it. He ran up tens of millions in gains, astronomical, absurd. It was too good to be true. When the settlement took place it all just resettled back to break even and he totally lost his ass on the price of the leverage he took out. (The premium as it were).\n\nIf we therefore simply say some fool is dumb enough to do the impossible and pay $4.00 for a 1second to expiration ATM strike. If he's the only one setting the price (no additional premium).\n\nThen the stock will simply go up $4.00 at expiration and expire at break even. he'll have made no money and lost none either.\n\nIf there's someone else also setting the price, let's say they wanted $4.50 but would keep the $0.50 as profit (extract it from this hypothetical market).\n\nThe price would go to $184.00 but you'd be $0.50 cents below the break even at a loss.\n\nThis literally has happened in the markets with zany idiot scenarios like at the Commodities exchange.\n\nIn that example - he had to pay for the leverage, that money is being REMOVED from the market.\n\nThe price broke even to what the counterparty left in the market.\n\nThe sole buyer who was himself was given all that was left in return...he was only down the amount he paid for the leverage.

It's the same construction, but it doesn't prove anything, other than value requires an agreement by all parties to play by certain rules.\n\nThere's a lot of ways to skin the time value cat. Another is to take the perspective of the seller. We can define time value as **the risk premium** a seller demands for the probability that they will be forced to honor the contract at a loss. What factors increase that probability? Time, for one, because more time means more possible price outcomes that put the seller in the loss column.\n\nIf there was no risk due to time, all contracts would trade at intrinsic value because the final price at expiration would be 100% predictable.

It doesn't actually teach you how to drive a car, so to speak.\n\nSo regarding what I'm ranting about options, I'm trying to find out how to explain that really if you only worry about buying power and time (time itself not theta as a price), you will do a lot better at managing your options trades than if you think of things in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic value and further breakdown extrinsic value into the Greek's categories.\n\nIn another thread I pointed out I don't bother with greeks at all, I don't pay attention to even delta.\n\nI worry about price and time. I worry that each trade is sufficiently staggered across time and that I'm receiving the right price for the right amount risked.\n\nThere are mechanical reasons I think that those variables work and they have to do with what the trading floors do and concern themselves with. And I see it play out in how price action behaves. Quite often, but no specific example comes to mind at the moment.\n\nOne example, I suppose, is probability of profit. In of itself it's basically a useless metric also. Something that should happen only 5% of the time statistically; instead actually happens with almost all of my trades through out most of the trade and causes a need to manage that trade.\n\nNow that I think about that aspect it's probably because volatility is a crap idea. When you back test an event for the current given volatility you would get an expected statistical result.\n\nBut as I've theorized above...volatility is just a circularly-derived variable plugged in to explain the current price. It really has nothing to do with anything at all.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "By margin I was more specifically referring to leverage.

No one uses it though.\"\n\nBanks don't use it. No one uses it to actually price an option. Know how options are priced? Someone wants to buy an option. That's literally how it's priced. They want a defined risk. How they come up with that defined risk is certainly not black scholes. \"I got 50,000 shares of ABC stock, I really am worried the price might go below my margin call...I better use the Black Scholes model to see how much premium I should be paying for the protective puts.\"\n\nIt just doesn't work that way, at any scale. They throw a bid in at some price near the midpoint and adjust it until someone bites.

Sorry that this is a stream of consciousness but you're among the first to ask a valid question that I can use to put my thoughts into a more coherent argument.\n\nOh and PS. I frequently trade \"illiquid\" options with huge bid asks for extremely efficient bid ask spreads because I discover where it's actually liquid and it trades there just fine. Never had a problem with it.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI believe I've found a potential model for liquidity that does give you a PnL but it is irrelevant to what people consider liquid or illiquid options.\n\nI also think a lot of mainstream thoughts on liquidity are wrong so I have had to redefine it some. I adhere to the \"liquidity theory of money\" by the way - so I'm not just blowing shjt out my ass. This is all real economist stuff if you go down the rabbit hole.\n\nAnyway.\n\nLiquidity is inversely proportional to risk and is directly proportional to a known price.\n\nI'm constantly frustrated by time because time is a thing, but not quantifiable. The closest I can approximate it to is something like this.\n\nL x T = T x 1/R\n\nJust as an example....\n\nIn this equation you'd just drop the Time it's a constant, it doesn't \"exist\".\n\nWhat is known price?

Since life continues, new market participants enter as old ones leave there never seems to be a final transaction. But in any thought experiment there is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith options the final transaction is the expiration; which is why there's the theoretical pricing model in between, and then it all goes out the window at expiration and there's what actually happens which is what I try to illustrate in the breakeven examples above.\n\nAt final transaction when price is known; aka agreed upon, you have maximum liquidity and zero risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is important because a lot of people think buying an investment is risky because the price might go down.\n\nBanking doesn't think that way and NEITHER SHOULD YOU.\n\nIt doesn't really matter what the price does. Liquidity is liquidity.\n\nWhen price is transacted you have maximum liquidity and no risk. You get the price you get. How that affects your profit or loss is irrelevant to the risk-pricing model.\n\nOr ought to be irrelevant.\n\nRather how it impacts YOUR liquidity should be what matters. And your liquidity is affected by profit and loss because obviously liquidity is the ability to FACILITATE a known price.\n\nIf you can't agree on a price because you don't have the liquidity then the price changes until liquidity is discovered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THIS AND THIS ALONE IS WHAT MOVES PRICE.**\n\nNot probability, not time, not gamma explosions or volatility.\n\nCan a price be agreed upon at the given liquidity, yes or no?\n\nA seller is short, so to lower price they profit.\n\nA buyer is long so to raise price they profit.\n\n**AT THE OTHER'S EXPENSE**\n\nThus where the two's liquidity requirements are balanced is where price is discovered. There's zero risk at that price.\n\nFurther out in time there's greater risk, because price is not known or agreed upon.

This can only be done if the counter party is willing to pay for that for some other reason.\n\nThis is why I emphasize we are in the business of buying and selling risk....that's all.\n\nAnd knowing a time value is irrelevant to that assessment.\n\nRather you need to know how much someone is willing to pay YOU for taking on the risk to balance the liquidity equation.\n\n**\\*THAT CAN BE MODELED\\***", "score": -3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Your analogy is flawed because a can of beans is not expected to rise or fall by 20% between now and expiration.This is the part of theta you fail to realize for some reason.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You'll have a tough time explaining why anything rises or falls in price.
