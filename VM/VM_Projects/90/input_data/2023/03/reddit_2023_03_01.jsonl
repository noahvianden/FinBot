{"title": "Rivian posts mixed fourth quarter and underwhelming EV production outlook", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/28/rivian-rivn-earnings-q4-2022.html\n\nShareholder letter: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000187417823000006/rivian_q4-2022xsharehold.htm\n\nElectric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and a lackluster production outlook after the bell Tuesday.\n\nShares of Rivian were down by roughly 8% during extended trading. The stock closed Tuesday at $19.30 a share, up 4.6% for the session.\n\nHere’s how Rivian performed in the period, compared with analysts’ estimates as compiled by Refinitiv:\n\nAdjusted loss per share: $1.73 vs. $1.94 estimated\n\nRevenue: $663 million vs. $742.4 million estimated\n\nThe company reported an adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of nearly $5.2 billion in 2022, narrower than guidance of a $5.4 billion loss in November.\n\nFor 2023, Rivian forecast vehicle production of 50,000 vehicles. That would be roughly double last year’s amount but below expectations of roughly 60,000, as estimated by several Wall Street analysts.\n\n“Supply chain continues to be the main limiting factor of our production; during the quarter we encountered multiple days of lost production due to supplier shortages. We expect supply chain challenges to persist into 2023 but with better predictability relative to what was experienced in 2022,” the company said in its letter to shareholders.\n\nRivian said it expects to achieve a positive gross profit in 2024. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion — a narrower result than the $2.5 billion loss it reported a year earlier. Quarterly revenue of $663 million jumped from $54 million in the year-earlier period when the company had just started making its first products.\n\nThe results follow difficult times for the electric vehicle startup that have included slower-than-expected production, unexpected pricing pressure and plans to lay off 6% of its workforce in a bid to conserve cash.\n\nRivian is focusing on ramping up production of its R1 truck and SUV as well as an electric delivery van it builds for Amazon, its largest individual shareholder.\n\nAs of the end of last year, the company had about $12.1 billion in cash remaining, down from $13.8 billion at the end of the third quarter and $15.5 billion as of June 30. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $294 million compared to $455 million during the year-earlier period.\n\nRivian said while inflation has been a factor in its supply chain, it will continue to take steps to ramp up production and reduce material costs by slimming down its engineering and vehicle design, along with commercial cost-down efforts.\n\nThe company’s forthcoming R2 model, for example, will use a simplified assembly and sourcing process to achieve “a meaningfully lower cost structure,” CEO RJ Scaringe said on an analyst call following the earnings report.\n\nHe added the automaker is “in a very different position with our supply chain today” relative to a year ago, which will help the company execute on more “aggressive cost and pricing” measures.\n\n“It won’t necessarily be a linear path over the course of the next several quarters but we will start to see those impacts as early as Q1 as we start to reduce the material costs in our vehicles and the technology introductions,” said Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough.", "id": "11et5cb", "created_utc": 1677641890.0, "score": 197, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "The only reason it isn't a $2 stock yet is the $12B cash on hand, that's worth roughly $13 meaning that's going to be a hard floor until the next quarter.\n\nThe market is pricing the business + assets - cash very low because of the burn rate and risk that they'll run out of money before becoming profitable.", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "Companies trade for below book value all the time when they have a bad money losing business model.\n\nRivian isn't going to shut their doors and pay out that $13 of cash to their investors as a dividend, so why should it trade based on it?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Book value != cash value.

He *personally* controls nearly 10% of the voting power of all shares and can veto decisions made by the board. [1]  Amazon (who seems to have his back) owns another 17%[2], and institutional investors (who normally vote whatever the board recommends) also control a huge chunk.  Also, remember that a ton of retail bagholders still think RIVN is going to be the next TSLA, and cashing them out at an 80% loss isn't going to put them on your side.\n\nHostile takeovers normally take a while to achieve a change in control.  And that's still true even when the acquirer controls an actual majority of voting rights.  You have to:\n\n1. Call a board meeting\n2. Get it scheduled\n3. Notify all the shareholders (company bylaws normally don't allow secret votes for good reason)\n4. Have the vote\n5. Impanel the new board\n5. Finally have the new board remove the old CEO. \n\nWith his outsize voting rights, RJ can draw out the process even longer than normal.  He can put up roadblocks at every step of that process. \n\nYou also have to consider that shutting down the company means laying off employees and canceling supplier contracts.  Those actions will create new liabilities for Rivian.  The severance payments of unplanned hypothetical future layoffs don't live on the balance sheet today (and neither do the the \"or pay\" part of \"take or pay\" contracts).  Those new liabilities must be subtracted from the assets before you can distribute them. \n\n> If it starts trading at $5, a takeover starts to look pretty attractive\n\nIf that happens you still have to ask the question, \"Can we distribute the money before RJ burns enough cash to bring the book value down to $4/share?\"  \n\nYou have to remember that Rivian is consuming cash to the tune of $5B/year [3], and that their balance sheet is quoted *as of Dec 31, 2022* [3].  It's currently *March* of 2023, which means you probably need to subtract off another ~$1B to approximate their balance sheet today.\n\nAs of Dec 31, they have current assets of ~$13.1B, and non-current assets of another ~$4.7B (who knows if the non-current assets like the plant can be sold for anything, though).  Their total liabilities are $4B... which means current assets less liabilities less two months of cash burn comes out to net assets today of ~$8.5B (and I'm not even counting any new liabilities created by winding down the company).  That's a little under $9/share book value.\n\nSo a hostile takeover is actually a pretty dicy proposition *today* even at $5/share.  You'd have to assume you can buy for $5/share take control of $9/share net assets, wind down the whole thing and distribute the cash within about 9-12 months.  Plus, you have to pay a \"wind down CEO\" and a small army of lawyers and investment bankers to manage the whole thing.  \n\nIt is *possible*? Certainly, but you're taking a pretty big risk for, optimistically, a ~25% gain.  The only way I see that being worthwhile is that RJ decides that he wants out and is willing to help you accelerate the process (and then all the shareholders who still think he can turn Rivian into the next Tesla will sue you and RJ, and generally be a massive headache for the next decade).\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Scaringe\n\n[2] https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RIVN/holders?p=RIVN\n\n[3] https://assets.rivian.com/2md5qhoeajym/5TBOuPTvDNZwGjUte1Vp1M/d789f042ab663f6766491f028ef8378f/Rivian_Q4-2022_Shareholder_Letter.pdf", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "**[R.

This is also why they want Rivian and eV's so badly. For them, the savings would be astronomical if they can just deploy eVs for all their last leg deliveries along with charging stations at their warehouses. Fuel costs would become more fixed since they can deploy their own generating facilities (solar + wind) cutting energy costs for those vehicles by about 75% (less savings in northern parts of USA unless Rivian figures it out).\n\nIn all, despite retail woes, they made about $4b last year.
