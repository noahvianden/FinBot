A lot of people will sell CSPs on high IV stocks to make profit, I specifically sell it on companies I identify as I would like to own. For example, MPW had a high fully covered dividend with a positive carry on margin account (which in my opinion is a strong buy signal), that’s exactly the kind of company I’d like to have on my account anyway, or JPM at $115, which I believe is below their intrinsic value, or IJS (small cap value) which I believe is undervalued right now. And in most cases I already have exposure to these stocks, and I would actually like to have a larger exposure to them if they hit my desired price (which is my strike). I’m not making a crazy amount of money from CSPs, it’s a very small percentage of my portfolio (although the total assignment value can be large).

I'm not sure I agree.

There is an assumption that OP has a number in mind where they believe that the stock is a good enough value to allocate their capital to.\nAll of that said, your assertions/lessons are hugely valuable to understand, and I see posts here daily that on the surface do not.\n\nAnother way of looking at it is:\nOne side balances CSP premium (and interest), while the other balanced CC premium plus asset growth (or loss) and dividend (if any).\nThe left side in this case is much more predictable and versatile; but I don't think that it can be said to be better.\n\nPlease correct me if I'm misunderstanding, and especially if I'm just plain incorrect.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "You got my part absolutely correct.
