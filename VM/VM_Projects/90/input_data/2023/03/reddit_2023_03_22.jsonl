Again, it's more complicated.\n\nExample 1.   When oil companies can't find the needed material and skilled workers to work in the oilfield, production doesn't ramp up as fast to meet demand. That's if they want to ramp up production that fast.  Several CEOs (interviews and Dallas Fed survey) have said they aren't interested in doing so to make shareholders happy.  Anyway, slowed production increases the price of oil. Increase in oil prices ends up being higher prices at the pump.  Higher prices at the pump (across the board) means higher cost for travel and delivery of goods. So on and so forth.\n\nExample 2:  Avian flu infects farms.  Farmers have to slaughter millions of chickens.

From the technical graphics, QQQ broke through the upper edge of the downward trend channel near 308 today, closing on the strong resistance level of 310, which is a strong signal, but the volume of the stock market in the past two days are very small, whether it is an effective breakthrough is still difficult to say, or wait for the Fed meeting and then judge the direction of the market for a period of time after it.\n\nUS Dollar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nU.S. stocks are strong but the dollar index is still down slightly, on the one hand, no matter how the Fed's rate hike cycle to the end, even if the 25 basis point rate hike this time does not mean that the FED can maintain interest rates at high levels for a long time, on the other hand, the market believes that the risk of the financial system is decreasing, so must sentiment is receding, which is the main reason for the decline in safe-haven assets today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all for today's analysis.
