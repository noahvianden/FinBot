{"title": "Desktop Metal: A Ten-Bagger Tesla Story", "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nHey guys, I'm a long time member occasional contributor. Three years ago I [posted](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpeu8i/petition_to_give_ubetterthanmadoff_a_very_special/) after a special autist posted some incredible DD after the market closed on a Friday about an impending market crash in Argentina. Last August, I [posted](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wlqb4q/desktop_metal_dd_long_term_tenbagger_and/) my first Desktop Metal DD thread on r/wallstreetbets. It's been a pretty tough year for the stock market and unprofitable tech companies like DM have been hammered hard. However, things are beginning to look much better for DM. Before I get into my DD, here's some background on the company:\n\n**Background**\n\nDesktop Metal went public via SPAC in 2021. They produce a revolutionary line of incredibly fast 3D printers that can compete with traditional casting on a price per part basis. They hold over 650 patents and can print in over 250 different materials. Their flagship product is the [Production System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/production) which began to ship. Designed for mass production of end use metal parts, it is over 100x faster than traditional 3D printing technologies putting it leaps ahead of its competition. Their product offering also includes the [Shop System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/shop) for mid-volume production, the [Studio System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/studio) for prototyping, Fiber for the 3D printing of a variety of carbon fibers, their new unit [Desktop Health](https://www.desktophealth.com/) for a variety of uses including dental, bone regeneration, soft tissue fabrication, and organ 3D printing. Recently, Desktop Metal released the Einstein Pro XL, an affordable production-grade 3D printer for dental labs and other medical professionals. You can read the press release [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/139/desktop-health-announces-global-availability-of-einstein). Recently revenue growth has been largely driven by the expansion of their healthcare unit. Photopolymers are a great addition to DM's portfolio and represent a $200B market opportunity. \n\nIn the last two years, they've made several important acquisitions with the $500mm they recieved as a result of going public via SPAC. In August 2021, they acquired their largest competitor, ExOne for $561mm in a mixed stock/cash deal. Desktop Metal has been incredible aggressive, spending over $800mm to buy out their competitors and adding new materials to their portfolio. They have 950+ issued patents and pending applications for their machines and materials. Their Studio System sells for roughly $300k and generates $1.1mm in lifetime revenue with 600k being profit. This is driven by the high profit margins on their materials. I believe that their materials portfolio represents the key to Desktop Metals long term growth and profitability.\n\nAs a result of these acquisitions, Desktop Metal grew rapidly. There were many redundancies that were eating into EBITDA and driving continued losses. Last year, Desktop Metal announced a $50mm cost cutting initiative as well as the hiring of a new CFO, Jason Cole, formerly of Analog Devices. On February 6th, [Desktop Metal announced another $50mm in cost cutting measures](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/desktop-metal-boosts-productivity-by-updating-cost-cutting-plans-for-2023-220642/#:~:text=Industrial%203D%20printer%20manufacturer%20Desktop,its%20long%2Dterm%20financial%20objectives.) for a total of $100mm in annual cost reductions. Jason has demonstrated a strong desire to achieve profitability as soon as possible over growth at all costs.\n\nAs companies look to shorten and de-risk their supply chains, Desktop Metal provides a compelling product to reduce material waste and cut costs. Their printers are already used by companies like BMW, Lockheed Martin, Stanley Black and Decker, and many more. Their products have additional aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, medical, and military applications. Revenue has grown significantly from $26mm in FY 2019 to $206mm in FY 2022. FY 2023 revenue is projected between $210-260mm due to macro headwinds with breakeven EBITDA being achieved in Q3 or Q4.\n\n**Why DM is Attractive**\n\nDesktop Metals Q4 earnings were fantastic and exactly what investors needed to see. The result of their $100mm cost cutting initiatives are beginning to show through on their income statement. Operating expenses [fell to $37.9mm in Q4 2022, down $3.6mm from Q3](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_78b61139c42c8f258a21fe79e9c13a8a/desktopmetal/db/884/7565/earnings_presentation/DM+4Q-22+Earnings+Presentation+vF.pdf). During the Q&A portion of the call, an analyst asked about what revenue would be required for DM to breakeven next year. The CFO, Jason Cole, stated that DM would breakeven across the whole forcasted revenue range of $210-260mm. This is **huge**. Desktop Metal has been priced for the last year as if it was on the verge of bankrupcy. Until today's 30%+ surge, Desktop Metal was valued less than the market value of their competitor ExOne which they acquired last year for $560mm. The market has been confused with how to value Desktop Metal and this is why I think we have such an incredible opportunity in front of us today. Craig-Hallum analyst Greg Palm [released in a note](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3673587&headline=dm-craighallum-warming-to-desktop-metal-after-new-supply-agreement-1677774515&test2&ref=tipranks) said that he is \"warming up to Desktop Metal\" following \"solid Q4 results\" and that \"momentum seems to be building in several areas of the business.\" While he kept his $2 price target and a hold rating, he said this was \"to wait for additional evidence of business trends improvement\" but that \"he believe the stock can work higher from current levels.\"\n\nWhile I was also bullish six months ago in August, my thesis was that the risk/reward profile of bankrupcy to non-bankrupcy was favorable. Yesterday, we got confirmation that Desktop Metal would **NOT** go bankrupt and achieve profitability in FY 2024 -- a full year ahead of schedule. They have $750mm in assets ($360mm in current assets) and $260mm in liabilities per their 10-K released yesterday. This guarantees that they have enough of a runway to reach 2024 where they will achieve full year profitability. Desktop Metal also teased on the earnings call that they will soon be announcing a Master Supply Agreement signed with a major consumer electronics company that per Twitter, is rumored to be Apple. If true, it would mark a major milestone for DM. Despite this, short interest was 21% before yesterdays earnings per [Koyfin](https://app.koyfin.com/snapshot/s/eq-0digtg) -- even higher than it was when I posted in August. You can read their full Q4 2022 earnings report [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-23-002567/0001558370-23-002567.pdf) and their press release [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/141/desktop-metal-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022). \n\n\n**This Is A Tesla Story**\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, Tesla demonstrated something very similar to what DM showed in their earnings yesterday -- that they would not be going bankrupt and that they had a viable road to profitability. Just like with DM, people knew that the technology was going to change entire industries and investors didn't want to get left behind even if they had to pay a premium for a piece of the pie. Tesla shares exploded, rising from around $20 per share to a peak of $400 per share last year. I believe that yesterday was a monumental moment for Desktop Metal, and the market seems to agree. As of 3:30PM, shares are up 38% trading around $2.08.\n\n\nIf DM were to generate $0.50 in EPS and trade at **moderate** 20x current P/E, shares would trade at $10 per share for a 400% return from current levels. With >20% EPS growth, DM could achieve EPS of >$1.00 per share by 2030 for a **conservative** share price of $20 for a 900% return. EPS growth of >40% is possible for DM even in a challenging macro environment. Considering that DM's profit largely comes from their consumables, they will become increasingly profitable with time as their machines sell and customers continue buying DM's expansive material inventory. Other fast growth tech companies like Cloudflare trade at P/E's in the **hundreds** due to their high projected revenue and EPS growth. If DM traded at even half of Tesla's old forward EPS in 2025, we could see a share price in the hundreds. \n\n\n**My Positions**\n\n2000 shares at $2.40\n\n2 $2.50 Jan 2025 call\n\n3 $3.00 Jan 2025 calls\n\n4 $4.00 Jan 2025 calls \n\n6 $5.00 Jan 2025 calls\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhen Desktop Metal begins to get more press, people are going to pile into the company. It has all the ingredients for a meteoric rise. Transformative new technology, some media hype, and **28% of all shares are short.** Desktop Metal is a no-brainer for ~$2.00 in 2023. While I'm not going to give a price target, Desktop Metal has an insane amount of room to run.\n\n3/3 Edit: Spelling and I had to delete the Imgur links due to sub policy", "id": "11gdpdq", "created_utc": 1677790431.0, "score": 79, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "I’ve been bagholding this one since 2022 op so you know I’m bullish long term.

You've had the best analysis of DM on reddit, but surely the math all changed with the $SSYS announcement.\n\nI'm curious to know your thoughts. Seems like stratysys is getting DM cheap when DM is still vulnerable and hasn't really shined yet - but maybe the profitable flywheel of ssys dumping money in from other divisions will give the metals AM portfolio the edge over competitors, realizing better growth long term?\n\nIs it worth the dilution?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve been following everything closely and will probably write another in-depth post shortly. In short, I think the deal is good for all parties involved. I’d suspected that DM would be an acquisition target for awhile now. That being said, I think this is about the best case scenario. DM gets a cash flow positive business to help support their new products and staves off an equity raise while SSYS gets the best metals portfolio and printers in the industry. Obviously, I wish the macro environment was better and DM was trading around $6 but we don’t live in a fantasy land.\n\nI’m a little worried by the continued bids for Statasys by Nano and 3D Systems. SSYS published this [report](https://assets.website-files.com/646d3ff4f45630efe69682f7/6491adda45ec27a66c87a769_Stratasys%20-%20Delivering%20superior%20value%20with%20Desktop%20Metal%20combination.pdf) detailing the benefits of a combined DM-SSYS after rejecting 3D Systems bid two weeks ago. 3D Systems is obviously trying to block the merger from going through as it would create the largest additive manufacturing firm in the world with an established global sales network. A spread has emerged between DM and SSYS despite the agreed upon deal which would exchange 0.123 SSYS shares for each share of DM, assuming that the deal closes. DM is around $1.80 while the closing price of SSYS today would be equal to about $2.24. It could be a solid arbitrage opportunity.\n\nMore news should be reported shortly and I’m kind of holding my breath. I still think the deal is in the best interest of both DM and SSYS shareholders but it’s all up to the SSYS board now.\n\nI’ll try and post it when I have time. Moving to NYC on Saturday morning and I won’t have internet until Monday. If it’s been a few days, shoot me a message and I’ll make sure to get on it!\n\nEdit: Forgot to answer your main question — yes, I’m still in DM.

It's 100% consistent with my own thoughts and research, but very validating to hear from you.\n\nHard to say if the opportunity here in DM is true arbitrage or bag-holding. I sure hope SSYS goes with DM and not DDD. I think the long term model make more sense for SSYS than combining slow growth businesses, and I think SSYS is the best way for DM to truly see liftoff and adoption with its technology.\n\nMy biggest forward looking question now is this - if the DDD bid wins, do you think DM is still a good investment, or could it spell trouble for smaller companies like DM? In other words - will the new scale of SSYS/DDD allow them to organically produce the tools/IP to out-compete smaller printing companies?
