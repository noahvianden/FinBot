No other phone had that kind of multi-touch glass display. None of them were able to integrate with your computer music library in such an efficient manner. None of them managed to bottle the experience of web browsing without diluting it into an inferior mobile experience, in the way that the iPhone's edge-to-edge glass display managed to do. None of them had a sleek presentation. Never discount the attraction of a pretty product.\n\nWhich one of Palm's smartphone was \"superior\"? I'm struggling to think of one that came close. The Palm Centro was exactly the type of phone that the iPhone was designed to replace. A sort of in-between device that diluted email and web browsing so it could fit into a small screen above a keyboard.\n\nWhen the App Store launched on the iPhone 3G, the game was over. Games and apps on an edge-to-edge glass screen without the limitations of tactile buttons... nothing was going to compete, once the average person began encountering iPhones in the real world and realized that typing using a virtual keyboard on a touchscreen was not as bad as they had imagined (or as bad as Blackberry and Sidekick marketing told them it would be).", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Two things the iPhone did: \n\nLarge screen which meant getting rid of the hardware keyboard.

{"title": "Why we are months away from the top, the perfect sell signal and how to time the market", "selftext": "alright friends, i would normally charge 2/20 for this BS but I was studying the relationship between SPX, Unemployment and different parts of the yield curve over the past 20 years.\n\nWhat I found is that that unemployment was a lagging indicator, but has more recently has become correlated to the SPX, especially since 2007+.\n\nThe most interesting tidbit is that 3 month treasury yield was the best predictor of a market top. Basically after a hiking cycle, anytime the 3 month yield falls by about 1% was pretty close to marking the top or ensured you got out before the train ran you over.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3b5vm2zbltfb1.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c079f1421c57f47bd31b19f5daa534f0581a14b\n\nBack in 2000, 3 month treasuries hit a peak of 6.2% in October-00, which corresponded to the market peak at the time. If you waited until the 3 month fell by 1% to sell in Jan 01, you would've gotten out not at the peak, but exited about 13% off the highs and got out before SPX would plunge another 33% over the next 22 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ym47t44tltfb1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ca59ca34030188c26dee28d71041329b5b9b0a\n\nDuring the GFC, 3month rates peak at around 5% in Feb 2007 and started to fall, by the time it fell 1%, it would have been August 2007, right near the peak. Now the market would've peaked in another 3 months, but coupled with the fact unemployment was starting to rise a bit, if you got out then, you would have avoided the whole GFC drawdown of 40%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/no03ifkcmtfb1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=683f673ddabdb2d12c8b41720462a4f028082208\n\nThis signal also worked remarkedly in 2020 covid cycle, where 3m rates peaked out around 2.4% in feb 2019 and started falling, by the time it got to 1.4%, it was Feb 2022. If You got out then, you would've been spared a 30% drawndown.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8z8z1exmtfb1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=d65920b8d69019f08e698cd8b0bc23abd7f537b4\n\nNow take a look at today to understand if we are near a crash. Rates are still turning to highs, we just hit 5.4% on the 3 months, We are nowhere close to the 4.3-4% that would warrant a sell signal. If it does show up, I expect it to be probably 6-9 months away. If it does show up, go nuts with puts. Unemployment rate also seem to correspond to the size of the correction, bigger spikes = bigger crashes + high vix which correspond to the passive indexation dynamic (see mike green)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xl9wnxdantfb1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae24a0353786357765496051f7a6b70e2c5270db\n\nTLDR: Jump into the pool, the casino is still open, and we are still 2-3 quarters away from a real crash.\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talks.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "15gtu1x", "created_utc": 1691036561.0, "score": 221, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|7 years ago\n**Total Comments**|4990|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: - Unemployment is a lagging indicator, but has become more correlated with the stock market since 2007.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "what‚Äôs great about wsb is that mcdonalds employees can confidently call the market top", "score": 475, "replies": [{"body": "They do like 1-2 good trades and suddenly they think they're warren buffet jr\n\nMyself included tbh.
