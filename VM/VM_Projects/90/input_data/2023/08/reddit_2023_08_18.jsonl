It shows that only 4% of ALL public traded stocks EVER have contributed to all the returns of the stock market to this day.  Yeah that is how few of the stocks actually make up the return of the stock market.   \n\nWe already have articles published back to 1930's showing active funds run by active fund managers do worse (Jensen). Those were days when insider trading was easier too so you would think that would be the days their outperformance would continue.  \n\nThe SPIVA studies each year are updated show the same which you can look up yourself.  \n\nThe landmark/ seminal articles published by BHB and BSB in ?JFA showed the top pension funds couldn't outperform their own asset allocations either.  This was the real nail in the coffin.  GREAT studies and design if anyone wants to read them and are available if you search for them online for free.  You want EVER see them mentioned by Wall Street (no surprise).\n\nHow about REAL life results?  Well Jack Bogle interesting enough who founded the first retail index fund (Vanguard sp500 in ?1977) wrote down EVERY single domestic equity mutual fund at the time.  He knew folks like you would be arguing at some point which is better.  There were 340 or so.  So after 25 years how many beat his sp500 index funds by 1-2% (to cover the higher costs of active funds)?  5-6/340+.  That make a success rate of:  <2%.  Yeah that isn't good!\n\nSo we have no peer review published data from 1930's to now ALL showing active fund managers and pension fund managers who many have advanced degrees from MIT/ Harvard who are MORE then capable then doing 4th grade math running algos 24/7 on computers more expensive then your house is worth can't do it, but somehow you advocate the common Joe is better at it.

Then you would have to include your higher cost of active trading as well to lower that success rate.  Everyone's dream of finding the next Apple or Tesla is about 10% (megawinner).  Link at bottom.  \n\nBTW, the data I gave on Bogle was WITH the 2% taken off due to higher cost as I mentioned on my post (go reread my post).  Without the 2% taken off it would have been 12/340 or so.  Rick Ferri's \"power of passive investing\" has the chart in it.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to learn more about the debate should read this book as it has footnotes of many of the published peer review articles showing as Charlie Ellis (former head of harvard endowment fund) calls it a \"Losers game\".  \n\nIn the end you do you. I just don't think it is reasonable and good advice to advocate active management UNLESS you can provide the data to support your argument.\n\nMy advice to investors... The data is CLEAR on this matter.  Index investing is what makes you money over a lifetime.  If you want that itch of active management no problem.  Carve out 5-10% and go scratch that itch.  Just don't think active management is going to reliably beat index investing.  It likely won't.
