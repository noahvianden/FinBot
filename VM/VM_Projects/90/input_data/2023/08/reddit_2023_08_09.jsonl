Maybe buy oils, RE, or things that are relatively unloved on the dips as trades or just S&P/R2K index funds. If you're a quick trader or high risk regard then maybe run neutral-bearish options now and then neutral-bullish on dip.

When looking solely at the year-over-year inflation rate, the highest rates registered are no longer in play (ie. it won't be as easy to beat each month like it has been over the last year).\n\nWith that in mind after all the highs registered, some of the lowest overall inflation months in 2022 were July, August, November, and December. All of which will now be calculated in the new year-over-year inflation rate. \n\nBecause these rates were so low, it's going to be really hard for the each upcoming month to be drastically better. This will inevitably lead the month-over-month inflation rate higher since there aren't anymore high rates to beat. So year-over-year inflation will likely bottom around 3% or a little lower before starting to go back up again. It will never hit the Fed's 2% target at the current trajectory.\n\nTherefore, the Fed is likely going to use this as an excuse to raise rates 1-2 more times in the next 6 months to combat this.
