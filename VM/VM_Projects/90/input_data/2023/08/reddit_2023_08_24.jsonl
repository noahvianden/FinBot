Something Intel struggled with the last 2-3 gens but has since solved in their delusion that they could out perform and save some cash on Litho tools.  \n\nLikewise, Intel is getting ALL of the new EUV tools for the next 2-3 years. So TSMC has to make do with slightly weaker tools as well. ASML is constraint and Intel has them snagged up. \n\nOnce Intel gets EUV they will almost instantly catch-up node size/feature size PLUS have backside power/power via etc. Which is a feature even Nvidia said they want and stated that they will switch to whomever gets it first. Of note, Intel is ~1 quarter out with it. TSMC is 1 year out.\n \nMEANWHILE, graphic cards (the current darling of AI) and AI specific chips are going to Nvidia and Intel. \n\nAMD COULD still perform. BUT it's got MASSIVE headwinds. \n\nTLDR: AMD is getting punched from all sides. TSMC is maxxed out for output so they can't increase volume. NVIDIA is a beast taking their graphics card and AI money. Intel is catching up to TSMC in ~12 months or less and might END UP getting AMD's money in addition.

Not to mention, China imports a large % of its grain from NATO (or NATO-adjacent) countries.  90% of the world's purified neon, which China would need to use TSMC's foundries comes from Ukraine.  \n\nIn short, it seems like China could easily take Taiwan, but at the risk of destroying the world economy, wrecking global trade, risking a nuclear exchange, causing an historic famine in China and ending up with foundries they can't really operate.\n\nYet I hear China experts say the same thing you did - that's it's going to happen at some point.

They can probably pull that off for a few months.

Sure, maybe someone wanting re-election will go visit once in a while for domestic messaging and the Chinese will act upset for a week...but that's really the extent of it.\n\nCCP is also very pragmatic and economic minded despite how the west portrays them. They're not going to light themselves and the global economy on fire by attacking Taiwan for no reason.\n\nSure, there's some risk there, but I think the market is really placing too much weight on a pretty remote possibility. China would only take Taiwan through a) cultural/diplomatic means if they can convince the Taiwanese people that reuniting would be good for them or b) when Taiwan is not as relevant economically and the west stops giving a fuck about it as muvh\n\n\n...hopefully this doesn't age badly lol", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "China's approaching a massive recession.
