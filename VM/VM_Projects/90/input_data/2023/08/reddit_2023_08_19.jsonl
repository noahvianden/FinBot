{"title": "Massive Misconception About the Writers Strike", "selftext": "What most people do not realize is that the majority of the major studies are owned by larger entities that do not suffer from this. Sure its small term pain knowing that certain projects are on hold. There is a lot of content in the coffers that they can still continue to produce without additional writing.\n\nMost of the major studios also have other revenue streams that power them through. Let's just take Disney to start. They have $8.3B coming in from parks. They have $5.5B coming in from Streaming. They have 1.9 Billion coming in from cord deals.\n\nLook at Comcast, they have Peacock streamers, they have their existing cable business, they have their internet business (mixed with cable subscribers), they have their mobile unit.. they have plenty to keep powering their way through.\n\nThen you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too. For instance I'd be very interested in how Warner Bro's/Discovery are going to be doing.  I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects. The major studios now are conglomerates that own so many other businesses they can keep moving along. They also don't realize that these studios will keep generating revenue but don't have to pay any of the writers, actors, production, etc... they have a freeze on money coming in but also a freeze on money going out.  The problem with industry consolidation + multi-faceted businesses is you lose your negotiating leverage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. What do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEspecially their fear of AI As they know will becoming after their jobs. Netflix already was using it to determine what  shows and themes would be the most productive for returns. Disney/ILM started using it to replace opening credits. Disney even hired the group that for the end of Mando Season 2 were Luke showed up, another group of people showed they could do a better Deep Fake and they hired them. If I'm not mistaken Netflix used AI to write one of black mirrors episodes.\n\nAI is coming and I can see why writers are so fearful. People are so naive on the idea that AI is coming for jobs even creative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anything I'd love to hear from people some of the VFX studios if they are public? That would be were I would start putting money into. Ones that are progressive and have a massive catalogue. It sucks ILM is private (Disney owned), Pixar (Disney Owned), Dreamworks, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**At the end of the day the stocks to pay attention to are:**\n\nThe Chips Needed to Make these: Intel, Nvidia, AMD\n\nThe Fabs that produce them: TSCM, Samsung, Intel\n\nThen there are companies producing the software: Epic, Blender, Unity. Adobe\n\nThe Streaming Services: Netflix, Disney+, Max (Warner Bros) -- then you have youtube material being turned into its own streaming service like Curiositystream Inc.\n\nThe Companies that specialize in building AI  Model with datasets: OpenAI (Microsoft), Google, Facebook, ByteDance, etc.\n\nRoyalty Companies: Dolby, IMAX\n\n**Then there are the host of startups creating custom chips for these tasks (ASICS), newer software, and existing VFX studios who know how to power them all.

Discovery is pretty profitable, and actually there’s an argument to be made it’s under-monetized as part of the cable bundle. Apparently Discovery ARPU is something like 3-3.5 as part of the bundle? So they could charge 5 bucks for ad free Discovery+ and still come out ahead in the streaming wars. If WBD Stream, their programatic advertising business, does well then even a FAST version of Discovery+ would theoretically be more profitable than as part of the cable bundle. It’s not talked about too much, but Discovery took over Warner Bros from a position of strength in their spin-merge, rather it being a defensive play.\n\nFor Warner Bros, even in the worst case scenario where they shut down Max entirely and have no new content, they’d still own the back catalog. I could imagine the other streaming players would pay a lot for the rights for Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, LOTR, Batman, Barbie, etc. So they would get the high margin licensing revenue without any additional content spend. How large those royalty payments would be too hard for me to guess.\n\nTbh I’m not too familiar with the industry outside of speaking to friends that work in LA.

OP, I reaaallly hope that you see this. Man... you might want to really reconsider this. I think that you're about to learn a couple rough lesson that most new(ish) option traders experience (myself included).\n\nThe first being IV crush.  The vega on your 475 calls is 3x that of your credit calls. I imagine that you know that your puts will expire worthless if the price doesn't move. What you might not know is that your 475 calls are going to lose about 50% if the price doesn't move, and IV drops back down (which it probably will) to where it was a month ago.\n\nIt would have to go down significantly to make money in the other direction (like.... probably below 350).  The price will have to go up a lot (but below 500) to make money on the upside. However, if it goes up just a little bit, you could get another tough lesson... Early assignment.\n\nIf the price pumps up enough after the earnings call, the the holder of your 440 call might execute early. Then you'd have a short position equal to 440 minus the new price. The price going up to 470 after hours would be the worst. Your new short position would be -60k, and your 470 calls would only be worth around 25-30k.\n\nLosing 30k would suck, but do you know what would be worse? There's more shit that could happen...\n\nYour portfolio might register the new short position (-60k) in after hours after earnings, but it won't show the new gains in the 470 calls until the next day. Can your portfolio take a -60k hit without getting margin called?\n\nMore importantly, I see an even worse, nightmare situation potentially playing out...\n\nIf the price goes over 470, you get early assignment, and you get margin called, I don't exactly know what would happen to those 470 calls... Your brokerage may scan through your portfolio and see that you have those 470 calls and auto execute them to cover the 440s. That would basically stick you with that -60k position AND flush the value in your 470 calls down the toilet.\n\nLike I said, I don't know the specifics on early/auto assignments, and I could easily be wrong on that last part, but I wouldn't risk it.\n\nEdit: I just realized that I switched from 475 to 470 halfway through. The math would be different, but the concept and risk are still the same.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "What if he sells covered calls...", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Way safer play... And probably more in line with his convictions also. Really the only way to dodge IV crush is with stock or deep ITM options.\n\nYou could buy an 8/25 $375 call and sell $400.
