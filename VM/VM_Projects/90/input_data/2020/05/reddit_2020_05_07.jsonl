It was all downhill from there, eventually bottoming out at $1.38 in March 2009. EVERYONE was talking bankruptcy. Literally, everyone. I remember it because I'd watch the market news every single day. Then CNBC runs an interview with Adelson - I believe it was in April 2009. The anchor was trying to paint a doom and gloom scenario. Really, it was actually cringe worthy to watch. You could tell that Adelson had enough and cuts her off mid interview and says, **and I quote**, \"This is Vegas. Do I look worried?\" CNBC had a split screen at the time, one showing the interview and the other showing the LVS share price. As soon as he said that, you see the stock climb like crazy, never seen anything like that mid day. It ended climbing over 20% in one day just as he said that, and continued a climb over the next 4-5 years to over $80/share.\n\nMy point is that even though people see bankruptcy, they need to understand the business behind it. Look at all the retailers now. Which of them have billionaire backers who founded the company? None that I know of. The same with virtually any other business in deep shit right now. But, if you can find the companies with billionaire owners, chances are they won't let their businesses die. Who wants to leave that legacy and also who wants to lose that much money on a business **you know** prints money? This is why Adelson forked over $1B of his own money for LVS in 2009...and it paid off insanely. He's now worth $12B more than he was in 2009 because of it.
