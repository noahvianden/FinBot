Waymo is widely considered to be in the lead in the space and it will likely take them another 3-5 years.  Tesla, which started working on the problem 5 years after Waymo is still at least that far behind.  Cruise, Zoox, Yandex, Mobileye, and others -- there are many companies ahead of Tesla in this space.  Tesla will also not be able to it with current hardware, they will need to capitulate and use lidar or at least more sophisticated radar than what exists today.  It's simply too dangerous to rely on camera only; no matter how much lower they can get the error -- and it's not feasible with current computer vision technology to get it acceptably low, you need contextual understanding of the world that requires human-like AI -- lidar-based systems will always be safer. Using technology that guarantees that you are at fault in 10x or 100x as many accidents as companies that use lidar is not a viable strategy for gaining regulatory or public opinion approval.\n\nI do own a Telsa 3 (and a significant number of shares in the company).  I would never in a million years take my hands off the wheel or my eyes off the road for more than a second.  It's a great feature, but if you trust your life to it then you have a false sense of security and don't understand that low probabilities can still be unacceptably risky.  And that's autopilot on freeway.  Driving on surface streets is an order of magnitude or two more complicated.  If they're not close to hands-off autopilot they're certainly nowhere near robotaxis on surface streets. Head over to /r/teslamotors and you'll see that the majority of owners agree that it's nowhere near as close to ready as Elon claims.\n\nTesla, by the way, does and will use maps for their FSD features on surface streets.  They are designing their system to be able to work without maps, but I assure you that if/when they deploy in city streets they will absolutely be using maps simply because it's too dangerous NOT to.  The car will be more conservative (and possibly not drive at all without human oversight) when outside a mapped area.

{"title": "If You’re A Permabull, Keep Scrolling: The Next Leg of the 2020 Year From Hell", "selftext": "Ok listen up ladies and gents. I have been a bear since February 20th, and since about mid April I have been sitting on my hands on my gains from the big initial short. Yes, I’m stupid, but like many others, this was my first time navigating a 30% decline in the stock market so I didn’t have the macro view to see the upside recovery.\n\nLet me lay out some facts.\n\nI. The Economy is Fucked\n\nIt doesn’t matter how you look at it. I’m going to bring in an excerpt I wrote in response to someone the other day. \n\nMy two cents says the fed can’t help us this time around. Unless they act now. Savings rate doubled in April from 7 to 13%, even if it comes back down to 10-11%, the economic impact is devastating. America runs on consumer spending (70% of gdp), so a 40% increase in savings rate would be murderous. On top of that, people and businesses are over levered because of the belief that our economy would continue to pump out strong numbers pre covid, so there will have to be some deleveraging that happens. Stanford released a study a few days ago predicting 42% of job losses are permanent, but let’s be conservative and say it’s 20%. That would put us at 8-10% unemployment, again affecting consumer spending. Credit card is through the roof, student debt is through the roof, mortgages aren’t being paid on time, and jobs are probably not coming back. The Fed can buy up all the assets they want, the economy will be in tatters either way.\n\nNow, what can we do about it?\n\nIn my opinion, you go bottom up instead of the typical top down approach. The Fed prints money and increases the stimulus checks even more than they currently are. Make people feel fucking rich. Then, even if consumer savings rates stay the same at 10-11%, they will spend the rest of it and stimulate the economy. \n\nNext would be to bring jobs back home from abroad. Ironically, this is what Trump wanted all along and he might get the golden opportunity. 78% of americans recently surveyed said they would buy more expensive products if they were made in america, so bring manufacturing home.\n\nThe final step would be a massive infrastructure overhaul. I’m talking the shit politicians have been talking about for years. Airports, roads, bridges, tunnels. All of it. Huge federal jobs program. This should help bring unemployment back down during the deleveraging while companies find their footing and new companies emerge. \n\nRemember, these are conservative estimates and a path I believe is the only way forward. If we don’t take steps close to these or drastic steps in general, the devastation could be worse. I don’t see a better case, but maybe there is one. \n\nFeel free to debunk anything I wrote.\n\nSo given all of that above (assuming someone in the comments doesn’t completely make what I’ve said above irrelevant), we still aren’t anywhere in the short term. For all we know, the market could reach ATH in the next 2 weeks. \n\nThat’s where part 2 comes in, and where things get interesting.\n\nII. The Social Unrest\n\nThe social unrest is here.\n\nYes, I am absolutely fucking insane. I have gone mad by all measures of the word. But if you care to hear why I believe this is the tipping point bear with me.\n\nGeorge Floyd.\n\nMinneapolis was an absolute disaster tonight, I watched a lot of it on live stream and parsed through hours of Twitter comments. These protests are not over. They are lined up to continue through the weekend. Here is why that matters (again, in my opinion): \n\n- 30 million unemployed (with little certainty of whether their jobs are coming back)\n\n- high debt levels across the board for american consumers\n\n- low income households are bearing the brunt of the pain (53% can’t pay bills up from 44%, only 23% can survive 3 months on their savings)\n\nThese protests are going to become something more than BLM or Anti Cops, they have a lot of potential because of the amount of uncertainty in people’s lives right now. People will go out and fight if they believe it is their only option, and when they see things like “AMZN hits ATH” or “Bezos cuts relief pay while he gains $30B”, they get fucking pissed. Even though most of us here know Bezos isn’t really gaining $30B, a lot of people don’t understand that concept. These protests have to potential to be a massive, massive movement that will catch the attention of wall street and turn into an eat the rich movement. People are getting desperate.\n\nIII. Social Unrest + Economic Instability\n\nNow if you were to look back at any riots in recent history (last 30 years), you would find most of them have had little impact on the stock market. I would argue that most or all of those riots happened in times of relative economic stability. This time it’s different, and if we use Hong Kong as a case study, the impacts are not negligible. \n\nProjected GDP Growth in HK 2020:\n-5.8%\n\nGDP Growth in HK 2010-2019 (average):\nBetween 2-5%\n\nPretty fucking bad, considering coronavirus wasn’t even a thing when these projections came out.\n\nIf we have prolonged social unrest, we will be double fucked and it will really tank the markets, but I’m not here to go off on that hypothetical. Let’s get back to the focus.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThese riots have the potential to instill the uncertainty that markets have needed to reverse course. Social instability is the one thing that can trump economic instability, and wall street can’t ignore the two together. \n\nThese protests are going to bring back a level of instability and uncertainty to the markets, which I think will lead to a realization of the real lives of people across the country. This is just the spark that lights the fire, not the reason for the crash. The reason is still the fundamentals of the economy. The spark is the uncertainty that these protests will bring.\n\nAlso, Lil Yachty releases album tomorrow, so a crash is basically guaranteed.\n\nTLDR;\nProtests are going to bring back the uncertainty in the markets, gay bears will reign victorious again.", "id": "gs3po8", "created_utc": 1590661472.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "The only paragraph with unbiased arguments is the one about Lil Yachty", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "y = mx + what?
