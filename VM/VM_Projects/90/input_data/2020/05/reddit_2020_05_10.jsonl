{"title": "My Tesla Bear Argument", "selftext": "Not too long ago, the sentiment on Tesla across Wall Street was that it was a failing company that was nearing the end of its cash pile, yet a few upgrades from analysts later, the stock had position itself to be one of the strongest in the automotive industry. Up 242% YoY, I can't seem to comprehend what attracts investors and institutions towards this stock, as not much has really changed, fundamentally with this company. I am going to share my view on Tesla and try and debunk each bull theory, from my point of view.  \n\n\n* Tesla is 5 to 10 years ahead of its competitors\n\nIf you had said this to me about 12 months ago, I would've agreed with you, back then, it felt like the moat around Tesla's battery technology and the supercharging network was simply too much for others to catch up in a reasonable time frame. The release of the Porsche Taycan however, changed everything for me. Despite what you may say about the car's price, the Taycan is simply an amazing car and shows that the VW group is just steps behind Tesla in terms of  EV tech. With a real-world range of \\~280 miles and a price \\~100k to 130k USD with options, it presents itself as a viable option for those who may otherwise be shopping for a Model S. Moreover, it showed that Tesla was simply not great at building cars. The Taycan has a much better chassis and cooling design than the \"compatible\" Model S and Model 3. This extends further to the build quality, where Tesla cars still suffer from large panel gaps and imperfect paint jobs, despite having had 2 years to iron out these production issues. Europe was a hot market for Tesla through 2019, but its dominance will fade with the introduction of EV from big German automakers that are targeting the same segment as Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y (BMW i4 2021, Audi Q4 2021, Mercedes EQA 2021, VW ID series, etc..) Tesla's lead is fading, and it is fading fast.  \n\n\n* Superchargers\n\nIonity and Electrify America are catching up fast while Tesla has slowed down the supercharger network's expansion. The charging experience between Teslas and other makers is already minuscule in the EU. Likewise, there will be a larger pool of CCS2 fast chargers across NA in 2 to 3 years as it is a universal standard, whereas Tesla uses its proprietary port.   \n\n\n* Self Driving / Robo-taxi\n\nWhat can I say..... Elon Musk has been stating that AP will be fully operational as early as 2017. Yes, there is been progress, yes, they are ahead of every auto-makers. but no, they are not going to have AP fully working this year, nor next year, nor the year after. Don't even think about Robo-taxi, we are at least 5 to 10 years from that happening from a regulatory standpoint.  \nWith its current valuation of 151.9 billion, Tesla would have to outperform almost every single automakers, within the next 5 years to justify its valuation and I simply don't see that happening. It has trouble reporting profit without resorting to shady accounting tactics. The stock is simply over-valued and over speculated. \n\n  \nPosition: Short Sell Tesla", "id": "ggtq30", "created_utc": 1589080103.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "I think Elon agrees with you mostly", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "For everyone who is proposing shorting Tesla, please at least post a screenshot of your position to show you’re putting money where your mouth is.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "For those defending Elon, please back up the stock valuation with facts besides the tech.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why?

{"title": "What do analyst recommendations really mean?", "selftext": "Often I see people either taking analyst recommendations seriously, or saying that Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of idiots. Neither is true. The important thing to understand here is that it’s actually not their job to help retail investors (you) make money. Here’s how Wallstreet actually works:\n\nMost research analysts work for banks. You probably know that these analysts get paid very good salaries. But research in and of itself doesn’t generate revenue. So how is their existence justified? \n\nLet’s first talk about how banks actually make money. Banks generate revenue via corporate activities – these include both equity and debt financing deals – when a company sells new stock to investors, Wallstreet takes a clip. They also take a clip when a company issues new debt. It is true that investors pay Wallstreet some commissions to trade stock and to consume research, but those are dwarfed by fees for facilitating debt and equity issuance. Wallstreet also makes big fees when companies buy one another, so called mergers and acquisitions.\n\nSo as a bank, you want to do everything you can to get a company to choose you when they are selling additional securities. How do they do this? Well one good way is to write flattering research about the company. A research analyst at an investment bank is not supposed to make recommendations that help investors make money, the research analyst is supposed to make recommendations that maintain good relations with the company, so that their ECM, DCM and M&A teams can get deals that make the bank money. \n\nIf we take an example – some people have asked me why do research analysts keep upgrading Tesla’s stock price target as the share price goes up? No, it’s not because they are stupid. No, it’s not because they can’t see that Tesla is more expensive than all the other US automakers combined. Yes, they can see that the stock price went up while Tesla stopped making cars. BUT Tesla is a company that requires a lot of money (maybe even more now due to their production delays)! And that means both equity issuance and debt issuance. The ECM and DCM bankers are sitting there salivating at the fees that they can make as long as Elon picks them as the lead bookrunner. And these are the guys that get paid the big bucks on Wallstreet – they go and have a word with the manager of the guy that writes about Tesla, a much lesser earner, and make it clear that they need their firm to stand out as the most bullish on the street, so that Elon chooses them for his next raise. Consequently all of Wallstreet falls over each other to keep upgrading in the hopes of getting into the company’s good graces. It’s twisted, but this is just how Wallstreet works. \n\nThis is also why there are no upgrades for boring cheap and profitable companies. They don’t need Wallstreet, so Wallstreet doesn’t talk about them. On the other hand, if you are a money burning software company that pays their employees in stocks? No problem, no profits required – you will get upgrades. Research analysts are required to tie themselves into knots to justify any stock price, lest their delicious bonus will look an awful lot less delicious. \n\nThe same goes for companies that like to make acquisitions – cash rich guys with a bit of an empire building streak – here Wallstreet wants to pander to them to make money on the acquisition streak – think Allergan before it blew up. Also companies that are in areas where a lot of M&A activity is going on – guys that may be purchased by said acquirers – Wallstreet wants to pump these up to make a bigger fee when they get taken out!\n\nOf course, the issue with buying into this is that it can blow up at any moment. Wallstreet can’t manipulate the whole market. Wallstreet also doesn’t care if Tesla goes to $300 and all the “suckers” (as they call them) who bought based on their recommendations lose money. Once Wallstreet can’t make money out of a company, they don’t care about it anymore. They will still be laughing all the way to the bank.  \n\n**TL;DR: Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of self-interested cheerleaders. Don’t expect them to produce any actual research based on facts. Just like you, they want to make money.**", "id": "gh1pe7", "created_utc": 1589118099.0, "score": 683, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "The problem with analysis is simpler than you're saying.

The world of banking is not as bad as the original post depicts. “Evil” is not a necessary assumption to explain why stock market analysts are often wrong. \n\nI think the most common misconception about stock market analysis is that there *really exists* an intrinsic value, and if we think hard, work hard, research hard, analyse hard, and own sufficiently many phd’s, we can think it out with good precision. Which then is mistaken by a point estimate with zero confidence interval. But that’s not the case. At best we have a probabilistic assessment about the future, which changes as information unfolds.  Suppose the stock price today is 100, tomorrow it will be 200 with probability 0.5, or 50 with probability 0.5. The expected value is 125 and the 25% return more than compensates for risk. The recommendation -rightly- will be “buy”, and the analyst will be 50% of the time wrong. And then there is the nice multiple equilibria story, which messes up things even more. If the analyst recommends buy, people will buy my stock, I can issue new equity more easily, extend my business, worth more, which justifies the buy recommendation. If analyst recommends sell, people sell, I cannot grow, will worth less, which justify sell recommendation.

I previously worked on the private side (Industry coverage and M&A) of two large investment banks and can attest that there are alot of regulations in place to wall off the corporate advisory side from the sales & trading/research side. Mainly to prevent insider trading.\n\nFor IPOs companies will chose investment banks to manage the process partially based on their research analyst (whether they are good or popular among institutional investors in their sector, etc) and will need those banks’ analysts to support the ipo. In essence the analyst is helping the bankers and company advertise the ipo but if the company is shit, generally the bankers and research analyst will not go forward with the ipo bc analysts have a reputation to maintain among institutional investors (who are the backbone of ipos) and no one wants to waste their time and reputation on a failed ipo.\n\nOne thing though is as a research analyst you maintain a relationship with the company management so if you are overly negative about a company, itll hurt your and maybe your firm’s relationship with that management. On the advisory side, I’ve never had a situation where a company i covered refused to work with us because of what our research analyst said but there are probably unscrupulous management teams that would take that in consideration. However I would generally say because of this a research analyst will be more apt to express their conviction if they believe a stock has upside than if they believe a stock has downside and won’t rate a company as “Sell/underperform” unless they are really convinced the stock is overvalued.
