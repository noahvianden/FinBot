Once i get the shares, do a covered call for $280. collect about $2k premium if OTM. sell shares for $280 and collect prem if ITM. get something like $2k prem per week. i know thats probably not possible since it will not always work as planned with the price of SPY fluctuating. this probably works best if we have a L shape recovery\n\nanything inefficent about my plan? i know my risk is selling the put, getting assigned the shares, then share price keeps droppping significantly. at that point i would be comfortable holding SPY long term and just collect dividends along the way until it goes back up to where i would do cover call again and be profitable if i sell the SPY shares. the other risk is losing out on significant gains like if i sell puts/calls instead of just buying shares on march 23rd and held the shares for longer.", "id": "gjvjwb", "created_utc": 1589491868.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "As the saying goes “you didn’t invent the wheel”", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "as the saying adds: you wheely didnt", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Isn’t it the wheel ?
