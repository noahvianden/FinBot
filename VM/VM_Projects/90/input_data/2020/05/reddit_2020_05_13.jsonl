{"title": "DD: Home Depot HD $237.5 Call 5/29", "selftext": "First post so please don't tear me apart like JPOW did my asshole today with his big red dildo. I've been scanning forums for the last  last few weeks and have seen a lot of different opinions/DD's on stores with earnings next week like  Home Depot and Lowes. Figured I'd give you my 2 cents since that is all I have left after today. (For the lazy fucks/people that can't read- scroll to bottom for TL;DR)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHD took a beating today which is also why it's the best time to get in before earnings next week on May 19. When you  look at the 1 month graph, they have strongly trended upward about $30. Their 52 week high was $247 in February (currently trading at $230). It was gaining some solid momentum before yesterday afternoon when everything took a dump. I think they will beat earnings and continuously gain momentum within the next week approaching their earnings date for a variety of reasons:\n\n1) Long lines.... . I'm a licensed contractor/real estate agent and have gone to Home Depot almost 4-5 days of the week, every single week, for the past 4 years. I have never seen anything like this. Phones ringing like crazy, out of stock on items consistently, (could be supply chain issue but the second they get in certain items its gone the within a week), 2 hour lines inside, cashiers stressing out, (honestly need more staff), and then there's the line OUTSIDE lol. \n\n2) ReAl eStAtE mArKeT iS cRaShIng... a lot of other posts I'm reading that are shitting on my beloved Home Depot have stated that people don't want to list homes bc they don't want sick ppl walking through their house, fewer home sales, and that this is only temporary bc ppl are stuck indoors and have nothing better to do than change their old shitty sink faucet to a nice new shiny one so they can impress their wife so she doesn't keep running off w her new boyfriend... very wrong, but my own thoughts:\n\n\\- Nobody listing homes- wrong. I have done more than 20 showings in the past week. My email is flooded with inquiries for showings right now. Homes are cheaper, some people need cash now, and others just don't care about the new flu. People will simply put masks and gloves on, and typically the homeowner will greet you outside, ask you politely not to touch everything and let you walk through the home and check it out. People are still looking to move throughout all this especially because homes are getting a little cheaper. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-The Rich get Richer- Home prices have gone down since COVID-19 without a doubt, but nothing even remotely close to the 2008 crash. This is the perfect opportunity for investors to come in and buy what they can so they can get cheap properties and flip them (half of fucking real estate anyway). I personally work in the wonderful shit hole of Detroit and see it on a daily basis with multiple groups of foreign investors asking to put their money into the US bc their markets are complete ass and they don't trust their economies (typically South America investors we have been dealing with). We know multiple other companies that received a very strong influx of investors asking to put their $ (from 500k to 10 million in the last 2 weeks) into the US real estate market bc its getting cheaper and it recently has been on an upward trend. Granted, Detroit is a bit different but this week we sold a 50 pack of homes to an investor that has now hired 30 different crews of contractors to go in and flip those homes...... guess where they're getting their supplies from?!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n 3) Whos Buying?- Everyone... everyone from the Boomers finally getting around to their home project while under quarantine, general contractors still renovating their projects, older people in the gardening section picking out a fancy new plant to put in their kitchen window, to the younger couples buying some random ass high-end home appliance or lawn-mower they can't afford for their new home they aren't paying mortgages on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) tHE LiNeS aRe LoNg bEcAuSe iT hAs lImIteD capacity- YES bears, for fuckssake we know that there is limited capacity in the Home Depot stores but that doesn't stop people from going there (and good job, so does every other fucking store in the world right now).  There are also other posts under /r HomeDepot speaking about how multiple stores have beat their weekly goals by $400k.... I was bitching to my buddy who is also a manager at a local HD about how they keep running out of a specific flooring and paint that  I use and he told me when they get a shipment, it comes in and flys off the shelves within hours and that they have had online orders that they have to fill so a lot of items are consistently gone... also told me they have crushed their sales on a weekly basis since COVID started and have not had a down week since it was shut down for one week in March...  Another benefit to the \"Limited Capacity\" is that this will be spoken about during their Guidance and how they are actually OBEYING (\\*\\*cough cough Papa Musk\\*\\*) the actual laws that were implemented and are STILL selling out of things, crushing weekly goals, and staying busy every.single.day....\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) Home Depot Pro-  For those of you that don't know what Home Depot Pro  is... its pretty much PornhubPremium except free!. You get exclusive savings, discount coupons, business tools, purchase tracking,  detailed online receipts/login, and specific customer support line. Free to sign up and multiple managers at the Pro Desks have told me there has been a significant increase in Home Depot Pro signups in the last month. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHome Depot has had a very steady increase for the past 5 years. This month it was approaching ATH until yesterday. No doubt in my mind that this will surpass the ATH once earnings come out. I can't see it dropping much further and loaded up on calls at the end of the day while it was low. This will definitely continue to trend upward next week as earnings date approaches.  Again, just my 2 cents from what I have seen on a daily basis compared to the last few years of religiously going to Home Depot day in and day out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, but am a degenerate gambler and alcoholic)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**$237.5 Call 5/29**\n\n**$250 Call 6/12**\n\n**$270 Call 7/17**", "id": "gjam0i", "created_utc": 1589412950.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "I got HD, LOW, WMT and TGT calls for the 22nd", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "I got the first 3, may pick up TGT fthoi.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Price didn’t change much over today, so I figure it’s probably a solid play", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "tgt 122c 6/12", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": " HD, LOW, DG. my ass hurts from today", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "HD 250c 6/19 & BJ 35c 6/19", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You loaded on BJ too.
