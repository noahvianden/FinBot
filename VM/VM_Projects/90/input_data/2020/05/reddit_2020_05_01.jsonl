I remember this one event I went to on social good entrepreneurship really confirmed my thoughts in the subject. The lead speaker was some ceo from a sucessfully funded early stage startup in the social good arena that was backed by draper, alphalabs, and I think the Carnegie foundation. I will briefly outline the most bizarro world story Ive ever heard. The CEO talked alphalabs into a 100k of funding on essentially a napkin sketch (this is extremely uncommon in any place that isn't silicon valley), he then proceeds on his plan to make an environmentally friendly product that simultaneously provides profit while ending poverty and providing jobs in the Pittsburgh area. He then realizes that 100k is not enough to make a product and in the next year convinced draper to put in two million. He convinced them by essentially lying to draper about intent to purchase these products by big name companies. That was actually acknowledged on stage by all company involved. Then when he goes to make this product he  realizes he actually knows jack shit about how to make a product by spending all the money given to him trying to figure out how to build a fucking commodity item. Draper gives him another 3 million to go back and hopefully figure it out. He suceeds. Now though, he gets rejected by every big name company he lied  to draper about already having sales too. Why you ask? Because his environmentally friendly feel good fabric (yeah he couldn't figure out fabric for 2 million) cost a whopping 3% more to make, and Nike would rather spend 26 cents on the material in their $150 sweatshop shoe instead of 27 cents. Then he proceeds to making his own backpacks out of his fabric to sale direct to consumer(another 3 million from draper to fund this). Turns out word of mouth doesn't cut it and now he needs to start advertising massively to sale his product. Now thanks to this \"unforeseeable\" need to advertise, he needs to cut some cost. He does this by relocating the fabric production to China aaaannndd relocating almost all of the packaging and distribution jobs from Pittsburgh to outsourced and china. This brings us to now. Where this ceo, who is losing money selling backpacks because he has to spend 70 cents on advertising per dollar of revenue, because the only way to move this shit is by spending major bucks to blast an advertisement that tells you all about how this amazing company makes backpacks in china from non recycled plastic, that are also packaged in china with only two token black female phone operators in Pittsburgh that have a job solely for the photo ops, in frankly rather pedestrian styles, is giving me a talk on how to be a successful, SOCIAL GOOD entrepreneur(sorry for that doozy of a sentence).
