You basically wrote off the idea of doing a DCF, which is essentially the gold standard for any valuation. You address this in your blog, but I'd argue that with a robust valuation model you can absolutely forecast cash flows, D&A, PP&E, CAPEX.

But there are 3 things that I don't like about using DCF to value Tesla:\n\n1. As mentioned, I think it's hard to accurately forecast some of the factors that are part of FCF. Just one example is Tesla establishing more local production, which will benefit cash flows thanks to the 60-day gap before they have to pay suppliers. I find it hard to forecast how this will impact \"accounts receivable\" and \"account payable\".\n2. Even if there are methods and reasoning one can use to forecast all items that are part of cash flows, you're still adding more assumptions and variables into your model, and more places where you can make mistakes. EBIT has less complexity to it.\n3. I don't know that DCF makes sense for a high growth company like Tesla. Isn't DCF a method to calculate what kind of (steady) ROI one can get on capital? It seems great for a real estate investment or a very stable company, but a lot less useful for a dynamic, high-growth company.\n\nI'm less familiar with DCF, so if I'm missing things here, please enlighten me!

If you believe in an efficient market, theoretically the market will trade at or around this valuation. But if you know something about the company’s operations and can tweak your model, you may find that the company is undervalued.\n\nFor the other things, you can reconcile A/P and A/R using historical numbers compared to industry standards and your projected estimates. \n\nTldr: yes there are more factors that affect the valuation, but that’s what makes it more accurate,  and robust.

I'm happy to hear it was useful to you and others.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to give individual advice. As I explained in this blog, there are just too many factors that should impact investing decisions for each person differently.\n\n$6k is indeed not enough for any naked Jun'22 call options. The problem with a, for example, $1,300-$1,800 call spread is that the maximum return is when the SP is exactly $1,800 upon expiration. You'd net a little over 8x, but the stock would also return 2.25x, so you only make about 3x as much as you would by simply holding the stock in a best case scenario. If the stock goes up more than $1,800, you'd make less than 3x compared to simply owning the stock.\n\nI personally would also consider picking up a $1,450 Mar'21 call for $6k. There's definitely a lot more risk associated with this one compared to a Jun'22 call spread, and I'd estimate it has a >10% chance of expiring worthless. However, to me personally it seems like it offers a better risk/reward considering how I think 2020 will play out.\n\nI could be very wrong though. A single Mar'21 call is much riskier and a Jun'22 spread is much safer, but I personally would be willing to go for the riskier bet with $6k which I expect will pay off more on average. That $6k could have a very different value to you than to me though, so you have to make your own decision on what is best for you.\n\nOne last thing that makes me personally less inclined to go for the call spread is that I don't have a good feel for how the value of call spreads change before expiration. Considering I usually prefer not to hold until expiration, it's an important factor to consider. A naked call option will always be worth more before expiration than at expiration at the same stock price, but that $1,300-1,800 call spread would be worth less at a SP of $1,800 before expiration than it would be at a SP of $1,800 at expiration. Not knowing enough about this, makes it more difficult for me to evaluate the ROI of the spread if not held through expiration.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "here is a link to show how that $1300/$1800 6/22 plays out over time:[http://opcalc.com/8jv](http://opcalc.com/8jv)\n\noptions calculator is a good reference to see what your options could potentially net if you have never used it. Of course it doesn't take into account fluctuating IV but it's a good baseline to formulate an exit strategy for a position. If the SP were indeed to be greater than $1800 by 6/22 I would be losing out on potential gains sure but I would still turn that 6k -> 50k, and I would be more than happy with that return as I also hold shares as well and would continue to build on that position. The 3/21 call looks good and I think that TSLA could have a share price somewhere around $1600 if things go right, S&P inclusion, compounding profitable quarters, ect. Using that number upon expiration of the 3/21 you'd still make more if you were to execute the 6/22 spread that same day, I know you said you don't hold options til they expire and neither do I usually but just wanted to point that out. Also if there is a second wave of COVID, knock on wood that there isn't, it would drive the stocks down and even if TSLA does great and hits it's benchmarks the market uncertainty would definitely hinder the SP trajectory. The call spread gives things a little time to play out and I would rather error on the side of caution for now even though I have the upmost faith in this company's direction.

There's just two steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of shares it costs to buy the option.\n2. Calculate the necessary price upon expiration to be worth that many # of shares.\n\n**Example 1:**  \nStock Price: $800  \nStrike Price: $1,000 (**StrP**)  \nOption Cost: $8,000  \nOption Cost in # of Shares: 10 shares (**OC#**)\n\nThe formula now is:  \n**StrP** / (100 - **OC#)** \\* 100 = $1,000 / (100 - 10) \\* 100 = $1,000 / 90 \\* 100 = $1,111\n\nThe option would now be worth $11,111, which would be worth 10 shares at a SP of $1,111.\n\n**Example 2:**  \nStock Price: $800  \nStrike Price: $1,000 (**StrP**)  \nOption Cost: $20,000  \nOption Cost in # of Shares: 20 shares (**OC#**)\n\nThe formula now is:  \n**StrP** / (100 - **OC#)** \\* 100 = $1,000 / (100 - 20) \\* 100 = $1,000 / 80 \\* 100 = $1,250\n\nThe option would now be worth $25,000, which would be worth 20 shares at a SP of $1,250.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's easier to think of it and visualise it as a ratio. The option allows you to buy 100 shares at a certain price. You gain 100 shares, minus what you pay to exercise the contract.\n\nIf the SP is $1,000 upon expiration, and you buy 100 shares for $100,000, the option is worth 100 shares, minus how many shares you paid to exercise. If the strike price is 50% of the stock price, $500 in this case, the cost to exercise the option is 50 shares, so the option is worth 100 - 50 shares = 50 shares.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time, will look into it tonight!

At a certain scale it becomes harder to keep growing.

As is the case with most of big tech. Equally people are fleeing to these names because they have massive cash piles and actual avenues for growth. Given the bond market and state of the rest of the economy its like the financial equivalent of the floor is lava (some funds, like pensions NEED a real rate of return in order to meet obligations). If/when a vaccine comes out and the rest of the economy rebounds, you can bet that money will flow back out elsewhere (may take a few years)\n\nSecond of all - still Amazon did increase their pay?
