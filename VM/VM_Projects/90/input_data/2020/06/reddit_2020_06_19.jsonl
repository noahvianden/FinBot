{"title": "Big Move Coming", "selftext": "https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix\n\nI’m going to make this short and sweet. Every opex for the last year has resulted in GEX falling off a cliff and ending in or damn near a temporary trough. In most cases this happens over the course of a day or two, and it routinely closes opex day out with a lower GEX print. What does this mean for markets? A potential slingshot and snowball effect. Sharp drops in GEX often leads to a short term pullback in equities usually shown within a few days. It’s hard to make substantial moves in either direction with a high GEX. \n\nBear case: GEX falls off a cliff tomorrow slingshotting equities lower which is then compounded by negative dealer gamma causing a March like crash. \n\nVXX 7/17 50c, SPY 7/17 300p, TQQQ 7/17 80p\n\nBull case: GEX falls off a cliff tomorrow temporarily bringing equity’s down in the next few days to set up the next leg higher to SPY 330. Gives GEX a chance to reset and play into the snowball effect that allows for big moves up.\n\nSPY 7/17 330c, QQQ 7/17 250c\n\nLet’s see how they want to play it.\n\n6/19 Edit:\nAs predicted, GEX dropped from $6B to $2.1B today. DIX also produced its largest print since inception at 52.5%. Let me clear something up. DIX is not as great of a short term predictive indicator as you all think. It’s been skewed by the retail frenzy and even the creator of the metric said there may be as much as a 5% disparity between pre and post March DIX prints. I also have a running theory that the onset of pension fund rebalance buying has contributed to the big DIX of late lol. Anyways, as I’ve already mentioned, GEX moving drastically lower often leads to the market taking a similar trajectory in the short term. This does not necessarily mean we’re crashing. This means that equities should trail (to a lesser degree) today’s GEX move on Monday or Tuesday at the latest. From there, see the bear and bull case above. I’ll leave you all with this: If we see GEX move significantly lower on Monday, look out below.", "id": "hbrrcb", "created_utc": 1592531454.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "That's a bunch of fancy words and analysis to basically say...the stock market may go up or down tomorrow.", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "nice", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm in!", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Volatility traders ftw", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think actually it suggest short term pullback either way, after which we go up or down.\n\nBut I'm not sure we're seeing a pullback today at least.
