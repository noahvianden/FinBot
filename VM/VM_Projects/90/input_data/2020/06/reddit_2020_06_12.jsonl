Any tips/suggestions for increasing your quality of life on the cheap?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The simple answer is to work on yourself. My belief is that as long as I’m alive my mind and body are the closest thing to a guarantee that I have, so self improvement is my first priority. \n\nIn my experience the closest thing to a magic bullet to quickly improve your life is to develop your physical fitness. It makes you feel better, it makes you think clearer, it makes you more attractive, and it greatly improves your self confidence. I reached a point a few years ago wear I was at a social function wearing a shirt that had grown too tight on me and I just felt like a miserable fat bastard, I decided that I’d proactively address it. I signed up for the gym and committed to going 5 days a week, each day working on a different muscle group (legs, arms, chest, shoulders, core) and started an easy intermittent fasting regimen, where I was eating everything within a 10 hour window in a day. Within 3 months I lost 35 lbs and had clear muscle definition. It’s a few years later and I’m in the best shape of my life, feel better than I can ever remember, and have a lot more confidence. \n\nSecondly, I recommend actively reducing the amount of time that you engage in passive entertainment and replace it with active education. Be real about how much time you spend on the internet, on your phone, watching tv, playing games. There’s a time and place for all of those things but don’t make the mistake of giving over all of your free time to them, you’ll lose decades with little to show for them. I’m someone that requires a lot of entertainment and stimulus, ADD by nature, a great surrogate for me has been listening to books on tape while I’m actively doing things.\n\nThird, and most importantly, honestly assess your weaknesses and gaps in knowledge and really nerd out on educating yourself in those areas. There’s a quote I love by Joseph Campbell, “Where you stumble, there lies your treasure.” And it’s true, it boils down intention and focus. I grew up without any real financial education from my parent, shy and socially awkward, eating a poor diet, and operating out of a lot of limiting beliefs about who I was and what I could become. Now I’d say I’m much more positively developed in all of those areas than the average person because of deliberate intention and focus. I’ll tell you that self confidence and charisma are like superpowers that makes life tremendously easier. \n\nLastly, be frugal. Money is not an ongoing certainty. You could lose your job, the market could collapse, you could lose your health and with it your savings. Money is power but money is also defense against destitution. The accumulation of liabilities and debt without purpose is a trap. You deserve toys, nights out, good meals out, vacations and such, but only in line with what you make and only after paying down your debts, paying yourself in savings, and purchasing investments and assets that will accrue value. If your lifestyle leaves you broke at the end of month then you should take a hard look at what you value. The people you will attract with an ostentatious display of spending will only drain your coffers; if you spend unsustainably there will be a point where you lose the toys and those relationships. You should want actual wealth and not just the trappings and appearance of wealth, that’s a suckers game. \n\nThis all applies if you make minimum wage or triple figures. Know that you are your most important asset.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The easiest and cheapest way to save money while being healthier is fasting.
