{"title": "NIO: $100 a share in 5 years, or $15?", "selftext": "I got turned on to NIO by a friend roughly two months ago, when the stock price was worth $3. I didn't believe in the stock, I didn't know anything about it besides it being called the 'Chinese Tesla.' Nevertheless I put ¬£20 into it because it wouldn't hurt me whether it went up or down. I started taking it seriously when the stock reached $4 a share and funnelled ¬£100 into it. Never imagining it would reach $5 as quickly as it did, I sold it regrettably at $5.15 automatically, before I had the chance to read the news about the Goldman Sachs upgrade. So, I bought back in with ¬£200 at $5.95. It's value according to Goldman should be around $6.40.\n\nMy friend is part of a Facebook investors group, who turned him onto NIO. They had been buying NIO when it had been $2, not too long ago. They believe NIO has the potential to reach $100. So, for every ¬£100/$100 you invest in the stock now, today, could be worth roughly ¬£1,670/$1,670. \n\nObviously, I'm just spouting gain bullshit. Nobody really knows how much a stock can really be worth long term, there's too many variables to consider. But is NIO an actual 'buy' for a long term investment? Tesla has been able to grow so fast in the last 12 months, 1. because it's sexy 2. because it's a market leader in electrical vehicle manufacturing 3. because Tesla is so much more than just a car brand, Tesla is solar panels, Tesla is innovation and new technology. While NIO (at least to me) is just a car brand, and a relatively unknown Chinese one at that. Tesla is ahead of the curve, however, not for long, and NIO and every other brand are fighting to catch up. NIO will never have the market share Tesla has right now that partly justifies it's high stock price. When NIO is big it will be directly competing with Tesla, but also with Mercedes, BMW, Volvo/Polaris, VW/Audi, Toyota/Lexus, and others. With this in mind I can only see NIO reaching $15 in the next handful of years.", "id": "gycygk", "created_utc": 1591538631.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "...not seeing an option for $0.99?

I also didn't know much about that brand before until I start to see them more and more in the street.\n\nFrom what I have to say, despite the fact that NIO is financially not in good posture the overall popularity in China is growing very fast. I'm starting to see more and more cars day by day in the street.\n\nOne bad point is the fact that a NIO is more or less worth a TESLA which now has a huge factory and is literally invading the marked. However, with the recent anti American sentiment here in China and the the government pushing for more CHINA PRIDE / MADE IN CHINA stuff NIO might have a chance adding to that which is very rare here in Chine NIO is having a good reputation (quality etc - Chinese ppl tend to not trust Chinese cars).  \nTo finish I can really see the enthusiasm growing and their new car looks promising (hopefully it wont be more expensive than a model 3 or it will be a big fail) but I still think this can turn very badly. its a bet (i also invested quite a lot)", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "NIO has been on my watchlist for some time.\nI looked at their products and what convinced me not to invest was the fact that they sell cars more expensive than Tesla, and Tesla has a giga-factory in China. I understand that they target the SUV market, but even in China, I doubt that they can build a company and develop better electric cars at a lower cost than Daimler, Volkswagen, Volvo or Japanese companies who I imagine have already poured a lot of resources into R&D.\n\nAt the huge amount of debt they have I am very sceptical about their success. There is an enormous pressure for them to make sales.\n\nAnd if they sell now cars which are not good enough they'll tarnish their brand - something you don't want to do: if you bring a car to the market it better be not worse than the existing ones.\n\nOf course, those who have invested billions in it will seek it to stay afloat and I suspect the Chinese government will also want to see it succeed. \nBut, on the other side there is also the fact tha Europeans and North Americans are trying to curtail the growing influence of the Chinese in the world.
