It implies that Nikola and Tesla are comparable, as the comment it replies to demonstrated that Nikola has given some *rather dubious* claims about their planned future operations. It does so by highlighting one idea (of many) that Tesla has proposed which hasn't gone according to plan.\n\nWhile it's entirely reasonable to doubt some of Tesla's statements due to their timelines (and Elon's specifically) being inconsistent and certainly not consistently reliable, I think this overlooks a pretty key difference between the two companies: Tesla has actual produced on a substantial number of the plans they've laid out, historically. \n\nNikola currently has done little (to my knowledge, feel free to correct) aside from accrue capital investment, liaise with larger manufacturers to prepare a potential supply chain, and publish advertisements explaining the future they see in store for the company. Note that I'm not going to even touch the lawsuit and IP arguments, those are so far above my head I'd need airfare just to approach them.\n\nComparatively, Tesla has a history of successful venues to their name. They produce a significant quantity of high-quality electric vehicles, consistently show revenue growth and tangible efforts to scale their business, and appear to be directly connected to significant technological breakthroughs. While this isn't a guarantee of their future performance, as the analysts like to say, it does indicate that you can expect a percentage of their ventures to be successful, or at least feasible. Nikola has no such history to draw on.\n\nAnd please do note I don't have an issue with Nikola, personally. I don't like to discuss my own financial position (though my presence here might give some things away) but I don't even hold anything related to the company right now. If they end up being a successful venture, I'll cheer them on. Any green tech is good tech. But comparing the two companies simply isn't accurate at this point. It's more accurate to compare them to the Tesla of many years past, which to my knowledge didn't (and certainly shouldn't) have a valuation in the tens of billions so near to inception.\n\n------------\n\nTo more generally answer the question you posed earlier, I think the hate for Nikola in the sub is a combination of sports-fan mentality (which is surprisingly hard to avoid, even when pointed out) and the amount of effort made by so many people to compare the two companies. Especially when, as I pointed out above, it isn't truly accurate to do so. People in this sub are currently feeling rather vindicated in their beliefs. Who can blame them, really, when the stock is currently on an unbelievable tear? But this means that the comparison to a company with so much uncertainty and so many questions left unanswered puts them back in the position of trying to defend their position, which they've only recently began to feel they no longer need to do; this can be very frustrating.\n\n-----\n\nBut lastly, I'd like to address why you don't seem to be getting very productive responses, despite being:\n\n> generally interested in a good conversation.\n\nI see five comments by you in this thread:\n\n1. I thought the mission was about everyone transitioning away from ICE to BEV and other platforms. Why the hate in this sub for NKLA?\n\n2. When does the Tesla FSD Robotaxi network start? \"So if Nikola has no problem lying about these things, what else are they lying about?\"\n\n3. > unsophisticated investors who think they‚Äôre buying into a movement. \n\n4. I‚Äôm agreeing with you here, people should be very careful when investing their money into a company with a stratospheric stock valuation, much of which is based around future projects hyped by a charismatic CEO with a long history of over promising and under delivering.\n\n5. Literally quoted a reply to my question with a clear example to draw a parallel and I‚Äôll happily accept the downvotes. But I wonder if 3_711 applies this same standard to other companies with a history of lying about timelines and capabilities? Did Tesla ever build a single car carrier? I understood from the CEO on an earnings call that a shortage of those was causing Tesla significant logistics problems resulting in lumpy EOQ delivery schedules.\n\nLet's go through those.\n\n> I thought the mission was about everyone transitioning away from ICE to BEV and other platforms. Why the hate in this sub for NKLA?\n\nI think I've addressed that fairly well, I don't think there's much more that needs to be gone over. People are frustrated, and use the downvote when maybe they shouldn't.\n\n> When does the Tesla FSD Robotaxi network start?\n\n> * So if Nikola has no problem lying about these things, what else are they lying about?\n\nAgain, I think I've gone over this. It's not an entirely false equivalency, but it certainly is lacking in a few things.\n\n> > unsophisticated investors who think they‚Äôre buying into a movement.\n\nThis one is the most clearly egregious, in my opinion. The person you're replying to wrote four paragraphs to explain their argument, and you responded with a single line. Worse, it wasn't even something you wrote, just cut from their explanation and used to *imply* your argument. \n\nIf you want to have a productive discussion, state your points. What you did there was, in the meta of the conversation, easily interpretable as indicating \"your argument isn't even worth speaking about, because it falls apart under its own measure.\" \n\n> I‚Äôm agreeing with you here, people should be very careful when investing their money into a company with a stratospheric stock valuation, much of which is based around future projects hyped by a charismatic CEO with a long history of over promising and under delivering.\n\nThis is an extremely problematic statement on your part, because it firmly demonstrates you not arguing in good faith.\n\nYou asked for people to explain their skepticism on Nikola, and then used the false equivalency explained above to pull a \"gotcha\" moment and claim that there's no difference between that and their faith in Tesla. This one I'm counting as a strike against you, because it's not productive, it's disingenuous, and it erodes the ability for people to discuss with you. The only reason it isn't getting removed despite being reported is because it's in response to a comment that itself is straddling the line for removal. If you'd prefer, I'll remove them both. I don't see the need because the discussion there is clearly over.\n\n> Literally quoted a reply to my question with a clear example to draw a parallel and I‚Äôll happily accept the downvotes. But I wonder if 3_711 applies this same standard to other companies with a history of lying about timelines and capabilities? Did Tesla ever build a single car carrier? I understood from the CEO on an earnings call that a shortage of those was causing Tesla significant logistics problems resulting in lumpy EOQ delivery schedules.\n\nAgain speaks to the equivalency above. You're correct, Tesla has failed to follow through on many promises they've made in the past. You're also incorrect, because they've successfully accomplished many things they claimed they would, despite people decrying those claims as impossible.\n\n-----\n\nSo, in summation:\n\n> Thanks for leaving them up. I‚Äôm really not trolling, and am generally interested in a good conversation.\n\nMaybe, but you argue like a dick. \n\nImprove your discourse, and you get better odds of people actually having a conversation with you.\n\nHope this helps,  \n~Corinth", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I‚Äôll reply after giving this a full read.
