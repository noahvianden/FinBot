I’m in no way trying to be a bear or bull at this time. Just trying to look at it unbiased and to know when to cut loses instead of holding. \n\nSPG is down 20% from is high this week. Which was Monday. \n\nMAC is also down 30% from its high of Monday. \n\nI think to say these dips are minor is an understatement if they continue for the rest of the week.\n\nI have July exp on my calls so I am holding. But I don’t have much faith as of this moment", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your first three sentences show you aren't paying attention and are indeed bias as your ignoring news and what's happening with REITs themselves and substituting that for fear of an unrelated topic.\n\nThe second issue is that you're ignoring sell offs for things like Mac. People started selling on Tuesday because of emotional fears in PREMARKET, and there was the additional concern about the Jpow meeting that dropped the whole market. TODAY was a continuation of that.\n\nIn the end you have a ~$2 drop, with reverse resistance around 10.75 meaning it won't stay long below that because of real money holding on. Which is proven today when it dropped to 10.30 and shot back up.\n\nIt moved $2 in one day before why can't it do it again once the fear passes? It's a minor dip. Other tickers have even smaller dips. The biggest dip is SPG which isn't a surprise because it always swings and is the most popular and most known mall reit to it's detriment.\n\nNow if you feel scared and want to sell you can but it's throwing money away.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "OP: Buy July calls!
