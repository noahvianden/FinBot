Of those people who do, they probably spend every waking moment searching for inefficiencies and probably have expert-levels of knowledge about their domain. Realistically, most people (you) are better off relying on passive management, because they won't out perform the experts (discounting luck). Shit, even the experts can't really outperform the experts. This isn't a recommendation - do whatever you want - but if I were you I'd put 40% of my portfolio in SPY, 30% in QQQ, and 30% in GLD - that is, assuming I plan to hold for multiple years without selling and averaging down on drawdowns. \n\nSave your money.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "All good investing for dummies books will tell you the same thing.
