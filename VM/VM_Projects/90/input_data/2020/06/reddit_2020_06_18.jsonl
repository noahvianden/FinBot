{"title": "How to invest during this stock market bubble (macro economy point of view). Plus, how to invest like Buffett.", "selftext": "I  know there are a lot of new investors here so I just wanted to share  some advice. I am mostly a short term trader at the moment and hold  small positions in stocks I intend to hold for a long time. I am ready  to go all in again on my long term portfolio when the valuations are  attractive. I study macro economy as a hobby.\n\n# Are we in a stock market bubble?\n\nThe best indicator of whether or not the stock market is in a bubble can be seen in this chart. **Charts don't lie.**\n\n[https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/)\n\nThis chart shows you the **market cap to gdp ratio**.  It's basically a chart that shows how overpriced stocks are compared to  the actual economy. When stocks reach above 1 then it's in bubble  territory. US stocks are currently at **1.478**. At the peak of the dotcom bubble that number reached **1.4**. At the peak of the housing market bubble it peaked at **1.061**.\n\n# Market sentiment during peak of bubble\n\nAt  the peak of a bubble you start noticing a lot of people that have  gotten rich from the stock market. People are buying stocks on margin  thinking that the Fed will always save the day. It is very easy to just  buy and walk away and you see your portfolio double and triple. You see a  lot of hysteria in the market as you see now. This happened during the  peak of the dotcom bubble and the housing bubble. People were buying  tech stocks with $0 in revenue thinking they would be the next Google.  They didn't care the company wasn't making any money and thought the  stocks would just keep going up. FOMO (fear of missing out) is common  during these times. A lot of new traders hop in when they see all their  friends getting rich. During the housing crisis people with low income  jobs could easily get three mortgages to buy big houses thinking they  would go up forever. As we all know now, they don't go up forever.  Today, we see companies like Nikola with $0 in revenue skyrocket because  a lot of speculators are jumping in. But who knows, maybe they will  become the next Tesla. I personally would avoid it. This article  explains market sentiment during a bubble well. I think we are in the  \"return to normal\" stage where a lot of people were buying the dip.\n\n[https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-5-stages-of-a-stock-market-bubble](https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-5-stages-of-a-stock-market-bubble)\n\n# How to invest during a bubble\n\nBargains  are not easy to find during a bubble but if you do enough research you  can find them. Even during the past recessions, if you were able to find  companies that were a bargain, you still would've made money. I thought  airlines were a bargain when they hit rock bottom but apparently  Buffett had second thoughts. **Buffett never sells his stocks**.  When you see him selling stocks in a company, that means there are  serious problems with the company. He knows a lot more about companies  than most of us do. The table below is from Bridgewater Associates. They  did a study on a macroeconomic level on the impact of COVID-19 on the  economy.\n\n[https://imgur.com/xkDBwVC](https://imgur.com/xkDBwVC)\n\nAccording  to this table if the unemployment rate is at 10% you can expect an 85%  drop in earnings for the airline industry. Currently the unemployment  rate is 13.3%. Currently AAL stock is at $16. If you do the math and  calculate the potential earnings drop, the price of AAL isn't considered  a bargain unless it is less than $5. Buffett sold AAL at $11 and he is  right.\n\nOne industry that took a  huge hit but Buffett still held onto were oil stocks. Oil stocks hit  rock bottom during the recent crash due to oil prices dropping. I think  oil companies could potentially be a bargain right now.\n\nAlso, with all the money printing being done by the fed, gold is looking more and more attractive.\n\n# How to invest like Warren Buffett\n\nBuffetts strategy is actually very simple. **Buy when cheap**.  Even if you have to wait 20 years for it to become cheap. You need the  patience like him in order to become a legendary investor. He follows  the market cap to gdp chart closely. When the market goes through a  recession and the number drops down to below 0.8, watch him go on a  buying spree while everyone else is crying. He does this during every  recession. He rarely buys when valuations are high like now.\n\n# Are recessions bad?\n\nRecessions  tend to happen every 10-20 years in a healthy economy. The most recent one was in 2008. The one before that was 1999. We were long overdue for a recession but the Fed has been delaying it via quantitative easing (money printing) and keeping the interest rates near 0%. Most people  think recessions are bad but actually they are healthy for an economy.  Economies like the US go through debt cycles. Debt goes down during  these recessions and the economy emerges more efficient and it is better  for the consumer since prices drop. We are currently at the very end of  this current debt cycle and you are noticing the signs of it. Wealth  gap increases and social unrest increases. Interest rates are at 0%. A  new power (China) emerges and contests the current power (USA). Fed is  constantly printing money to keep the stock market from falling. Rich  get richer and poor get poorer. A deleveraging process (recession or  depression) usually fixes a lot of this. (source: Big Debt Crisis by Ray  Dalio)\n\n# Are bubbles bad?\n\nMost people think of bubbles negatively since the majority of people lose money during these times. But from macroeconomic point of view bubbles aren't so bad. These periods of high debt are when entrepreneurs emerge and start companies. They can easily get low interest loans like we see today. Few of those companies are good enough to become the next Apple, Facebook, Tesla, Uber, etc. The best companies will survive the low debt periods (recessions). The economies with the wildest debt swings are the ones that are the friendliest for entrepreneurs.\n\n# Where is the stock market going in the short term?\n\nNobody  knows the answer to this. I see a small upside potential but a large  downside potential. Which direction it will go in the short term is  anybody's guess. One thing I've noticed is Trump is trying very very  hard to inflate the stock market bubble. He knows he is not getting  re-elected if the stock market crashes now. He is pressuring the Fed to  constantly print money and he's spending helicopter money like a madman  trying to prop up the stock market. This may be good for stocks in the  short term but has serious consequences for the long term, since the  already huge bubble becomes even bigger. Also, during a deleveraging  process a lot of high debt companies declare bankruptcy. This is when  the Fed needs to step in and save the essential businesses. You can't  let large essential companies fail, since that might take down the  entire US economy. When the auto industry failed in 2008, it took down  entire cities along with them. All this spending that the Fed is doing  now worries me. They might run out of ammunition when they really need  it. This next recession might be very very bad. Recently, Dalio issued a warning to his investors about a “lost decade.” If he is right, that means we won’t see stocks go back to 2019 levels for the next ten years.\n\nThis doesn’t mean dump all your stocks today. I’m just giving you the advice from Dalio and Buffett. They may be wrong too. You should always do your own research and make your own decisions on how to invest. I personally think they are right. They are smarter than most of us here.\n\nSource: Most of this content is from Ray Dalio and Warren Buffett, the investors I admire the most.", "id": "hbkpk9", "created_utc": 1592507011.0, "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "imagine if instead of a crash in the Dutch tulips the sellers and landowners began buying all the tulips in a mad dash to stabilize prices and then the landowners began ripping out their wheat fields while forcing their serfs to plant MORE tulips even though they literally know the flowers were worthless just because they knew the tulips had to be purchased at the newly inflated prices otherwise everyone would starve\n\n\nhahahaha, can you imagine?", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "That sounds like a really familiar car rental company, or is that just me?", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Damn bro, use a comma.

{"title": "The Amazon of SE Asia? SEA Limited (SE)", "selftext": "Seen a lot of hype regarding this stock. I decided to do my own analysis. Let me know what you think as well! \n\n**Overview** \n\nSEA Limited is an Internet company based in Singapore. They operate through 3 different segments, not only in e-commerce, namely, 1) digital entertainment (Garena), 2) e-commerce (Shopee) and 3) digital financial services (SeaMoney). All 3 segments have huge potential for future growth. In Q1 2020, the company managed [58% YoY total adjusted revenue growth](http://cdn.garenanow.com/webmain/static/resource/seagroup/presentation/2020-05-18%20Sea%20First%20Quarter%202020%20Results%20Deck.pdf) from all 3 segments of their business combined. This high growth rate and operations in the future tech space led many to proclaim SEA Limited as the Amazon of SE Asia. \n\n**High Top-Line Growth** \n\nSEA’s gaming platform, Garena, continues to experience high growth in revenue as well as user base. Adjusted revenue grew 30% YoY and quarterly active users and paying users grew 48% and 73% YoY respectively. Their in-house game, Free Fire, was the main contributing factor to this huge growth. Monthly paying users more than doubled in Apr, hitting yet another record high.\n\nTheir e-commerce segment produced even more stellar results. Gross order increased 111% YoY and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) increased 74% in Q1 2020. Adjusted revenue was $314.0 million, up 110.5% year-on-year from $149.2 million for the first quarter of 2019. I expect the growth to be even sharper in Q2 as many turn to online shopping during the lockdowns.  \n\n**Operates In Markets With Huge Opportunities**\n\nSEA operates in a rapidly growing SE Asia market. The region remains one of the fastest growing in the world with economic growth continuing on average of 5.4%. Supported by a young population and growing middle class, it is projected that the region’s Internet economy will [triple its current size](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/asean-business/tech-change-brings-about-wave-of-opportunities-in-s-e-asia) by 2025, reaching US$300 billion.  \n\nThe company also focuses on emerging trends in the economy, such as e-commerce, esports and fintech. Newzoo projected that global esports revenue will grow to $1.1 billion in 2020, a [15.7% YoY](https://newzoo.com/insights/trend-reports/newzoo-global-esports-market-report-2020-light-version/) increase. E-commerce should hit $4.9 trillion by 2021, a [265% growth rate](https://beeketing.com/blog/future-ecommerce-2019/) and fintech at a [CAGR of 24.8%](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-fintech-market-value-is-expected-to-reach-309-98-billion-at-a-cagr-of-24-8-through-2022--300926069.html) through 2022.  The recent crisis has accelerated the shift toward these innovations, which would benefit SEA greatly. \n\n**Downside: Huge Cash Burn** \n\nSEA reported a net loss of $239.4 million in Q1 2020, slightly higher than the same quarter a year before. Expenses continue to increase in all aspects to fuel its massive growth. It burns up to $750 million per year, with a cash pile of about $2.5 billion. At this rate, it will burn through its cash in about 3 years. The company has to constantly raise cash to sustain its growth, which is not great for existing shareholders.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nThe stock has ran up a ton since March lows and is currently trading at extremely rich valuations. It’s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is at 18.68 while Amazon’s sits at 4.47. If we compare to Argentine e-commerce startup MercadoLibre (MELI), whose P/S is at 17.93, SEA’s valuation is still slightly higher. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile SEA has amazing potential playing in emerging markets and trends, it poses significant risks. The company is burning cash to fuel its growth and I do not see how long it will for it take to turn profitable. Furthermore, with its rich valuations, I see more risks than upside.", "id": "hbfxrk", "created_utc": 1592491479.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "i am from singapore. garena is kinda popular but there are really too many gaming options out there today and no strong moat for garena to be honest. shoppee has good growth and competitor lazada sucks after they got acquired by alibaba. competition is strong for e-commerce in the region too and we buy from amazon, taobao or various other websites, nothing really keep my on shoppee unless i want to buy some cheap mobile phone covers. haven’t heard anyone use their mobile payment at all and competitors like Fave & Grab are shit but still better known than SEA payment.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "From Singapore too.

Cash burn is worrisome but if anyone has ever worked in a startup, you know that there is a learning curve to break even and then sail into +ve EBIT. This org is in the middle stage of that curve.

Than, I bought my puts back for a loss to avoid assignement and realized I could have just rolled them and I had some research to do\n\nI watched tastyworks all day and night and have managed to turn 34k into 66k, just since March 30th. I know this is not typical, the VIX is high and selling puts/put spreads has been like free money with the market going up and up but,\n\nI have literally been making enough money to pay my bills with this. I recently made a really stupid mistake where I was basically robbed for 7k by (and I say this with some shame) an escort/hooker)\n\nI was so mad about this I told myself this week I would make it a goal to make it back within two weeks with theta. From Monday to today, I have made over $6200 off put spreads. Now, I still have 3 open that are expiring tomorrow so I could lose some of those gains or I could add about $700 to them.\n\nI know luck has played a huge role in this and normally option premiums are much cheaper but, I am so happy I joined thetagang and I really feel like this could be a full time gig for me, or, at least a great way to supplement my income. \n\nI have heard the horror stories about a single trade blowing up someones whole account but I feel like if I stick to spreads where my losses are capped, do my DD and not be greedy such as closing at 40-50% even if I am fairly confident I could ride it to expiry, not playing risky tickers, etc, I can easily add a few grand a month to my income\n\nAm I delusion because this is just dumb luck? In hindsight, if I dumped that 36k into nearly any stock on March 30th instead of depositing it to my theta account I would be up even more lol so...\n\nJust want to hear from some experts. I feel like getting 2% a week on a 100k account is very doable even in a low VIX environment", "id": "hbp6r4", "created_utc": 1592521800.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "Not to burst your bubble, but you got insanely lucky.
