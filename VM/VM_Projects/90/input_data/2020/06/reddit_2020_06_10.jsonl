{"title": "When to sell a stock", "selftext": "When to sell a stock\n\nDISCLAIMER- this article is for long term investors ONLY, if you're a day trader, you might not be much value from it. \n\nSelling a stock is a tricky thing to do. If you sell it too early you might miss multi bagger returns just for a 10% profit. But if you wait for too long your 30% profit will become a giant loss. This is a common problem faced by majority of the investors out there. The ideal answer is to never sell a stock but we both know that doesn’t work in the real world. About a year ago I was making a killer profit on BEL. This was a really good trade that I’d made. I could have exited the stock with a nice profit but I got greedy I held on to the stock for a long time and soon enough things turned sour. My profit went down. I waited until the price came back to my original target but the stock fell.\n\nMy lower profits were soon vanished. I’d just broken even. Now my only desire was to make a little profit but soon enough I went in the red territory. The stock fell down for no apparent reason I lost money. I could have taken a loss and moved on but I just wanted to break even. So I waited but again the stock went further down and hit my stop-loss. I went from a winning double digit return profit to a negative trade in a short period of time.\n\nI could have exited at any point. But I didn’t because back then I had no idea when to sell a stock. Selling a stock is really tricky.\n\n￼\n\nAnother time I had purchased shares of a company and the stock went down within a few days. I quickly sold my shares because I didn’t want to take the loss. But later the same stock went up at least 35% in less than a year. I felt stupid for selling too early.\n\nOnce I saw a company trading at 230 rupees, something like that. I decided that whenever the stock hit 220 rupees I’d buy it. The stock went down to 226 but then it rose, it rose like a fucking space shuttle. The stock then went from 230 to 600 in less than a year. A true missed opportunity. The opportunity cost was huge. I lost a multi bagger just to save a few bucks!\n\nAfter the third incident I learnt a crucial lesson- Selling at the right price (and time) is vital yet extremely difficult.\n\nThe example mentioned earlier in the book about Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is an example of extreme patience. Rakesh J bought Titan Company’s shares at just 3 rupees. He had a chance to sell them at 6 rupees and double his money. He didn’t. he had a chance to sell them at 30 and make 10x returns. But he didn’t. most of us would have sold our shares at 10 rupees or around that range. But the ones who wouldn’t sell it at 10 would’ve sold the shares at 100 or 200. Holding a stock which is up 10x or 100x is extremely difficult.\n\nThe moment the stock falls from 120 to 90 and you 4,000% return goes to “just” 30x it feels bad. We feel an urge to sell it before it goes down any further. But the same stock went to 200 and then to 500 and finally above 1,000. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala made 400x more money on his trade and he still holds a significant amount of shares of Titan even though the stock fell from 1200 to 1000.\n\n \n\nSo when should you sell you shares?\n\nThere are 7 situations I could think of when it would make sense to sell your stake in a winning or a losing trade.\n\nValuation Level Sell.\n\nWe’ve talked about valuation and how to find the intrinsic value of a stock and buy it below the intrinsic value. This way we limit our downside but what about the upside? In this method we sell a stock after it has hit a certain valuation. How do we find out the valuation? Through valuation ratios and market capitalization of the company.\n\nMarket capitalization. Every company has a market capitalization and there is a ceiling to the market cap of a company. The price of 1 share is 1,000 rupees and the total number of shares is 1000, the market capitalization of the company is 1000×1000= 1 million rupees. A lot of time value investors buy companies with a fixed exit. For example they buy a company at a specific market cap amount so if they enter a stock when the company’s market cap is 10,000 crores they plan to sell it at a market cap of 50,000 crores because they believe that the company won’t grow much after that. This is not the best strategy as it is almost impossible to predict when (if at all) the company will hit a specific market cap. So I don’t really use this strategy.\n\n \n\nP/E ratio. Every company has a P/E ratio unless the earnings are negative. So the plan is to buy a company at a low P/E ratio and sell it when the P/E is relatively higher than the industry P/E. if you buy a stock at the P/E of 17 when the industry P/E is 21 and 4 years later the stock’s P/E goes up to 38 when the industry P/E is 29, this might be a chance to sell the stock because it is severely overvalued. You’ll have to factor in the other factors too such as the P/S ratio, the P/BV ratio, the charts, etc and if the company is still overvalued by 30% or more you can plan an exit with a whopping profit.\n\nOpportunity Cost Sell.\n\nIf you hold a few thousand shares of a company for 5 years and there is no significant movement in the price, for example you buy Power Grid at 196 and the price after 5 years is 203 or 180, this is a very small movement for a period of 5 years. Then you might consider selling that stock to find a newer, better one. But beware that the price after 5 years may be 203 or 180 but if the high and low the price in that period is 90 and 350, you might want to reconsider your thought.\n\nIf you hold a loss making stock for 5 long years think of all the time and money you’ve wasted. In these 5 years you could have booked a small (or a big) loss and invested that amount into a better company and covered that loss. Some people agree on selling a low return stock and investing that amount into a higher return stock to cover the opportunity cost. This way he could have risked a minimum downside for a major upside.\n\nConstant switching between companies adds up to high transaction cost and higher payment of taxes (STCG)\n\n \n\nDeteriorating fundamentals sell.\n\nA lot of times we buy a fundamentally strong company at an attractive price but over the course of 5 years or so the fundamentals become weak. The company undergoes major changes like change in the management or it acquires a lot of unnecessary companies which rises the debt level or the industry undergoes a major shift and the company becomes a dinosaur. Anything can happen which can make a company weaker. DHFL was a strong company a few years ago. It was at 600-700 rupees and then it suddenly fell to 250 and the stock is trading at just 20 rupees! That’s a major fall. The company has a poor management and the debt has skyrocketed! This once good company is down to its knees.\n\nIf you had invested in it at 200 levels it would have gone to 691 but then I would have fallen down to 20 rupees and you would have lost 90% of your capital.\n\nFundamentals change. The companies that were once strong can become weak. Yes Bank is another example. This company was strong priced at 350 rupees and it fell to 30 rupees in less than two years. Sometimes you may buy a wonderful company but over time that wonderful company doesn’t stay wonderful.\n\nYou should regularly check your investments. I recommend going over you portfolio at least twice a year. An amazing fact is that majority of the Fortune500 companies in the 1950s and the 60s don’t exist anymore. So even the biggest, strongest and the most powerful companies can fall over time.\n\nIn the picture below you can see that the intrinsic value of the stock was 80 rupees and the market price was 60 rupees. So if you though that it was undervalued and bought it, it would have been a big mistake. The company performed so poor that the intrinsic value fell to a price below the market price and a new intrinsic value was calculated. Falling fundamentals is a giant threat to your strategy.\n\nMight be a good strategy to limit losses, not really for profiting.\n\ndown from cost and up from cost sale.\n\nThis is a technique used by amateurs in investing. It simply means that selling a stock when it is up or down certain % from your buying price. This is a very common approach and apparently it works.\n\nFor example you buy a company at 250 rupees and decide that you will sell the stock when you make a 30% profit or a 10% loss. Those are the two possibilities you need to look for. So if the stock goes up 30% i.e. to 325 you sell it or if the stock goes down to 225 (10%) you sell it. This way you’ll know when to exit a stock and you’ll not face too much risk. The moment you make a 10% loss you’ll be out and the moment you make a 30% profit you’ll be out. So your profits will not drag down into losses and your downside will be limited. This is actually a pretty good strategy. The only downside to this strategy is that you will lose the potential upside too. You’ll protect the downside but miss the potential upside.\n\nWhat if you book a profit at 30% and the stock goes up 300%? You’ll miss it. But isn’t protecting the downside more important than gaining the upside?\n\nForce sell.\n\nThis is a bad reason to sell a stock. Imagine that you invested 10 lac rupees and 18 years later it turns into 50 lacs. You now have increased your money almost 3x in 18 years. That’s impressive.\n\nBut what if you want to buy a new house or pay for your kid’s college? You can simply sell your shares and buy the things you need. This strategy talks about selling your shares to buy something.\n\nTarget Price Sell.\n\nThis is the most advanced type of exit from a company. Let’s assume that you buy a stock at 100 rupees and your set a stop-loss at 90 the target at 140. That’s a 1:4 risk reward ratio. Unlike the forth strategy you consider more factors and set a pre decided set price (not percentage).\n\nSo if your stock goes up to 140 and the stock P/E rose from 17 to 19 but the industry P/E is 21, you don’t sell your shares. Instead you set a new target and a higher stop-loss. You can even use a trailing stop-loss. So your new stop-loss and target prices will be 126 and 211 respectively. Then if the stock rises to 211 and the P/E is still not overvalued you can hold it and set a new target and stop-loss. But if the price reaches 200 and the stock’s P/E rises to 25 while the industry’s P/E is still 21 you can consider selling it.\n\nYou can also look at the charts of the company (daily or weekly time frame) and decide. If there is a resistance coming up soon you can sell it after testing the resistance and place a stop-loss below the support and hope for an upward breakout. If the stock is going in an uptrend you can use 50 day SMA along with 250 day SMA as support and use Fibonacci retracements to find new targets and resistance levels.\n\nThis method of investing is definitely more complicated than the other methods but this provides the maximum upside with the limited downside. The other methods lack either of the two factors.\n\nLimited riskLimited (but higher) return\n\n \n\nThe Never Sell strategy.\n\nWarren Buffet recommends this. He tells us to buy amazing companies at awesome prices and never sell the shares, but following this blindly can be catastrophic. You have the maximum downside in this strategy but the upside too is maximum, this is what makes this strategy the high risk, high reward strategy.\n\nYou can acquire potential multi baggers through this strategy but you can also lose it all through this strategy. It is dangerous. Even Warren Buffett sells his shares regularly.\n\nUnlimited riskUnlimited return\n\n \n\nHere’s how to use this strategy in the best way possible. You find an amazing company and buy it below its intrinsic value. Let’s say that you buy 100 shares of this company at 100 rupees and the company pays 6% dividend every year. The stock rises to 160 in 6 years (10% annual growth). What should you do?\n\nHere’s a possible answer- since you’ve bought the shares at 100 and the company grows at 10% per year and pays 6% dividends every year you accumulate 4610 rupees as dividends.\n\n2014- 100 rupees @6%= 6 rupees x 100\n\n2015- 110 rupees @6%= 6.6 rupees x 100\n\n2016- 121 rupees @6%= 7.2 rupees x 100\n\n2017- 133 rupees @6%= 8 rupees x 100\n\n2018- 146 rupees @6%= 8.7 rupees x 100\n\n2019- 160 rupees @6%= 9.6 rupees x 100\n\nSo the addition of the dividends is 4610 rupees over the course of 6 years. And the capital appreciation is 6000 rupees (160×100 – 100×100). So what you can do is sell those 6000 rupees worth of shares which amounts to 37 shares.\n\nSell 37 shares and your amount from capital gains and dividends will be equal to 10,610 rupees which is 6.1% more than your invested capital. Keep the remaining shares as they are i.e. hold them as long as you can (the company must be fundamentally strong).\n\nSo basically you’ve gotten back your entire invested amount with a 6.1% gain and the remaining is free floating shares for holding forever. You’ll have 63 shares of the company. Hold them forever and reinvest the dividends. After splits, bonuses and reinvesting dividends you’ll have a significant holding in the company which will multiply after each split and bonus. The 6% dividends will give you a decent amount of yearly income and you’ll have no risk as the investment has already paid for itself.\n\nSo even if things go sour you won’t lose money as your capital has already been covered. Everything above that price is pure profit.\n\nNo risk (after recovery)Unlimited returns\n\n \n\nOf course this strategy is made super simple and taxes, inflation and other charges aren’t taken into consideration but overall this was just to give you a fair idea on how you can eliminate risk after a few years and earn pure profit. This strategy is difficult as you need a company with strong fundamentals at an attractive price which provides regular dividends (or increases a lot in value) and stays amazing for a long period of time. Wipro and Infosys are prime examples of this type of companies. These companies have made massive amount of wealth to investors who got in early. This strategy might have worked like a magic in these companies. Speaking of magic we’ll soon discover the magic formula of investing.\n\nSo these were the 7 reasons to sell a stock. Now I hope that you have a fairly good idea on when you should sell a stock. This doesn’t guarantee you that you’ll always have the lowest downside with the highest upside but it’ll give you a small edge. And that small edge makes all the difference.", "id": "h0bgzu", "created_utc": 1591797351.0, "score": 361, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "I just wait for it to reach the top and then sell.", "score": 239, "replies": [{"body": "It works for me 100% of the time.", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "90% of the time it works half the time baby", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "90% of the time it works 1% of the time.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Half of me is 90% Irish...", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I like turtles", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Me too.
