We don't know much about what's behind your 150k. How your appetite for risk? etc.\n\nI'd suggest don't take a straight advice from anyone without understanding and do some more research on the type of strategies and their risk and see what works for you.

I get \\~1% returns on premium per week wheeling roughly 1 standard deviations out of money. With $150k, holding 3 - 4 positions might be your best bet. I wouldn't touch google right now because COVID has pushed the sector into what I would call \"WHY WOULD YOU BUY IT, THERE'S A THOUSAND DIFFERENT STOCKS OUTTHERE WHY THIS ONE\" territory. If a market crash comes, tech is getting rekt first (the next one likely wouldn't be directly COVID caused) because it is already overvalued while other sectors are at multi-year lows (they have less room to fall). I'm not saying GOOGL is bad, but I do believe there are plenty of better ones out there.\n\nAs for the other options, it really depends on your trading style. Is the $150k your life savings? Or is it just some pocket money? Because if it is your life savings, then you should focus on risk reduction and hedging to achieve the 2%. EI: avoid companies who face existential problems like they are the plague. Hedge against a potential bubble burst by investing in some VIX and/or gold to offset potential gains/losses. Because if the S&P500 goes down, no matter which stock you put your money at (ignoring puts), you will suffer considerable losses (minus your hedges).  Hence, fundamentally great companies and hedging will save your butt there, but these will eat into your profits.\n\nNow, if it's your pocket money then there are a few more ways to spin this. 4% or even more a month is easily doable depending on your risk tolerance. I would look into the energy sector (XOM, MRO, and EPD are what I believe to be good plays here) for a probable crude recovery of 30% - 60% up in price in 1 -2 years. EASILY 2% monthly returns via premiums with pretty low chances of assignment if you play it right. The cruise industry is also another good option (CCL is my only recommendation here: it's by far the best in its sector), though I'm not optimistic about their decision to set sail again in November. However, their premiums are quite nice, and it's an industry that's bound to recover once the pandemic is over. Financials and REITs are also potential plays right now, but be careful of your choices. I'd go with 25% in energy, 15% in cruises/travel, and 20% in financials and REITs. With your remaining 40%, find a BIG BOI stock of your choice and use it to lower the volatility of your portfolio. Have some extra cash left to toss into a VIX call or something expiring in 3-6 months in case there's a market crash.
