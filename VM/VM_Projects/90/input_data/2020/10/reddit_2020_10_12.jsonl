You need to ask yourself “if i had this new valuation in cash, would i buy this contract?”\n\nThis question will solve your life’s decisions when it comes to trading. Trust me. And yes, it will actually work in changing your mind. Sometimes after im deep in a contract i think “fuck it, im gonna wait to see if i lose my last 200$.”\n\nBut if i stepped back and looked at the REALITY of it, ultimate liquidity means you essentially just have cash, and by not selling it, you’re buying it.\n\nAnd most of the times in these situations when you say it outloud like that, you realize, it sucks that i lost some cash, but fuck no would i make this bet right now.
