Assuming AMD stays flat, you will lose every day. If it goes up a couple bucks tomorrow, I'd sell it and use that profit to buy an end of October call. Odds are it won't hit 90+ this week, but may do so by the end of the month. Options lose value every day because extrinsic value is based off of time until expiration. When you buy a weekly, it will bleed 1/5th of it's value every day. Its cheaper to buy weeklies because there is less time left. \n\nTheta is the estimate of how much it costs to hold for a day. Think about it as the daily cost of the contract. I just looked up your call, it has a Theta of -0.1926. it will lose about $20 every day unless the price of AMD climbs. If you bought it for $30-40, and it's now worth $67 at close, tomorrow at open it will likely drop to $45-55 just because you held it overnight. It has a Delta of about $20, Delta is how much it should go up or down in price for every $1 in change on the underlying stock. So if AMD moves up a buck or two tomorrow, I'd probably sell and collect your small gain. Unless you expect AMD to go up every day by at least a dollar, it would be dumb to hold onto this for much more than the next day or two. Of course if AMD goes up $3-4 tomorrow, you will miss out on some profits.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Well I held it's worth pretty much nothing.
