{"title": "Apple and Netflix Discussed Acquiring ‘Bond’ Movie for Streaming", "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-netflix-discussed-acquiring-bond-231130830.html\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. held discussions with Apple Inc. and Netflix Inc. about taking its new James Bond film directly to streaming, according to people familiar with the situation, but the studio says it’s committed to a theatrical release.\n\nThe film, “No Time to Die,” could fetch hundreds of millions of dollars in a potential streaming sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. MGM declined to comment on any talks, but said the film “is not for sale.”\n\nNabbing the rights to “No Time to Die,” would have been a major coup for a streaming service and could have helped entice subscribers looking to watch the latest Bond movie. The Daniel Craig film, which cost about $250 million to produce, would be the most notable movie to switch to streaming due to the pandemic, though other films have taken a similar route.", "id": "jh93ht", "created_utc": 1603546861.0, "score": 775, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "Content is king.
