{"title": "Due Diligence on Hyliion (HYLN)", "selftext": "I’d like to preface this post by stating this is my first proper DD that I’ve publicly submitted. I’ve been a follower of r/stocks for nearly 4 years now, mostly lurking and absorbing information. This is my way of thanking this community for helping me begin my investment journey and helping me mature into financial adulthood. I also think it’s necessary for me to make this point because lately I’ve noticed a concern with new accounts attempting to pump HYLN, which isn’t my intention nor is it something that I approve of as it leads to volatility. I plan to hold HYLN long-term (at the very least until I can avoid short-term capital gains tax before I start accepting *some* of my gains). \nBefore I begin I want to emphasize that **this is not a pump stock, the short-sellers need to stop treating it as one.** If you invested in this stock during the merger then short of accepting your losses you are now a long-term investor (1-2 years). Consider it a lesson learned and perhaps one that will pay for itself. \n\nOnto the meat. \n\n# Explaining Hyliion \nhttps://www.hyliion.com/\n\nHyliion (pronounced Hi-Lee-On) stands for HYbrid-LIthium-IOn. They're a company located in Austin, TX and led by a young CEO by the name of Thomas Healy. They offer electrified powertrain conversion systems for Class 8 fleet semi-trucks, effectively converting a diesel or natural gas powered semi-truck into a hybrid by replacing the powerhouse of the rear-most rear-axle with a battery-powered axle (think “Toyota Prius” functionality but on a larger scale). \nThey're also preparing a roll-out of their fully electric semi-truck known as the Hypertruck ERX. Their products are designed to improve performance and lower cost of ownership while leveraging the already-existing alternative fuel infrastructure. \n\nThe hype factor surrounding the company appears to have helped potential clients pursue their company with interest instead of their company chasing clients, I see this as a huge win for them, as does Thomas Healy (1). \n\nThis hype factor, for better or worse, found its way into the retail investor’s strategy as well. The stock price climbed 500% within a few months. Despite being due for a correction many gambled on the hypothesis that the price would continue to rise after the merger. Unfortunately, the week prior and during the merger resulted in a lot of unplanned activity leading to an increase in volatility. During the merger there were eight proposals that Hyliion was pushing to be approved prior to completing the merger and being listed on the stock exchange. All passed but one; Proposal 3. Proposal 3 was set to classify the board of directors, however this proposal failed to pass by popular vote of the investors for the general reason summarized by one large investor below: \n\n>One large investor, Kevin Jenkins of Utah Advisors, said his firm voted against proposal three in order to balance power between stockholders and the board. A classified board can make it harder for stockholders to force changes on a company when things go wrong. Jenkins cited recent troubles at Nikola as a recent example of such conflicts. (2)\n\n\nThis immediately resulted in the initial downward trend of the stock’s price. There was a lot of uncertainty in the air surrounding the merger and the future of the company (false rumors stating that “the merger cannot pass without this proposal” surfaced leading to more fear for the new-term future) and caused doubt for many retail investors. Hyliion extended the voting exclusively for Proposal 3 by an additional two days to recount and offer additional time to vote for those who didn’t. Proposal 3 failed again and once again the price of the stock dropped. The key to what happened on Wednesday however is that Hyliion confirmed that the merger would still be taking place on that Friday, and the ticker would change to HYLN at some point in the following week for all brokerages (the timing varies between them). This all seemed to line up once again until the unexpected happened at the worst time, the Thursday evening prior to the ticker change President Trump confirmed via Twitter that he tested positive for CoVid-19. The markets tanked and Hyliion was hit about as hard as you could imagine. \n\nEventually, the merger went through and now we can move onto talking about what this company offers for the future of the Class 8 semi-truck industry!  \n\n\n#**Product 1:** The Hybrid-Electric Product\nThe hybrid conversion products are available for order and fitting TODAY and can be optioned to cost between $36,000 and $40,000 per unit (7). It's a product that's universally compatible between all trucking OEMs (it's already been featured mounted to a 2020 Freightliner Cascadia in front of the NYSE and Thomas Healy has confirmed that it can be installed on all other CLASS 8 manufacturers as well including Peterbilt, Volvo, Mack, Kenworth and International). \n\nThe front most rear axle is still driven by the truck's factory engine, however the rear most rear axle is 100% electric-drive. A keynote is that this product is not manufactured in house, it’s manufactured by DANA; an industry leading supplier of drivetrain, axle and electrified propulsion components. DANA holds a stake in HYLN equity (12). \n\nTwo options for the hybrid conversion unit exist. They can be installed on both a used truck as well as a brand-new truck while retaining the manufacturer’s warranty. I’ll briefly cover them both below:\n\n**The Hybrid Diesel Unit**\nEssentially taking your typical diesel-powered semi-trucks and fitting them with a battery-powered rear most rear axle. The battery system can be installed on nearly every OEM’s Class 8 semi-truck with no additional driver training required. The unit weighs 695lbs and adds ~1500 ft lbs. of torque and 120hp capability to the semi-truck, offering immediately improved performance and efficiency. The software (created in-house) offers advanced analytics that maximize fuel economy by determining precisely when to utilize the captured energy, keeping the truck in an efficient operating range (4) with assistance through the power of regenerative braking that supplements the jake brake (a generally prohibited noisy brake that brakes the engine by loss of energy that would otherwise be used to turn the engine’s crankshaft) and reduces the truck’s brake wear thereby reducing maintenance on this component of the vehicle as an additional bonus. \n\nDuring a vlog test-drive with the hardware (7), two truckers summarized their opinion on the hybrid conversion system using the following points:\n\n* It “feels and runs just like a regular diesel truck”. \n* Saves on fuel. \n\n* The increased performance is very welcomed, especially during up-hill driving.\n\n* The software offers a “points system” that keeps track of the driving habits of the driver, keeping them conscious of their driving decisions and helping them save money through efficiency. \n\n\n**The Hybrid Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Unit**\nThis hardware is identical to the hardware utilized for the hybrid-diesel unit. CNG trucks are generally underpowered when compared to their diesel counterparts, this product assists the CNG trucks in gaining performance by storing energy on down hill roads and flat terrains to assist in accelerating the truck up the next inclined road. The additional power figures help supplement additional payload as well, allowing for tandem sets to be pulled by CNG trucks (a trait generally exclusive to diesel-powered trucks). Again, the beauty of this product shines from the software that uses algorithms designed to take advantage of previously collected hill data based on terrain and location to maximize climbing power (5). \n\nA common retort I’ve seen by the investing community is that “hybrids aren’t the future, electric is”. I agree, however I also believe that the hybrid solution is the short-term, necessary steppingstone to the electric future. Hyliion has a plan for the future as well. Let's move onto that. \n\n\n#**Product 2:** The Hypertruck ERX\nEnter the ERX. This is their fully electric-drive truck. The rear axle is driven solely by an electric motor with battery cells provided by Toshiba and packaged and managed in-house by Hyliion (8). When the truck’s battery power is low an under-the-hood generator turns on, converting renewable natural gas produced by biowaste to charge the battery thus delaying the need for a grid-charge. This results in the Hypertruck ERX producing NET-NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS. \n\nPage 9 of their investor presentation offers the following comparison between their Hypertruck ERX, Tesla’s Battery-Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Nikola’s scam product:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/v59n7lQ.png \n\nThe truck offers 1,300 miles of range with a larger payload than the competition and shorter recharging time than a Tesla:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KKv4tzb.png \n\n#**Product 3:** The Batteries & Software\nThe battery packaging, modules and management systems (software controlling the functionality of the battery) are built in-house by Hyliion. The lithium-ion battery cells are sourced from Toshiba. \n\nHyliion’s software is a key product that appears to be overlooked by many investors. The software works off of driving habits and locations to allow for a more efficient battery life, prolonging drivability between refuels as well as increased efficiency and the pat on the back  knowing that you're utilizing renewable resources.  Thomas Healy has stated that one of their company’s goals is to work with the battery cells that are provided to them and configure the functionality of the batteries with their software to outlast the truck's lifespan; instead of evolving the batteries they are evolving the software that can make the current-existing technology *better*.\n\n#Clients\nBelow is a list of target customers. Do with this information what you will as most of them have not been confirmed at this time but being focused on such heavy hitters provides a very positive outlook for the investors:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/UxSQ3Ra.png \n\n* The logistics company “Agility” has confirmed a pre-order of 1,000 Hypertruck ERX vehicles (featuring a $5,000 deposit per truck). The initial fleet demonstration vehicles are expected to be delivered at some point in 2021, with volume shipments scheduled for 2022 for all clients. Agility also invested in HYLN pre-merger.\n\n* Wegmans, a grocer that offers 103 stores and two distribution centers across seven states, has paired with Hyliion for their CNG conversion product. They recently purchased two brand new Volvo CNG semi-trucks, one that is being used to test the Hyliion CNG conversion system. Wegmans' statement on this product is quoted as “a true performance game changer that gives the truck enough torque and horsepower to pull a tandem set” (13). Prior to Hyliion’s conversion system the only trucks they had that could pull a tandem set were diesel-powered. Wegmans has a history of pushing for renewables. Their assuring stance on Hyliion’s product bodes well for  Hyliion’s company, investors and their future clients. \n\n* Penske is another target client that recently purchased into the conversion product. They started with converting three trucks with \"the remainder being delivered throughout the year\" (14).\n\n* Saving the dessert for last. This is not a confirmed client, but this was a very interesting find to come across. In the beginning of this video, showing off the ERX:\n(SOURCE WAS YOUTUBE - REMOVED - I didn't realize I can't use YouTube links in my posts, instead please reference the screenshots below - if you're interested feel free to PM me for the actual link to the video). \nIf you look closely, you’ll see what appears to be an H-E-B (a supermarket grocery chain based in San Antonio Texas) semi-truck:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QoQtxHx.png\nHere’s an image I pulled from the internet that shows what their semi-truck looks like in full:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2RUknKA.png \nThis may only be the beginning of the rumor, but it seems likely that HEB is testing Hyliion’s conversion product. After all, they are on Hyliion’s “Target Customers” list featured in the image at the beginning of this section. \n\n\n#Competition\nI should begin this segment by stating that at this moment Hyliion does NOT have any competition when it comes to hybrid conversion technology for Class 8 semi-trucks. \n\n**Tesla** \n\nTesla has plans to build battery-powered semi-trucks at the cost of ~$200,000 per truck, with an expected range of 500 miles (compared to Hyliion’s 1300 miles with the ERX). I think that they are a very competent competitor however they have many fine lines left to iron out and like Hyliion, the strength of their position in this sector is still completely unknown. They’re dominating the retail consumer EV market but that can’t be compared to the truck market. I also don’t believe that autonomous trucking will become the norm any time soon (lobbyists and lawsuits will push this back for years if not decades). An advantage for Hyliion here is timing; they're ahead of the game with their products already available for testing, analytics and purchase.\n\nThroughout my DD I’ve found myself reading trucking blogs and watching trucking vlogs. I’ve noticed that truck drivers tend to be “old school” and particular people. I can’t imagine that the interior minimalistic qualities that Tesla is known for will be popular with those clients (chains like WalMart won’t care what their truckers like or dislike which renders this point moot in that sense, however the many smaller chains and retail drivers will consider this point in their decision). \n\n**Nikola Motors**\n\nThey’re under investigation by the SEC amid fraud allegations, and the CEO Trevor Milton has since stepped down from his position within the company. Not only that but GM have pushed back their contract to renegotiate their terms given the company’s recent headlines in the news. At this moment I don't think it's reasonable to consider their company a competitor to anyone.\n\n#Concerns\n\nI can’t trust someone’s DD unless if it contains some potential negatives about the company, so I couldn’t expect you to read through mine without knowing what concerns I have about Hyliion's future:\n\n* They’re a newly offered company that’s only a few years old with a young, unproven albeit ambitious and driven CEO. How will he handle the title of \"youngest billionaire\"? How will he handle potentially delayed earnings in the future? Will he reallocate funds properly in his company? How does he interview his potential peers and under what basis does he hire on?\n\n* Their revenue won't ramp up for at least a year. They’re expecting $1,000,000 in revenue by the end of 2020, and $8,000,000 by 2021. The expected earnings increase at an ambitious rate and right now we don’t know how competently the company will be run in the long term. Their expected earnings from 2020-2024 can be seen here: https://i.imgur.com/QC1F5Pj.png \n\n* Their social media presence isn't up to par with what the investors were expecting. Thomas Healy has promised to be more active on social media, but people want more. He went from never posting anything to posting once every couple of weeks. People are expecting a Trevor Milton tier of pumping which they won't receive, but I think it'd be nice to hear from him a bit more often so that we know he's still alive, at least. Obtaining a closer relationship with your investors is never a bad idea either. I noticed that Hyliion is looking for a VP of Marketing at this moment, perhaps that person will assist here. \n\nIf you made it this far I commend you and appreciate your time. We’re here to become better traders and if you have any critiques or corrections regarding my DD I’m happy to acknowledge them. \n\n**NOTE:** Some of my sources were removed. I didn't realize that YouTube links cannot be referenced in posts. I understand the reasoning (people will pump their own channels), but it's an inconvenience here. If anyone wants the direct links I am happy to PM them to you. The background to HYLN and how they came to IPO has also been removed under Rule #7, if anyone is interested in the full details regarding their merger feel free to message me directly. \n\nSources:\n\n1.)

This equates to roughly 500 miles before the driver needs to stop, which is the Tesla Semi's total range. So even if the driver were to drive the maximum amount of miles, he would not need to stop. Realistically drivers will probably stop closer to 6 hours into the first drive.\n\nDuring this 30min resting period the driver can charge the vehicle well over 80% of a full charge, so with the Tesla this would be at least another 400 miles of range which is enough to last for the full 3 more hours the driver is allowed during the rest of their working day.\n\nSo ultimately the only prerequisite is that there are enough chargers available so that the driver can take his 30 min break somewhere between the first 300-500 miles.\n\n> Think of the driver schedule.

The driver has to pee, eat dinner, and take his 30 min break at some point.  These are human beings, not robots.  Can you drive for 8 hours straight and not take one piss or eat your lunch?   There's a whole other thing about \"trucker bottles\" used when you're in a hurry or don't want to pull over.  \n\nRead up on trucker hours of service here.  \n\nhttps://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations\n\nI take it that you've never driven a tesla on a long road trip AND you've never taken a ride on a long haul semi truck trip across several states.  In my case it was socal to norcal in a Tesla.  And up/down the eastern seaboard in a semi truck.  \n\nDriving a Tesla (car) on a long trip is a FUCKING PAIN IN THE ASS because of charging times.  Your whole focus is planning your trip around where chargers are and trying to eat/run errands while the damn thing charges.  \n\nNow scale this up to a semi truck charging grid, which we currently have ZERO of.  Lets just say Elon builds 100 of these 30min charging stations along I40 which is a major transportation corridor for trucks going east/west coast deliveries.  When you pull up to one of these truck stop diesel pumps, the wait time is often 30min or more, TO GET TO THE PUMP.  These trucks can fill 300 gallons in 10min (two tanks, each with their own nozzle.)  It is not the same diesel pump you see for cars/trucks.  It's a much bigger tube with a much higher flow rate.  \n\nNow these Tesla semis are taking 30min to charge, how many charging stations do you need so you're not waiting an hour or longer to charge?  Lets say 40 charging stations at a Tesla truck stop.  If you have 40 trucks charging at once, to get that 30min charge rate, it's approx 1 megawatt PER truck.  I don't know what voltage its charging at, but lets generously say 1000 volts.  3600 amps of power for ONE truck to charge.  Times 40, times however many charging locations on that power grid, you see where this is going (and you did address this).  Tesla would have to build another Ivanpah sized solar farm just to power 10 of these \"gas stations\". \n\nYou are grossly simplifying the problem of charging with a semi truck on long haul routes.  You're googling hours of duty and such but you've never worked in the trucking industry or driven a tesla on a long trip (assumption, but I'm 99% sure you haven't).   \n\nThere are people much smarter than you and I working on these challenges, and we will come up with something.  I do believe that batteries and a renewably sourced power grid is the future.

I personally think this will happen faster than you might think as EV adoption follows an S-curve, but it's still going to be an issue in the first years of the Semi's product lifetime.\n\nOn the upside, this will also be an opportunity for companies like Exxon, Shell, etc. to use their existing infrastructure and change it into a business model that will still exist in 10 years' time. Imagine all the fuel stations they could convert into massive charging lots powered by renewable energy with restaurants and other ways to pass the time while your car/truck is charging.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I believe that EV cars will have that S curve adoption as you mention.  CA is regulating for this to happen as well.  The charging infrastructure is not nearly as difficult to build out for cars.  while our power grid does not have a huge amount of excess capacity, we can still incrementally add car charging superchargers.  as you’ve seen, semi truck supercharging, is a much bigger problem.  which I have no doubt we will solve.  I sure as fuck I’m not smart enough to tell you what that solution might be though.  lol\n\nI get what you’re saying about “gas stations” having things to do while your car charges.  but I do not think that this is A proper solution.  wherever you were going you want to get there right away.  you do not want to sit around at some truckstop waiting for your vehicle to charge.  The performance of the battery electric vehicles needs do you have the convenience level of fossil fuel cars.  refueling a car with gasoline is quick and can go for a long distance (300-400 miles).  refueling a diesel semi truck is quick and the truck can go for a very long distance well over 1000 miles.  A battery electric vehicle can do neither of these currently.   charging is slow, range is limited.\n\nI fully believe that we will solve these problems otherwise The results will be catastrophic for our planet and our lives in the long term.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Here you go.  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Hyliion/comments/jas0e0/i_drank_the_koolaid_then_i_went_to_a_cng_station/\n\nAfter looking at Hyliion's magical (aka bullshit) $1.00 gallon equivalent number they used in their calcs, I can see why the stock has shit itself.
