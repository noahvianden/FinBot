I came to make a comment about your post sounding like an AA speech, but you’ve already taken care of that.\n\nGood for you. Don’t discount buying options altogether just yet though imo. There’s a time and place for selling options and there’s a time and place for buying options. There’s no denying that significant returns can be achieved with long options.\n\nWhen I first started selling options, I also completely moved away from buying options, but slowly I made my way back to it. Now I do both. But I generally try to buy 6+ months expiration and preferably at or itm, and I have a plan to exit (generally playing ER run-ups and IV expansion and exiting a day or two before ER, and then at that point I may switch to selling some options on the ticker if I want more for an IV crush ;)). I also buy some careful LEAPS here and there.\n\nI found that learning the ins and outs of selling options made me a smarter buyer of options as well. Because now that I understand what I’m looking for as a seller, I know to avoid exactly those things as a buyer. For example, since option sellers are often looking for theta decay and inflated IV as major components in their favor, I know that is exactly what I need to avoid when buying options, so hence I buy with plenty of DTE and attempt to buy when IV is relatively lower and expected to run up (such as before an ER as I mentioned). And since as an option seller I’m looking at that juicy theta decay once an option hits around 45 DTE, as a long option holder I know that is the latest I can hold a long option and I need to exit before 45 DTE in most cases, preferably 60 DTE.\n\nThe whole stereotype of the ‘wsb options buyer’ is people buying very otm weekly options, or buying options a day before ER at the peak of IV, and expecting to hit home runs. And certainly this type of situations are generally in the favor of the option seller and not the buyer, and that’s why we’re here ;).\n\nAs with any other style of trading, it is possible to make money with just about any sort of strategy as long as one has adequate risk management in place. Traders who lose their hat and jump from strategy to strategy generally don’t find themselves in trouble time and time again because they were using the wrong strategy, they find themselves in trouble because they had poor risk management.

That's a ratio spread. When it gets assigned the spreads value will be the distance between strikes, so getting assigned at $10 for example, with a $2 wide spread. That is selling a second $10 put and buying a $12 put means you get the premium plus the $2. This means your cost on buying is actually $8 minus premium rather than just the $12 minus $12 puts premium. You end up with a lower cost to own when you get assigned but sacrifice put premium to get it. One thing to note, in order not to pay a debit which I don't recommend, the short strike's premium has to be at least half the ATM. So the $10 premium would have to be at least half the $12 premium. I like to shoot for the short strikes premium doubled to be 125% of the long option, just a bit more, so there's some credit to take home if there's no assignment.

For the physical media competition they have the likes of Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Target (yikes).  Obviously these companies have a lot more going for them though so not really a fair comparison.\n\nFor digital media they have the publishers themselves.  For consoles you have Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.  For PC you have publishers like Valve, Activision/Blizzard, EA, Ubisoft, Take-Two, Rockstar, etc.  All of these companies have direct lines to their customers and sell the same product (more conveniently) at the same price.  They also have WAY better margins on said products.\n\nMaybe we could compare them to other brick and mortar niche stores like Michaels.  They have a similar valuation, but they have a product that can’t be sold digitally and benefits from holding it before buying.  Also, they are actually profitable.\n\nI can think of a few smaller physical media stores in my area like Newbury Comics and FYE but these are smaller companies with less overhead.  Haven’t looked into them much but I can’t imagine they are doing to well right now either.\n\nSo what is GameStop’s value at all?  As a life long gamer I can honestly say I have spent maybe a few hundred bucks at GameStop in the 20 years they have been around, and I do prefer having the physical media.  You could try to tell me they have a loyal customer base who will tell their friends to shop there, but I don’t think I have ever seen a positive thing said about GameStop.  I have seen plenty of negative.  \n\nThe fact that they have no close comparison I’m sure contributes to their volatility and is why they are hard to price especially right now.  They could turn it around with their name recognition and some new revenue streams but I don’t see any reason for them to grow from where they are.  Video games are booming and GameStop will for sure get some of that pie in the short term but they will soon be extinct if they don’t adapt.
