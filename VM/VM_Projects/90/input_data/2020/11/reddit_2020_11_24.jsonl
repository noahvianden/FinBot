{"title": "Balls Deep in $MGNI", "selftext": "Alright tardos come listen as I tell you how you too can make money.\n\n$MGNI\n\nEarnings Call:\n\nTake a look at the recent earnings revenue year over year is up 62.01% beating by 7.4 million. EPS is up 2.5 times the estimate being expectations by 0.10 per share. Imagine how good you would feel if you ever hit 62.01% gain in your portfolio let alone in a year.\n\nWhat do they do?\n\nThey sell ads. Specifically to streaming companies like Hulu, so while you're sitting there watching Rick and Morty wondering why you can't afford ad free Hulu $MGNI are the ones to thank for the ads you're watching.\n\nFundamentals:\n\nStreaming platforms and access is expanding at a very fast rate. More houses are buying more streaming devices (phones, tablets, smart TVs). Their viewership grew 50% last quarter. Ad space is in high demand right now with the holidays as well as political ads that have and will run. Since Joe Biden won and coronavirus is over ad space is back in high demand with companies fiending for a spot on hulu and peacock. There's also like 15 different apes (money managers) \"raising price targets\" whatever that means. \n\nStock is up 80% over the month and 54% over the week. The stock will hit $30 before. Options are cheap and going to rise. \n\nEdit:\nu/mcf19 added how they're eliminating third party cookies, DIS and how their balance sheet is elite. Good info I wanted to add.\n\"I went in two weeks ago on MGNI 15c 12/18 ($0.10 then, now $2.50 plus). Their costs almost entirely fixed at this point and they have virtually no debt. 84% of their debt is \"A/P - seller\" which is money captured in transit between advertisers and the platforms they service. The other 10% of their debt is lease obligations and they have two small offices (gives a picture of how little debt they have). Super healthy company. With cookies going away on browsers and the new unified ID 2.0 initiative being implemented, this could blow up. Disney year end call on 12/10 will be huge for this, should give better (positive) details about the relationship between MGNI/DIS with the streaming platforms.\n\nhttps://www.thetradedesk.com/news/magnite-and-index-exchange-join-the-unified-id-2-0-initiative \" \n\nPosition:\n\n$20 C 12/18/20\n\n$20 C 1/15/21\n\n$25 C 6/18/21", "id": "k05zkd", "created_utc": 1606228192.0, "score": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks retard", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "anytime", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just bought in, this is a no brainer.
