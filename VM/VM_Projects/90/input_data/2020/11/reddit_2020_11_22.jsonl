{"title": "Better ways to buy hot stocks in an overvalued market?", "selftext": "I think most can agree that the best performing stocks YTD are also some of the most overvalued in history.  Given that the market has gone up in almost a straight line since 2009, and tech/cloud/EVs have gone up even faster since March, valuations on these industries are very stretched and the bears are starting to get louder and more insistent that a true 50%+ crash is coming.  \n\nI think we can also agree that, even if we are in a massive bubble, a bubble can grow beyond anyone's expectations, especially with zero rates.  So even if the bears are eventually right, trying to short stocks can ruin you before you're eventually proved right.\n\nSo what's an investor to do if you want to make money, if you recognize that high growth stocks are overvalued and value stocks are unlikely to provide much return?\n\nIMO, making predictions about the short term future of stocks is a fool's errand.  Instead of making predictions, it's better to be a bull with a plan so you don't react emotionally when things go south.  With that in mind, here are some strategies I've been thinking are appropriate for this type of market:\n\n1)  **Simply B&H** - if it's a quality stock with great management, and a long runway for growth - just B&H and ride out the volatility.  Works for longer time periods, but you really need a 10+ year time period.\n\n2)  **Buy with insurance** - buy the stock, but reserve 1-2% of capital for insurance, either in the form of buying puts, or selling calls or both.  Even if the puts create a 1-2% pa drag on your returns by expiring worthless most of the time, a high growth stock has the potential to return far more than that.  And if the market does crash, the options will pay off asymmetrically.  Alternatively, you could buy VIX ETPs which also have a decaying baseline.  \n\n3) **Buy with insurance and trend following overlay** - academic studies have shown that momentum exists in multiple asset classes using lookback periods of 3-12 months which means that the best (worst) performing stocks continue to outperform (underperform) for some time going forward, usually 1-6 months.  Applying 3, 6, and 12 month momentum can help to get you out of stocks and into safety (cash or bonds) when the trend is negative, and back in when the trend is positive.  Note that this method doesn't get you out exactly at the top and back in exactly at the bottom.  Trend following always has a lag and will not help you much in sharp drops and reversals like we had in Feb-Mar this year.  But it will greatly reduce the drawdown in a grinding crash/revaluation like what we experienced in 2000 and 2008.  Also, using shorter lookbacks can help you respond faster, but may also generate more trading costs and taxes.  12 month momentum or a 10 month/200 day moving average are generally considered the best balance, with lots of out of sample confirmation.        \n\nThere are also other hybrid options-based strategies I will write up in the future.

Obviously, this method works until it doesn't. :)\n\nI did this with the cloud stocks back in August/September. FSLY and NET had blown up, I sold CSPs at strikes I considered reasonable, 35 for NET and 80 for FSLY. I got assigned NET at $32 and FSLY expired worthless.\n\nNET has since doubled, and I am really happy to have bought NET at 32 instead of 42 where it was when I sold the CSP. FSLY was at 92 when I sold the CSP, and I'm really glad I didn't buy that stock as it would still be in the red then.\n\nI'm seriously considering this strategy for getting into the meme EV stocks (ie. SO-LO [*edit my original reply got banned for using this ticker...], FU-V, AY-RO) and even charging stocks (ie. BL-NK, SB-E) because their premium to cash ratios are bonkers right now. You can reap almost 12% premium on some of these CSPs while waiting for the market to consolidate. For example, AY-RO 7.5p had premiums at almost 20% ($1.5 per contract) on Wednesday of this week. Obviously the big risk here is you can end up a bagholder as these stocks crater and never recover. But if you're okay holding AY-RO for at least a year, its not a bad strategy to enter a position.\n\nThis method obviously has downside:\n\n1. You can't control if a stock blows up. Like TSLA for example. Selling CSP wouldn't have been as lucrative as putting the same cash straight into the stock. Your ROI may not be worth it for stocks that never come down.\n\n2. It works until it doesn't. You could end up getting assigned a lemon of a stock that never recovers. So I would never sell a CSP on a stock I didn't plan on holding for at least 1 year. These meme EV stocks could fall into this category. Are you willing to buy AY-RO (for example) and hold for a year? That company has 6 people, made $330k last quarter and lost $3M. And its valued at $200M right now...\n\n3. You have to sit on cash while you wait for the CSP to expire, which can require a lot of self control and patience as other stocks blow up around you. You can feel tempted by FOMO. It requires real self control imho.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan of this strategy to enter positions that you may have missed.
