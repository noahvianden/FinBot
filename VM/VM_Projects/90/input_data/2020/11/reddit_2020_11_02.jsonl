{"title": "The time for HYLN is now", "selftext": "I got into Hyliion back when it was trading under a SPAC in July, at around $24, then jumped out after it doubled. Now, it's being shorted to shit, but none of the goddamn fundamentals have changed, so I'm going all in once more.\n\nThe tl;dr reason I believe this will go up is because it already went up without any of your autist strength. The gay automods banned the SPAC ticker--I don't even know if I can say it here--which means this thing doubled on Robinhood, StockTwits, and WeBull 'tards alone.  \n\nOverview: Hyliion makes natural gas power trains whose performance is unmatched by any other product. [Here's Wegman's waxing poetic about 'em](https://www.wegmans.com/news-media/articles/partnership-with-hyliion-american-natural-gas/).\n\n[Here's Warren Buffet's bet earlier this year on natural gas](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/05/warren-buffetts-berkshire-buys-dominion-energy-natural-gas-assets-in-10-billion-deal.html). \n\n[Here's Warren Buffet's bet a few years ago on Flying J](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pilotflyingj-m-a-berkshirehathaway-idUSKCN1C81C0), the largest U.S. truck stop operator. \n\n[Here's Flying J's 5% stake in Hyliion](https://theheadlinereporter.com/flying-j-entity-discloses-5-4-stake-in-hyliion/). \n\nConclusion: Buffett owns Hyliion. \n\nHyliion's two main competitors? Nikola and Tesla. Nikola is a scam. Tesla all but admitted in their last Q3 call that the Semi tech isn't there yet:\n\n```\nGene Munster: Good evening. A question on Semi. If you could just walk us through \nthe development of Megachargers, platoon and maybe just how you think about \nautonomy for Tesla Semi? And what is -- how you envision it impacting the broader\n trucking industry beyond just EV?\n\nJerome Guillen: Yes. We continue the development of the Semi. And in particular, \nMegachargers, we realized that 350-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars\n is not going to be enough for Semi. So we're looking for something much more \npowerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging as fast the Semi as \nduring a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next \nbreak, yes. So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi. \nThat's the goal.\n\nWe're working with other parties to make sure that there is a standard \ninfrastructure that will be able to be deployed for all customers. Yes. Probably, \nall I can say at this point, yes. We're not working on...Just we're not working in \nisolation. Yes, we're trying to -- **we have to invent it because it doesn't \nexist.**\n```\n\nNow the finishing point: Hyliion is green, green means up.\n\nOk ok ok, here it is: [HYLN is being shorted to shit](https://i.imgur.com/Glb2s4T.png)\n\nNext earning report is November 12. \n\nPositions: buy shares, this might take a month or two due to election.
