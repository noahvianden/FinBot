And that was pack in 2017, when there were \"only\" 1.4B in circulation, at the absolute peak hype mania of cryptocurrency. Somewhere along the years 2018-2020, they again changed their statement, that it is not quite packed in USD, but in USD and other assets, by which they mean essentially bitcoin. \n\nSo that is how it works for them in Laymans terms: \n\nIn 2020 they have so far printed additional 14.5B, now around 18.5B in circulation. Tether treasury claims that they have packing in equivalent to usd, right, which essentially means, that they print 1B tether for example, without any fiat/gold etc packing, then transfer it into major exchanges, buy bitcoin (due to very thin order books, which is a proven fact) that will rise the bitcoin price far more than people realise. Then transfer those bitcoins into their fault <<< which represents their packing to a certain ratio, whatever that is. Then make another mouse click, print another 1B, rising bitcoin even further etc etc, rinse and repeat until ad nauseam if necessary.
