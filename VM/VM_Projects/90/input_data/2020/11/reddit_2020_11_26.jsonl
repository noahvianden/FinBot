{"title": "Questions about Tesla S&P 500 Discussion regarding index funds", "selftext": "Hey everyone, I just found out about how index funds have to buy tesla to balance their portfolios. It’s a little confusing so a few questions -\n\n- What is the time period investment firms have to buy Tesla shares? Is it 30 days before and after S&P inclusion date? Or is it a fixed time before/after the announcement date?\n\n- If the above question is correct, are there any estimates for how many for how many shares may be outstanding for funds to buy? I heard there’s about 120 million shares outstanding but not sure what percent of that may have been already been bought up \n\nThanks I’m advance for your help, I’m really trying to understand this!", "id": "k1ojmv", "created_utc": 1606428713.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "Rob Maurer at Tesla Daily has done great coverage of S&P inclusion in his videos that will answer your questions better than what you'll get here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TeslaDaily/search?query=S%26P\n\n\nShort answers though:\n\n- most index funds by within +/- a few days of the inclusion. Benchmarked funds obviously have considerably more latitude\n\n- 120 million shares is approx what needs to be bought by index funds. But keep in mind that is only a few day's volume. A bigger question is how many shares will be acquired by benchmarked funds, which is truly unknown. Potentially another 170m shares gives you a sense of magnitude.\n\n- in terms of how much has actually been bought already, we have had 7 trading days of volume being 10-30m shares over the \"normal\" level of the preceding few weeks (although that was comparatively low volume by tesla standards). Which means that potentially ~70-210 million shares have already been acquired either by funds or by speculators looking to sell to funds. Nobody can know for sure, and certainly other long-term investors may be just buying after inclusion announcement because S&P inclusion makes them feel \"safe\" (lol), but in the absence of any other real news in the last week it seems obvious to me that this price action and volume is driven mostly by S&P.", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "170m shares is like 20% of the float. Thats a lot. Nevermind the trading volume.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Ug at people who confuse trading float with trading volume.\n\nLet me explain this to a basic public what **some people** are asserting is that the $30 Mil 'volume' that was exchanged, was 100% BUY AND HOLD ORDERS - ALL OF THEM!\n\nThat's absolutely absurd to consider. If you have **ANY** experience in markets, like 90% of volume is 'fake volume' or rather buy and resell orders. Like buy at $550, sell at $551, buy at $449, sell $550... etc. Generally that's easily 90% of volume.\n\nThere is 'float' and active trading float, or you can think of this as market liquidity. 'Active Float' is what is relevant; if 50% of Tesla holders 'hodl' then the 20% purchase of total float is actually like 40% of actively traded shares (20 / 50 = 40%).\n\nActively traded shares is an unknowable number, but *on occasion* you can get an idea, through examination of prior action. In Bitcoin land, MicroStrat disclosed they bought $500 Mil coin, all within a few days. Price moved $500. That's generically how I think of actively traded shares - $X millions in = $X price difference.\n\nActively traded shares are **always** highest around target price. So like, Tesla moved from $400 to $570. That might be like 60% of the traded shares off the table.\n\n---\n\nI don't follow Tesla too closely, but you can expect exponential price movement with these >!mother fucking!< index funds.\n\nLike, you can expect a price of $800 or $1,000. It won't stay there, but these guys HAVE TO BUY at any price (for the most part). There money is NOT THEIR MONEY - they literally don't care what price they pay. That's how index funds work. They have a *technical right* not to buy, but they will.\n\nHeck - Tesla could go to $1,500. Seriously, it gets >!fucking!< wild. I've seen it.\n\nThese guys give no >!fucks!<, and their buddies make more money trading the options, while they spam the stock buy button on passive, pension fund money for people who have no election or voice to complain. It's sick! Never index!\n\nCan I guess the price of Tesla? >!Fucking no way!!< It's egregiously undervalued, but who the >!fuck!< knows!\n\nI might take out a short term option and sell it before expiration during a price spike. That could net you 300% profit. But most my plays involve claiming Tesla won't lose 30% in value 3 months from now. That's pays like 100% per year. That's fine.\n\nStock game is hard. NEVER 'hodl'. Sell if it gets absolutely all >!fuck!< whacky. $1,200 I say. Sell 25% to 50% of holdings. Rebuy at $600 to $700 or whatever, twice as much. Remember, these are >!fuckers!< pension funds! They give no >!fucks!< - only BUY BUY BUY!\n\nTesla is a great stock to hold. But expect WILD DAYS.\n\nDon't settle AT ALL for a measly 30%!!! Rookie numbers.\n\nShit could go 100 to 200% up. But it might not stay there. Take profit, I say. Rebuy more.\n\nAlways be thinking - HOW MUCH >!FUCKING!< TESLA CAN I BUY! You want it by the barrels full. It's a game, don't let >!dick less!< pension fund >!blowhards!< scare you, >!rape their corpses!!<\n\nIf it goes up $1,200, sell some, and double down on your rebuy. REALLY >!FUCK!< THEM HARD. That crushes 'actively traded float'.\n\nThis is what you want. This will force them to acquire even more as T sustains a market cap of $800 Bil or some such, if possible. But you got their shares - you took them!\n\nIf you *never* sell on absurd spike, shame. If you sell every time it moves 20%, good luck.\n\nGet all the Tesla you can, and teach papa Index a lesson.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "I'm so fucking amped!
