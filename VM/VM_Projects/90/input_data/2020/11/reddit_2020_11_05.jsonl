Over 10 years recovery should be expected, but opportunity cost might be high vs constant management of that 5k\n\n- 3D Printing (PRNT etf) - I have a lot of faith that 3d printing will become a huge part of modern assembly and production lines. \n\n- Qualcom (QCOM) or American Towers (AMT) for the emergence of 5G infrastructure \n\n- AMD, CPUs are a 2 game town and Intel is shitting the bed and decrepit. I think AMD has a lot of growth potential over 10 years. \n\n- Citibank (C), typically I wouldnt recommend a bank here but I think they are undervalued right now and likely to chug back up and have a good dividend on top\n\nIts tough with most techs I think being pretty inflated at just this moment.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I keep hearing about Corsair on Reddit, what’s the hype?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "They had monster earnings because of COVID everyone staying home buying gamer tech like mice and keyboards.
