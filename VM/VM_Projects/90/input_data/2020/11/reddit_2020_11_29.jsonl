Why is this? \n\nWell, after the financial crisis of 08-09, the government took control of a few companies including GM, Chrysler, AIG, Merrill, Countrywide and some others.\n\nEach of these were either sold off to more solvent company (Merrill, Countrywide, Cheysler) or eventually were resold to the public through a new IPO (GM).\n\nExcept Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).\n\nInstead of reselling them to the public, the government kept them captive and stole their lunch money for twelve years.\n\nHow much money?\n\n$380,000,000,000\n\nYes. Almost enough to buy TSLA outright.\n\nAs you might imagine, the owners of FNMA and FMCC were a bit pissed about being robbed by the government to that extent, so they sued.\n\nThese things take years to wind their way through the court system, but it just happens that this case hits December 9.\n\nWhile we can’t know the outcome of the case, there are things we do know.\n\n1. The listed defendant is Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. This means he can settle this out of court anyway he wants.\n2. With the new 6-3 conservative majority on the court, they may not be too sympathetic to an argument the government can steal $300 billion from you.\n3. FNMA has $60 billion in the bank now\n4. FNMA makes 10-15 billion in profits per year\n5. The entire market cap of FNMA is $3 billion \n\nFor those wondering, there are no options on FNMA, but at a share price of $2.65, a share of FNMA or FMCC IS AN OPTION.\n\nNote: if this doesn’t settle by the time Trump leaves office Biden will scuttle it if he can because democrats love that pot of free money.\n\nI’m in.", "id": "k31pjj", "created_utc": 1606618901.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "Otc shit, fuck that.\n\nAlso I think more than the lawsuit, the speculation is they may return it to private ownership on their way out of office.

The main question to ask yourself is when does the announcement of Pfds converting to common happen, and at what rate? I think it will happen with one of these two announcements, and the math will look like par value (25 or 50) divided by maybe a trailing 30 day price of FNMA OR IPO price. If i'm right that means I get to double dip into getting par value immediately and then getting the upside of commons. I could be wrong though.

I actually bought a bit of commons to get in on the lottery risk but my portfolio remains like 97% pfds... bought about .5% worth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith regards to your other reply on the tickers, there are fixed and variable rates. Right now the variable rates are the cheapest, but if your theory is right (which, it's 90% not right, I thought about your argument, and while i still don't think it will happen, the only way i see it happening is, Mnuchin and Calabria do not do anything, Biden does not do anything, and in the event SCOTUS gives us a favorable ruling, the NWS is reversed, and we take 4-5 years to build capital, but even then in a scenario like that I believe the GSE's would opt to do an IPO and not wait), and they don't redeem or convert the pfds, then you don't want those and you want the higher fixed rate ones. The general consensus is that ALL pfd shares will be converted at par value, but a small minority thinks the interest rate will have an effect. My biggest holdings are currently in FMCCP, FNMAK, FNMFN, FNMAL, and a couple of others. Basically, if you are to buy you can try to maximize your par value, which means find the lowest price (FYI, tehre are two classes of pfds, par value of 25 and 50, the 25 are more recent which is why they have more volume and are more expensive. I've opted to go primarily for the $50 ones though, so it is kind of personal decision as well. If you're maxmizing par value, then go for the cheapest $50 pfd, and if you are taking a more balance approach, do the same but exclude the variable rate pfds.\n\none thing to add: I bought about 5k of commons today because, I do think new money is goin to come in, and I think in the short term the commons could possibly outperform the pfds, but I park my money in PFDs since if they get converted at Par this wll be a 7 figure pay out for me, which i am happy with, and I don't need to risk the biscuit and be left with nothing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. If the PSPA amendment comes out, commons will rise more\n\n2.

(also they wont IPO at anything below $20, but in that case you would most likely see a reverse split) If they ipo at $3, commons make nothing on the announcement, while I take my share I purchased for $20, and convert it into 16 shares of FNMA.\n\nDo you see what i mean by the risk adjusted returns?\n\nThe smart money is in the Pfds, the gamblers are in the commons", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why do you suppose the pfds are falling in this environment?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1-2% is not really falling.

{"title": "Follow-up DD from an actual scientist about $NVAX: Less science more gains (+38.5k so far)", "selftext": "NVAX is up >30% since my first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). I'm assuming the trigger for the pop was [AZN's phase 3 trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/business/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca-oxford.html) setback, with the idea that some of AZN’s supply contracts might be up for grabs if they run into problems. Importantly, I don't think the pop was anything NVAX-specific (like a leak) because NVAX/MRNA/INO all were up in a very similar pattern/magnitude on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3rdfwei99261.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=c577e375a53352d5e16849c0b83d6bbc5b9f3f25\n\nThat’s good news if you still want to get in on this because it means the key upcoming catalysts are very much in play and there’s a still a lot of meat left on this bone. Enough that I added another $12k of Dec/Jan options on Friday (proof/gains update at the end). There might be a better entry point over the next few days and I tend to do a horrible job trying to time things so use your own judgement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to take another crack at this DD because my first post focused too much on the science at the expense of highlighting the key misconceptions about NVAX that make this a huge opportunity, even with the recent 30% run. For those who don't read version 1, I'm a research scientist with 5+ years working in vaccine R&D and am currently a biomedical PhD candidate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: I think NVAX will have a successful Phase 3 trial and will hit $200 ($12.7B market cap) sometime between January and March.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DISCUSSION\n\n**NVAX's $8B valuation has not priced-in a successful Phase 3 trial, which I think is close to a guarantee and will happen much sooner than people are expecting**\n\nFirst things first - everything in this post is irrelevant if NVAX's Phase 3 results are poor and do not support emergency use authorization and global licensure. However, I think *NVAX’s Phase 3 UK trial is as close to a slam dunk as possible*. Here's why I'm so confident (refer to first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k08ya1/dd_from_an_actual_scientist_nvax_might_not_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for more details on the science):\n\n* NVAX not only uses the same target antigen as PFE/MRNA/AZN, but it also has superior immunogenicity as evidenced by their Phase 1 data   \\[[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026920?query=featured_coronavirus), [2](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)\\]\n* NVAX has best in class antibody titer data and excellent T cell responses \\[[1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026920?query=featured_coronavirus), [2](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/RACAP_COVID-19_MAP%20Updates.pdf)\\]\n* Observed sterilizing immunity in non-human primates despite highest viral challenge dose \\[[3](https://www.novavax.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/NovavaxPresentationforACIP.pdf)\\]\n* Comments from NVAX head of R&D on 24Nov2020 about the release of Phase 3 UK interim data \"we have actually now adjusted our expectations around unblinding (the data) because we have made fairly conservative assumptions. But now it is clear we can expect much higher efficacy\"  [quote at 16:00](https://ir.novavax.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-virtual-healthcare-conference-fireside-session). ***This is huge revelation that I think has flown under the radar.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll explain more about my thinking about the timing of the interim update, but the short answer is that I think we'll get the first Phase 3 interim readout in mid-December and that the results will be at least as effective as PFE/MRNA, if not a bit better. It's worth mentioning that *at this point in the trial*, the hypothesized superior performance of NVAX will most likely not be apparent (even if it's actually superior) because the 95% mark set by MRNA doesn't leave a lot of room for improvement.\n\nI think one of the reasons that NVAX is viewed as an underdog relative to PFE/MRNA/AZN is due to a lack of awareness that data from the UK Phase 3 trial can be submitted for global licensure and [emergency use authorization](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-granted-fast-track-designation-us-fda). Instead, I think people assume NVAX is much further behind based on the fact that their US Phase 3 trial will start next week. Hopefully I'm right about that misunderstanding because if so, this should rocket once the interim update is made and the market starts putting the pieces together.\n\nBefore going any further talking about valuations, let me just say that yes, I’m aware that NVAX has run up 3000% YTD. However, that represents an increase in market cap of only $7.75B (note that they’ve received $2B in funding). Consider that MRNA – who has never had a vaccine even enter a [phase 3 trial](https://investors.modernatx.com/static-files/dc121fec-63eb-4794-a2fd-e0d3eadbaa6f)  – has had a $42B market cap increase in the same period of time with $23B of that increase coming since November 2nd (note that NVAX has increased by $3.65B since November 2nd). Pretty interesting for NVAX if you ask me and supports my hypothesis that NVAX will rocket once data is released and they're viewed as being legitimate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NVAX has supply contracts in place for at least 1.5B doses and the manufacturing capacity to deliver up to 2B doses in 2021 and will generate BILLIONS of dollars of revenue pending successful trial results**\n\nThese are the most up to date numbers that I could find but I would expect additional purchase agreements upon release of phase 3 efficacy data and/or any problems with PFE/MRNA/AZN vaccines:\n\n* UK [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase) to purchase at least 60M doses with [analyst estimates](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/29/why-novavax-shares-vaulted-higher-today/) that it will bring in up to $1B in revenue\n* OWS [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-16-billion-funding-operation-warp-speed) for the US to provide 100M doses as part of the $1.6B in funding\n* Japan [agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-takeda-announce-collaboration-novavax-covid-19) to manufacture and provide 250M doses\n* [Agreement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-canada-reach-agreement-principle-acquire-novavax) with Canada to provide up to 76M doses\n* [Agreement](https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/new-collaboration-makes-further-100-million-doses-covid-19-vaccine-available-low) to provide up to 1B doses to the COVAX buying program\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the talk about who gets to market first ignores the fact that the world will need billions of doses which can't be individually supplied by any one company and NVAX already has substantial supply agreements in place. Importantly, most of the agreements are contingent on clearing phase 3 trials which once again further increases the importance of the Phase 3 interim results. Also, the idea that there will be no profits in COVID vaccines is simply untrue (see MRNA’s market cap). It’s challenging to try to project revenue due to the high probability that there are new supply agreements upon release of phase 3 interim data, but even if you stick with the current slate of agreements it’s a huge number relative to an $8B market cap.\n\nThe other key assumption for NVAX to ever be able to reach the $200+ range is that their global network of manufacturing sites will actually be able to deliver on these agreements. To that end, NVAX has [agreements](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum) with seven different contract manufacturers around the world, including an agreement with the Serum Institute of India who makes more vaccine doses annually than anyone in the world resulting in an annual production capacity of 2B doses/year, significantly more than MRNA or PFE. In addition, NVAX has a much cheaper/faster product to manufacture at scale than either of the mRNA vaccines. It goes without saying, but there's significantly less value in being first to market if you have supply constraints.\n\nNow, you might say even if that’s all going to come to fruition in 2021, this is a one-time event and once everyone is vaccinated that revenue stream is gone. I don’t think that will be the case because COVID is going to become endemic which will probably require that we give boosters to high risk groups, globally. Which brings me to my next point for why I think a $200 price target is well within reason:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In the likely event that annual boosters are needed for a subset of the population, NVAX is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this recurring revenue stream**\n\nOnce the pandemic is over, the difficulty and cost of conducting clinical trials is going to be significantly higher. As a result, the companies that make it through Phase 3 trials this winter will probably end up being the bulk of what’s on the menu for booster shots in the future.\n\nI think NVAX will be in a great position to be the vaccine of choice for boosting not only because I think it will have clear superior efficacy and favorable distribution/cost, but also because all of the competitors have important limitations in this context:\n\n* AZN/JNJ’s vaccines both induce an immune response against the viral vector itself, almost certainly preventing them from being able to be used for boosting.\n* PFE/MRNA are expensive and more [painful](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/covid-vaccine-cdc-should-warn-people-the-side-effects-from-shots-wont-be-walk-in-the-park-.html) than typical vaccines and my sense is that people aren't going to choose to them if there are alternatives available.\n\nAnother key point in favor of NVAX is that their trials have put more emphasis on enrollment of elderly and of patients with [comorbidities](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-initiates-efficacy-trial-covid-19-vaccine-south-africa), both of whom will likely be recommended to get booster shots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NVAX successfully completed a Phase 3 trial for their influenza vaccine (NanoFlu) just before the pandemic started and may end up as the only company with a combination COVID-Flu shot for the foreseeable future**\n\nAlthough everyone rightly points out that NVAX never brought a vaccine to market, they did however successfully complete a Phase 3 trial for their NanoFlu vaccine just before the pandemic started. They shifted focus to COVID but will be submitting a BLA for [NanoFlu](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-appoints-leadership-team-advance-nanoflu-through), which if approved, will compete in the multi-billion dollar global flu vaccine market with significant revenue potential.\n\nThe important point to understand is that NanoFlu uses the same platform, formulation, and adjuvant as their COVID vaccine making a combination vaccine very feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint. This could be a huge money maker and they’ll now have the revenue/cash from other activities to be able to fund the development of such a vaccine. A combination COVID/Flu vaccine for the mRNA/vector platforms will be almost impossible for several reasons that will take way too long to explain, but it’s not on the radar for them. Sanofi could create a combination flu shot with their COVID vaccine but their COVID vaccine candidate uses a different adjuvant than their marketed Flu shot.\n\nIt's worth addressing the fact that prior to COVID, Novavax didn't have the greatest reputation. Although this was deserved in many ways, some of the criticism ignores the staggering costs and complexities of vaccine development. There's a reason that only a handful of companies make vaccines and they're all very well funded. In my opinion, Novavax's setbacks were not a reflection on the quality of their technology and I think they were actually turning the corner prior to COVID. Either way, whatever you think about their past, Novavax is now in an unbelievably fortunate situation flush with cash and in possession of an extremely valuable vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Catalyst timing**\n\nNVAX’s original clinical trial protocol stated that their first interim update would be triggered once 66 events are recorded at which point the data is un-blinded and the first efficacy assessment is made. But given this new caveat from Dr. Glenn about having a peak at efficacy data sooner, my guess is that we'll get the first look at efficacy data in mid-December ([quote at 16:00](https://ir.novavax.com/events/event-details/piper-sandler-virtual-healthcare-conference-fireside-session)).\n\nThe challenge in trying to trade this interim announcement is that there will almost definitely be a couple of negative [catalysts](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/28/america-will-be-the-first-country-to-roll-out-a-covid-19-vaccine) for NVAX in December, as the FDA will meet to decide about emergency use authorization for Pfizer on December 10th and for Moderna on December 17th. For all the reasons I outlined, I think these are both immaterial to NVAX’s outlook, but the announcements could trigger an overreaction and some selling. On one hand this could create a nice buying opportunity, but that might hurt if you're holding 1DTE options. I don’t know what the right answer is here, but my thought is that the interim update will greatly outweigh any negative effects of the EUA meetings and that's how I plan to play it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Positions**\n\nCurrent holdings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3nkrubm99261.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6882cf8a3efcadf037074311875a7783c07abab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/taydaarn99261.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecc990c6e163750fdad2b9c6cce9cf35d07f83f2\n\nRealized gains\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6euqsxo99261.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=25fb7bc3fa7e53b9a17516ab34387c8cf04b4037\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time.

Most traditional vaccines are hands down terrible at generating IgG since the route of antigen exposure is highly unnatural. Nowhere in nature is a single peptide floating around with a bunch of plant carbohydrates going straight into the lymph node. In most cases, your body will develop a response primarily against the adjuvant (because that is what elicited the activation in the first place). There is no scenario where a traditional vaccine will reach the IgG generation capability of an mRNA vaccine\n\n2- While distribution and storage might be more feasible, the moment the coronavirus mutates, Novavax will be well behind its peers. A single nucleotide mutation in the sequence would yield basically an identical drug product and formulation from Pfizer and Moderna (and Moderna is in talks with the FDA regarding this issue). In the case of Novavax, however, a single nucleotide mutation would force them to have to re-optimize their production system and it could potentially impact the formulation and drug product stability - testing of all of these items would cost a lot of money. \n\nI think it boils down to this: would you rather have a few slightly painful injections but know with 95% certainty that you are immune to the coronavirus, or would you have a normal vaccination but just not be sure whether it worked for you or not? My bet is that most people would choose the more effective option.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t want to insult you but almost everything you wrote is inaccurate.\n\nThe downside with traditional platforms compared with RNA/vector-based platforms is that it takes longer to identify and develop the initial vaccine candidate. But once you’ve identified a candidate the RNA/vector platforms have no advantage, and actually have some significant disadvantages related to (generally) reduced efficacy and a lack of a proven safety profile. To be clear, these non-traditional platforms are valuable, particularly in a pandemic, but the value is in speed. In our current situation the advantage in speed is very minimal, especially when you consider the supply constraints. \n\nSecond, you have it completely backwards about IgG production - both in principle and with respect to these specific vaccines. NVAX has demonstrated by the highest NAb titers of the Phase 3 candidates by far. And it’s simply not true that mRNA vaccines have superior NAb generating properties.\n\nAgain, I don’t want to insult you, but I’m guessing you spend a lot of time on MRNA/PFE message boards bc your interpretation of how vaccines work and what’s “natural” is very flawed. For one, you don’t develop an immune response against the adjuvant - adjuvants are non-specific amplifiers of the immune response to the antigen. NVAX’s vaccine is a nanoparticle close to the same size as the actual virus, with spike protein presented on the surface of the particle very similar to the way the virus presets them. That’s FAR closer to the way things happen “in nature” than a god damn mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticle that enters a host cell to and is translated into a spike protein that becomes the eventual antigen. \n\nRegarding mutations you’re almost entirely wrong again. Single nucleotide mutations in the virus only matter for vaccine efficacy IF it leads to a missense mutation for an amino acid on the spike protein that’s critical for antigen-antibody interactions. To render our current crop of vaccines ineffective, we’d probably need multiple single nucleotide missense mutations on the spike protein. This is unlikely but not impossible (recent human-mink-human transmission and generation of “cluster 5” mutant strain actually might have led to something like this but it’s too soon to tell). However, in the event that this happens, all of the vaccines would be potentially affected bc they all use the spike protein. If the mutation were significant enough, all companies would have to start over. In this scenario, mRNA platforms would again have a small lead in generating a new vaccine candidate but I think this lead would actually be smaller if we have a second round and wouldn’t be material either way.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Eh, like I said I have not read into detail on Novavax's offering in particular and I am not an immunologist by training, but I am a PhD with focus in nanoparticle systems, immunotherapy, and rna delivery and I work in the pharmaceutical area in formulation development. I don't read any message boards, I'm just going off my textbooks and the recent literature and my own research expertise.\n\nSee the keyword here is \"adjuvant\". You need an adjuvant (KLH, alumina, whatever) to get a traditional vaccine to work because you will not appropriately activate the APCs by just going in with the target antigen. The adjuvant stimulates the appropriate PRR and this will help load (an) antigen onto the MHC. Because the adjuvant is doing the stimulating, most of the presented antigens actually come from the adjuvant itself. So yes, you of course develop an immune response against the adjuvant that's literally its job. (Please see this reference: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02874/full which actually talks about the Saponin-based adjuvant system that Novavax uses and how it activates a certain pathway). This is the issue, because your B cells are going to generate type specific antibodies against what is loaded, in concert with other environmental cues. Most vaccines result in a significant IgM and IgE ... which is fine for complement, but not the best for pathogen response (I believe those would be considered \"neutralizing antibodies\" also). Specifically, IgG antibodies are superior for the maturation of CD8+ T-Cells as a pathogen appears, and recruitment of other professional pathogen response cells. So not all \"NAb\" (stupid term, but ok) are created equal. Anecdote, but from the few vaccine conferences I have attended, just getting your body to recognize the correct epitope with a traditional vaccine is still a huge challenge.\n\nWhile you are correct that the NVAX might be morphologically similar, the mode of infection is not. SARS-CoV-2 is a ssRNA virus. It is literally mRNA. The process by which the infection progresses is by translation of the mRNA. The Moderna and Pfizer candidates, by proceeding through this pathway, therefore more accurately simulate the act of viral infection. And actually, I would hypothesize that this \"RNA infection\" is presumably activating the same immune pathways (innate anti-viral response from professional APCs like the well known dsDNA / dsRNA / TLR3 responses) as a real coronavirus infection, which would generate the right cocktail of signals for the development of a robust innate anti-viral response.\n\nLastly, I don't know the sequence of the spike protein, but let's say there's a glycine in the center and through a single nucleotide mutation, this glycine gets converted to a cysteine. At this point, NVAX needs to go back and assess the redox state of the peptide, then change their expression system, re-scale up their expression process, re-formulate their peptide, and then distribute. Now what if an Ile turns into an Arg? That's going to change the pI, the logP, the conjugation chemistry is going to be all messed up - again requiring a complete redesign from step 1. All Moderna has to do, in either case, is synthesize a new template to account for the 1 base change (roughly 2-3 days work), and then re-do their IVT using the exact same conditions - no change to formulation or to their manufacturing process. So NVAX spends $1B and 6 months adapting, and Moderna spent maybe 2 days and ~$0. The only sticking point is whether the FDA would consider a sequence change as a new \"drug product\" requiring a new review process. In the case of NVAX it is definitely a new drug product since the formulation and stability have definitely changed. In the case of Moderna, I think they have a good argument that it is not a different drug product.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "  \n\nOk, first off apologies. After reading your opening line that you definitely wouldn't recommend NVAX but haven't looked into them I assumed you were an idiot and didn't read your post as closely as I should have. You've made some valid points in your follow-up that I'll respond to:\n\n1. I was making a general point about the distinction between the adjuvant and the antigen and trying to point out that the eventual immune response that will lead to the immunity that we care about is directed against the antigen, not the adjuvant.\n\n2. I now see the point you were making about the mRNA vaccine being more natural and although that's a fair point, I ultimately don't think it's all that important if we reach an endpoint of functional immunity with a protein subunit vaccine. What I think is more important is the actual immunogenicity data that we have from Phase 1 trials for MRNA and NVAX, as well as the NHP viral challenge data which favor NVAX significantly. The mechanistic advantage that you're saying mRNA vaccines have might be true in principle, but it hasn't translated to superior in vivo data. Maybe that's due to mRNA dosing limitations and in the future that will be solved, but based on the existing data for the two subject vaccines, I think NVAX is be better. Now we have to see whether NVAX will match the 95% efficacy number.\n\n3. You're right in bringing up the distinction between different antibody responses, but again I think the functional data are what matter most and the data suggest that NVAX leads to significantly higher levels of NAbs than either mRNA vaccine (not sure why you think this is a stupid term since whether or not an antibody is actually neutralizating is a critical distinction).\n\n4. I'm well aware of the implications of individual AA residue changes on protein production, stability. But you're jumping ahead. We already know there are several spike protein mutations and we have every reason to believe that most of them will have no impact on the current Phase 3 vaccine candidates. So your original claim implying that coronavirus mutations will necessitate new vaccine candidates is wrong. In the event that we actually need new vaccines due to mutation, I strongly disagree that MRNA would be able to make the argument that they don't have a different drug product bc that new mRNA will be generating a new antigen. The only advantage they'll have is in getting the initial candidate out faster. But NVAX is actually much faster at candidate generation then people seem to realize hence the reason that they're only 1-2 of months behind despite being a much smaller company.
