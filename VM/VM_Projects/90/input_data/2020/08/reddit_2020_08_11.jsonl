I only have so much cash to go around, so I try to stay away from poor management. I'm an engineer by day and I understand how management can ruin a technical company. I don't care how competent you are as an engineer; you can't do your job properly if your bosses won't allow it. Beyond that you have years of what, I would consider, ill advised buybacks meant only to prop up their stock price in the short term. \n\nI know there's a lot more detail to get into, and I could get into some of it if you like (I'd be interested in your take), but when I look at BA I see a lot of problems. I don't know that those problems are going to be addressed appropriately anytime soon and I have to consider opportunity cost. With that many unknowns I am more confident placing my money elsewhere.\n\nThat doesn't mean they won't double in two years, it just means the company doesn't hit my criteria for investing and I feel better about other choices I am more confident in bringing a great return. I'm fine with someone asking \"have you considered X, Y, and Z?\" and having a discussion, but I _rarely_ see an argument for BA that goes beyond \"the fed will never allow them to go under.\" That's not an evaluation I can get behind.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for sharing.  That all makes sense. I also don't invest in companies I can't wrap my head around (so I avoid most tech and pharma) but I feel like I understand BA, particularly their DOD contracts and that's why I buy shares whenever they dip below 130. I agree with you that too big to fail isn't a reason to invest and thats an issue on all these subs.   If BA hits 200 again before November ill sell and buy more when it returns to 120 or 130.
