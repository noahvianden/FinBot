{"title": "Intel CEO bought $400k of Intel stock & upcoming Tiger Lake", "selftext": "Apparently he bought the dip with an average price of $50/share, which makes today price look like a good deal. This makes me wonder if he believes that Intel will recover from its infamous 7nm delay announcement.

There will be a presentation in Aug 13 by Intel chief architect about its new Tiger Lake, which is said to be launch in Sep 2.

Even though Intel CPU only has 4 cores (vs 8 cores in AMD CPU), it is only 6-17% slower than AMD CPU.\nSo performance-wise, Intel 10nm CPU still looks pretty competitive against AMD 7nm.
