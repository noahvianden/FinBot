{"title": "Silver Gang Cheat Sheet: Past Bull Trends and Present Day Picture", "selftext": "What's going on WSB! Hope we all had a productive weekend. I for one finally learned how to tie my shoes! No more velcro straps for me! Mommy is so proud. I also took some time to do a write-up on silver. Full disclosure of bias: I am borderline sexually attracted to silver. I've been long since April. I've incessantly posted in the daily threads about it. I have personified the shiny metal as a naughty little girl. I literally talk dirty to the charts sometimes. One time I got really high and... yeah, we'll stop there. Either way, I'm obsessed. I think you'll see why. Although we are certainly at the very beginning of a long-term bull market, ***caution should be exercised; we're likely getting a sharp move down in the coming weeks.***\n\nI know you all hate literacy and charts, but give it a chance. Learning slaps. Lets start with 2003, the beginning of the last real deal silver bull market. As we all know, the Dot Com Bubble had just popped a few years prior. A bubble pop makes people want tangible shit. TSLA 2000 ring a bell? QE then lit that dirty bitch silver on fire, running for 500% in just a few years from the bottom of the GFC as she tried to keep up with big brother. Sidebar: fuck gold. Silver is the superior shiny slut. Either way, economic instability led to precious metals beating the absolute shit out of SPY for the next decade. We all know this. Silver has a ton of catch-up to do to begin with; silver/gold ratio is important. Metals will 1000% outperform equities in the coming years.\n\n[Ain't she pretty? Orange is gold, blue is silver](https://preview.redd.it/6rlix080zti51.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=0261abe9333ec28a8577d20500dd2c516be550a1)\n\nThis is where it gets fun. Silver followed a very simple pattern the entire time. To a T. Who taught her that? Yeezy? I don't know. Regardless, my graphic does it all justice. This is the main takeaway, and how I expect the current bull market to play out. A very good road map to have.\n\n[We are at \\\\\"3.\\\\\" right now. Bull market lasted roughly 7.5 years, ran for a total of  nearly 950&#37;. from \\\\\"2.\\\\\" Don't worry you impatient fucks, this move is going to be much faster\\/higher. Infinite QE isn't going anywhere. Blowoff top happened when price broke from this channel. Silver is a seasoned slut now.](https://preview.redd.it/m26psk2zfti51.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=5640b47316396b3d94eb145e41d283285bfe1a43)\n\nFast forward to present day. We have the same exact setup. Truly can't believe my eyes that she's blessing us like this. She can be a good girl too.\n\n[Like looking up a virgin's skirt... except she's been around once or twice.](https://preview.redd.it/5q1fkax7hti51.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d060c38d81e952ab3b8766232e4f0a024bd4119)\n\n[A closer look](https://preview.redd.it/2zdootyfxti51.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=410e0e03610596b895a63d19b0499d4c0469b42a)\n\nIn summary: I expect these trendlines to have a significant influence on price action going forward. I expect a pullback. I expect a dream entry to add to positions. And I expect shit to get crazy after that. QE may run this thing into the fuckin moon, and I wouldn't be surprised if we hit 35 spot before the end of September. At the end of the day though, I personally don't think this time will be any different. History rhymes. I'm not necessarily suggesting you go short, as that's retarded even for us; I'm just waving the warning flag for those of you leveraged to the tits on weekly 30cs. A straddle or strangle is ideal. If you're lucky and somewhat paid attention, you already have leaps or profitable calls; puts are the way to go.\n\nHonorable mention: Good Ole DXY. I believe we're due for a DXY bounce, and that shriveled little DXY is showing early signs of well-deserved (tiny) bounce. This was discussed in the daily thread at length on Friday. I'm not calling for ATH's here. The dollar is fucked. But we have the largest net-short position on the USD in like, I don't know, ever, (citation needed: I'm forgetting how long, but over a decade for sure) and a squeeze seems likely. Equities would react as well. Watch DXY closely this week. It fucked up metals and equities on Thursday/Friday.\n\n[DXY bounce, anyone? No homo of course](https://preview.redd.it/6vbvmkcb4ui51.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=25159c8d695ca6fbdfa098053b71ea330dffba89)\n\nI hate posting positions, as I believe that's up to the individual. Personally, I'm long with leaps and have some short-term puts as a hedge. Intend on buying the FUCK out of the dip if it happens. If not? I'll continue to personify and objectify a shiny rock.  \n\n\nEdit on 1/30/21 as this will likely get more visibility: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

I think Platinum has the most upside potential from here, but there will be a run on all the metals related to the Tech race(to become self-sufficient in the semi-market).\n\nI also make cast jewelry as a hobby, so I had an idea to pour lots of 1-gram silver bars because they're hard to find and expensive. The best and cheapest grain silver I've found comes from Ross Metals in NYC. Right now you can get .999 grain for about $1.15 a gram. Then sell 1g bars for $2.50-3.00/per on ebay.

This DD actually led to some very profitable shorts for me; thanks charts and DXY!\n\nPersonally? I think we’re watching silver correct in time more than price right now. I’m still looking for downside first, but not nearly as much as I was during this post. The dollar should continue to rip, but I’ll don’t see more than a 10% drop max on silver here unless things get out of hand. Of course, a close eye must be kept on things as we’re in a very fuckin dynamic market right now. Not a cop out, I swear, just that my take could literally change tomorrow with how volatile things are currently. \n\nHave closed most of my shorts, am fully positioned in miners, and waiting for some more downside before I finalize my silver leaps. Miners should go first. I think you should be fine with those expiries. I’ll be targeting March myself, but just so I don’t have to lose too much theta. Wave 5 by the end of the month IMO. Keep in mind stimulus news would be a great catalyst. Gold looking very bullish to me. \n\nTLDR: a bit more downside, but not a favorable enough risk/reward for me to be shorting presently.
