It's deforestation, mining, hundreds of machines burning A LOT of CO2 to mine out these batteries, then they materials are shipped someone to make them, then shipped someone else to finish the product, then to Tesla.\n\nMining rare materials is an extremely impactful process to the environment and the world.  It's definitely more impactful than the process of drilling and refining oil. Not to mention as the car ages it needs batteries replaced, and they're extremely toxic to the ecosystem and expensive to dispose of properly. \n\nIn the end it's probably the exact same, it's just they each are more impactful at different times of their life", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/2019-tesla-impact-report.pdf\n\nIf you go to page 8 of this report, the fourth bar graph from the left is the carbon footprint of a Tesla currently.

It has those monster dump trucks that you can drive a truck under, those massive machines that grind rocks, the shakers that sift minerals from rock, all the front end loaders, semis driving back and forth to the mines, generators to light up the mines, and much, much more. \n\nThose big dumps and front end loaders use gas in incomparable amounts compared to a road vehicle. When I operated one it was about 15-30 litres of gas per hour depending on the size and what you're doing, and that was a rather small front end loader compared to what's used in a mine", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm assuming that ICE vehicles also significant amount of raw materials. Is there a notable difference in the C02 intensity of these raw materials compared to those in EVs. If so can you send me an article/report proving so.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "no judgement here by the way it's been a long time since I've done research on it but I will try to find it for you later. Because oil drilling will still continue whether they need it for cars or not. So it's kind of like a piggyback effect if you would. Yet if they started making all cars they would have to open many more minds to harvest lithium from the Earth.\n\nAs I had said though, it is very destructive to the environment around it as well unlike oil. Oil can be harvested taking very little space and is only impactful on a large-scale when an accident happens. whereas with mining it has to take a wide area because the deeper you dig The wider the pit has to be to get to the mine and they will level Forest to makes spots for camps for the minors. There are actually companies butts sole purpose is to deal with recovering the land after mining yes.\n\nYou also have to keep in mind the places where some minds are created to have very little concern for the environment because they just care about the country becoming rich so they will have poor practices that don't factor impact to the surrounding area. A lot of places will be careful with oil because when an accident happens that's lost money and it can cause massive damage to not only the environment but the workspace. So there is more invested to keeping it a cleaner operation than mining. \n\nEdit: one thing I forgot to add. Places where a lot of mining is is done without the environment in mind also have no emissions regulations. There are some countries that force mines to sign contracts about how much emissions they will make, but many of the countries that have heavy mining are developing countries so they just want the money coming in so they won't make us heavy of regulations in fear of losing the business. I would also have to check on China's regulations because they do tons of mining and in the past they did not carry in the slightest about how much emissions they made they solely cared about getting as much mineral out of each mine as possible as fast as possible.\n\nEdit 2: lol I keep thinking of more against mines. Mine's require massive amounts of water, and again, depending on countries, it can completely destroy fresh water sources as a result. You can also look up tailings, and just general water pollution from it because they use it to help soft for materials which will add a ton of shit into water sources that shouldn't be there. \n\nIt sounds dumb, but if you're a gamer at all look up \"eco survival game\" and give it a try. It's amazingly accurate on industrial impacts on the environment, and crazy fun for a crafting game. The biggest impact on the environment in it is mining, and coal burning. Especially when you need to start dealing with the left behinds of processing the raw minerals into material. That's a whole other issue as the shit left behind from processing metal literally poisons the ground requiring it to be buried very, VERY deep in the ground, or forever maintained and kept isolated from the rest of the environment. They will make damns to keep the rest of the enviroment from coming in contact with it", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is all very interesting. I guess I hadn't thought much about the impact of mining. If you had to guess, would you say that these impacts offset all of the C02 savings associated with driving an electric vehicle? Obviously you don't have an exact number but just a rough estimate would be helpful.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Its super tough to calculate as you said due to the fact that lithium is used in so many things beyond car batteries of electric cars, and gasoline is used in more than just light vehicles. But I'd say it's pretty close to be honest. But when you factor in all the other factors I would personally say mining is worse than drilling/fracking. \n\nwhen you factor the forever dealings with tailings made from decades ago, the destruction of land, monitoring of how to fill in an abandoned mine, and so much more it's hard to see how it's less impactful than oil.  It's kind of a \"I'll destroy your home so my home stays clean and pretty\" kind of thing. \n\nIf you monitor emissions with regulations and such globally, mining MAY be better in emissions, but I still am uncertain due to how it destroys the surface of the planet. Battery vs gas is kind of like arguing about if you want to ruin your legs or your arms. Either way something needs to be destroyed. It's just a matter of figuring out which one survives longer while ruining it. If that makes sense. Like... If you do a job that wrecks your arms but takes 30 years vs doing a job that ruins your legs but takes 20 years. You're likely to pick the job that takes 30 years due to time, but some people will think their arms are more important and pick to ruin their legs regardless.  So some people will take the more damage to someone else's countryside in order to clean their countries air while others will think it's more important to keep the landscape of someone's country clean and healthy making them choose to ruin their countries air quality", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Check out this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zCrMUKvl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4zCrMUKvl4)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "TGAN they make the best Gallium Nitride (GaN) chips.
