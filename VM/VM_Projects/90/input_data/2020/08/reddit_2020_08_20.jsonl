Just curious on your opinion regarding RKT. I know it's miming around here but it seems to have great revenue and net income. With ER in the beginning of September, do you think this could be a good play? Would a 6 month out LEAP be smarter?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "IV is too high on RKT right now. RKT is literally in the 100th percentile of Implied Volatility, which means you're paying up the ass for premium on contracts. So if RKT's movement stabilizes, you can potentially lose on IV crush, price movement going against you, and theta, although the latter is of less concern with LEAPs.  I personally am actually looking to sell RKT puts when it has a red day to collect on that premium, because I wouldn't mind owning the company. \n\nIf you must buy, RKT LEAPs are probably ok, but not after the 2 day run it's just had.
