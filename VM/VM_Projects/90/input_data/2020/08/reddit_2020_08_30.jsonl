{"title": "JAMF is easy money on earnings release", "selftext": "Alright fellas, hop on the **JAMF** train for easy money.\n\nJAMF IPO-ed on July 22, 2020 -- it's been chilling in a range waiting up to its first earnings release on 9/1/2020 AH. JAMF is the fucking leading enterprise solution for management of apple hardware and solutions. Its primary customers are businesses, schools, hospitals, and anybody using apple products. Trendy tech startups are using it. Established players are as well (Salesforce, IBM, Cisco, etc). JAMF has already secured massive government contracts for remote schools (elementary, middle, high school, college, law schools, LITERALLY EVERY TYPE OF SCHOOL) that aren't reflected in their earnings. As WFH movement grows and becomes more permanent, there are tremendous growth opportunities for JAMF.\n\nJamf reported $204 million in revenue in 2019, up from $146.6 million in 2018. While its annual revenue grew around 39 percent year over year, its net losses have shrunk by around 10 percent, from $36.3 million in 2018 to $32.6 million in 2019. Next earnings release is September 1st - after hours. I'm calling for a blow out fucking quarter due to the school contracts.\n\nThe stock is trading under $39 (\\~$3.8B market cap). Near term analyst price targets are in the range of 45-70. I think it could easily double/triple after earnings.\n\nI've got 175 shares holding long term but figured I'd let the boys know before earnings", "id": "ijjdd6", "created_utc": 1598817688.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "I mean they IPO'd like a week ago so yea", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "you won't regret it", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Famous last words", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "ya for sureat least he didn't delte the post", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "As an update, I'm in the middle of researching this stock and these were indeed famous last words.
