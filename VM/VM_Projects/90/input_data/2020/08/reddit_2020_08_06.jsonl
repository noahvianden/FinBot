Being the son of an immigrant family who supports 3 other family members, I am constantly getting pressure by my mom on buying a house to have a home of my own, after her nagging and nagging and asking me to go look at houses with her, I broke down and bought the house instead of buying AMD shares below $2. (The house had gone up around 90K in value).  \n\n3 years went by, my gf at the time (now ex.) was pressuring me to invest in a condo with her mom, I told her I don't have any extra money.  She goes, what about your stocks?  I was like I am holding those long term until AMD hits at least $80-90 or even higher, and that will be my retirement money.  She started talking shit daily saying my AMD will crash at 16.xx if I don't sell it now, she nag and nag, so I cracked and put a sell order in, the stock sold right when her mom borrowed money from someone else to buy her condo and no longer need me, long story short I ended up with 6K shares after buying back in at a higher price.\n\nIf I had listened to myself and stick to my long term plan, the 50k total shares would have been 4 million assuming I sold at $80.  \n\nAlways stick to your own plan and goal, no one else have the same insight as you do.
