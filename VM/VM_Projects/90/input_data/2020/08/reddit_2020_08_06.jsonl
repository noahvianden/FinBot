Being the son of an immigrant family who supports 3 other family members, I am constantly getting pressure by my mom on buying a house to have a home of my own, after her nagging and nagging and asking me to go look at houses with her, I broke down and bought the house instead of buying AMD shares below $2. (The house had gone up around 90K in value).  \n\n3 years went by, my gf at the time (now ex.) was pressuring me to invest in a condo with her mom, I told her I don't have any extra money.  She goes, what about your stocks?  I was like I am holding those long term until AMD hits at least $80-90 or even higher, and that will be my retirement money.  She started talking shit daily saying my AMD will crash at 16.xx if I don't sell it now, she nag and nag, so I cracked and put a sell order in, the stock sold right when her mom borrowed money from someone else to buy her condo and no longer need me, long story short I ended up with 6K shares after buying back in at a higher price.\n\nIf I had listened to myself and stick to my long term plan, the 50k total shares would have been 4 million assuming I sold at $80.  \n\nAlways stick to your own plan and goal, no one else have the same insight as you do.    I have learned that people who are trying to change your decision are usually the ones who make the most noise and without any knowledge in the things you do.   \n\nThis is the lesson that I will be telling my kids, if I get to have any.
