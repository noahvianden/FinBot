{"title": "For Nio Bulls, battery swap stations are flawed", "selftext": "I've been following electric car development for the last 6 years and I can tell you Nio's battery swap stations and \"battery as a service\" concepts is a flawed business model. At least for passengers cars. It could work for trucks or motorcycles.\n\n1.) Tesla introduced their version of battery swap technology all the way back in 2013, but abandoned that plan for super charger networks. Lower cost and less moving parts that can break down.\n\n2.) If you watch Nio battery swap videos, you will notice there are at least 1-2 technicians making sure the battery swap goes well (you are dealing with high voltage energy packs and lots of moving parts during a battery swap) This means unlike Tesla supercharger networks, the cost of operations are higher for Nio\n\n3.) Battery as a service is flawed...at least for passenger cars. When you buy a Tesla car, any depreciation of the battery packs is on the owners expensive. Where as with Nio that depreciation is at the companies expense. Normally it isn't a big deal as Nio can charge a higher monthly fee to Nio owners, but any battery breakthrough will make these battery packs depreciate a lot more, Tesla won't have to worry because the buyers already paid for the battery.\nAlso Nio will have to figure out when to take the battery packs out of operations, batteries degrades over time, 5 years from now the battery can maintain between 80% to 90% of its original charge. At which percentage does Nio remove those battery from circulation? Again Tesla won't have to worry about this, as the owner already paid the car in full. \n\nWhere does battery swap make sense? Heavy duty long haul trucks (swapping a truck's battery is quicker than charging a 700 plus kilowatthour pack) and motorcycles like GOGORO (lighter battery means you can swap it by hand) \n\nI'm an autist, so take my advice with a big grain of salt.", "id": "ifus8c", "created_utc": 1598293935.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "We know that, and we know that tsla isn’t worth 2000 yet it keeps on giving", "score": 40, "replies": []}, {"body": "None of that is correct.\n\nNIO has already made a deal with battery makers, they are NOT buying these up front.
