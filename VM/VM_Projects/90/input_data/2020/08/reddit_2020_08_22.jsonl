Secondly, we deploy a rules-based options-collar strategy that is geared towards providing a constant, fully financed portfolio hedge. To break that down a little further, an at-the-money Nasdaq-100 index call option is sold with the intent to generate a premium. We then use a portion of the premium received to purchase a Nasdaq-100 index put option. That provides downside protection, because it fully hedges the portfolio and seeks to protect against potential losses in the underlying equity portfolio.

In the future, there'll be an even greater demand as power walls become the next Model Ey (energy) once (matter of when, not if) V2G becomes a thing.\n\nCouple that with Elon's request for sustainably mined Nickel, that whoever does it, will get a large contract from the company. There's also Cybertruck and Semis on the Horizon, and don't forget, SpaceX is sourcing Tesla motors and batteries to handle the electrical grid and backends of their Starship prototypes. This means that the probability of SpaceX sourcing more products from Tesla once their Starship is flying, will increase as well.\n\nOn top of that, their Ey MegaPacks in Australia are *massively* successful. They have a functioning peaker plant that's printing money. A second one requested in a different part of Australia, a third being built in Dubai, and with California's fires and power blackouts, having one or more in the home state is all but guaranteed.
