{"title": "NIO monthly delivery - Be ready to pump.", "selftext": "# It's a new month, time for another round of NIO pumping.\n\nNIO will be revealing their delivering report for July. As per last few months, NIO tend to do this on the first Wed/Thurs of a new month, so my estimated date of pump will be Aug 6... Then again, things may change, so I'll be in on Monday open\n\n\\----\n\n# NIO pump takes days.\n\nNIO isn't like most penny stocks, the pump takes days, so at least 14 DTE, preferably more.\n\n* Price on July 1, is below $8, and it peaked at July 10 near $15.\n* Price on June 1, is $4.30, and it peaked at June 9 for $6.7.\n\nIf you don't have patience or can't count past 7, this is not for you. I know the criteria invalidates 99% of you retards, but that's my perspective of \"how life works\"; Get your wife's boyfriend to help if needed.\n\n\\---\n\n# Why is there a pump?\n\nBecause NIO will most likely do better than expectation. Here are some numbers.\n\n>Apr 2020: 3,155May 2020: 3,436June 2020: 3,740\n\nDelivery numbers went up by around 300 per month, so  we can assume market expectation to be around 4050 for July. Now, if NIO delivers around 4050, it meets expectations = price rise due to constant high growth.\n\nIf NIO delivers more, it exceeds expectations = price rise even more.\n\n\\---\n\n# So, how many EV did NIO deliver in July?\n\nOn July 18, NIO officially stated that the 50,000th NIO production car was officially off the assembly line. Yes, they build their 50,000 EV on July 18.\n\nUnlike other car makers, NIO outsourced its manufacturing... meaning, that'll most likely be \"order on demand\". Building their 50,000 EV means they have 50,000 sales.\n\nTill June 2020, NIO did a total delivery of 46,082 EVs; That's a balance of nearly 4000 EVs left for July. NIO is almost at the \"expectation mark\" on July 18th. With nearly half a month remaining, chances of exceeding expectations is **huge**.\n\n\\---\n\n# Priced in?\n\nWell, NIO news isn't obscured. Everyone who knows how to find can find the information. However, do understand that NIO's current price is suppose to be at $13. The reason it's trading lower: someone from Goldman Sachs downgraded NIO with a price target of $7.\n\nThis is good in a way because current price has more upwards potential. In addition, most people in the knows, will reverse the BS from GS... I think this is the likely time for the reversal.\n\nBy meeting expectation's, I'm expecting NIO to hit higher 13s, while exceeding can elevates it back to ATH or even more, depending on how much it exceeds. Hypothetically speaking, if NIO can deliver over 5,000 in July, breaking $20 is possible.\n\nHowever, there's always the possibility of another analyst, jumping out with one of those \"underweight\" review; for those not holding long term, expect a dump after the pump.\n\n\\---\n\n# TL/DR:\n\nNIO 8/14 13c\n\nNIO 8/21 14c", "id": "i2mibg", "created_utc": 1596412304.0, "score": 168, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "8/28 27$c hold my beer", "score": 97, "replies": [{"body": "🤣", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "🤭", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Same cuz", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "ive been holding this boy forever \n\ni think i have 100 shares too", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "LETS FUCKING GO 🍻", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is solid DD actually.
