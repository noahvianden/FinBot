{"title": "UPS calls for October 16th look S3XY", "selftext": "EDIT: HUGE CATALYST: https://twitter.com/livesquawk/status/1301256506160144384?s=21\n\nOk shitbags, listen up. I‚Äôm looking at UPS $200c 10/16. Did some DD on this that I can share. Earnings just happened and you saw the pop after, same story with Fedex. COVID is real good for the shipping business. You saw FDX just hit over $200 and was $170 a week ago. UPS trading around $160 and will keep climbing as well. \n\n- UPS is Raising rates on shipping this fall and during the holiday season. Higher rates, higher revenue. See https://abc7chicago.com/business/ups-to-add-surcharge-for-companies-shipping-large-quantities/6365412/ - they‚Äôll be adding surcharges to keep up with shipping demand. Don‚Äôt forget about inflation happening too. \n- This particular call will expire roughly 11 days before their next earnings. Now they have not officially announced their next earnings date, but based on prior estimates, it will be around the 27th of October. Therefore if it doesn‚Äôt hit $200 before October 1, there should still be a nice run up first 2 weeks of October leading up to earnings. \n- Amazon partner (FDX is not) for shipping. Obviously we all know how amazon has been doing this pandemic. They are friendly competitors in a sense, as amazon does their own shipping yet they can‚Äôt replace UPS... yet. At some point that will come down, but I don‚Äôt see this partnership ending in the next 1-2 years. It‚Äôs kind of like having a roommate you hate, but have to live with until your lease ends. \n- calls are extremely low downside at .50. If you can‚Äôt afford a $50 call, you shouldn‚Äôt be trading. \n- IV is 56% at the moment, it has calmed down quite a bit since earnings, now is a good time to buy with lower IV. \n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/120115/ups-vs-fedex-comparing-business-models-and-strategies.asp\n\nUPS $200c 10/16 $0.50\n\nHappy Trading!", "id": "i98tag", "created_utc": 1597354437.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "yeah thanks for your post, i think now is the time to buy for Q3 earnings run up / fall plays.

Seeing as I damn near got blown up today, I think I'm just going to laser focus on UPS only and average in cash to these spreads and other spreads closer to the money or further out. UPS has been on the uptrend and there's no real reason for it to stop. Outlook on shipping is bullish and as we approach fall earnings it's going to keep going up, especially if they issue good guidance for the 4th quarter. I did a bit of my own DD and several experts are saying that UPS has no reason not to follow FDX up, and that there might be some resistance around the 170 level but after that should be a nice uptrend. We'll see if that plays out.\n\nI'm just going to start opening more of the 200/210c and also get some LEAPs. I don't think I'm going to grab anything dated for September though. Not sure about any volatility closer in and I just want to avoid that. I'm so sick of losing my ass on shorter dated options.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No problem.

That's about 3% every week. I'm worried we won't get that. I'm not sure why, I guess its just because its big run up recently was after an amazing earnings (though can you remind me what happened between August 6th and 7th to cause an 8% jump? EDIT: Nevermind, it was the memo announcing their increased fees) and I'm worried it won't keep up that kind of performance for long enough.\n\nEDIT: I guess it the market keeps pricing in an amazing fall season then we could see this run that hard. Their new fees means every package shipped is more dollars in their pockets.
