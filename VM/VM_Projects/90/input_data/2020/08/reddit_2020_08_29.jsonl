I started betting against the cruise industry because I thought no one would be getting on the plague magnets for months, then as the pandemic dragged on started betting against the S&P come July 31, I was down huge llke -35% for the year when all three indexes were definitely in the black.\n\nYour math is right. If I bought 30 shares the day after the split announced I'd be up roughtly 42% I did buy 30 shares but not all at the same time. I bought 6 the day was announced and the other 24 over the next couple of days. I even stupidly sold 5 in premarket on a Tuesday and then bought them back the Thursdsay for much higher. :( My 2nd buy was three days trading days after the split was announced. So if the split was announced Monday after close I bought 5 tuesday at around $1550, then 1 more when it dipped to the 1400s later that day, a couple more Wednesdsay, took profits on something, bought 1 more on Thursdsay etc. The last ones I bought were around $2100. So my average cost is the $1782 I quoted. Had I bought all 30 on Thursday August 12th my cost basis would be in the high $1400s to mid $1500s.\n\nSo yes youre right. I'm up about 25% as multiple small buys as it ran increased my average cost, vs buying them all on the same day.\n\nI initially bought it as a trade and was planning on holding until around battery day and then selling off pieces to take profit until I wittled it down to maybe 25-50 shares and then hold those long term. Then again if I hold for a full year, I would lower my capital gains taxes to whatever the long term rate is for my income, vs paying straight income taxes on whatever I make in profits..so hmmm. Decisions decisions. \n\nGoing to sell a few VTSAX in my Roth IRA monday and buy like 5 shares of TSLA in my Roth account because that money I can invest and play with but not remove to spend for 20 years.

For anesthesiologists intraoperatively, you can keep patients breathing on their own while under anesthesia (importance for quick wake up at surgery completion).  For post op patients in the PACU going home after surgery and for patients on the floor requiring an opioid for pain relief, you have an improved safety profile.\n\nThe point brought up by several people will be the price point, which I’m assuming will be much higher than morphine, fentanyl and dilaudid which are the current go-to’s in the hospital if needed.\n\nThey will have to show that preventing respiratory depression and hence safety of using this drug in the hospital justifies the increased cost.
