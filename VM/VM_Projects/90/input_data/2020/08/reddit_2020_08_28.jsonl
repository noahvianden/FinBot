Obviously it’s a speculative vs investment grade stock, but the utter bewilderment of the stock price has me genuinely confused. I guess similar confusion happened with Amazon on their path to profitability. I agree the price may be rising too quickly, but we’ve seen the Silicon Valley business model multiple times before and it really shouldn’t be so shocking.\n\nThe prior automotive business model was largely the same manufacturer to manufacturer. Toyota, GM, VW and the rest built a highly decentralized series of manufacturing plants across the globe that utilized a complex hierarchy of suppliers to source components, and distribute through a dealership model. \n\nTransmissions, power trains and other systems are often built in separate cities and states then shipped to an assembly plant to be put together. Each of those systems is composed of hundreds of components that are not built by the car company but purchased from a multitude of suppliers. Suppliers farther down the food chain may supply a basic piece, such as a windshield. Tier 1 suppliers will produce pieces composed of multiple components such as a door panel or car seat with a heating coil and electronic controls. Each supplier up and down the food chain is its own company that works for a profit. Daimler, Ford or Mazda aren’t really car makers, more so car assemblers.\n\nAlmost all car companies also could not be described as car sellers, as they rarely interact with final customers directly. When you buy a BMW, you don’t buy from BMW, you buy from a dealership that bought the car to resell at a profit. There is no direct sales channel.\n\nAlthough they use some suppliers, Tesla has proven that they can successfully bring a majority of component manufacturing, auto assembly and sales under one roof, physically in the form of fewer larger factories and figuratively under a single corporate entity. This allows them to capture not just the profit margin of auto assembly, but also parts suppliers and dealerships. In addition, it’s heavily speculated that Tesla is moving away from its battery partners like Panasonic to developing all batteries in house, and is already the major solar panel producer in the us, and the largest private charging station operator.\n\nTaking electrification and self driving out of the equation, imagine if Toyota not only assembled its cars, but owned a  major parts supplier like BorgWarner, and a chain of gas stations like Marathon, and all of their dealerships, and maybe even had a successful auto insurance start up and stakes in some oil companies. Maybe they’re even working on a taxi service similar to Uber or lift. You could see how they might be able to take advantage of some major synergies and have a significantly higher profit and valuation than they do today.\n\nSeeing what Tesla has accomplished so far really draws a clear possible path towards that hypothetical Toyota scenario. That’s without talking about some of the additional markets that can be addressed. When GM was the largest company out their, they made appliances (Frigidaire), Airplanes (north American aviation), and trains (electro motive diesel). Tesla has hinted at addressing these markets to some degree.\n\nWe have examples of new business models completely dominating a traditional market (Apple vs. Nokia), we have examples of companies vertically integrating manufacturing to an insane degree (GM before the anti-trust actions that forced the duponts out and the divestments post Roger Smith), and examples of unprofitable companies with insane valuations but a killer business plan growing hugely valuable and dominating their market (Amazon vs. sears). So the question isn’t just how can Tesla’s valuation be so high? but how can there still be so much doubt of the company’s potential success.\n\n\n\nNote: As an aside, I’ve been a nerd on automotive history, and automotive company’s corporate structures since college, before Tesla IPO’d. I have been in and out of the stock with huge success, but am by no means a Tesla fanboy or Musk devotee. I have huge doubts about the timeline of a self driving taxi service, the ability for Tesla to maintain brand equity long term, the practicality of the Tesla semi to function on long haul routes well and think the  possibility that they start addressing markets like air conditioners or aircraft may be overstated. I am currently holding a large position but am constantly weighing selling, but am convinced that with time Tesla will expand out of automotive and into a more conglomerate style company (GE of the 80s, or GM of the 60s) with a valuation closer to that of Apple or amazon.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I got through half then had to give you a + for typing all that.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Because most stocks stop at the moon and his is going to Mars 🚀", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Deep", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "top tier DD", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I sold at 1700 for 300 profit.

[Tesla Time News - Elon's 5-to-1 TSLA Stock Split](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6vFbS0B7BM) Something that a lot of people are missing is that:\n\n1. No one has made a car the equivalent of the 2012 Models S. Truly they have not. In the mean time Tesla has been improving it and the other vehicles that it offers. \n2. Tesla is the only ones with a serious charging network and destination chargers. Watch the video to see how some of that will be changing for home and work.\n3. A lot of the major competition does not actually have a plan for EVs. Only VW would have a chance but even they don't have major plans to push. So Tesla will still continue to expand and grow.\n4. A lot of their major competitors are so debt ridden, and are very beholden to making a profit for their shareholders, that they will not be able to divert the money ($20 Billion USD) to make a start on things. Covid19 threw a wrench into those plans for GM and Ford.  Tesla has $14 Billion USD in Debt, but 6 or 7 Billion in cash. Ford has $175 Billion in Debt, and in April had $30 Billion in Cash of which 15 had just been raised at 9%. Their debt is rated at Junk. That Cash has been used to prop them up during Covid. How are they going to put down that investment into EVs? GM is not so bad but in similar straits. Which means they too will not push on the EV side.\n5. Lastly take a look at what Tesla has done with their Batteries, and storage. The Big Battery in Australia. They are starting Similar projects in other areas, including California. [https://electrek.co/2020/04/17/tesla-completes-massive-expansion-big-battery/](https://electrek.co/2020/04/17/tesla-completes-massive-expansion-big-battery/) Now why include this. This battery pack was put in place instead of building a peaker plant. Cost of the battery about $90 Million USD. It has literally paid off it's cost in lest than 2 years. Even making almost a $1 Million in a couple of days. Versus a fossil fuel plant that would have been $700 Million, and needed constant maintenance and fueling. Their Energy division is going to be bringing in close to the same amount as the automotive side. They have already applied for a utility license in the UK. \n\nConclusion. Don't bet Against them.

They have been a big proponent of the company. Their current guidance is that by 2024, the stock will hit $7,000! They have been off by a little bit, by way of time. I think though that they are really starting to hit their stride, with everything that they are doing and how they are putting their production together, ARK is probably right. In all honesty you probably have till Sept 22, when they do Battery day and the AGM. Either way they are announcing something very big for batteries. I do encourage you to watch that video as they break down the different business sectors that they are moving into. Those are really big money and so with the energy side having a potential to be doing the same amount of business as the auto side the price will probably be back up to $1000 after the AGM. Maybe more. You also have to think about the people like me and the guys from Now You Know. Plus all those kids out there who really believe in what the company is trying to do. They are trying to change the world over to renewable energy. The easiest way to do that is to wrap cars around batteries. So those of us who believe are many. Plus once you have owned a Tesla you really are not going back. Those owners usually look to buy stock too. \n\nYou are going to have a lot of competition come Monday for this cheap stock price. If you are able to get the stock at anything under $400 you will be a winner. It closed today at $2213.40 so it should drop to around $442. But I am not sure what Monday morning will do. I personally would hope that there are going to be people who will be dumping the stock, when they realize they lost a ton of money on it, since they were not the holder of Record as of August 21, 2020. The reason being that everyone seems to have made a mistake and not read the new correctly. The title of the investors news release was \" Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split\".  It then went on to say it is giving a dividend in the form of 4 shares. So everyone who has sold after that date, and everyone who has bought will not be getting the dividend. So every one who bought will have their investment value cut to 20%. If they hold it they will get their money back. If they dump it, then it is up for grabs at the reduced cost. It will definitely be going back up next week. \n\nSorry I realize I rambling. It is almost 2 am here.  The take away, is get your USD into the trading account, and put your buy order in for Monday $350 to $450. I can not decide. You may just have to change it to market if you are worried about missing the opportunity at a low price whatever it is. Either way if you hold it. You could potentially have a big payday in the next few years. My $2000 investment last year for 10 shares, will not get me 50 shares. If Ark is right, and it goes to $7000, and potentially a lot higher. I will have $350,000 in 4 years.  There are also still chances of another dividend so Jump in and join us. \n\nHope this helped.

In most cases you should be looking for good long term holds that are stable, and also pay a good dividend. Brookfield renewables is one. You should also set up your account to use DRIP, which will take the cash that is paid to you as a dividend and automatically buy new stock of that same company. This is usually free, so there will be no fees.  Obviously you need to get enough to buy a full share, otherwise the cash will just get deposited to your trading account. This is the way that you can over time get exponential growth. Do your research and look at companies that you would use. The Nickle mining companies are a good bet, but look for ones that are located in North America. Most of the legit mining stocks are on the Toronto Exchange as there was a major issue with a Canadian company  full of Fraud. After that there were really good rules put in place and the shareholders are well protected on that exchange.\n\nSo now why was no one talking about how great Tesla is, and why it is giong to $7000? Well because nobody wants Tesla to do well. That would mean that Oil and Gas will lose out. Then the Traditional Car companies will also face a downturn and lose value. That all is in the back of everything. It is why Tesla has been shorted so much.  Only a few people look at the way ARK investments does. They don't have a Automotive analyst looking at the company alone. They have a large team from different industries that Tesla is in, or could potentially be in. So Tesla makes it's own Semi conductor for the GPU that is now used for the self driving module. Need people who know that industry. Then they have Automotive obviously. There is the Infrastructure/ utility/ Power company aspect of the company. A few more specialists needed there. Then there is the AI side of things for the Self drive. Then Renewables, for the Solar side, which is now ramping up by the way. They are really killing the market in a lot of states.  Also there is a Software component that has to be looked at as well. So this is why Ark was able to predict that Tesla was going to be very far ahead of the curve and that really no one was going to catch them. The rest of the investment industry and their competitors just sees them as a car company, so that was the only analysis that was done. Looking only at that, Tesla does not make sense.  Also they look down on Tesla. Part of Tesla's production line is actually a giant long tent. It has been a tent for a few years now. That sort of things gets looked down on by everyone who looks at it. Yet they don't understand that just because it may seem dumb, it works therefore it is correct. \n\nPerfect example of this just get on with it attitude is the SpaceX Boca Chica Texas Launch Facility. Who ever heard of making Rockets out in the open while you are building the bases of the construction bays to build the next generation of Rockets. Same idea as Tesla, make it work, and they make it work well. \n\nLastly everyone just thinks that when they want they can just come in and roll over Tesla. How exactly can they. Tesla holds the patents for the battery chemistry, and the production methods. A few years back in order to encourage uptake and innovation in the industry Tesla released a huge number of Patents. Only one company took them, and ran with them. A company out of China I can not remember the name of.  With everything that Tesla is doing. They are also building up their charging infrastructure, and pushing as much as they can to make them green, using renewable sources. In a lot of cases just sticking huge Solar arrays over the station. Tesla has offered their competitors access to the network, but all of them don't want to give up a little info so that the communication between the charger and their vehicles can be made properly.  Thus allowing for basics like billing, and making sure that the charge is being done correctly.  It has taken Billions and years to do this. Even if the other manufacturers started to just throw money at the problem they could not solve it or progress very far, because Tesla is still moving forward. They don't have the traditional road blocks to innovation the rest of the manufactures have. Perfect example, why does the Audi e-tron have a grill, It is not very aerodynamic because of that, compared to what it could be. A grill is only needed to feed air to combustion engine so that the fuel can spark, and ignite.  From the beginning Tesla did not put a grill on their cars. The first Model S had a cover that mimicked one by being black. But it was an areo cover.\n\nWatching the following if you want to know about this company.: \n\n[Now You Know](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFmrcGuFNu_59L0pHcR0OA)  [Ben Sullins](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbEbf0-PoSuHD0TgMbxomDg) There is a whole host of others, but basically.
