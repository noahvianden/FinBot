Electricity is cheaper than fuel, maintenance on EVs is cheaper than on ICE cars, depreciation on EVs is lower than on ICE cars (and much lower on Tesla's actually, 10-30% over 3 years compared to 50-60% for ICE cars). Do the math on how much it costs of the time you will own the car. and calculate the difference. It's definitely more than the difference in sticker price, which is about 10-15k when you compare it with a new one in the same luxury segment, less for a used one.\n\nThese are facts, anyone can look them up. You say I won't listen to reason or logic; this is reason and logic. If you refuse to listen to this that's horribly ironic.\n\n> TSLA gets outsold by pretty much every car manufacturer.\n\n> Why do you think that is?\n\nBecause they make 500,000 cars a year while others build 10,000,000.
