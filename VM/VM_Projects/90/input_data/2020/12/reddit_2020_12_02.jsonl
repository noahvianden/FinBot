{"title": "You have to know when to pull out (even if you never do)", "selftext": "So much loss porn today, on a day when the market is more or less flat. Why? Because of all of the PLTR bag holders. Yeah, some of you bought horrendously OTM short-term calls, sure, but some of you were people looking at 400% gains and you held because PLTR to the moon.\n\nI keep seeing a lot of advice posts in here that are all great even if none of you retards are actually following that advice, but one more big piece here. I keep seeing people arguing with intense (and unearned) confidence that stock X will keep going up even though it's already gone up 559% in 6 months, stock Y (usually Tesla lol) kept going up when it was up 690% (see what I did there). But guess what fuckers, these are two different cases.\n\nI know we're all autistic in this sub but people need to have exit strategies. You have to recognize that you've already landed on the moon. When you're sitting on a 400% gain on a very risky run-up, it's extremely unrealistic for there to be no sort of pullback *even if the long-term thesis is still intact*. People are out here playing the lottery but you already fucking hit the lottery if you hit on 400%. Guys, the average return on stocks is roughly 8% historically (when you account for inflation). 400% is like 50x that. Yeah it's cool to post 10,000% gains and shit but you know what else is cool? Walking away with a big gain and not having to be the bottom bitch to the homeless guy who you share the dumpster behind wendy's with.\n\nLoss porns were funny but I keep seeing \"lost my life savings\" or \"gambled on significant margin\" or \"i used student loan payments for this\" and it's really bumming me out. So either start using what little brain cells you have or at least leave out the context because I want to laugh at you without feeling bad.\n\nEdit: Obviously knew what I was doing here with that title.", "id": "k5gg38", "created_utc": 1606937554.0, "score": 349, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah these huge losses or deep otm calls on meme stocks are sad", "score": 143, "replies": [{"body": "People are losing their life savings it's sad as fuck.", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Not pulling out might explain why I have so many kids and am the only person who's lost money in the biggest bull market in history....", "score": 33, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The existence of WSB creates a lot of FOMO even if there is survivorship bias (probably 1 in 50 make it big)", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "That‚Äôs....why we‚Äôre here", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "First meme stock i went in on.
