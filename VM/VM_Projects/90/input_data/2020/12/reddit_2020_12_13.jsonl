{"title": "GME Bull run thesis explained and why it should interest you. rokit rokit mun", "selftext": "Okay, good morning fellow autists and retards. \n\nI'm not going to bother with the niceties since most of you have the attention span of a pre-teen needing to go potty. That's not a lot so I'll keep it brief.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME is a B&M primary business, first and foremost. It operates mainly in the US, though it also has retail stores in Canada, Europe, New Zealand and Australia. They used to be wildly popular back in the day, but have seen rapid decline since the digitization era has come and GME for the most part hasn't been adapting as it should have been.   \n\n\nThis brings us to today, where the share price has been averaging down for years, until mid-August this year when we got the news of the [partnership with Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-surges-after-microsoft-partnership-announcement-2020-10-08#:~:text=GME%2C%20%2D5.74%25%20gained%2044,end%20and%20in%2Dstore%20operations), which sent the price to tendie-town for those who got in early. However, based on purely DCF, a fair value for the stock would be around 22 USD. Way higher than what it's now, and that's also the difference between Burry and Cohen imo. Burry invested purely on the fair value for GME, while Cohen has different intentions (more on that later).\n\nNow, a partnership is great, but it won't keep them afloat forever. They NEED to change their boomer mentality and start getting digitized. Gaming is a booming sector, [with insane growth YOY.](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-game-market#:~:text=The%20global%20video%20game%20market,12.9%25%20from%202020%20to%202027.&text=The%20rising%20inclination%20from%20physical,on%20hardware%20compatibility%20and%20efficiency) They need to capitalize on this or they'll flicker out eventually because someone else came around and filled the void. \n\nThis is where Ryan Cohen comes in. No need to introduce him, this guy has been mentioned enough, founded CHEWY made millions, etc. What hasn't been sent home enough, is that he has vision. He knows what people want, how they want to be treated as customers ([which is in part why CHWY has such good reputability](https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronikasonsev/2018/05/23/chewys-customers-love-them-and-heres-why/?sh=58b595244b7f)). \n\nWhat the gaming industry lacks is a centralized point that makes people go \"Oh yeah, I need this or that game, let's go to Gamestop for that\" There really isn't that one name for people. It used to BE Gamestop with them even now still being the largest gaming retailer in America. But they're but a shadow of what they have been. \n\nNow if anyone has been able to follow me through my ramblings, Ryan Cohen has in front of him an opportunity to pull GME up from the mud and reveal a diamond. Because that what GME is. A diamond in the rough, and no one's noticed, or bothered to check it out. \n\nNow I don't know how, or when exactly, there are plenty of other posts that go into the when and how Cohen will take over, but all I do know is this:\n\n\\-He bought up 9.98% of the shares outstanding (massive position)\n\n\\-He ([or his lawyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/)) wrote an unusually aggressive letter to the BoD to change pretty massively. \n\n\\-He's mentioned in interviews that he doesn't like to half-ass investments if he [\"believes in the company\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJdZPTjq274). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this say for me? That he believes in the company, not so much in the current way that its heading (hence the letter). His stake in the company tells me he's not just a friendly passer-by telling them to look-up because a meteorite is about to smash into them. No, he's putting his foot in the door so that he can then open it wide and let in some fresh air (himself/his team). \n\nNot only would it change the entire company in a good way, it would make any sort of valuation unpredictable taking into account future potential. \n\nAdd on to this situation that GME is so heavily shorted, and this makes for a SUPER interesting play, if not long-term, at the very least short-term, because of the short squeeze that would occur because of this. And if Cohen takes over, long term prospects are probably higher than whatever we get from the squeeze. \n\nI don't know if much of what I said made sense, but here you go anyway.

INTC has been there and done it.

AMD had to pay billions to offload their shit unprofitable fabs to IBM (later GlobalFoundries) and even for years after AMD was chained by a supply agreement where they were forced to buy less competitive silicon from GloFo whether they needed it or not, rather than more competitive Samsung or TSMC. IT VERY NEARLY BANKRUPTED AMD. And that is nearly where Intel is sitting right now. Not quite as bad, but the parallels are obvious.\n\nI'm not shorting Intel, they have a much broader portfolio than AMD or Nvidia and they still dominate market share in CPUs so they have a decent turnaround chance even if nothing is going their way right now. Sorry you fell for the INTC investor press releases all while they are hemorrhaging market share and gross margins, even though they have excess capacity and AMD doesn't.\n\nBeen riding AMD since 2.55 and Intel has never been in a worse position than right now.
