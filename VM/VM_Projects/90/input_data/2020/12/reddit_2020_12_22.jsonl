To do computation you either charge it to read as 1, or discharge it and read as 0. You do this billion of times per second. The bigger the transistor, the bigger the capacitance and the harder it is to charge/discharge it.\n\nA small process node, even if you just take your exact transistor layout for 14 nm and port it over to 5nm, you will get faster clock speeds, lower power consumption and per transistor it's also cheaper.\n\nNewer process nodes is really just synonymous with better technology. Shrinking the transistor is the goal, but innovation and new developments are required to allow for smaller transistors. If you have the money you can jump on the best node and reserve supply at 3 nm like Apple has, develop a new design to take advantage of the new better in every way transistors. When Tesla launched HW3 14 nm was alright. 7nm was very new at that point, Apple had just launched 7 nm chips a couple months before, the year before they also pretty much used a 14 nm node.\n\nApple has continued to launch 7nm+ chips in 2019 and now 5 nm chips in 2020, next year they will do 5nm+, then in 2022 they already got their 3nm supply reserved.

It will probably be on 7 nm, but the point is Apple is one of the most hardcore semiconductor guys, really pushing technology on cutting edge nodes. Tesla is today on a 6 year old node.\n\nSidenote, neither Apple or Tesla is actually manufacturing any silicon. That's all Samsung/TSMC. Apple just makes the transistor design and ships it of to TSMC for them to fabricate the design, but I know at least Nvidia spends more on semiconductor R&D, just designing chips than Tesla spends on R&D in total.

Also, study results are often highly biased and green energy really does cost huge amount to install and stuff doesn't last forever.\n\nThe bottom lines are the two respective techs can't compete. Nuclear tech provides far more kilowatts per dollar than anything else, as most of the cost is in security and safety and paperwork pertaining to the same and \"screw you\" fines levied for the slightest missteps.\n\nMeanwhile I've worked at wind farms and installation, technical issues, and repairs are expensive and labor intensive.

By Tesla's stock price you'd think that EV is quickly replacing gas, but they still represent less than 2% of car sales this year and a fraction of a percent of cars on the road. I've seen a number of big office buildings with EV charging stations, but I've never seen any of them used even once.\n\nAnd all this when investor speculation, consumer desire, and government regs/subsidies/taxes all RAMMING this industry forward. Tesla is so overvalued that they would have to account for 100% of car sales in the US to justify that price... I mean that literally, their PE ratio is 50 times what a healthy growth stock should be. And each and every other EV builder is equally overvalued. As is the solar/wind industry which mooned the same time Tesla did, but their valuations make even less sense as they have years/decades long contracts with cities to provide power and the industry moves at a snails pace. And I've seen the insides of one wind farm project, where work was slow and expensive due to mismanagement, lack of qualified personnel, overwork, and technical issues (don't buy World Wind and Solar).\n\nAlso, nuclear energy has made many technological progress at the same time even if it isn't front page news. The Pentagon and maybe South Africa are buying \"NewScale\" reactors, which are small enough to be moved by semi, modular enough to be quickly assembled together, and standardized so they can be bulk manufactured. To say nothing of thorium reactors, which has been tested mostly on paper for decades but no one wants to fund it. Also, technology moves in decades while the market and the news moves in weeks, and historically speaking predicting when and how technological progress will occur will lead to repeat failure of investments normally by being too early or the tech being unspectacular.\n\nI don't know what the future will be like, and given Biden has also jumped on the bandwagon and wants to subsidize green energy. This may cause prices to rise even further by propping up unprofitable ventures and inept companies.

They started in 2009 developing software for [storage controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_array_controller) using generic [flash storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory) hardware while secretly developing their proprietary software.  They completed this in 2015 and went public, raising $470m in venture capital efforts.  Now they are a leader in Garnet Magic Quadrant for primary storage arrays in 2020.\n\nSome cool examples of their reputation: F1's top team, Mercedes AMG picked them up and has attributed their success to PSTG's tech.  The City of New Orleans was victim to an extensive cyber attack in 2019 and PSTG saved the day.  PSTG's tech was recently compared to Dell's EMC Powerstore and it wasn't even close.  Pure Storage's FlashArray is the shit.  When the top entities look for data security and management they're not going to settle for the 2nd or 3rd best option, they're going to the best in the industry.\n\nThe run-up for PSTG and many stocks post-election has been the stuff of fairy tales, but I'm not letting that slight me.  Sometimes I will turn away from stocks because I think it's too late, but in reality I'm early.  I bought CRSR at 25 and sold at 35 (F).  Honestly there's no telling how high a company can really run up.  All I know is with a market cap of 6 billion, PSTG has a long way to go.  The 20% run-up over the last month has been on average daily volume.  It looks like institutions have been steadily accumulating ever since Pure Storage established themselves as the best in the industry with the highest potential for growth.  Their numbers make me think that they will be bought out by a larger entity soon, because they're basically operating at a net loss, but with huge potential if they can get their costs down.  **1.36b revenue in 2019.**\n\nKeith Martin, the Senior Director at Cloud Capacity Engineering had this to say about PSTG:\n\n*‚ÄúPure has had a revolutionary impact on the business, completely changing our mindset and how the cloud infrastructure team functions. The storage experience freed us up to be more creative. It was a magical transformation.‚Äù*\n\nLastly I really like the team.  The CEO was a Senior Exec at Cisco Systems.  The CTO was a founding engineer at Veritas, and their Co-Founder served in Yahoo!'s Office of the Chief Technologist.  The company is solid, has a ton of new press / clout and is clearly going places considering cybersecurity is  probably the hottest sector right now.  I am blown away that the volume has been so low so far especially with Cathy scooping up shares all year.  I really love how the chart looks with slow and steady bleed up over the last month.  I expect a huge pop this week.  \n\n**Price target of 27 by EOY.**\n\nPositions:\n\n22.5c 1/15/2021\n\n25c 2/19/2021\n\n30c 1/21/2022\n\n+ Shares.", "id": "khwfxa", "created_utc": 1608605339.0, "score": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Someone give him gold ^\n\nEdit: vilified", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Is that all it takes?
