{"title": "The Weekend IV Report - List of Tickers with High IV Options", "selftext": "What's up fellas at Theta Gang. Not long ago I made a post about an IV tool I made called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker)  that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI often use the theta gang wheel strategy by selling cash secured puts close to at-the-money and I like to see where I can get some bang for my buck. A quick scan of the list will tell me what IV is looking like for certain stocks and when earnings is coming up and whether or not I want to do a weekly theta YOLO for earnings. You can sort by IV, stock price, or Earnings and filter by ticker.\n\nHere's some of the top tickers from this weekend. Instead of making a full list of tickers ranked by IV, I'll share some of the more common tickers mentioned.\n\n\\***Smaller Accounts - Tickers under $50 will be BOLDED.**\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Stock Price|IV (%)|Next Earnings Date|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**MARA - Marathon Patent Group Inc.**|$5.47|240%|N/A|\n|**RIG - Transocean Ltd.**|$2.16|178%|Feb 22, 2021|\n|**ACB - Aurora Cannabis Inc.**|$10.96|165%|N/A|\n|**TLRY - Tilray Inc.**|$8.66|162%|Mar 22, 2021|\n|**AMC - AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.
