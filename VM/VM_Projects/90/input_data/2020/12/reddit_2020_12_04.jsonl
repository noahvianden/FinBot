{"title": "What PLTR actually does (short version)", "selftext": "TL;DR Imagine the show Devs but without quantum computers\n\n\nSome.background: I am a software engineer. I don't work at Palantir. This is all based on my own prior knowledge and things I have read in one of their user guides.\n\nHere it goes.\n\nPretend I'm the NSA. I have many databases, containing things like ISP data, security footage, text messages, GPS data, voice recordings, credit card transactions, emails, public records, and satellite images. I need a way to connect my datasets to generate insight, which in the case of the NSA means spying on someone.\n\nPalantir sells the software to do that. It works in multiple steps.\n\n1) It uses my datasets to create a knowledge graph where the nodes are all people, places and things in the \"universe\" and the edges indicate their relationship. It's like a social network, but in addition to connections to my friends, family, and coworkers, there is also an edge connecting me to my phone, my home, my car, my preferred Wendy's, etc.\n\n2) Using the connections in that knowledge graph, it can create a coherent and complete timeline for a given person by piecing together data points from my whole data ecosystem. This requires machine learning and AI to extract signal from unstructured data like images and text, and the use of pattern matching to de-annonymize data by linking it back to specific people.\n\nThe end result: Reconstructing a model of the past by connecting all data breadcrumbs left along the way, and then predicting the future based on past events.", "id": "k6gzt3", "created_utc": 1607070252.0, "score": 180, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "I don't want to know the future of their victim.
