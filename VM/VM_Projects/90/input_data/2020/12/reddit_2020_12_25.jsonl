My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don‚Äôt follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I would think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.  \n\nI think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.  \n\nNow, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren‚Äôt really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don‚Äôt even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?\n\nConventional wisdom allows average Joe‚Äôs to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found. \n\nWhich investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you‚Äôd probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better. \n\nI cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I‚Äôm up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I‚Äôve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year. \n\nMoral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it‚Äôs going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options). \n\nThank you, and have a Merry Christmas.

I am a big believer in genomics too. however i have been reading a lot and it seems like science is just not there yet. We just don‚Äôt understand genetic underpinnings of most complex diseases. Apart from monogenic diseases, most diseases are caused by many different genetic mutations and environment so a tool such as crispr while revolutionary for basic science is simply not adequate. Also it seems like crispr has its limitations. I read that cas9 is error prone and cutting DNA seems to cause an aging like effect on the cell. I was surprised to learn crsr fixed sickle cell on human patient. This is very promising but a lot of genetics/biotech seems to come up with miracle cures on lab only to fail phase III. \n\nI am not doubting you.

I spent a little time on biomed (my thesis was actually about gene therapy nano particle vectoring for cystic fibrosis patients) but I love machines too so now work in manufacturing.\n\nThere are still 5,000-8,000 monogenic diseases out there. Many polygenic diseases can also show the 80-20 effect by which I mean, fixing one of the mutations has a disproportionately significant effect (enough to be an effective symptom or quality of life treatment, if not a cure) even if many are left untouched. Of course we are not ready to begin human clinical trials on a wide scale but animal lab studies are in progress. Recently a Chinese researcher used CRISPR to edit the CCR5 gene out of human fetuses. Those children are now alive and immune to HIV (although it was an egregious ethical transgression in the eyes of most science professionals to do that without knowing the potential consequences or consulting the industry about human genetic editing ethical standards). Later got sued for it or something. Google the name He Jiankui. The point is public awareness and motivation for scientific experimentation around the technology are making big strides recently. \n\nIndividual genetic mutations do occur that can confound targeting and yes cas9 can make errors in site selection. Book-ending the active protein with cas9 instead of just one helps, as does appending RNA ‚Äúhairpins‚Äù to help with specific targeting. Those hairpins have been shown to 50x targeting accuracy (Thats off the top of my head, so don‚Äôt quote me but I remember the figure I read was at least an order of magnitude increase). Also keep in mind in the future we will likely be able to sequence a patient‚Äôs genome down to the base pairs and account for those unexpected discrepancies. The main question for me is how long that will remain too cost prohibitive for widespread adoption. \n\nThere will be plenty of developmental and regulatory barriers along the way but that‚Äôs the case for any new medical technology. Old school pharma fails in phase III 95% of the time too. It doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt rake it on on the products that actually go to market. I think this sector would behave similarly, but the ones that land will go way bigger way faster. Many small biotech shops you know of are struggling to do the same thing Pfizer does with similar technology and way less resources.
