{"title": "Why I'm Shorting the Tits off SPCE", "selftext": " 1. As of writing, SPCE has a market cap of 7.8 billion dollars and 600 people have signed up, which comes out to $13,000,000/person while tickets are $250k/person. I may wear a helmet to sleep and ride the short bus to a puzzle factory every day but that math is too retarded even for me.\n\n2. Blue origin will (eventually) fly you to space for $150k in a real rocket, not some weird looking airplane like SPCE that costs $100k more. If I’m going to go to space I’d rather get the complete experience and do it in Bezos’s giant overcompensating rocket cock (just google image it). If I want to be weightless then I can pay for a flight in a private vomit comet for $5k.\n\n3. When the eviction mortarium ends and the shit really hits the fan, our streets are flooded with the newly homeless and every year brings a record forest fire season, even the most out of touch millionaires may think it is in poor taste to spend $250k and burn a shitload of fossil fuels for a 3-hour flight and maybe 5 minutes of weightlessness.\n\n4. I grew up in New Mexico and Virgin’s spaceport is in an armpit in the middle of nowhere. The whole lead-up to the launch is going to be depressing, probably involving a \\~3-hour long drive from the Albuquerque airport along a desolate stretch of interstate. Maybe they’ll set up a helicopter or commuter plane type service for VIPs but still they will have nothing else to do there. I think Virgin is the only occupant of the spaceport and the rest of the facility is deserted. No nice restaurants, no clubs, just dusty wasteland. Not cool.\n\n5. Maybe a few people will still go through the hassle and expense of a SPCE flight (If they ever happen) but once word of mouth spreads and Forbes pays to send up a journalist to write up the whole experience then the excitement will be over. They will need thousands of customers a year to make this whole endeavor make sense and I just don’t see that ever happening.\n\n6. Although I sincerely hope that this doesn’t happen, they already had one fatal crash in 2014. Not that I am in any way counting on it, but space flight is risky and rich-ass space tourists only want to **pretend** to do something dangerous. Even a whiff of another safety issue will tank the stock. \n\n7. SPCE has been messing around since 2004 and still has essentially no revenue but they lose more $$ every year.  Actually, this is kind of bullish?\n\n8. Out of the aerospace people I have talked to (granted, only 3 of them; 2 BA and 1 Blue Origin) it seems like the cool kids work for either SpaceX or NASA. Most of them forget that Virgin Galactic is even a thing until you bring it up to them.\n\n9. Even if the SPCE test goes well today I think it will be bad for them. They will see a funny looking airplane thing and then compare it to the gangster-ass shit that the other private space companies are doing and it won’t be a good look.\n\n10. If you’re rich and boring and really need to make yourself appear interesting at dinner parties that badly then you can fly Blue Origin, buy a Lambo Urus or Huracan and have money left over. If you just want a memorable experience then you could get a $10K a day hooker for weeks and have the champagne and cocaine blowout of a lifetime.\n\nTL;DReeeeeee: \n\nJan 2021 $30 put\n\nApril 2021 $25 put\n\nJan 2022 $20 put", "id": "kb6n12", "created_utc": 1607706157.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "Commenting because I want to see the follow up.

{"title": "RPRX Lockup Expiration + BIG WHALE PUT VOLUME", "selftext": "TLDR: RPRX lockup expiration ends Monday 12/14, 272M shares will be unlocked. This morning, $40 PUT options for Dec 14 volume rose from 5 -> 1.22K in the matter of a few seconds...\n\n**WARNING:** BID-ASK SPREAD IS PRETTY BAD, AND JUST THIS MORNING THIS WAS A SUPER ILLIQUID STOCK!!! Gamble at your own risk - I'm only throwing a couple hundred at this one. Please exit in 1-2 days to avoid theta burn and drop in premiums once retail and value investors start buying the dip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Price Targets To Exit:**\n\nREALISTIC STOCK PRICE TARGET FOR EOD MONDAY: $39.50 - 40.\n\nBEST CASE PT FOR EOD TUESDAY: $36-37\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst DD Post so don't expect anything too fancy or long but I know at this point y'all probably stopped reading by now so nbd. I was hesistant to enter this since this is a dead company and options volume is illiquid as fuck. HOWEVER, I was trying to get my orders filled due to the horrendous bid-ask spread on PUTS but I then I noticed the volume pumping from single digits in the morning to over 1K instantly... someone, somewhere with deep pockets knows something for next Monday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More Details:**\n\n* If you check the SEC filing, they offered 77.6M shares at $28 during their IPO, and then later a secondary offering of 17.3M shares at $42. However, **272M** shares will be unlocked next Monday, 12/14, which means any employees, insiders, early institutional investors, or big bois who got in well below $28 can choose to take profits if they want. Current price is hovering between $45 and $46, so make your own decisions. There will be 2.86x shares released than the tradeable public float right now, but of course this is subject to Rule 144 so there are limits on the pure amount that can be dumped at once.\n* Whoever pumped the option volume from single digits to over 1.2K got in around 0.35 - 0.55 for their premiums. Just a frame of reference if you wanted to get some confidence on overall pricing. Current premium for the same $40 PUT option right now is around 0.45, but bid-ask spread is high again.\n* Safest play: If the stock bounces or rallies again today by the EOD, just follow whoever this whale option buyer is and try to pick up $40 PUTS for cheaper, maybe around 0.25 or 0.30. Note this is unlikely and you probably won't get filled in time, but most likely you will only lose 1 day of theta maximum and can selloff right away on Monday if insiders choose not to sell their shares.\n* Riskier play: If you are more risk tolerant or like gambling, aka everyone on this sub, then just follow the WHALE and buy hundreds of the $40 PUT option. You will risk illiquidity to close and theta for 1 day though if the stock does not drop much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** I'm poor as fuck and not employed yet so only **short 25 shares at $46.20**, and holding **4 Dec 18 $45 PUT options** (Sadly, this is decent chunk of my portfolio value). Also trying to get filled for 20 $40 PUTS, but probably won't happen in time before close to see if bid-ask spread lowers and premiums drop for a last minute bounce. Up around 100% but greeding until Monday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SEC Sources and Screenshots:**  'Upon the completion of this offering, approximately **272,356,527** of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares (or 271,735,923 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) will be deemed “restricted securities,” '\n\n[SEC Prospectus screenshot on # of restricted\\/locked shares](https://preview.redd.it/zhn3qropel461.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=665c60d71c326972355013ed9f17d84fd29abcef)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIPO Prospectus date recorded was 6/15 + 181 days = 12/13 (Sunday). First trading day lockup does not apply will be 12/14 (Monday).\n\n[SEC Prospectus screenshot on RPRX Lock-Up Agreement](https://preview.redd.it/yp38tvg9fl461.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&s=47f20ca62d8b8fa96dcc6bd45df12a8e64191407)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: If you compare that $40 option to every single other option volume, something seems sus\n\nEDIT 2: If anyone is more experienced and has insights on secondary offerings, their second prospectus filing date is 10/15. 10/15 + 91 days = 1/14/21. Will this be a second lockup period expiration? I believe that this only applies to later partners who were not in before/during the IPO.\n\nEDIT 3: This stock tanking in the afternoon, maybe in anticipation of Monday + overall market dump. Not sure if the WHALE knew something or it just happened to dump with the S&P. Might not be the best entry point anymore unless you find a bounce.\n\nEDIT4: To feed your confirmation bias, similar DD, same day, same play, different person: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kb57da/royalty\\_pharma\\_rprx\\_lockup\\_expiration\\_final\\_call/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kb57da/royalty_pharma_rprx_lockup_expiration_final_call/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nUPDATE: See a lot of big candles but not back to back.
