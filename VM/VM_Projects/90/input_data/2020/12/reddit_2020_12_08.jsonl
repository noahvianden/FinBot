{"title": "WISH IPO: A giant in the making.", "selftext": "For those of you unfamiliar with the company, wish.com is the third largest e-commerce website in the United States and it has the most-downloaded shopping app in the world. \n\nSince 2018, the company‚Äôs revenue has more than doubled as it has perfected its targeted ad systems that tailors each social media ad to the customer it‚Äôs targeting. This is the reason for the ultra-specific ads you may be familiar with which cater to your profession, hobbies, interest, etc.\n\nAs of now the market is flooded with e-commerce sites like Amazon, which has the logistics market cornered, and Alibaba, which thrives on economies of scale. Wish.com brings its own unique benefit to the market, and that is in its proprietary ad-targeting algorithm, which operates similarly to the blockbuster app TikTok in providing content which targets the specific needs of the buyer.\n\nI believe this factor alone sets Wish ahead of most of the e-commerce marketplace and could place them in the top three holders of global market share by 2025. \nIn an inescapable age of information, information will continue to be the most valuable tool in securing buyers, and Wish has everyone beat in that department as of now.\n\nI see this as an opportunity to get in on an Amazon or \nAlibaba initial offering. \n\nBefore I go any further, I believe I should highlight that this is *NOT* a meme stock and it‚Äôs not more empty promises as we‚Äôve seen in recent mergers and IPO‚Äôs. I think this is best evidenced by the players involved in this offering. The management of this company are not from retail backgrounds and this is not a retail company. At least not exactly. CEO Peter Szulczewski is an engineer from Google who **wrote the algorithm** for keyword search expansion. After leaving Google, he wrote an algorithm that analyzes browsing behavior to determine buying interests. When he realized how effective this algorithm was at suggestive selling, he put together a team including Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang. All this is to say that Wish is not just a retail company.\n\n**Wish.com‚Äôs main product is not goods‚Äî it‚Äôs buyers**\n\nI see the most difficult hurdle for Wish to cross as supply chain logistics. Since independent sellers can list items on the marketplace, questionable practices often take place with regard to quality of goods and shipment. Wish has made advancements with regard to shipping including and agreement between China Post and the USPS, but they are way behind Amazon in their shipping infrastructure. This is in part due to their reputation as a low-cost marketplace preventing them from investing in high-cost shipping. This issue will need to be resolved for them to become competitive on a global scale.\n\nLastly, Wish has established itself not only as a major player in the global market but as a stock that is here to stay. Reinvestments into infrastructure, alongside groundbreaking advancements in the science of targeting advertisements puts Wish on the forefront of global commerce. The foundation is there, but the company has tremendous shoes to grow into.  \n\nHere‚Äôs my prediction for the stock:\n\nI believe the initial public offering will be the largest of this year, AirBNB included. I think as the funds become available, and if their worldwide shipping and customer service infrastructure are improved sufficiently, Wish could see a swift rise to become a household with few peers in market capitalization. Potentially one of the next trillion-dollar market cap stocks. I will be investing heavily at IPO.

This post is for the majority of you dumbasses who FOMO'ed and bought calls at the top and panic sold at the pullbacks, or those who bought calls at market close.\n\nFOMO is one of the strongest human emotions and is the reason why 99% of retail traders get chewed up by the institutions. When you see a meme stonk pumping like TSLA you will have the urge to buy calls AFTER it has already gone up. Admit it. This urge is stronger than:\n\n* The urge to eat when you're fasting.\n* A heroin addict's will to do anything to get that next hit.\n* The urge to masturbate when your wife withholds sex with you, but she's banging her boyfriend Chad instead.\n* A Karen's urge to launch a complaint and ask to speak to the store manager.\n\nWhat you're supposed to do is have a binary requirement after a stock goes up and is everextended:\n\n* Wait for a pullback to a previously established support level to go long.\n\n\\-or-\n\n* No trade\n\nMost traders CANNOT follow this easy set of binary rules.
