For Tesla automotive *alone* to warrant such a valuation, Tesla would need a similar market share.\n\nExcept they would in fact need a larger market share, because there are strong indications that BEVs last significantly longer and require less (highly profitable) maintenance, so the automotive business will most likely shrink, and one of its biggest cash cows is draining out. In addition, new vehicle types like electric scooters and electric bikes will probably further reduce automotive demand. So Tesla would most likely need to capture more like 10 % of the global market share of *all cars* in order to motivate the current valuation.\n\nAnd that's only if Tesla will be able to do so at a 100 % certainty. If you admit there is a 30 % chance of failure, then the required payoff needs to go up by at least that amount. (I think that estimate is pretty low)\n\nAnd also, that estimate does not take time into account. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar ten years from now, because of compound interest. If Teslas rise to full dominance takes five years, that's a 40 % value reduction if one ssumes that the alternative cost is an investment with an average yearly value increase of 7 %.\n\nAll in all, Tesla would need something like a 40 % market share with a 30 % chance of failure within five years to justify the current valuation. Looking at only the car side, I think that's too high. There are simply too many vehicle types, and too many price segments within each vehicle type for Tesla to be able to cover the market within a few years. We're talking about something like 100 different models to get decent coverage.\n\nBut, if you instead accept that Tesla with their current rate of pushing out new vehicle models could potentially put out as many vehicles as Toyota does today in a few years, but they might also capture 20 % of the semi truck market, they might fully replace peaker plants, they might find an ever increasing market for home energy storage, etc...
