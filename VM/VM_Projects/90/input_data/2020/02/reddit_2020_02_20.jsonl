{"title": "Semiconductors for Dummies (TL;DR buy TSM $65C 4/17)", "selftext": "Alright fellow autismos listen up. If the beer virus doesn't tank the market this is freest money you will ever see. Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on three companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lSB6Psm.png\n\nGlobal Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US. Though Samsung did just recently win over Qualcomm, they will be splitting this deal with TSMC. Samsung also sells chips to IBM, but those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes, not for consumers. Samsung mostly focuses on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is in a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the world's largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Literally can't go tits up. Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earnings on April 16th and option prices are ripe. Go get them tendies boiz.\n\nIn short, TSMC splitting QCOM 5nm with Samsung. TSMC locked in 5nm A14 Bionic for AAPL, 7nm Big Navi for AMD, and 7nm Ampere for NVDA. They are also expanding rapidly to meet the rising global demand for chips. PS5 and Xbox Series X chips are also produced by them. They are selling chips faster than they can make them.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention Huawei is about to surpass Apple to become TSMCs biggest customer. Also TSMC and Global Foundries were in a patent feud for a while that was locking both companies up. They have decided to call a patent truce and won't have to worry about any restrictions for the next decade.\n\nPositions: https://i.imgur.com/hTla19a.jpg\n(will buy more when I transfer funds from vanguard)", "id": "f6k556", "created_utc": 1582157515.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": ".45 cents per contract and legitimate DD?
