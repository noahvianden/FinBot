Probably the broker goes momentarily short the shares at that price to Joe and then books the cover buy immediately after in the after hours market. \n\nThis is just one of a million ways this stuff happens.

Everything I said before still applies. It’s not originally what it was meant for, but that is what after hours trading has also become used for.

You and another person can place the same market order at the same time and end up with wildly different prices. You can place limit trades that get traded through and not get executed. Many trades are negotiated off exchange (this is true during market hours too, but those trades are still held to the NBBO quote where as in after hours they are not). Liquidity can be sparse and movement in both directions is rapid and not necessarily reflective of a price in a competitive market. If you do see a quoted price from someone, they are not necessarily obligated to execute with you if you try to trade against it. There are plenty of situations where after hours trading is up, but when normal market hours resume the actual competitive price is down (or vice versa). That perceived benefit is not always there. \n\nYes of course people can benefit from after hours trading. All I’m saying is understand what you are signing up for when you do.
