Once the LiION battery technology was developed, they could have latched onto it and started getting that economies of scale going to drive the prices down.\n\nBut they didn't.\n\nThe only real part of the Tesla cars that needed 12-15 year old mobile device technology for would be the navigation, autopilot, etc... But the electronics and powertrain technology has been around for a very long time - it just needed to be used to be developed.\n\nLegacy auto makers kept building really ho-hum cars.

They've had a few decades to really embrace technology and point the industry toward a better future rather than just the future with the best short-term profits. And they didn't. They consistently didn't.\n\nMaybe it's a huge flaw in Capitalism itself. Once you get to a certain point as a corporation, your mindset changes from innovation to appealing to consumers. So in order to get real innovation, you must wait for a new company to come along.

They responded by threatening to raise prices on other controllers they supply to us in other products seen as mission critical for our company.

An example outside of the automotive business that I've seen of this is that AMD used to fabricate their own silicon chips, but in 2009 things were going bad so they had to sell of their fabs and spun it off as GlobalFoundries. GlobalFoundries used to only make AMD's stuff but if someone was going to buy it as its own thing, then they wanted some insurances there was actually going to be any customers after AMD left. \n\nThe contract AMD signed said that they could only buy wafers from GF as long as GF could meet their demand. This really screwed over AMD because GloFo was dropping the ball with their latest nodes and there was other suppliers, like TSMC that offered way better products, but AMD's products suffered because they were locked into ordering from GF.
