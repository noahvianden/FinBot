{"title": "The Glue Eater Chronicles: JPOW’s Baby Boomer Bomb", "selftext": "**A Brief Note about my last post:** Judging by the amount of “EAT CRAYONS DICKHEAD” messages I received after my last post, it’s become pretty clear that some of you interpreted my suggestion to have a hedge as “This Reverse Good Will Hunting on WSB told me that I should take out a second mortgage and go all in on puts.” I may have suggested it too early but buddy, with my IQ, you should be impressed that I can floss without supervision. So to those of you that took that approach, I’m sorry if you lost money but I tried to be clear that I’m actually net long and I was worried about a few of you over-leveraged gamblers when I saw that some indicators looked ominous.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The intellectual content in this post is not mine and comes from Raoul Pal, a brilliant mind in macroeconomics that I’ve learned a lot from.\n\n**The Baby Boomer Time Bomb**\n\nThere’s no shortage of conspiracy theories as to why JPOW has taken the most radical steps of any Fed chair ever. In the past few months we’ve seen unprecedented action from powerful institutions and I thought I’d share the most useful perspective I’ve come across in my research so far. So strap on your propeller hat and open a Capri Sun. We’ve got work to do\n\n**Why Does JPOW print so much?**\n\n• Baby Boomers (Age 56-74) are one of the largest and most profitable generation the US has ever known\n\n• In the 70’s, they bid up the demand for goods and services by record numbers\n\n• That demand created the inflationary environment of the 80’s because they were the first generation to take on enormous amounts of debt to increase their standard of living\n\n• The popularity of “pension plans” and passive investing soared and gained a huge following with boomers\n\n• At this same time, credit was made widely available\n\n• For this reason, the boomers who chose to invest began to accumulate an enormous proportion of equities\n\n• The average baby boomer is 64 and planning to retire in the next 5 years\n\n**How do Boomers Affect Me?**\n\n• The simple truth is the millennials don't have the resources to pay into the system for the sustainment of the retirement plans of the boomer generation\n\n• There is a huge amount of supply from boomers and very little demand from millennials\n\n• This is further exaggerated by millennial student debt and the fact that millennials make up a much smaller proportion of the US population than boomers\n\n• At about 2000 the very first of the baby boomers began to retire and had to drain some of their investments to sustain their lifestyle\n\n• Every year we’ve seen an increasing amount of baby boomers retiring but based on age, we will start seeing the mass exodus of retirees between 2020-2030 with the peak in the early 2020’s.\n\n• The issue is most of them can’t afford to retire and maintain their current standard of living because they have too much debt. The wide availability of credit gave the illusion to many that they could afford more than what they really were able to.\n\n• The estimated amount needed per individual retiree in the US for disposable income is 44,000 a year but the average benefits from US pensions/retirement plans are predicted to only generate 23,000 per year per individual.\n\n• Assuming life expectancy remains the same, the “average” retiree can afford to drain 9,000 every year from their savings.\n\n• Therefore your average retiree needs at least 44,000 to meet their yearly needs and only has 31,000 available to do it and the situation is even worse for most boomers because these numbers are heavily skewed by the 1% of boomers that have huge store holds of wealth.\n\n**Why is JPOW Worried About my Mom?**\n\n• You may have heard that baby boomers (average age 64) own 46% of US equites, the highest proportion of equities by far when compared to any other generation. The tragedy is it is the top 1% of baby boomers own the majority and most boomers are not in a position to be able to retire.\n\n• Because retirees are now living longer than ever, they need to stretch the amount they have saved/invested to last longer. This is not their fault at all. The issue is assets that offer more stability such as bonds don’t offer enough return for them to survive.\n\n• This has led to an ultra-high portfolio concentration (80%) in assets that are considered far more risky like stocks. The baby boomers of today have the highest level of portfolio risk that the world has ever seen.\n\n• That is at least one reason we have an extremely overvalued market\n\n• No metric is perfect but the Price/Earnings ratio is the highest in recorded history. So is the market cap /GDP ratio.\n\n• That means that the recession we are currently in is coinciding with the exact point that the largest amount of baby boomers are beginning to retire. Right now the retirement fund of boomers holds 70% of their net worth and 80% of that is invested in stocks. A crash will utterly destroy their net worth.\n\n**The Disinflationary Dragon**\n\n• Retirees normally spend significantly less because they are concerned about stretching their dollar for the rest of their lifespan.\n\n• This means that at the same time most boomers are selling their stock to fund their daily needs they will be cutting the amount that they are willing to spend on consumer goods.\n\n• This is a deflationary force and when multiplied by the fact that boomers are the majority of the population that own investments and that they are extremely concentrated in risky assets, we are staring down the barrel of the largest deflationary force in economic history.\n\n• This is why the Fed wants to “run inflation hot” and take unprecedented action to prop up asset prices. If the Fed lets nature take its course, the baby boomers will see that they are the ultimate bag-holders and will race for the exit, demolishing the hope for retirement of the largest American generation.\n\n**Summary for my Fellow Glue-Eaters:** The Fed can’t stop Quantitative Easing because if they do, the average 401K and pension will crumble. Millennials can’t afford equities at these ultra-high valuations so there’s not enough demand to combat the tidal wave of supply about to reach shore. When JPOW tried to raise interest rates in 2018, he stopped immediately because he caught his first glimpse of this ugly-ass disinflationary monster. JPOW spends every waking hour of the day printing because when he dreams at night, all he can see are those soulless disinflationary eyes staring back at him. He’s backed into a corner.\n\n**What does this mean for me?** A lot of you are probably young and willing to take on stupid amounts of risk like me so that you don’t die a slow cubicle death. The truth is I have no idea what asset class offers the most promise for the near future but you can bet your last juicebox that I’m going to keep my eyes open with what JPOW is up to and make posts with what I learn. If you guys have any ideas better than UUP calls for when shit gets froggy someday, let me know. In the mean time, I think having a hedge is not a bad idea.\n\nGood luck my brothers.\n\n**TLDR:** Your mom is a bag holder. JPOW is trying to be her white knight because our generation doesn’t have the cash to do it.
