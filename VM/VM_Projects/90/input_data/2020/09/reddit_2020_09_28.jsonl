The dealer turns over another face card and would have lost yet again, you have now left over $800 on the table in two hands.  \n\nOn the final hand, the dealer shows an ace and you with all the money you have being bet, are showing a 4-2.  You hit twice and bust.  The dealer takes your money without ever giving you a third chance to run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why trading in a lot of ways is more deceptive than actual gambling.  In a casino, you put the money down and wait to see what happens.  There's no scenario where the casino will pay you a fraction to walk away early aka scalping.  \n\nWhen you put up the $245 for the TGT call you never told yourself I'll be happy if I get up 43%.  You probably didn't tell yourself anything.  **I'd strongly recommend swing trading with options by ivanoff**.

Absolute black and white rules that cannot be broken.  The casino lets you make the bet anytime, but they have a real consistent edge before you ever get to place a chip down.\n\nWhen you're betting with options, you better be sure you're trading an A+ setup.  Buying outright calls in this heightened volatility will only work when you have a real edge that can be used properly in this environment.  But what you just described was not that.  \n\nThe issue with ignoring this is eventually your early punt turns out to be the wrong idea, and then you hit the normal drawdown without any of the upside cushion you would have had if you held your winners longer.  \n\nDon't ask others for when to take profit--track trades yourself and determine that.  Options are the most sophisticated instrument many traders will ever use, and they're doing so with zero F's given, much to their later regret.  \n\nI'd strongly suggest focusing on what your strategy is, and why options benefit it, and then the profit can start to take care of itself.  But what you described is something that will not work long term, and I hope I'm convincing you to stop and reassess while you still can.    \n\n\nIf you're unsure where to start, ask yourself if your strategy works well when trading equities instead of options.  Buying outright direction only increases the returns of the strategy, so if your strategy isn't strong enough, start looking at past winners and go from there.
