It’s not sexy but it’s pretty impressive. This will no doubt be revolutionary.

They said that a lot of their manufacturing involved proprietary alloys that makes the battery *part* of the infrastructure of the cars and in order to do that, it requires the invention of new alloys. Definitely a buy. Tesla is going to explode in 2-10 years time. Not easy for the day trader but that gives me a lot of confidence. Just increased my stake by 10-15% on this battery day news alone. Sold before battery day and bought a lot of the heavy dip yesterday and today.

Not to mention the proliferation of battery tech in general (from appliances to hand held electronics to transportation systems and photo voltaics) is going to be a big eater of aluminum.\n\nIt’s possible that a lot of it will come from recycled sources as is the case with Apple. But I think the maturation of the EV market still has a way to go and improved battery tech will necessitate aluminum utilization.\n\nAlso it’s fair to say that actual valuation doesn’t matter anymore. People will become aware of the use of aluminum by companies like Tesla and that will push the market up.\n\nI mean, look at GameStop. Do you really think it deserves a 100 point gain in the last couple of Months? No. It doesn’t. But older folk just see “game” in the name of the stock and click BUY because they hear a new console is coming out. Just completely devoid of sense. I also think that the gains in photo voltaic make sense but does it warrant 400-3000% increases that we’ve seen? No. It doesn’t. It won’t stop people from dumping into it. I don’t blame the retail investor. I blame dumbass micro firms that are outdated and don’t understand what they’re investing in fully.\n\nI also blame straight up crooked inside investing. It’s so obvious that the SEC is not doing their job. Why is congress and the senate given a pass? All you have to do is look at the volume of trades to realize that there is rampant pump and dump schemes within every stock. It’s infuriating. It makes it hard to win as a small time investor. But thankfully idiots exist everywhere and they are concentrated in the older demographics.\n\nIf you want another easy win just buy Facebook. Anyone over 40 doesn’t understand that they are more than just a social media platform. They *will* be the face of AR and VR. Point blank. Do you really believe that this paradigm of existence will stay here forever? That TV screens will just get bigger and phones more powerful? No. No it won’t. We will evolve past the need for a phone and Facebook will make that a reality in 5-10 years. Apple is also making a stake in that department as well. I’ve read the patents. I’ve followed it as someone with a background in human biology and CS. It’s obvious. The new chip designed to replace Airdrop to be used for AirTags will be what powers the Apple glasses slated for launch in 2022.\n\nApple is a buy. Facebook is a buy. Tesla is a buy.\n\nAnd there are a few others that I can easily say to invest in. I believe Elon mentioned utilizing silicon for the batter development. There may be some value in seeing how to factor this into your portfolio. But the future is obvious. I also think there is some value in investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology despite Nikola’s failures. This tech was big back in 2007 and before batteries had the capacity that Tesla is pioneering, it made a lot more sense. It’s not too late for that paradigm to make sense for transportation.\n\nAnd lastly, you should really be investing for the inevitable impact of climate change. Who is factoring in climate change? There are some serious winners here.\n\nBeyondMeat is a good company to consider making part of your portfolio.\n\nIt’s hard to say (or for me to say) who is behind hurricane proofing and water proofing home technologies, but I think a bet in these companies makes a lot of sense. AT&T claims that they are investing long term factoring climate change into their decision making but I just don’t believe that. AT&T has failed in many ways over the last 3 years and I have no confidence in their decision making. The purchase and utilization of HBO Max is a last stitch effort to not get left behind.\n\nVerizon makes more sense. But who is really innovating on the front of internet and entertainment? I don’t know. Maybe you can help me answer that question.\n\nI placed huge bets on Roku and have won 30%+ gains because it’s obvious they will own the distribution platform for as long as TVs aren’t replaced by VRs.

Things come in paradigm shifts. You don’t seriously think that hand held cell phones are gonna exist like this forever do you? That’s silly.\n\nThings leapfrog.
