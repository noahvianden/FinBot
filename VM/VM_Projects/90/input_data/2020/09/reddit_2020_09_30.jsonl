{"title": "$BWMX DD: Growth at a MORE Than Reasonable Price! Largest Position I've Ever Taken", "selftext": "I will keep this analysis brief and let the quality of the play speak for itself. Please DM or comment with questions.\n\n**Intro**\n\n$BWMX is a Mexican provider of home goods. It utilizes a direct-to-consumer model to sell its products (read: MLM). While Reddit may be against MLMs, they often have success as business models. One famous example that Ackman could tell you about is Herbalife. EDIT: IF YOU ARE AN ESG INVESTOR DO NOT READ FURTHER. \n\nI am long $BWMX for three reasons. First, it is fundamentally undervalued, given its current financial performance. A normalization of P/E to a more appropriate multiple should yield an upside of at least 50%, with 100% being a reasonable longer term target (I will expand on this later). Second, $BWMX enjoys two Covid-19 related headwinds, which have been creating a flywheel. Evidence of continued flywheel momentum is mounting every day. Finally, there are a large number of incentives for management to behave appropriately, and help $BWMX capitalize on the potential from these prior two factors. I will discuss each of these reasons in turn, from last to first.\n\n**Management**\n\nThe company is largely family operated, with Andre Campos serving as CEO, and brother Luis Campos serving as chairman of the board. There is significant insider ownership, aligning the interests of the Campos brothers with shareholders. Institutions own only 1% of the float, which is only 2 million shares (this is an oversimplification which I address later, but understand that this is a low-float company by any measure). In effect, the company is run by an owner-operator. The management team has extensive experience as they’ve been growing $BWMX or similar companies for years. All of this is important, given the fact that overseas companies are often written off due to their opacity; this is not a shell company or one without direction. Here are brief write ups of key executives:\n\n* **Andres Campos – CEO & Board Member**: CEO (2018-2020); Commercial Director of Betterware (2014-2018); Strategy and New Businesses Director of Betterware (2012-2014)\n* **Luis Campos - Chairman**: Prior to Betterware, Luis Campos served as: Chairman of Tupperware Americas (1994-1999); Chairman of Sara Lee – House of Fuller Mexico (1991-1993); Chairman of Hasbro Mexico (1984-1990)\n* **Jose del Monte – CFO**: Regional Director of Banco Regional de Monterrey (2007-2019); Founding Partner of  Geltung Asesores (2001-2007); Corporate Banking Regional Director of Banca Serfín (1996-2001)\n* **Martin Werner – CEO & Chairman of DD3 Acquisition Corp / Board Member**: Co-founder of DD3 Capital Partners. Partner at Goldman Sachs (2006-2016); Co-Head of Investment Banking for LatAm; Managing Director at Goldman Sachs (2000-2006)\n\nNote that Martin Werner oversaw the reverse merger transaction which saw $BWMX listed on the NASDAQ.\n\n**Flywheel**\n\nManagement has recently been extremely successful at creating a flywheel effect during Covid-19. First, demand for homegoods and cleaning supplies (which are $BWMX’s primary offerrings) has dramatically risen. This can be seen in Google Trends data for \"cleaning products\" or “[home goods](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=home%20goods).\"\n\nFurther evincing this demand spike are the dramatically increasing viewership numbers on Betterware’s Youtube videos. For those who don’t know, the company releases monthly “Catalogos”, detailing new additions to the product offering. Consider the consistent increase in viewership for these successive releases:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TMFBlpJ](https://imgur.com/a/TMFBlpJ)\n\nCatalogo 8 will soon be far and away the most viewed release, considering it was released just one week ago. Management has commented on this demand spike, saying:\n\n*“And I think that this situation of COVID-19 came to accelerate our process to convince people about the importance of cleaning and organization at home. Then we believe that this is something that will remain. People now are more conscious about cleaning and organization, and we are the right providers for that.”*\n\nOf course, it’s hard to know whether this will be a permanent lifestyle shift, but as part of my research I’ve spoken to several Mexican friends who have mentioned that Betterware is increasingly popular and an increasing household name.\n\nPart of that is also due to the other half of the flywheel: the increasing number of Betterware representatives who are selling the company’s products as a means to diversify their income stream / earn after having been laid off. To again quote from the earnings call:\n\n*“And obviously, during the pandemic and during the COVID-19, our growth came mainly from growth in associates and distributors. So these are people that have joined our business, that have joined our model and we expect to remain being part of the model and continue growing from there.”*\n\nEssentially, we have an MLM model where the product is actually in high demand, and there is a corresponding rise in sellers as people diversify income streams due to the pandemic. However, the pandemic has only accelerated this effect, which was already occurring. This is crucial, because it means that we are not simply seeing demand be pulled forward; see below.\n\n**Financials**\n\nThe company’s financials speak for themselves and demonstrate that we are seeing acceleration augmenting already strong performance (note that I’ve put the financials below in millions of USD). I’d encourage everyone to play around with the numbers themselves and do their own forecasting. I’ve been highly conservative here, and have simply forecasted revenue, etc. based on down-ward rounded straight line average performance (so this is not even accounting for Covid-19 tailwinds):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||2017|2018|2019|2020E|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$73.7|$117.90|$163.10|$227.50|\n|Gross Profit|45.3|69.1|95.40|133.07|\n|EBITDA|18.1|29.4|44.30|61.79|\n|Net Income|10.6|15.2|25.00|34.87|\n|EPS|.32|.50|.83|1.33|\n\nAs you can see, the company is trading at 2.8x sales or 14x EPS with these conservative estimates. But adjusting more reasonably for Covid-19, it’s more like 2.5x sales or 12x P/E. Those are numbers you might expect to pay for a solid company in an industry like Insurance or Auto Parts—not a rapidly growing company in an emerging market. Making the mispricing of $BWMX even more apparent is the fact comparable MLM companies universally *have declining YoY EBITDA*. Many of them enjoy comparable or higher multiples, and yet they are money losers, while $BWMX is printing FCF:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/h3SdWci](https://imgur.com/a/h3SdWci)\n\nThe most comparable company is Natura and Co.—they’re growing revenue at a comparable rate—but they trade at a ridiculous P/E of 183.4. Essentially, BWMX is an industry leader, is a beneficiary of Covid-19, and yet is being treated like mature industrial stock. This is not to mention other initiatives, such as the company’s increased focus on digital marketing and its successful trial expansion into Guatemala (Google the earning’s call to learn more).\n\n**Discovery**\n\nThere are several reasons why $BWMX has not yet been efficiently priced. The most obvious is the low float. After all, it’s scarcely worth it for an institution to begin a position at this point, because there are so few shares available. However, with an increasing number of warrants expanding the share count there will be ample room for the fairer pricing that comes with institutional attention (Note: the warrants, $BWXMF, are also severely mispriced). With full warrant conversion, we could see an additional 4.5 million shares and institutional entry. I talk more about the pros and cons of this in the “Risks” section.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, there is *no* sell-side coverage for the stock. As we’ve seen time and time again, sell-side coverage is responsible for massive price movements and price discovery. For instance, NIO recently jumped 5% on a bullish report from DB.\n\nFinally, the company hasn’t been around for very long. It was created through a reverse merger with a S.P.-A.-C. (formatting to avoid Auto-mod), which means that most people simply haven’t heard of it. If you check the Stocktwits message board (I know, I know, Stocktwits…) you’ll see that it has under 200 followers, which I’m using as a rough proxy for market following.\n\nI believe that the company will not go undiscovered for long for three reasons. First, the market, while not perfectly efficient by any means, is not *this* inefficient. I’m seeing increasing chatter on social media about this ticker, which is actually meaningful in terms of discovery, since many institutional bigwigs are on Fintwit. Secondly, earnings are right around the corner (in early November), and it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore a company putting up the financials of $BWMX if they do so for several consecutive quarters.\n\nFinally, the company itself is aware of the fact that it’s undervalued, and has committed to better IR. Per the last earnings call:\n\n“I mean, as you said before, we just listed on March 16 (sic) \\[13\\], a few months ago. We are strengthening our strategy in order to have more activity in this regard in the future. In fact, beginning in September, you will see more and more activity from our side because we really want (inaudible) \\[our investors\\] to know us very well, to understand what our business model represents and to be confident about our consistency in terms of growth and profitability.”\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe main risks for the company are geo-political and legal. First, given the nature of MLMs, such companies are often subjected to unfavorable changes in the law. I don’t know enough about Mexican MLM law to comment further, but my expectation is that—because it’s Mexico—regulations are relatively lax. Still, this is an undeniable risk.\n\nThe geo-political risk is obvious. Given that this is a foreign company listed on the NASDAQ, it’s entirely possible that they’ll face the ire of Trump. And further, USD/Peso currency fluctuations will have a noticeable impact on financial results. As a $BWMX investor, you’ll want a strong peso.\n\nAnother thing worth discussing is the possibility of dilution. There exist warrants trading under $BWXMF which have a dividend-protected strike price of $11.50 (so, effectively, $10 with the current dividend). When and if these are tendered, they will increase the float by \\~4.5 million shares. This could be good for institutional involvement, but it obviously will not be good from a pure supply / demand perspective. In fact, I’m confident that the recent dip is at least somewhat attributable to people cashing in some of their warrants. However, I think that conversion will occur slowly, because the potential of the company is so obvious. I could also see an activist investor buying up warrants and challenging any tender offer that occurs. If a tender offer *does* occur, you should see 30% upside or more on the warrants immediately (which is actually a risk, because I think that’s still undervaluing them).\n\nOf course, all of the regular risks—such as a new market entrant or a failure to monetize their distribution network—apply. But the above two risks are the ones which I believe could serve to significantly limit upside.\n\nYet, given the ridiculous valuations in U.S. equities, I’d be remiss if I didn’t say that the risk / reward here seems favorable.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver time, $BWMX will be more fairly priced, assuming that it continues to perform. It’s hard to assign a price target, but if it maintained the pace of its revenue growth, this would be at least a bagger in a year or two. The upside will be realized through continued financial performance accelerated by the Covid-19 flywheel, and catalyzed by discovery and improved IR communication. The risks are mainly legal and geo-poltical in nature. I’d encourage everyone to strongly consider $BWMX, and I am long.\n\n*Disclaimer: I have a large position in $BWMX.

So if people from *here* cannot be bothered to use the app, use delivery, and use curb side pickup?—then what the fuck makes you think your 300lb, syphilitic aunt is gonna be any different?\n\nWhat you fail to understand is that this simply will not work. Google shopping express who offers much better technology and user interface, fucking failed miserably! And they had millions of sign ups. You know why? Because 3 months of free delivery.\n\nWalmart is doing the same fucking garbage. Free couple months of delivery. Hell even I signed up. But at $100 a year? That’s the same fucking price of amazon. And amazon has cheaper prices and a wider selection and a smaller delivery window. The people here take this virus seriously unlike people in hick states. So the people here *want* contactless delivery. Do you really people think people in your “target demographics” take the virus seriously enjoy to pay $100 to enjoy delivery? No. They’re going to go to Walmart like normal because it’s the only store in town. They’ll be giving away their one errand.\n\n**I know this. Because I used to live in a small southern, hick town for 18 years.**\n\nHave *you* ever used an app by Walmart? I have. They suck asshole. It makes you wish you could find the POS app developer that agreed to make that garbage and slit their throats personally for giving you such headache.\n\n**Walmart is not a tech company. Say it with me: *”Walmart is not a tech company”***\n\nThey do not know how to create an app, how to create a usable website, how to handle delivery logistics, or how to train their employees (who are much older) to handle delivery logistics and use technology to track orders.\n\nLook. I hate Amazon too. They’re an evil company. Yes they’re evil. But they’ve whipped the ass of everyone till this date.\n\nWill Walmart continue to be a competitor? Yes.\n\nOf course walmart will continue to be a competitor because of anti-trust laws. Amazon cannot be the only provider in the world. But, will Walmart dominate a large percentage of the field? Nope. It won’t. Because it’s already lost a lot of it’s grip *to* Amazon. Have you been living under a rock for the last 5 years or is your dumbass some 15 year old who has never left mommy’s house until 2019?\n\n***Go ahead and make whatever stupid decisions you will. You’re of course retarded like the rest of us. Why else would you be here in this subreddit.***\n\nBut—you will get no sympathy from me when your asshole gets fucked over by your aggressive calls. I’ve been down this road many times. Walmart does *not* have what is necessary to succeed against Amazon on an apples-to-apples comparison of services. They can differentiate in the market and compete differently. Maybe only in terms of produce. But direct amazon competitor? Haha, get real fuckwad.\n\n**If your arrogant enough to believe that the Bay Area doesn’t have huge Walmart’s used by millions of people—** then you’re retarded enough to lose your life savings on Walmart calls.\n\n**TL:DR** *get rekt you retarded momma’s boy and enjoy losing tendies on your aggressive calls. Try a fucking google search on “Walmart’s in the Bay Area” before you talk out of your anus and get us all dirty with your shitty assumptions.*", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Is Walmart a stonk?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": " Jan 22 145 calls here", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can’t, already going home with the cocktail waitress (TGT)\n\nEdit:  11/10c $200 TGT", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "More like $AMZN", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks I got a nice visual and realized i've been in quarantine long enough that I'm really stoked to fuck wallmart", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "quality dd", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Walmart+ is actually doing crazy good out of the gate.
