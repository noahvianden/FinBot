{"title": "73k in NFLX PUTS (exp 9/11)!!! PLEASE HELP!!", "selftext": "I started this account (not my first account) with a $5k bazooka last week of instant deposit with robinhood gold .. I went for AMD puts making 80k and cashing out my original 5k. Then as NFLX was falling under 500$ I went for NFLX puts on friday (460 strikes) based on the notion it ran up from 490 to 540$ for no reason on 8/26 (Maybe after news about releasing \"Cuties\").\n\nNeedless to say even when it rose causing my account to go down to $20k i still held and now have $6k which will probably be $1k by tomorrow based on Theta decay. It broke 500$ again yesterday, falling when all the other tech stocks had recoveries. AH it came above it, so I think if the market is falling, this would probably be the best FAANG stock to go for, cause it's the only one of the five not diversified enough into several revenue streams.\n\nAlso fell on 7/16 earnings cause of over-saturation of the market. With DIS+ and mulan, AZMN prime with the Boys, HBO Max with JS Snyder's Cut, and Hulu with South Park... why is NFLX still priced like it has room to grow?\n\n(P.S. I use my aunts subscription so I don't pay for Netflix)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waigohvmq9m51.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=6792622c57a26bfc62698c48448856a318e1482a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krdrvx3gq9m51.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfeb954f7fba999fd256b3b01752028fd2cb94a0", "id": "ipyiuc", "created_utc": 1599721714.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR: this retard bet a bunch and lost", "score": 214, "replies": [{"body": "He went full retard.
