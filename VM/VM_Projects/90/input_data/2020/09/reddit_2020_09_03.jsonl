Except ... not.\n\nIn reality if your goal was a 100% return and you hit it and someone else thought they could make a 20% return which was their goal you both win with each seller taking on new risk but also relative return.

For instance if I sell you something and you give me cash for it but I bought that something for less and then you sell the same something for more than you bought it for you didn't lose anything and I didn't lose anything and it is very possible in this value chain that no one for quite some time loses anything in the tactile sense.\n\nThere is a single \"loser\" in this chain, in a sense, however. Yes, someone does have to buy the top.\n\nE: By the way there is an complex relationship between taking losses and trading. For instance selling something you do not want or need anymore for less than it's value is still a value play; if I want to free up my cash to buy calls in XYZ and I'm willing to take a 10% loss to do it in ABC you're actually doing me a favor by taking it.

You stop being paranoid that anyone is out to get you because they aren't and you learn to set the limits that allow you to succeed; if your exit every trade were dedicated at the price equal to or better than your target goal you'll hit it more often than not trying to \"fleece the market\".
