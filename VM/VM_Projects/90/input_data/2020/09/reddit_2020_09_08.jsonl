Note the DIX increased  aggressively near the lowest point of each correction\\/pullback.](https://preview.redd.it/wic5n5uv90m51.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=571c724bed4d618e38fcab8ce40f0be25a4970e0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe  DIX is currently at 39%, up from a low of 35%. At each of the previous  market bottoms marked by darkpool buying in the figure above, the DIX  was from left to right: 47.7%, 48.2%, 45.5%, 45.3%, and 40.6%. This  suggests if the DIX were to rise into the mid 40% range, we should  expect a market reversal.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nLooks  like the market has pulled back to it's 50 day sma for both major indexes  as well as most of the large cap and tech stocks. This behavior is  common during market recoveries throughout history. The increase in  darkpool buying supports the idea that we are either at the bottom of  this dip, or nearing it, based on historical DIX numbers during pull  backs and corrections. This is encouraging, perhaps its time to start looking for entries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick edit for you goobers - wait for confirmation that the 50 sma holds. Breaking below it is bad news.\n\nEdit 2: Confirmation of a bounce is often thought of as the first day to open and close above the 50 sma. Some like to see more, or specific reversal candle patterns as well. It is likely the job opens report that comes out Wednesday morning at 10am est, or the unemployment claims on Thursday, could be the catalysts to drive a bounce. For those that want to monitor confirmation to the down side, this is often viewed as the first 1 day candle to open and close below the 50 sma, and if the job openings data and unemployment claims report are shit, expect more down side.\n\nEdit 3: also note the vix is starting to come down a little as well.
