You're right too that it varies a lot by industry, but I think of OCF like I would for loaning money to a friend. If you have a friend who lives paycheck to paycheck and comes to you asking for $10k, and swears they'll pay it back within 6 months, would you loan them the money? Same thing with a big company ... companies that burn cash will eventually run out, or their debt will come due and they'll be unable to pay it, or will be forced to sell more stock to raise cash, all of which can be devastating to share price. There are obviously a million other factors to consider but OCF is a really good thing to pay attention to because it represents the cash a company makes from *actually running the company* ...
