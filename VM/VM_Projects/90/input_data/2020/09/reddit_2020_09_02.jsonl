Walmart is an absolute giant and the fact that they're going to use their infrastructure to compete with amazon prime is huge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are a couple stats to give you autists the scale of what's going on here:\n\n**Employees**\n\n|Amazon|840,400|\n|:-|:-|\n|Walmart|1,500,000 (US only)|\n\n**2019 Revenue**\n\n|Amazon|$280.52B|\n|:-|:-|\n|Walmart|$514.4B|\n\n**2020 Q2 Revenue\\***\n\n|Amazon|$88.91B|\n|:-|:-|\n|Walmart|$137.7B|\n\n\\*Basically walmart is doing fine despite the virus\n\nSo now walmart is now going to use all this infrastructure to go head to head with amazon prime. I have never been to one of their stores in my life because the nearest one is 10 miles from me, now I can get shit delivered to my door on a days notice whenever I want. Not even amazon can ship that broad an inventory on a day's notice without extra fees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd also I'm gonna bet that since they're delivering groceries (again, directly competing with amazon) which is gonna be an \"essential business\" they'll get all kinds of bullshit tax breaks / ppp loans / who the fuck knows. At this point it wouldn't even be that big a deal if trump personally wrote them a check for half a billion dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Getting in tomorrow at open with some 160 calls for sep 18. It's already a hype stock but walmarts just getting started\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlso look at the market caps (amazon $1.75T / walmart $417B) .
