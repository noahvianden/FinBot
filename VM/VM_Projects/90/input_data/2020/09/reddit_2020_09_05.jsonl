{"title": "TSLA inclusion announcement will happen next week w/ effective date after 9/11 close", "selftext": "**NEVER has a \"new to index\" company inclusion into the S&P 500 has EVER been announced two weeks before the effective date. TESLA inclusion announcement will happen next week and effective date after 9/11 market close**\n\nI did the research. Most \"new to index\" inclusion announcements are only given approximately 3-4 days notice and are rarely announced on a Friday. (usually a Tuesday and then the effective date is 3-4 days later.\n\nMost of the \"rebalance\" inclusions (from midcap/small cap to S&P500) are announced separately from \"new to index\" inclusions.\n\nEveryone is freaking out for nothing.\n\nAlso, wouldn't it make sense to withhold the tesla inclusion out of todays announcement so the price would further get reduced.\n\nTLDR: Don't lose your mind following the heard and after hours trading.\n\nTSLA 10/16 500C\n\nBTW, I have a theory that someone is manipulating the after hours stock price by dumping shares to drive the price lower so it will be cheaper to add to the S&P 500 index.\n\nSomeone has been selling EVERY single night after hours this week after the ATM announcement. Why wouldn't they dump the shares with high liquidity during the day? no other reason than to drive the price down... why would they want to drive the price down? Cheaper shares to be indexed on the announcement. Index firms can not purchase shares until it is officially announced so they can not front run and would benefit from a lower share price.", "id": "imrxyb", "created_utc": 1599266899.0, "score": 105, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "Seeing this post as a TSLA bagholder just depressed me", "score": 131, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t need to be reminded of the after-hours drop, or the other drops this week.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Those bags are extra heavy today here too.", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "The stock is up 8x this year.
