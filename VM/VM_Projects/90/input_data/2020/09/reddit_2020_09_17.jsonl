The report you are demanding requires firsthand inspection and costs $350/hour. 😅\n\nYou may want to tone the armchair warrior act back a bit in hobbyist Internet forums— but if you are so keenly interested in the subject, I encourage you to get involved and consider working on crash testing and making cars safer. Your passion for detail is clear.\n\nBut I’m game; I can give you my read of the situation:\n\nThe images show a high-speed small-overlap offset on the driver’s side. 45-50 mph speed differential maybe? On most cars that would rip off the wheel completely, or push the wheel into the occupant space. Neither here, where the wheel is attached, and the wheel itself has self destructed. This is good, and unusual behavior IMO. A lot of wheels I’ve seen are stronger then the car bodies, and often break the car frame and continue into the cabin. Instead here, the wheel acts as part of the crash structure.\n\nThe (black) bumper beam is completely intact, and the (silver) crash rail is not crumpled at all. Unusually, it is bent into the space where an engine would be. Normally, a crash like this would bypass the bumper beam and peel off the whole side of the car and A-pillar, sometimes including the left side of the occupant’s body. Unusual behavior, and the best case scenario.\n\nThe cabin space shows massive amounts of shear and deformation, yet shows no signs of intrusion. The passenger was protected, but the frame mangled in such a way they had to remove the B-Pillar just to get him out of the crushed car body. You can see how the instrument panel and cross car beam are pushed into the occupant space some amount, showing what incredible force the impact had. Interestingly, the Driver door is completely attached (neutral, but shows more frontal small overlap approach angle then a crash at an angle). I would estimate broken legs, or broken ankles at the bare minimum.\n\nI very much hope there are a number of modern cars that meet this level of crashworthiness. For all of our sakes. But I agree with the first responder in that this appears to be a rare scenario where someone survived. The engineering website is into it!
