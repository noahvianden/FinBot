His Q2 chatter led to an increase in price (after the stock split), and long dated calls have returned handsomely.\n\nSo what‚Äôs going to happen on batter day? No one knows, but it is likely that their batteries will be unrivalled and the forecast is $500 09/22.

TSLA is in a high IV environment with an IVR of 55.5 and an IV% of 89.8 respectively. Typically it is not wise to purchase options on an underlying with high IV%. In this case TSLA is 89.9% higher in IV than in the previous 52 weeks (today). The 445 calls for Sept 25th (battery week) are around 41.10. Come battery week, the IV will probably increase into the 90's, making the buy-side of the options relatively more expensive. As traders, we should be looking to buy options in low IV, and sell premium in high IV. \n\nI think the real battery week play here for the Sept 25th expiration would be a long broken wing butterfly.
