But that's basically all this provides us\n\nI've seen an ever increasing amount of traders here that don't trade Theta at all. They're Delta traders that are simply riding the market. That's why we saw so many gains posts before the tech bubble popped, and so many losses after. There's a reason premium sellers maintain a slight negative Delta *even when they know we're in a bull market*, so this type of backtesting is not only incorrect but dangerous", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Now that’s my point. **The sample size being so limited** is the REASON why selling downside skew and being long delta has a positive expected value in the long-term. Because “stonks only go up” and our markets/economy recovers quite fast from recessions/depressions/crashes, in part also due to our government and Fed always stepping in. \n\nBut who cares about the discussion of ethics about the gov stepping. There’s profit to be made anyways, and that’s the only thing a trader should concerned with. Not if he’s right or wrong about the trend.\n\nAnd so the thing is, the reason selling puts and tails/downside skew will always be +EV in the long-term is because yes in fact a majority of the PnL you will get will be from delta or “delta riding” the market.\n\nJust like you know and do agree that for a lack of better words “stonks only go up” for the past decades, it’d be a shame and stupid to not buckle down and reap the profits that come with being long delta and also short skew aka a risk-reversal (long call, short put).\n\nAnd even if you were DELTA HEDGED and chose not to stop going against the grain of our upward drifting markets and miss out on tons of Delta PnL, you will still reap $$$ profits from being short downside skew and implied vol because vol and skew displays autocorrelation and is mean-reverting. \n\nAnd your statement about premium sellers maintaining a slight negative Delta in a bull market? What does that even mean? Who and what are you exactly talking about? There are many premium sellers and buyers all expressing their own views. If someone wants to maintain even a slight negative delta in any timeframe of this market, they will simply get run over and have their account drained to $0. If you just said you’re aware of the fact and do agree with “stonks only go up” so you should know not to maintain a negative delta in a market with upwards drift.\n\nNow if you want to talk about selling premium whilst also protecting yourself against crashes, implied vol and skew expansion, and jump risk to the downside that’s a different story and depends on the intelligence and discretion of the said trader(s) or hedge fund(s).\n\nNow of course the backtest of the OP is not all that advanced at all, but he still made money. And that’s my point. And why he made money? I explained it all above. Either ride the upward drifting time series that is our market, or get ran over by it.\n\nHave a good day and I realize I might’ve come off as a bit hostile at first. Cheers mate.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The reason traders maintain negative deltas is because of the inverse relationship between price and volatility (obviously not everyone does this)\n\nI'm not trying to say you shouldn't be bullish, I don't care what direction you play.

I don't even know what claim OP is making with this post, but trying to convince people they could've made 500% ROC by simply selling ATM put credit spreads every wednesday is *dangerous*.

Well that’s why trading isn’t so cut and dry. \n\nJust recently the negative (inverse) spot price/implied vol covariance relationship broke.\n\nAny trader who had negative deltas and was presumably short gamma/short vega (vol) as well got double whammied when SPY and implied vol both went up in unison.\n\nWe saw $SPY going up, while VIX going up with it and conversely, $SPY down and VIX down.\n\nThat’s why trading successfully is not just a matter of automated  cut and dry strategy.\n\nDitto, I as well only want information on this sub to clear and accurate amongst the barrage of thousands of mind numbing misinformation and obsolete posts by noobs on the Wheel.\n\nAnd yes I did agree with you that the strategy is not advanced. And it is indeed dangerous. But it’s only dangerous without correct position sizing. \n\nSo that’s the thing I’m trying to say... **Even though it’s blindly dangerous**, the thing with selling puts, put spreads, or downside skew regardless of how blatantly stupid and blind it may seem, as I said previously, it will win always win regardless.\n\n**Run a backtest, or as a matter of fact, cash test it. I’ll sell a monthly 50 Delta put and you buy the same one. I will win in the end.**\n\nThe fact that you can take any bullish strategy and show me positive backtest results is my precisely my point. \n\nDon’t underestimate the power of a simple slow trending time series, coupled with cheap convexity to the upside. Statistically, the path dependency is already on your side, so is the favorable asymmetric Risk:Reward payout.\n\nIf the market was a slowly downward trending time series, I’d say all the converse of the above. But it’s not.\n\nI hope you understand the point I keep trying to make. I don’t care about being right, wrong, bullish, or bearish. I care about making money, math, and statistics. And statistically, being long delta vs short delta will always win. Whether that’s through calls or put spreads.\n\nOn the topic of how I personally trade? \n\nLong Vol Dispersion. I’m usually delta-neutral 90% of the time and reaping premium off of indexes, aka mainly vol dispersion. Sell index vol and buy vol in individual names. But I do like to maintain positive deltas and a statistically +EV by selling downside tails. As you can see.\n\nAside from that I’ve purchased a vol fitter from a company that utilizes one of the best Option pricing models in the public domain with 12+ parameters superior to Black-Scholes and SVI.
