{"title": "DD: Time to Buy Boeing and Airlines Calls.", "selftext": "Boeing and airlines are going to the moon next week. Here's why. I kept it short for you low IQ retards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe current financial aid by the federal government for airlines ends October 1st. The airline industry employs just about 10 million people in the US. That's right. ***10 million***. [source](https://www.airlines.org/industry/) This includes not only the airlines themselves but everything involved with it. Aerospace (Boeing), shipping (UPS/Fedex), the oil industry, among many others. If government stimulus isn't passed by October 1st, airlines have stated that they will make furloughs permanent.[source](https://www.nbc4i.com/news/u-s-world/thousands-of-airline-employees-face-furlough-on-oct-1-without-relief-from-congress/)\n\nNot providing funding to the airlines will send the entire economy, the US in particular, and to an extent, the rest of the world, into a tailspin because of it's indirect and direct linkages to almost every industry. For example:\n\n**Airline employees fired =**\n\n* millions of people without money to put back into the economy\n   * every single industry will be affected by this.\n* less flights = less planes being built\n   * airplane manufactures, steel/metal factories, defense companies, will all be affected. do you know how many companies are involved with making planes? it's astounding.\n* less domestic/international flights =\n   * less spending of American money worldwide\n      * other countries will be affected and have a vested interest in this stimulus being passed.\n   * reduced cargo shipping, which affects almost every single business worldwide, with American companies being hit the hardest\n* less airport traffic\n   * food and retail businesses that make money within airports will start to shut down. McDonalds, the coffee stand, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could keep going, but i know you retards have a short attention span. Airlines will be most affected by this, followed by Boeing. Every industry will be affected without stimulus being passed, but by far the stimulus helps Airlines and Boeing directly. Boeing is the lovechild of the republican party as it is a gigantic part of the military. Republicans get rock hard spending more money on the military, so you know they won't let them fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: Boeing 11/20 150C & Jan 21 170C.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: for all you retards saying the stimmy won't happen, look at this: [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/mnuchin-and-pelosi-revive-stimulus-talks-as-democrats-call-for-compromise-bill-before-election/ar-BB19oBOQ?ocid=uxbndlbing](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/mnuchin-and-pelosi-revive-stimulus-talks-as-democrats-call-for-compromise-bill-before-\nelection/ar-BB19oBOQ?ocid=uxbndlbing)\n\nUPDATE: BA awarded a 2bn contract at close. https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Contracts/Contract/Article/2360802//", "id": "iz9c56", "created_utc": 1600993710.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "The GOP has no particular love for any particular military contractor.

Bosch and a dozen others could shit these things out in a few months if they really wanted to and produce them at much larger scale. At the end of the day it’s a pretty basic electrical component that is never going to have huge margins.\n\nSo the only real value is in the network of stations itself. And in that regard they’re already competing against an [Amazon/Ford](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/10/17/ford-introduces-north-americas-largest-electric-vehicle-charting-network.html) partnership committing to 35k units in 12k locations. GM has partnered with EVgo for their network. Tesla’s network is huge in comparison to chargepoint, so you calling chargepoint “the industry leader” is actually retarded. They’re not leading shit, they have less than 2k DC fast charge stations and all of their customers have partnered with other firms. Their main investor is Siemens who afaik does not make any vehicles, they’re just a supplier that grabbed a startup as a lotto ticket to compete with other suppliers and is trying to make a few bucks by taking advantage of the Tesla/EV hype with an IPO. The only thing they’re “leading” is the accelerated deployment of soon to be obsolete slow charging units.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You do realize chargepoint’s network is more than 3x larger than Tesla right? A simple google would have sufficed.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No it’s not, their DC fast charging network isn’t even 1/3 of Tesla’s. You are literally the exact idiot they are trying to trick by hyping up the “size” of their network when their strategy is literally to be the “leader” of the segment of chargers nobody gives a shit about. \n\nThe use case of slow charging is overnight charging at home to achieve maximum charge storage. The use case for public charge stations is to QUICKLY charge a vehicle while the user is away from home. Being the king of public slow charging networks is actually retarded because the network itself will be obsolete by the time EVs are actually a large enough segment for the growth to trickle down to public charge station third parties.\n\nCongrats, you’re buying blockbuster on the news that they just passed on acquiring Netflix.

Most charging occurs at home, work, or at restaurants. Doesnt need DC. The “gas station” type of charging where DC matters is only needed on roadtrips, and Tesla’s fast chargers only work on Tesla. I don’t care if you don’t buy the stock, and I appreciate a bearish argument.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Who cares where charging takes place today? You need to be thinking about where customer expectations will be in a few years. Why do you think OEMs and suppliers are focusing on fast charging instead of competing in this space? Answer: because the future is not slow charging, the future is going up to a fast charging station and inputting a charge time and expecting the charger to adjust output voltage based on that. You can always go lower voltage, but it’s impossible to increase it without sacrificing current or upgrading infrastructure.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You charge an EV like you do a phone: at home, at work etc where fast charging isn’t needed.
