{"title": "Buffett sells 100,000 bank shares and increases stake in gold and Coca-Cola", "selftext": " \n\nThe former largest holder of the American bank Wells Fargo & Co, Berkshire Hathaway Inc of mega-investor Warren Buffett, continues to withdraw money from bank shares.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has sold more than 100 million shares, the equivalent of $ 2.5 billion or more than $ 10 billion since June, according to a report published on Friday. As a result, Warren Buffett's company now owns only 3.3% of Wells Fargo's shares.\n\nThe North American bank reported a big loss in the second quarter of this year, with a negative US $ 2.4 billion. Credit losses and provisions were the causes, but the bank is also involved in scandals.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2016, employees used fraud to meet impossible sales targets. They opened millions of accounts in customer names without their knowledge, hired involuntary account holders for credit cards and bill payment programs, created fake personal identification numbers, forged signatures and even secretly transferred customers' money.\n\n## [Short the banks?](https://read.cash/@SamHamou/buffett-sells-100000-bank-shares-and-increases-stake-in-gold-and-coca-cola-a95715de#short-the-banks)\n\nBut it seems that it‚Äôs not just financial problems or customer treatment that Warren is withdrawing from his favorite bank.\n\nThe investor reduced its stake in Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, PNC, M&T Bank, Mastercard and Visa. While he bought a slice of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold, despite historic criticism of the precious metal.\n\nHowever, Warren has increased his positions in Apple, Coca-Cola and Bank of America. It is speculated that Warren is predicting that the effects of Covid19 will last longer than Wall Street imagined.\n\n>‚ÄúAccumulating money and finding gold mining attractive ‚Äì suggests that he sees the crisis last longer and perhaps worsen before it gets better. No one knows whether this will be the case, but Buffett has his finger on the pulse of the economy through all the various sectors in which Berkshire operates: from freight railways to aircraft parts, insurance policies to car dealerships, building bricks from households and Fruit of the Loom underwear, Dairy Queen industrial chemicals for fast food, jewelery for private jets and more. ‚Äù  \nsays Tara Lachapelle, Bloomberg columnist\n\nBuying more gold-related assets makes a lot of sense in times of crisis, but what is the reason for increasing participation in Coca-Cola? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://read.cash/@SamHamou/buffett-sells-100000-bank-shares-and-increases-stake-in-gold-and-coca-cola-a95715de](https://read.cash/@SamHamou/buffett-sells-100000-bank-shares-and-increases-stake-in-gold-and-coca-cola-a95715de)", "id": "irayy6", "created_utc": 1599910299.0, "score": 155, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "coca-cola: higher sales and growth of bottlet water sales in china maybe", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Dividends?", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "buffet is a longtime KO holder, so he‚Äòs in for dividents already, but the increase on his position could be due to new insights for growth markets as mentioned above", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Got it.
