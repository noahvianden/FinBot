{"title": "Autist Trading with RSI, MACD, and GAP", "selftext": "Alright you Autist,\n\nMy first post on WSB, long live bull gang.\n\nLet’s get to options trading using cool shit like MACD, RSI, and GAP so we can go all in and lose our money together, head to the “Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for 2020 to blow over.” Note: I’m not a pro or a financial advisor, use at your own risk. What I am is a 300lb neckbeard that loves the show Billions, cries at the end of Wolf of Wallstreet, and comments on Pornhub videos. But anyway…I’ll be using AMD due to the bull gang love and CGC cause some autist is giving out wrong info, don’t buy that shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RSI:**\n\nDafuq is RSI? Well…it stands for Relative Strength Index…and Wikipedia says it’s “a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock.” For our purposes here, think of it as just one word, **Momentum**. We can look at the momentum of a stock based on specific criteria, 250 days and 10 days and select times to buy and sell contracts of said stock. This generally works on a 1day – 5minute chart. I like to day trade options, scalp, take my tendies, hit up Wendy’s…dat baconator nawmean. *Find what works best for your trading style*.\n\n\\*RSI | 250-day Indicator\\*\n\nThink of this as the “overall” momentum of the stock.  RSI is used for overbought/oversold positions and floats between 30-70. For our trading, think of 50 as our indicator line. Anything above is a “bullish” stock and anything below is a “bearish” stock.\n\nBullish: AMD –  [https://imgur.com/a/sbTXDb7](https://imgur.com/a/sbTXDb7)\n\nBearshit: CGC – [https://imgur.com/a/nI2BTpd](https://imgur.com/a/nI2BTpd)\n\nThis shows the long-term trend of the stock, rather it’s on fire or crashing like Pier 1 imports. As you can see AMD is bullish and well, I will repeat don’t by that shit CGC yet options wise (until it hits the below stuff, the call the fuck out of it).\n\n\\*RSI | 10-day Indicator\\*\n\nThe 10-day chart shows your entry and exist points (look to call / look to put) for potentially gaining max profit.\n\nSimilar to the 50 line for the 250-day indicator, we’re looking at the 30 and 60 lines for the 10-day chart.\n\nTreasure Map: AMD - [https://imgur.com/a/K12HIkG](https://imgur.com/a/K12HIkG)\n\nAs you can see, usually charts come around after the 30 and 60 levels. So for buying calls, watch for the stock to drop below 30 and then place a call on the loop-around back once it crosses 30 again. Ride it up as long as you want, but once it crosses 60, I sell the option, rather ITM, ATM, or OTM.\n\nSame for puts, but inverse, put at the 2nd 60 line , exist at the first 30 line break.\n\nHopefully you’ll profit. I even added in some puts to show the bear gang some luv. <3 fap n nap\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MACD:**\n\nNow that you’re an expert options ~~trader~~ autist at RSI, let’s move to MACD…I like to call it the MacDaddy. But really, MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and it’s a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. For our purposes, none of that shit matters, we’re looking for X marks the spot on calls or puts.\n\nThis one is simple, use the 50 line as your baseline (similar to RSI 250) with 12 and 26 as your settings. Anytime the moving averages cross (make an X) above the 50 line, that’s usually a sign to put, if below the 50 line, that’s usually a call option.\n\nExample: [https://imgur.com/a/C9KdtDm](https://imgur.com/a/C9KdtDm)\n\nMake sure you review the chart overall, look at the amount of time it took to move $X amount. Based on your dollar movement estimate for either calls or puts, always multiple by 10. For example, if a stock is $11, and I put a call for $13, I wouldn’t want to cut myself short, so I’d get a call that’s about 20 days out ($2 x 10 = 20) Jesus titty fucking Christ break out the calculator already and do your own math.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GAP:**\n\nMy personal favorite and I’m not talking about the GAP between my eyebrows either, thanks genetics. Fucking 2020 caveman over here. Anyway…\n\nI like it cause it’s easy and narrows down my choices for what to call or put. I look at stocks that gapped up or down and use the above RSI and MacDaddy to see if it’s at a good entry point. If all 3 stars align, viola, you’ll be driving a cybertruck in no time.\n\nExample GAP: [https://imgur.com/a/peLJBTk](https://imgur.com/a/peLJBTk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Parting words of wisdom:**\n\n\\- It’s a marathon, not a sprint\n\n\\- No one went broke locking in profits\n\n\\- Don’t be greedy, build you stack one option at a time\n\n\\- F for the Bear gang\n\n\\- It's all a game of luck/chance, no amount of candlestick reading will be the market\n\nLuv,\n\nFap-n-Nap\n\nEdit: Fixed some shitty grammar", "id": "em4qnr", "created_utc": 1578544897.0, "score": 301, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "This should be stickied.... it’s totally fappable", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
