I would say that the model S and 3 fall into this category... outside of their drive units and batteries, nothing is particularly different than other OEM sedans. The X might also be included, except for the doors. \n\nBased on all of Tesla's recent manufacturing patents, future vehicles from Tesla will be built very differently than anything that has been built before. Complex full body die casting?! rigid wire harnesses? wireless communication? Armor glass?  All these things will require new manufacturing and assembly equipment, designed and built by wholly owned subsidiaries of Tesla. While it is very likely that competing Chinese firms will get a good look at the assembly processes inside Giga 3, and probably will be able to steal copies of the programming from the assembly equipment, they won't be able to buy copies of the same equipment, and there is no reason why the designs for this equipment to ever leave California. Similarly, especially high value small parts, like the electric motor cores (Monroe discussed laminated magnets of a like he had never seen) can be made in the US and supplied world-wide.\n\nAnyone who copies Tesla will be able to duplicate the shape of the car, but they will need to do their own engineering to go further than that, and I believe (and I think this is Tesla's strategy) that Tesla will be able to innovate faster than copycats can reverse engineer their previous work.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think intellectual property means much in China.
