{"title": "Companies that failed like Tesla", "selftext": "[This article comparing Tesla to successful billion dollar companies left me wanting](https://www.kevinrooke.com/post/understanding-tesla-valuation-tesla-market-cap). It felt like a cheer leading piece that focused on the ways in which Tesla is similar to Apple and Amazon, and ignored all the ways in which Tesla might fail. There are plenty of companies that have followed similar trajectories to Tesla, only to suddenly crash and burn. Yahoo, Transmeta, Boo, Theranos and Nokia all come to mind. I generally find there is a lot more to learn from failure than success, so I figured I'd take a first stab at comparing Tesla to those companies instead. Hopefully others can offer more insights.\n\nSome of the companies that collapsed did it because they were fake companies without a real product from day one. Theranos and Enron come to mind. I know some TSLAQ supporters would say otherwise, but I think that it's clear by now Tesla isn't one of them. They are selling hundreds of thousands of real, working cars every year. The cars exist and the market for them exists at somewhere close to the current price point. Yes their paint is thin, yes they move around losses between quarters in questionable ways to pretty up their books, yes their service sucks, and yes they often miss their deadlines. But guess what? None of that is illegal, and every major competitor does most of the same things. Tesla, for all its faults, simply is not a fraud, and beating that particular dead horse simply makes you look uninformed.\n\nThen we have companies like Transmeta that tried to disrupt an industry, but the incumbents were too agile, too entrenched, or too deeply pocketed. The disruption they brought to the table simply wasn't useful enough to unseat the current king. I don't think Tesla falls into this category either, because I firmly believe that the transition to electric is inevitable, meaning the industry will be disrupted no matter what else happens. This is just my opinion and I know not everyone shares it, but I believe that fuel cells, diesel and petrol are all dead ends for personal transportation. Busses, trucks, planes and boats are different, but I am personally convinced Tesla will not fail for the same reasons Transmeta did.\n\nNokia is the story of the entrenched market leader that failed to adapt quickly enough and got disrupted out of existence. Mark Speigel sometimes tries to frame Tesla this way, but I think anyone with half a brain sees it's bullshit. Tesla will not go out like Nokia, because Tesla is far too fast moving.\n\nThen we have companies like Boo. Boo tried to disrupt clothes retailing. Their execution was flawed. Their product was unreliable, they failed to keep their costs in line and after a while their hype died, they couldn't raise more capital and they rapidly imploded even though the market was theirs for the taking. The incumbents are to this day dragging their feet on the shift to internet and the whole market is suffering as a result, but in spite of that massive market opportunity, Boo failed to make a business for themselves simply because their execution was flawed. I think this is something that Tesla runs a decent chance of facing. Elon Musk has a poor track record of keeping costs under control (e.g. Model X development) and their product isn't always reliable (long list of mostly minor quality issues). Elon Musk is amazing at raising more money, but even he won't be able to raise money in a recession. They might desperately need some financial discipline in the coming years and it's not clear that they have enough of it. And also, Tesla has a lot of amazing engineers releasing amazing products but lets not kid ourselves: Their windshield wipers still suck in spite of the \"deep rain\" bullshit. Their speech recognition still sucks even on 2019.50.7. Autopilots repeated failure to detect stationary vehicles like fire trucks is an embarrassment. Right now, Tesla gets it right often enough that their misses are drowned out by the hits, but I believe a short streak of bad software releases could deflate the Tesla hype balloon enough to sink the company.\n\nI'm not saying Tesla will go out like Boo, I think the likeliest outcome is that they keep on growing and become one of the market leaders. But I also believe there is a non-negligeble chance they will turn into another Boo. How would I detect that early to cut my losses? Are there any other failure scenarios I've missed?", "id": "ekmypr", "created_utc": 1578275975.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Interesting post!

I live in Germany and I have friends in key positions in both the government and in investment banking.  Here is a summary of the current scoop I was able to learn over some Christmas Glühwein.\n\nUp until recently, the Germans have been so heavily invested in hydrogen solutions that they have mostly ignored the EV market.  My banking friends were so dismissive even just 6 months ago, that we go into a bit of a loud argument about it, where I warned them to start paying more attention to what Tesla and others were doing.  When I met with them at Christmas, a few things had changed: Tesla was starting to look invincible again, the German government announced that the subsidies for EVs were getting a massive boost, Tesla won a prestigious award in Germany, and the new Gigafactory in Berlin near the new (only 10 years late now and counting) airport had been announced.\n\nNow all those things might just sound like normal business-as-usual type of things.  They are not.  There has been a rethink in the government (according to my friends there) and hydrogen is no longer seen as a sure-thing.  They are not giving up on it, but Germany has environmental commitments and it no longer looks like hydrogen will get here fast enough to help.  The fact that so many of these events happened so close to each other is not a coincidence.\n\nThis seemed to be backed up by my banking buds.  They have conceded that EV seems to be the way forward with cars, although they are still holding out hope for trucks, ships and planes.  So right now, Germany is finally getting serious about investing in EVs.\n\nThe car companies here have gotten the message and that has led to things like VW announcing that it will reach its targets 2 years faster than originally expected.  Funny that.  (full disclosure: I love my Audi.  If they had a competitive alternative when I go to get our first EV, I would probably go with Audi.  Currently, they have nothing that even remotely compares and even the stuff being planned can't really compare either.  Still, I will go to our dealer and see what they might say.)\n\nThe next thing to watch for here in Germany is how the government deals with the expected rise in grid usage.  This was the biggest point of my banking friends 6 months ago: Germany can't handle everyone having an EV and the grid can only handle about 20% adoption before browning out.  I think they are probably right.  Our difference of opinion came from our conclusions.  They concluded that this meant EVs were never going to be the dominant choice (Jan: hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen!).  My conclusion was that the infrastructure needed to be upgraded to handle the expected increased load.\n\nIf we see an increased commitment to laying down more lines, that would be another indication that the government has pivoted away from hydrogen.  That would certainly mean the same thing for the car manufacturers here.  The government and the car manufacturers have a cosier relationship here in Germany than in most countries.  If one of them starts moving in a certain direction, it's highly likely that the other moved with them.\n\nOn a related point: I think the Dieselgate situation is going to turn out to be a blessing in disguise for VW.   I don't believe that all the major car manufacturers in Germany are going to make it.  At least one is going to either disappear or be absorbed in the next ten years.  By being forced to pivot sooner and harder towards EVs, VW has a better chance of weathering the storm and even becoming a serious competitor to Tesla.  Unlike the bears, I don't see this as a problem for Tesla, mostly because I don't see VW being able to really compete until 2027+.    I personally believe, however, that this will be enough to maintain relevance for VW.  I can't say the same for the other manufacturers here.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know if this video is accurate, but it makes a strong case for why hydrogen is a poor choice for fueling cars\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MzFfuNOtY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MzFfuNOtY)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.

It allows for a smaller and lighter battery (adequate for majority of daily commutes), and the small ICE engine helps to address range anxiety and other BEV shortcomings.  PHEV owners report very high combined mileage.  It may be the right solution for a lot of people, depending on their circumstances.  Still, it's hard to argue with the mechanical simplicity of a BEV.\n\nIf you can afford it, but right answer is probably to have a small BEV for weekly commuting and a bigger ICE for longer trips and vacation travel with the family.\n\nDo you know how the Germans will re-energize their grid?

It was a bloody stupid idea to take them off the grid in the first place and came from both a historical non-rational reaction to nuclear power and an emotional response to the disaster in Japan.  The Germans basically screwed themselves.\n\nYou have to remember that this is a country that still thinks that homeopathy is a real thing.  Germans have a stubborn emotional attachment to certain ideas, and nuclear aversion is one of them.  Never mind that they are simply buying nuclear power from their neighbors or that they have been forced to rely more on the very coal they want to replace.   \n\nEven if that were to happen, it would take years now to get new plants built.  Even the old ones would probably need to be reevaluated.  Getting an official ok to restart them would take years as well.  Nuclear is dead in Germany, for better or for worse.\n\nWind is huge here.  Driving down the Autobahn is basically a tour of windmills. \n\nI actually like wind power quite a bit; as a centralized power source, it really has merits and beats solar.  Solar is better as a decentralized energy source right now (home installations and that kind of thing), but the data I'm basing my opinion on is, I suppose, a few years old.  So take this with a grain of salt. \n\nMy government contacts couldn't really tell me much about what kinds of plans Berlin has for modernizing the grid.  I don't think there is one.  My suspicion is that they will simply keep expanding the wind power network and buying the rest from their neighbors.  It will take a pretty big shock for the government to change course on the power sources.  I'm hoping that they will start buffing up the trunk cables and encouraging more on-site power generation; those two things are what I'm watching for.  \n\nThe estimate of only 5% of the population driving EVs by 2025 is almost certainly underestimating the situation.  I think the number is going to be north of 10%.  That won't give the government much time to upgrade the entire grid to handle the increased load.  As I mentioned before, I'm hopeful that the government here has started to understand that the Tesla model is the de facto standard going forward.

It's just a few dollars for a rain sensor, one more manually drawn cable in the wire harness, and some kind of clip to hold the sensor. No big deal.\n\nBut if you go down that route, you need to add another sensor for the auto highbeams, because a rain sensor sure can't detect oncoming cars. And then you need separate compressors and cooling loops for the battery and the air conditioning because clearly those are different subsystems with different requirements. Why not throw in a third cooling loop for the motor? Also, every major subsystem (motor, battery, driving assist, etc) needs to be controlled by a computer, so suddenly you have half a dozen computers running different operating systems talking to each other in your car. Your costs are spiralling out of control. Not to mention the size and weight of your vehicle is going up.\n\nThe individual rain sensor isn't important, but it is part of a design philosophy that Tesla has that used to define the auto industry: Trying to reduce cost and complexety everywhere possible, because if you find a way to save a few dollars (or even a few cents) on every vehicle made and the make a million vehicles, you just saved millions of dollars. If you find a way to do that once a week for a year, you're a billionaire.\n\nFord and Toyota are both famous for this type of manufacturing optimization, but these days car manufacturers don't actually design cars so much as they try to glue together separate subsystems from 200 different subcontractors and iron out the worst kinks. This severaly limits their ability to cut these types of costs, because there is absolutely no way on earth that Ford, Toyota or anyone else will be able to make BWA and Borsch cooperate in such a way that a rain sensor and the high beams share hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, Teslas vertical integration strategy means they have an opportunity to do far more work with far less hardware. Reuse the autopilot camera as a rain sensor and as a car detector for the auto highbeams. Use a single cooling/heating loop for HVAC, battery and motor. Don't add a resistive heater to the cooling loop, just make the electric motor run less efficiently when more heat is needed. Use a single central computer to control all subsystems. Don't run thousands of wires from the control computer to each and every component in the system, instead make all electronics on the car share a single USB-like message bus.\n\nThere are huge downsides to vertical integration, mostly because Tesla has absolutely no economies of scale when making e.g. car seats, and I'd say the jury is still out on if Teslas integration strategy is actually better in the long run. But at the very least it's an interesting experiment, and as a Tesla owner I am enjoying the advantages as well as cursing the disadvantages it brings me.

I would have been fine with manual otherwise.\n\nIt's okay, everybody makes mistakes.
