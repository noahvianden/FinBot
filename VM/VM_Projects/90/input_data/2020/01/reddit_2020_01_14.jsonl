{"title": "I short strangled TSLA at the base of its rally. Question.", "selftext": "**EDIT: I went ahead and closed out my position without rolling.  This whole experiment costed me 108k in losses, but I'm still up 128k from my initial investment.  What pushed me over the edge was that everyone was right when they said the inevitable crash will wreck me on the put side as well.  Maybe I'll try again in the future.  \n\nEdit2:  And the SP dropped 10 dollars about 3 minutes after I closed out my position.  Woo.\n\nEdit3:  Screw it, I'll just go back to my old strategy.  The one that made me x5 in 3 years.  All in on TSLA calls once it hits the lower BB again.\n\nEdit4:  Man, this is the first time I feel this relaxed in weeks.\n**\n\n\nThe SP was 350.  I thought it was a nice middle ground between the top and bottom, so I started a short strangle.\n\nI used the strategy where if the SP got too close to one of my strikes, I would just shift both the call and put side to re-center it, give up a bit of premium.  \n\nThat was a month ago.  Today, it's at 530.  I've lost over 100k and I have about 75k in premiums remaining.  Basically, I'd shoot a goat in order to just break even at this point.  Short straddles don't really seem to work if the SP goes up huge almost every single day it seems.  Only reason I'm still in it is because I want to see how it ends.  \n\nI still maintain a nice 50 point gap between the SP and both call and put side.  I re-centered my strikes today and it looks like I'll have to re-center it tomorrow as well.  Has anyone been in my bizarre situation?  I have 3 weeks or 14 trading days remaining on my options.  \n\nWhat happens if it continues to go up almost every single day and I have to continually readjust and re-center it 2-3 times a week?  The SP will still continue to fall somewhere between my call and put strikes, and yet, I will continue to lose money every single time it goes up, which will (hopefully) net me profit in the end.  I can't both lose money almost every single day, yet get payout at the end.  It's a bit paradoxical, I'm not sure what to expect at this point.", "id": "eoeic1", "created_utc": 1578967710.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "I view any time I shift a trade as a new trade.

The best final \"payout\" would be zero if the price ends up between the two options making them worthless (vs. a negative payout if one goes in they money).\n\nAll those re-centers as the price moved up consisted of buying back an expensive ITM call and selling a cheaper OTM one higher up, bleeding money to end up where you started.

I re-center while it's still a decent amount away from the strike price.  For example, I have 50 points on each side of the SP.  I'll readjust once I'm 20 points away.

This is the first time implementing this strategy, so get ready for a massive facepalm.  Initially, I thought all there was to this strategy was just moving the strikes up.  As the premiums rose, I got greedy and sold more and more contracts on both sides.  And then, as the SP rose, the initial requirement smashed me in the face.  So, after heavy losses from over exposure, I had to cut the amount of contracts I had in half, and along with that, any chance of breaking even.  If I hadn't been that greedy, the losses would have been much less then 100k.\n\nNow, I've done the calculations and put myself in a position where I'll be safe even if the stock jumps to 700 in the next 14 trading days.

Your trade is a pure implied vol vs. realized vol trade, since as long as future realized vol > implied vol (adjusted to your skew strangle), you'll lose.  So far, it's been realizing far more than the implied vol.Also, I'm not sure on your expiration but given you have 75k premium left, I assume these are mid dated options too (so not LEAPS but not weeklies either), so it'll take you a long time to collect this premium (for the vol to become theta), even if it stays range bound.\n\nAs someone who is bullish TSLA, I think TSLA is probably somewhat overvalued at this point, but the thing is even if it crashes back down, you still lose because you readjusted your strikes and now you'll lose on your put side instead of the call side.  Also the thing is you never known when it will come back because clearly it's in the middle of a massive short squeeze right now and can go up a ton more.  TSLA IV is also probably too high and cannot possibly maintain this level forever, but in that case, if you just want to sell vol, I recommend you open up like a condor with like 200 dollar wide ATM options for your base part of the condor or something rather than a strangle/straddle, and make sure to do it on leap options (2021), so you aren't as gamma exposed and so the next stock you invest it isn't ROPE.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "If your thesis changed, close the trade.
