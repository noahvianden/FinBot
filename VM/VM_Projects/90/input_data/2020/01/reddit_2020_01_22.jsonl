In a registered account, it's easier.\n\nHowever as you've noticed, if the US holdings are treated as foreign, the trustees will charge you US taxes and withhold portions of your dividends.  You can track those and potentially use them as tax credits though.\n\nSo for a very simplified example: if a stock pays a $100 USD dividend, you'll only receive $85 and the US government keeps $15.   Sometimes that's ok because $85 is better than nothing.  But what about the $15 you \"lost\"?  Well, if you work it so that you owe the Canadian government some taxes, you can claim the $15 you paid to America as tax that you paid and they'll knock it off what you owe them.
