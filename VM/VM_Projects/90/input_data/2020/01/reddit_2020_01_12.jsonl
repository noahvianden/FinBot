Of course a decrease in the value of a company's assets, caused by a (large and widespread) loss for companies in general, would cause most crashes and the worst of the crashes.\n\nLet me use an example: the reason I initially raised an objection to your claim that people (presumably other than stockbrokers) lose jobs when markets crash as opposed to the other way around, is the example of the crash of 08 (and it's not alone in this regard).\n\nI'll give a quick version here or we'll be here forever. I won't cover every factor, just what's needed to point out the relationship I'm talking about.\n\nIn 2008, risky home loans were made without the appropriate documentation and oversight. These were packaged into mortgage bonds, and sold to institutional investors. When they started running low on the supply of new subprime mortgages, they created CDOs to sell leftover unsold bonds. They cut these derivatives into slices of credit risk, which unfortunately they didn't really supervise as nobody in the process saw it as their problem. Many of these CDOs had no real basis for their credit classification since there was so much double-dipping of the same mortgages in these CDOs. Then you have the credit default swap on CDOs, essentially a bet against the cash flow of an asset derived from mortgages. Wall Street bet against the first credit default swaps (a bet for housing to rise, a big, complicated, leveraged one), then sold some of the risk to insurance companies like Countrywide and AIG.\n\nSo, to summarize, it's like a dormant virus or bioweapon spreading, waiting for activation. Multiple sectors are exposed to leveraged credit risk on housing.\n\nThe first mover here is hard to pinpoint, but imo, it was interest rates. Interest rates are risen by the Fed, causing delinquencies and defaults on housing to rise, since so many Consumers were led by mortgage brokers to borrow too much and buy too much house because they could \"always refinance\", when really it was only advisable to refinance when interest rates lowered. Consumers were paying interest-only mortgages, so many choose to just walk away from the house, since they can't refinance, and they were essentially led to gamble on lower interest rates when the opposite ended up occuring. \n\nBanks repossess hundreds of thousands, eventually millions of houses. Housing prices drop as the market is saturated with inventory. The CDOs are distressed and the underlying bonds begin to fail. This triggers a credit crisis, where banks have taken so much in paper losses from housing that they lock down and stop lending. Several banks fail to borrow their operating costs from other banks and go bankrupt. Manufacturing lays people off, as they also needed revolving credit to continue operations. Basically at this point so many companies relied on credit that they were no longer getting from banks that they can't afford to keep their payrolls, they lay off millions collectively. This worsens the housing problem, causing more defaults, more bankruptcies, more trouble in the banks. Consumer spending drops as people lose their income, further worsening the problem as company losses grow and layoffs accelerate.\n\nOnly then, after this had been going on for essentially a year, did equities markets crash. During that year, they were volatile, but up. In fact they were up a lot even as insurance companies were going bankrupt, a very bad sign considering the fact that they were just as financially interconnected as the banks. Equities markets only really gave a damn once Bear & Lehman were in trouble, and Merrill was next.\n\nThe job losses, or more accurately, the systematic rise in bankruptcies and shocks in lending, led to the equities crash. Not the other way around.\n\nTL;DR: Look at 2008, job losses came before equities crash, equities noticed the problems last, even after ABS/bond traders who previously packaged and sold the toxic assets noticed and began to short them.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Jesus christ did you just write a thesis?  :P  I’ll read this eventually haha.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That was the short version!

Don’t you think that’ll take a big hit if people’s retirements drop 30% in a couple months?
