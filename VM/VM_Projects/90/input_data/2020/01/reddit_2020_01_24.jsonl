We are riding this ship together with Sir Branson as our captain, we must have faith as autists that this company with no revenue, any remote chance of making a profit in the future, and probably will crash at some point, will bring us sweet glorious tendies. I have faith, you only lose money when you sell. And there are no pussys on this ship, its either massive tendies or we go out like the Challenger. Also can I get a side of fries with that.
