The reality was, he tried to tell us, the Tesla stock will skyrocket and become an extremely hot thing. Don't listen to me, just open the chart and verify it yourself.\nYou might find also other hints.\n\nThat's good so far, but the reason I'm sharing this thought with you is his latest move. Tesla sold shorts. Yes right, they sold shorts!! I'm sure everyone from WSB is smart enough to understand this.\n\nNow that's all I needed to share, just take care and listen to Elon. He can't tell us directly, because the SEC... Ah well you already know it, middle word of this acronym is \"Elon's\"\n\nHappy trading!\n\nEdit: Just read my comments below, I'm cracking up.
