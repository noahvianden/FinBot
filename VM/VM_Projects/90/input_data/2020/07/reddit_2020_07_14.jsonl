{"title": "Stop losses LOSE you more money (no shit). Here's a new technique", "selftext": "Instead of setting a stop loss at 20%, you need to be buying contracts that are worth your max loss tolerance so you're not getting stopped out or panic like a little bitch every time it dips.\n\n\n For example, instead of buying a $1k contract and setting a stop loss at $800, you find yourself a contract that's $200 and let that bitch go to 0. You maximize your theta and you don't stop out. Yes, that means you can't buy higher priced stocks, but this technique alone should prevent you from betting more than you can afford to lose.\n\nTldr WMT 8/21 140c\n\n\nEdit: this concept is too high level for some retards. The point is buy what you can afford to lose rather than setting pussy stop losses\n\nEdit 2: this does not mean buy further OTM. It means accept that you shouldn't be trading Tesla because you can't afford to lose more than x%, instead go buy something like Walmart closer to the money and within your loss tolerance", "id": "hqrcyg", "created_utc": 1594686633.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "I don‚Äôt wear underwear and I don‚Äôt use stops.", "score": 98, "replies": [{"body": "So you shit directly into your pants like I do, nice.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Take that, middleman", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "It‚Äôs the only way to fly!", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "#fyp", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "your dad wishes he used a stop I am sure", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "That‚Äôs exactly what he tells me!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I agree with the WMT call.
