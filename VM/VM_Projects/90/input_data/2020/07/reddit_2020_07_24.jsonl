{"title": "Using Spreads 2: a slightly more advanced guide on how to stop getting destroyed by theta", "selftext": "My last post was more successful than I expected, so here is my next post as promised. If you missed the first one, you should [read it first:](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ht3dkf/using_spreads_a_guide_on_how_to_stop_getting/) since I'm going to be assuming you know the stuff in there already (in addition to the absolute most basic concepts like IV and what it means to buy and sell a call, if you don't you should probably do more than 5 minutes of research before trading financial instruments worth thousands of dollars, I said this last time too but apparently you autists are also illiterate)\n\nDisclaimer: **Unless I say otherwise, I'm assuming we hold everything I discuss here to expiration day because it's much simpler**. Many spread strategies, **particularly the ones in this post** involve getting out of positions before expiration, but if I included what happens before expiration this post will be 10x as long. Just be aware that **you probably do NOT want to hold these positions to expiration, but you will have to figure that part out for yourself**. Also, I am not advocating any plays described here, including my own.\n\nThis is going to be a lot more technical than my last post (while still avoiding scary things like Greeks that you should seriously learn from a book or something idk), but today we are going to be talking about my two personal favorite strategies: poor man's covered call and iron condor. Why are they my favorites? Like the basic vertical spreads from my last post, they are easy to comprehend and extremely flexible, but they can actually benefit from theta rather than simply reducing your exposure to it (vertical spreads can too, but it's much more difficult to do with basic vertical spreads in a way that has a reasonable risk/reward).\n\nThe **poor man's covered call** is really just a variation of a vertical spread where you buy one option and sell a higher strike. The difference is that the option you buy should be in the money and long-dated, and the option you sell should be out of the money and much shorter-dated. The idea is that this strategy mimics a covered call in that you are essentially buying 100 shares and then selling a call to reduce your cost basis, BUT your cost basis is already significantly reduced by simply buying a call instead of 100 shares. I will use an example from an option I actually purchased, so you can see the benefit:\n\nOn July 20 at 12:20 PM I purchased a Jan 2022 LVGO 80c for 50.40 a share. The price of the stock at the time was 111, so my options had 31 of instrinsic value and 19.40 of extrinsic value. (It cost me $5040, but buying the same amount of stock would have cost me $11100.) To offset the cost even further, I sold an Aug 2020 150c for 3.6 a share. In doing so, I reduced my cost basis by ~8% (from 50.4 to 46.8) by capping my max gain at 23.2 a share (the difference between the strikes is 70, my new cost basis is 46.8) IF LVGO goes up 50% in the next month. Note that if I were doing a real covered call with actual stock like some kind of boomer, I would have reduced my cost basis from 111 to 106.4, which is only a ~4% reduction instead of ~8%). The plan is that every month, I will sell a similarly far OTM call for the following month, getting 2.00 - 4.00 each time. Theoretically, if the stock never moves, or if the stock slowly creeps upward, I have significantly lowered my cost basis while also gaining value on the long call from the underlying stock moving up. Theta is going to eat the month-out call a LOT faster than the long-dated call, so this is situation in which you actually have theta on your side for once!\n\nThe big downside of this strategy is that if the underlying stock tanks (which is very possible, particularly with stocks with high enough IV to have premiums that make this strategy worthwhile) then obviously you lose a lot more intrinsic value on your long call than you gain on your short call (this is also true of a basic covered call, but stock doesn't expire). If this happens, you have a couple options. So you can see my thought process, here is an example of what I did today when LVGO dropped from 110 to 100:\n\n*Sell* the September 150c for 3.50. *Buy* the August 170c for .8 as a hedge so I don't have any naked shorts. This reduces my cost basis another [3.5 - .8 = 2.7].\n\nNow I am short the August 150c and the September 150c, and long the August 170c and the Jan 2022 80c. My reasoning here is, my cost basis is another 2.7 lower for the month of September, and I got roughly the same premium for September that I got for August when the stock was 110 rather than 100. Let's look at my gains/losses with some various scenarios.\n\n* *If the stock goes down a lot*: I lose money on the long call, but at least I have offset 2.7 + 3.5 = 6.2 points of the loss. I will continually re-evaluate what to do depending on the severity of the drop and the prices of the options. It's most likely I buy back the short calls (which will be much cheaper to buy back), and then start selling 120s or 130s instead to reduce my cost basis even further. \n* *If the stock goes down a little, stays flat, or goes up slowly*: Everything but my long call expires and I make the same 6.2. In September, I sell an October call. Rinse and repeat.\n* *If the stock goes up near 150 by August but doesn't break 150*: I make money on the August short call (because it expires), I am losing money on the September short call (so far), and I make a TON of money on my Jan 2022 call. Depending how much I made, I may happily get out of the entire position. Can always roll it into a new long-dated call to capture some of the gains.\n* *If the stock goes up to 170 or above by August*: This is extremely unlikely, requires a 70% move in one month but it hurts. I am now up ~4k on my long call (which is now worth roughly 90 when I paid 50 for it), but I am down 2k on my August short call (I'm protected from anything more than 2k by the August long call) and another 2k on the short September call (I'm protected by anything more than 2k by my Jan 2022 long call). Ends up being kind of a wash, which sucks, but again, required a 70% move in one month.\n\nThere's more to say on this, but that seems like enough for now. The takeaway here is: have a strategy for anything the stock can do, and be ready to adapt it. \n\n**Iron condors**: an iron condor is just two spreads stuck together. What's cool about them is that they are really just a fancy way of playing volatility. Buying an iron condor is essentially saying \"I think the market is underpricing the volatility of this stock.\" Selling an iron condor is saying \"I think the market is overpricing the volality of this stock.\" When you are wrong with a condor you can just tell yourself the market always wins in end the end because they have all the fancy computers and algorithms and who can beat that, and when you are right with a condor you feel like a god because you outsmarted all the market makers, those fucks.\n\nANYWAY, buying an iron condor means that you buy a call spread above the current price of the stock, and you buy a put spread below the current price of the stock, essentially betting it will either go up past your highest strike or down past your lowest strike. Selling an iron condor is the opposite, you are betting that the stock will NOT go up or down past your strikes. Here's an example with everyone's favorite thing: NUMBERS.\n\nQQQ is currently sitting at 255. My crystal ball says that next week is going to be wacky, so I expect it will either go up or down let's say 3 percent, but not stay where it is. \n\nFor the call spread, buying a 260 call and selling a 263 call will cost me .94, for a max profit of 2.06 if it closes next Friday at 263 or above, and a full loss if it closes below 260. I could take that position by itself if I'm bullish on QQQ, and it's essentially a 2:1 bet that QQQ goes past 263 in the next week (breakeven at 260.94, 1:1 profit at 261.88, 2:1 profit at 262.82, do the math yourself to figure out why that is).\n\nThe put spread is almost identical. We can look at buying the 250 put, and selling the 247 put, and, interestingly we get, a cost of .8 (vs the .94 for the call spread, so the market is pricing the likelihood of QQQ going down by 8 at less than it going up by 8.)\n\nNow we put those two spreads together. We buy the entire thing at once, and the cost is now the .8 for the put spread plus the .94 for the call spread = 1.74. Your max gain is now 1.26 if it goes EITHER below 247 OR above 263.\n\nBut wait a second you say, that deal sounds like it sucks! Why would I bet $174 to make $126? And I would say, why yes, I agree, that DOES sound like it sucks! So what if instead of doing that, we SELL the iron condor instead? That means we do exactly the opposite thing; instead of *buying* the 250p and 260c and *selling* the 247p and 260c, we *sell* the 250p and 260c, and *buy* the 247p and 263c. Now we have exactly the opposite risk profile; if QQQ stays between 250 and 260 by next Friday, we make $174, and if goes below 263 or 247, we lose $126 instead. \n\nThe interesting thing is that if we buy this iron condor, we are essentially making the bet that it's more likely QQQ moves 3% than the market thinks it is. If we sell this iron condor, we are essentially making the bet that it's less likely QQQ moves 3% than the market thinks it is. So either way, if you are right, hey, you did it, you beat the market!\n\nSince spreads are infinitely variable, and condors are two spreads put together, they're DOUBLE INFINITY variable. You can mess with the risk profile by changing the expirations, changing the strikes, widening the spreads, widening or shrinking the length between the spreads, all sorts of shit. I recommend messing around with a bunch of different condors and seeing how each one has a different risk/reward profile.\n\nThere are two main downsides to condors not already mentioned. The first is commissions. Every condor consists of buying and selling 2 options to open the position, and then potentially buying and selling another 2-4 options to close the position (if you're not letting some/all expire worthless). Depending on your commission structure, this can eat up your gains fast. The second is that since you are buying and selling two spreads, you can really get hosed by the bid/ask spread, especially on stocks with lower liquidity. This isn't so much an issue if you're doing condors on SPY or QQQ, but if you really want to bet on an obscure low-volume stock, it's something to watch out for. If you thought you were getting the aforementioned spread for 1.26 but it doesn't fill at 1.35, you need to consider that your risk profile has changed a lot and you may want to rethink placing the trade at all.\n\nNote: Iron condors are by far the least likely of the strategies I've mentioend to be fully held until expiration. The most important question for them is when you should continue to hold it, and when you should get out of it early, and when you should get out of only one spread and not the other. You should have a strategy when you open it for what you will do if the trade is going against you or you are guaranteed to lose money from panic selling. Perhaps that will be a topic for part 3.\n\nAgain this got way longer than I expected so I'm going to shut up now.", "id": "hx97nd", "created_utc": 1595621880.0, "score": 215, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, you know that this sub is allergic to good advice.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Sir, this is a Wendy's", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "And incredibly long posts.. wtf..", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "anyone else copy and paste posts like these to notes in case they get deleted but then forget about them", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Sitting in a word document as we speak.

Sometimes it's better to take 75% of your max profit or whatever and get out of the position rather than risk a Trump tweet or a vaccine pump or something destroying what seemed like a sure thing. \n\nFor those of us who don't work at Goldman Sachs, risk management is an art, not a science. And figuring out when to get out of positions that ARE going your way is just as important a part of risk management as when to get out of those that aren't. \n\nThis doesn't mean I advocate any specific kind of rule, or even generally advocate selling early or not, just that it's always important to be aware that your position is NEVER safe, and you should always be thinking to yourself \"should I take my profit/loss and get out while I'm ahead/behind?\" \n\nOne final point; I think the most important thing for me as a trader is the realization that the history of your trade really doesn't matter. If you open a condor with two weeks to expiration with a cost of $1000 and a max gain of $1000, and ride it 90% of the way to expiration and are 90% at max profit, that's great!

Intrinsic value = how far in the money your option is, extrinsic value = all the rest of the value of the option. \n\nIf a stock is at 80, and you have a 60 call that's worth 25, you have (80 - 60 = 20) in instrinsic value and the remaining (25 - 20 = 5) in extrinsic value. Essentially the intrinsic value is what the option is worth if you exercised it right now, and the rest of the value is the extra time value and such that makes an option worth more than just its intrinsic value. \n\n(If you're wondering, the intrinsic value of an OTM option is 0)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I had to do this yesterday when tech was taking a dump.
