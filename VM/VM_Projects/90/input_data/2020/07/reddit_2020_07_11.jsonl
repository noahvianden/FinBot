{"title": "$NFLX & $SPOT Top Picks Long Term!", "selftext": "For some odd reason, I feel that Netflix has potential to be the next big company to hit $1,000+. During  this Pandemic they have been unbreakable and with 182+ million monthly subscribers at $9.99 minimum per month, those are outrageous passive revenue coming in automatically. It’s not like a product you buy once and that’s it, other companies have to deal with trying to sell as much as they can, but Netflix it sells automatically with their subscription business model which I love most during this pandemic. \n\nSubscription business model’s are the best way to go in my opinion during this time and even after the pandemic decreases, people will still have their subscriptions. Some may leave but new subscribers will still grow as they release to more countries. Netflix is the Top Dog in the industry and I believe they will run just like Tesla!\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\nOne other Notable big winner in my opinion longer term is: $SPOT! \n\n$NFLX and $SPOT CALLS are my two best picks for long term.
