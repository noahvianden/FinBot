Even simple task like measuring the voltage of a cell becomes very very complicated in detail. Batteries are electrochemical device so in order to measure the voltage of cell you need the internal chemistry to settle for a few minutes before you can measure the correct voltage. Measuring after charging or discharging will give you wrong results. This means it is difficult to measure voltage while the battery is actively being used. You need to estimate actual voltage and to do that you need to measure temperature, charge and discharge curve. You then need to repeat the process for all the cells in series. Reading the correct voltage is critical since all cells must have the same exact voltage. If   the voltage of one cell is not balanced with other cells this will caused the cell to degrade more quickly than others. This degraded cell will affect the health of the other cells causing the entire pack to die prematurely. All of that headache is just from measuring voltage. Detecting the health of the cell is even more complicated you need to measure exposure time to high temperature, high voltage, and high current draw.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "not op but thanks for such a detailed explanation, very interesting!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "So once we as humans solve This problem why can’t every manufacturer learn and do it as well?

When they do EV conversion using Tesla battery. The first thing they do is remove Tesla's BMS and replace it with something that has better documentation. custom microchips are very hard to reverse engineer. You need expensive equipment and a lot of time to actually see the nano size transistor and then analyzed how they are wired. That is only the hardware side you need to also reverse engineer the microcode that runs on top of the microchip. Then if you are able to do that there is a good chance copying is not good enough because you need to adjust it to a specific battery chemistry and Tesla have secret additives in their battery chemistry that alters the battery specs. It would be far easier and have better chance of success to organized a team of experts and work from scratch and try to build up the teams experience until they can produce a comparable technology. Copying Tesla's technology will require the same team of experts and it is highly likely you end up with a copy that do not work. In both scenario Tesla would have move on to a much improve version of their technology. A good example of this happening is how Huawei could not just copy TSMC's 7nm microchip fabrication so they are force use older fabrication technology from SMIC but TSMC is quickly moving to even better 5nm fabrication technology.

The microcode is program by Tesla programmer. You need high level espionage to get the designs of various components and hope you did not miss something critical. You can poach JB Straubel and you will probably learn the high level architecture but not the details. And as i said the details are very important in automotive battery system. Again as an example Huawei could not just poach TSMC engineer and develop 7nm fabrication technology on their own. Highly complex integrated system is not easy to copy. There is not one person that knows all the details this is specially true with battery system that crosses multiple discipline. Again no one could just copy TSMC's 7nm fabrication technology by poaching engineers. If it was that easy Intel could have just done that and solve their own 7nm fabrication problems. Huawei could have rolled their own advance fabrication process instead of going back to using old technology for their microchips. Both this company have enough money to poach as many TSMC engineers as needed if it was possible. Samsung also have trouble with their 7nm fabrication but they are not poaching TSMC engineers left and right.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good points, But again, Nissan for example has tech that can achieve pretty close to Tesla.

Obviously there has been an uptick in the parcel delivery service based on the increase in online shopping due to COVID-19. FedEx, the other big parcel delivery company, had earnings on 6/30 where they reported EPS of $2.53 vs. consensus estimate of $1.42. Revenue was down YoY by 2.5%. This caused share price to jump 12% (140 -> 158) overnight:\n\n[FDX Jump](https://preview.redd.it/39cn8pp0c7c51.jpg?width=1913&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fb85bcffab89ab3e3ec319e3fe476cdba6a4a82)\n\nAt the same time UPS jumped up and has been hovering around the same:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hang in there bby](https://preview.redd.it/q7mt4a5fc7c51.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24a8f8596c501254ad2c159e5431311a9170ce49)\n\nFedEx has a much lower contribution margin per package delivered as they are trying to cut prices to compete against UPS, which is approx. 3x larger anyway.  Anecdotally, I watch the UPS truck pull up to my apartment building and stay for around 30-45mins every day delivering packages, while I see the FedEx truck come maybe 2x a day where the driver will deliver one or two package.  It is my belief the UPS, as the king of logistics, has a much more efficient delivery system which allows more packages to be delivered per trip and thus increases the contribution margin of each package delivered by reducing variable costs related to vehicles and wages.  This is why UPS is going to kill earnings even harder than that guy in the FedEx costume killed that judge.\n\nI personally have 7/31 $125 and 8/7 $125c.\n\nTLDR: Get free money because people are scared to go outside\n\nEdit: Down a bit but I’m not too worried. I was doing a little reading and found that UPS used a fuel surcharge to cover that cost of their business right. But it’s set for a contract period, meaning that there is a lag between fuel prices actually changing and the fuel surcharge being adjusted. I’m thinking since fuel has been cheap across the board since Covid started they are probably making extra bank on their charge.
