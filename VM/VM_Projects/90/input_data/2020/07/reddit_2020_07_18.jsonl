{"title": "Back-of-the-envelope DD on why Berkshire should be priced at least 20 - 30% higher", "selftext": "*Disclaimer: I'm kind of retarded and am down half a bottle of Jack. Make your own investment decisions*\n\nAlright boys and girls, I'm going to try to keep this (relatively) brief, at least compared to some of the other DD on here. I'm not going to write about the history of the company because I'm assuming that anyone with a modicum of investment sense is already plenty familiar with Berkshire Hathaway. If you've never heard of this company, or are a MrBeast subscriber, please stop reading now - this is not for you.\n\nOk, so this write-up started with a thought I had while in the shower: If you were to breakdown Berkshire into each of its *income-generating* components, what would be the fair market value? As a second disclaimer, I think there was another post on here a week or two ago, but I don't have it saved and thus haven't linked it.\n\nTo do this, I copied BRK's quarterly statement of operations from their latest 10-Q and [converted it into TTM format](https://imgur.com/XBkMu2F) (Q1-20 + YE-19 - Q1-19). I then grouped it by operating segment to derive operating net income applicable to each business segment. If you're unfamiliar with Berkshire - the company, not daddy Buffett - their two main operating segments are Insurance (and other, $200bn TTM revenue) and Railroad, Utilities, and Energy ($41bn TTM revenue). When grouped by operating segment, we can see that Insurance netted \\~$18bn in net income over the TTM, and railroad activities netted \\~$8bn. I didn't include non-operating items like derivative contract gains(losses) or income tax expense, because honestly I don't give a fuck about those. If you're really concerned, just shave like 10% off the valuation. Go crazy.\n\nNow, I don't know know shit about insurance or [railroads](https://66.media.tumblr.com/85128b4b8593a963721d1b688163fbc9/tumblr_p7in6eVSQA1v1rrybo1_400.jpg). But I do know a *little* thing about multiples (emphasis on *little*; like I said, I'm kind of retarded). So rather than creating a super intricate financial model with lots of terminal values and shit, I compared the net earnings of each operating line  to the average P/E ratios of other publicly traded companies operating in those industries to derive an estimated fair market value for each component ([See Comps](https://imgur.com/ut2c1qn), 10-year data downloaded from StockRow).\n\nAs you can see in the attached image, multiplying BRK Insurance by the average TTM insurance industry P/E ratio (8.69) yields an estimated FMV of \\~$157bn. Similarly, adjusting net earnings by the average TTM P/E for railroads yields a FMV of \\~$189bn (ignore the 10-year figures, we'll get to that later). In aggregate, this means that the fair value of BRK's operating segments based on TTM data is approximately $347bn, or 75% of their current market cap.\n\nThe remainder, I believe can be attributed to BRK's investment portfolio. Something that caught my eye, and sparked the idea for this DD, was [this](https://imgur.com/xfJvRMw). Notice the divergence in each company's share price? Me too. Granted, I wouldn't expect BRK to be perfectly correlated to AAPL, but I would expect their beta to be at least somewhat similar considering BRK's AAPL holdings alone are worth *20% of it's own market cap.* But I digress.\n\nIn this back-of-the-envelope model, I attribute the remainder of BRK's FMV to its investment portfolio. To estimate the investment portfolio's FMV, I created a little reconciliation ([which you can view here](https://imgur.com/AcmRkVL)) to recalculate current FMV values of investments based on share-counts disclosed in BRK's most recent 13-F filing. Investment values as of the report date are recalculated, but these are just for comparison. I used May 1st (the date the report was filed with the SEC) as the base period to capture value at issuance, but this is *extremely* optimistic. The investments were more than likely valued in early-mid March and thus are likely to be severely understated on the final report.\n\nRecomputing the current FMV of investments (shares x closing price as of today) for BRK's 6 largest holdings - AAPL, AXP, BAC, KO, WFC, and KHC - gives us coverage of approximately 76% of BRK's total investment portfolio. For the remaining 24%, I just relied on the numbers reported on their Form 13-F since I'm a lazy POS and all about that copy/paste life. You can view them [here](https://imgur.com/rxf1oh8).\n\nOk, so now we have FMV estimates for BRK's operating segments and investment portfolio - now it's time to see how much the company is worth (*as a warning, I'm ignoring the conversion of market cap for BRK-A & BRK-B shareholders. Honestly I just don't give enough of a shit to recalculate it. % upside numbers are based on market cap though, not share price, so it is captured).*\n\n* Using TTM multiples for the insurance and railroad segments gives us a [FMV for BRK-B of \\~$238](https://imgur.com/tFIj9XW) \\- **a 26.12% upside**.  But should we really be using TTM multiples? I mean, by doing so we're capturing the already depressed share prices of our industry comps. What if this return to (relative) normalcy, and we see industry multiples revert back to their 10-year mean?\n* Using multiples equal to the 10-year average for each of our comparable industries, we get a [FMV for BRK-B of \\~$266.26](https://imgur.com/KIIQKPt) \\- **40.65% upside.**\n* Just for fun, I also calculated an estimated FMV using share prices for investments as of May 1 (the report date). This gave me an estimated [share price of \\~$217](https://imgur.com/0TEdwPC) **- a 20% upside**.\n\nTldr/Conclusion; Berkshire should be worth between $230 - $260 without even considering factors beyond operations or the investment portfolio. Anything below $210 is severely under-priced IMO. Berkshire was trading well above a $500bn market cap before the pandemic, and I doubt their core operations were impacted nearly enough to warrant the lower valuation. Hell, their operating segments are under-priced compared to peers using *current* multiples. The only justifiable reason I could see for them having a lower valuation would be if Warren enters into any more \"risky\" derivative contracts or buys any more shitty O&G companies, but frankly I don't (or at least hope it won't) see that happening.\n\nTldr;Tldr; BRK-B $250 01/21/22 LEAPs are looking mighty cheap.\n\n*Edit:* In my drunken stupor I accidentally mis-keyed a couple numbers.

But by this logic, if we're only talking auto insurance the most comparable company is Progressive. I'm not sure if it makes sense that Geico would be priced at a multiple of 3-5x while Progressive is at 11-14x, even considering future economic concerns, COVID, and stale cash.\n\nEdit: to clarify, I realize that multiples inherently factor future growth prospects, but even though I don't have a background in insurance, I doubt Geico vs Progressive's growth prospects are *that* different.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Insurance companies aren’t my space, and I don’t trade them or invest in them. So take this with a grain of salt, but I would think the multiple difference lies in the market share percentage trend over time, that progressive’s book is less concentrated in auto insurance, and that their infrastructure is more online friendly allowing for better growth prospects. \n\nBesides the cash position, take a look at all of Berkshire’s holdings and ask yourself where the growth will come from. They own a lot of mature companies. Think back to finance class about that bell curve where we go from startup, to high growth, to slowing growth, to peak (mature companies), and downhill from there.

Berkshire has notoriously very little volume, which I assume is why the price is currently far below what is - in my opinion - their intrinsic value.\n\nA play on Berkshire isn't short-term. It's the antithesis of what you normally see on WSB (which is why I posted it; I like to be different.)

BRK is well-known for its robust capital structure. In fact, of BRK's liabilities you could argue that deferred taxes and insurance float could even be classified as equity for valuation purposes. This is because DT assume the sale of stock (should probably subtract this for a sum-of-its-parts analysis though) and insurance float is basically negative-interest debt, since BRK collects more in premiums than they pay out.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Looks like your DD is paying off a bit today", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Glad to see it printing for ya.
