I proudly command over five figures in assets, own my own pre-owned vehicle, and have been managing options trades since discovering the Robinhood App in June. Suffice to say, I am a full bore hyper brain on par with Elon Musk or Vladimir Spootin.\n\nThere are two cliffs that the USA is about to drive off of. First - unemployment is running out and eviction moratoriums are being lifted. Meanwhile people are running out of money and getting infected at record rates. That is blood in the street in case you didn't know.\n\nThe second cliff is the US election. We have a super motivated incumbent president who knows that people will blame him if they get kicked out of their apartments. Therefore Trump has to print money like a Venezuelan vacationing in the Wiemar republic to make sure he can finally deliver on all his promises to ~~putin~~ the american people; building a kick ass wall, jailing clinton, and getting justice for epstein.\n\nWe have about ten days for something to happen.\n\nI believe that they will pass a second stimulus and enhanced unemployment benefits by mid august at the latest. Additionally AZN is about to release some good fucking news on Monday to pump the markets up bigly. If you're not already balls deep in AZN calls - fuck you, I don't think I can help you get in on that free money. However, I do think it's time to start making a ton of calls on SPY for August.\n\nTherefore I present to you:\n\n* SPY Aug 17 $330 Call (retail investors are finally going to catch the car on this one)\n* AZN Aug 28 $64 Call (they have won the vaccine race, it's all but announced)\n* PFE Sep 18 $36 Call (super cheap RN - PFE gonna make an announcement in early September to keep up on the news cycle)\n* JNJ Aug 28 $152.5 Call (look for breakthrough up to the $155 - $160 range due to inertia)\n\nLosers:\n\n* AAL Aug 7 $11 Put (case rates baby)\n* DIS Aug 7 $115 Put (case rates AND their going to have mechanical failures in florida, leading to dismemberment)", "id": "hu0d8a", "created_utc": 1595164776.0, "score": 124, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "Dismemberment?
