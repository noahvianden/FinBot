Trump, Democrats, and the Fed all have one thing in common- They will not allow people to become homeless even though there’s 55% unemployment and 45% of people haven’t been paying their rent.\n\n\n**They MUST print more money, or we will see civil unrest and turmoil like the US hasn’t ever seen.** By the end of 2020, the Fed will have printed around **15 trillion dollars this year alone**.

Gold is testing new ATH and will break 2000, and silver, historically trailing behind gold, will rise with it. It’s like you have a fucking golden crystal ball that is telling you the future.

People are scared, people KNOW something is wrong with the stock market soaring while they see massive unemployment and civil rest around them. Gold is good too, but Silver is fucking primed to moon. Don’t worry about little dips or spikes here and there.

A three year time frame means very little when looking at something that has a 5000 year price history. Don't think of it as a regular investment like an investment into a company... it isn't, and you're right to point out the difference. An investment in a Silver miner would be a better comparison (not a bad idea right now... they are all structured for $17 silver, $20+ silver is going to make a lot of mining companies very profitable).\n\nBut that misses the point. We are currently in a cycle where intangible *representations of wealth* are more valuable than tangible wealth. I am not arguing the validity of this valuation, let me be clear, but look at the weight of high 'future' earnings companies compared to high 'actual' earnings companies. It is an intangible representation of wealth. Future earnings are consistently highly prized in this economy. Now this could all be correct, and those who bet on them will do just fine. Again I'm not here to argue these valuations are wrong, just offer another perspective on what might happen.\n\nAn investment into a bullion like silver is like a contrarian bet on the tangible world as opposed to the intangible. Not dissimilar to an investment in housing, except silver has a 10 year Bear market to recover from, and housing doesn't. Investing in Silver right now could be the equivalent of investing in housing near the bottom of the great recession. You are poised to do very well, while the average investor tells you you're crazy to get into silver, as 'you only lose money'. \n\nSilver will follow inflation up, that's been it's history as a quasi industrial, quasi monetary metal. One reason for this behavior is that silver is a byproduct metal, and very difficult to target directly. This means that in times of economic turbulence, it's supply tends to dwindle as other commodities decrease in price (and therefore mining output decreases), but in times of economic expansion, Silver is in high industrial demand. A valid argument against all of this is that we are not witnessing any inflation. Correct, no *economic* inflation, but silver can follow *monetary* inflation, just as gold will. And there is no doubt we are witnessing monetary inflation at unprecedented levels, it's just that  decreased velocity is keeping this inflation under control. Gold massively outperforms as velocity picks back up and monetary inflation occurs.. silver gets dragged along as a monetary asset, before eventually slingshotting gold as industry kicks back into high gear.\n\nPersonally I'd try and get my hands on the physical stuff, as I have reservations about the actual delivery capacity of the paper market and only use it for short term trades, but I'm a total weirdo.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Enjoy wasting time and waiting on Silver..\n\nTQQQ did this in one day..\n\nhttps://ibb.co/1bLpqYW\n\n107 to 111 in one day in 3 hours..
