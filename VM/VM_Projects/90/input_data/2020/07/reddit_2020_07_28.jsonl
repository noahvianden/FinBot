AZN lowest with just below $10 🤔 \n\n* note: My feelings and the following are, I hope, more nuanced than the title would indicate. In no way do I think the two companies are in the same ballpark- this is about next steps, valuations, and the coming cuck of widespread price discovery on Warp Speed biotech.*\n\nTwitter is updated usually more frequently: MiltDavis\n******************\n\nDD\n —————————————————————\n\nThe story of Theranos is a commonly floated parable in Silicon Valley for fast-rising startups that speaks more to the excitement of the time we were in--and the pressure on startup CEO's to succeed-- than it did the individual players involved, namely the 21 year old founder/CEO Elizabeth Holmes and to a lesser extent, her partner Sunny Balwani.\n\nA decade ago, at the height of Silicon Valley mania once the dotcom bubble burst had become more history than cautionary tale, investors were wowed to the tune of a 10 billion dollar valuation by the BioTech startup Theranos and it's charismatic young CEO Holmes.  The Stanford dropout, after spending months locked away working on a thesis, had conceived and was now promising the ability to diagnosis a wide array of diseases using only one drop of blood and her own proprietary device--in less than four hours.  This shattered the industry  standard (QUEST, etc) of multiple IV blood draws done in a lab and sent for testing, an accepted but somewhat gruesome process that could take days  to produce results as the potentially ill patients and their doctors awaited the results.\n\nThe concept of one drop, wide-ranging diagnosis was beyond revolutionary; the most comparable recent memory in Silicon Valley being the innovations of the person she idolized and obsessed over; Steve Jobs and his reviving of Apple--only this one could save lives on a mass scale.  Imagine a machine in your home the size of a cell phone that could screen you for .  Through confidence and charm, she took advantage of the desperation of FOMO in a wide and prominent group of people who desperately wanted to be in on the ground floor a silicon valley \"unicorn\".  **Her biggest supporters  included some of the most popular and renowned faculty at Stanford, four star generals including recent Secretary of Defense Mattis, and even Henry Kissinger.**  They all served on her board, and raked in billions of dollars in investments from individuals and Venture Capitalists.  **Rupert Murdoch, Betsy DeVos and a wide range of other celebrities and politicians invested hundreds of millions by the time they were in Series B.**\n\nNevermind the fact that at this point Holmes was a college dropout without any successful previous research to show, or had presented any working demos of her product that could be verified by independent science, they were all in.  The world needed this now, and she was promising it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFast forward ten years and the entire market is reliant on the perception that COVID will be placed under control.  Upcoming elections, decimated economies, and lives lost have made the chase for a vaccine a higher stakes version of the Silicon Valley boom with the money and pressure to match. Large pharmaceutical companies like JNJ, PFE, and MERCK, are moving along slowly, encumbered by their internal bureacrocies and, more importantly, the need to get things right in order to protect their investors and reputations.  Merck's CEO Ken Frazier sounds caution at development speed and promises being made, but he is largely ignored after one day of headlines in favor of splashy headlines.  Smaller companies dive in and begin throwing their all into the hunt for a vaccine, particularly ones that have yet to have taken a previous trial vaccine development to fruition.  Once again, previously untested companies and leaders without a track record are throwing their hat in the ring and valuations are soaring on the prospect of success without any sound accomplishment.  **Traditonal timeframes of vaccine development--multiple years--are completely cast aside for swifter promises.**\n\nModerna thrives in this environment.  Their work in 2019 on an RNA vaccine for Zika was developed in a shockingly low--record breaking--amount of time.  **Their CEO Stephane Bancel was an excellent motivator, hype man, and cunning salesman--and still is.   He has secured distribution deals for his wholly incomplete Vaccine with Longa, and signed up the nation of Brazil to distribute his vaccine to their masses** that, while surprisingly keeping the virus contained in comparison to some of its South American neighbors, is in desperate need of a game changer to turn things around for their COVID denying President who was recently diagnosed and quarantined.  The deals are on the table before the work is done, but how could they not be?  After squeaking by medical approval thresholds which have been loosened by Operation Warp Speed's singular focus on expendience, they are starting the first Phase 3 trial in earnest on a whopping 30,000 people, even more than the initial 10,000 they sought.  They're in the big leagues.\n\nWhile MRNA is securing deals with countries, getting full backing from entire nations, the POTUS, and even the usually grim Fauci, Elizabeth Holmes is awaiting trial on federal charges for doing the same; her high profile investors are all seeking damages from being sold a bill of dreams.  **Previously celebrated deals with Walgreens and Safeway that fell through when the level of Theranos' failure was realized have caused those companies to feel the affects for years.**  Among other injustices, the CEO of Walgreens' demise was brought about by his blind reverence to Holmes, and losses for companies and individuals that bet on Theranos ran over a billion dollars.\n\nThat's because nobody knew 1) they were lying about their ability to deliver the product, let alone in the timeframe they proposed and 2) everybody believed the product would work because their large investments needed it to.  Theranos engaged in outright deception in order to push things along and keep their investors happy.  The White House wants to push things along and keep investors happy.\n\n**I don't think Moderna is lying.**  MRNA is not lying because they don't *have* to, and they are not cutting corners to the point of fraud because they don't have to; the government is doing it for them.  **Operation Warp Speed is not true government oversight nor regulated expedience, rather it is the US government issuing lax regulatory standards and weakened scientific accountability in multiple areas in order to get the good news out to the public faster on a consistent bases**.  Theranos created their own rules as they went along; Moderna is playing by the new rules created by our government, and a President determined to win re-election.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThree alarms were sounded that let folks know Theranos wasn't what it was cracked up to be which draw distinct parallels with Moderna\n\n**1) Sketchy practices by their leadership:** much like Elizabeth Holmes would bluster her way into higher valuations with grandiose claims, Moderna does similarly.  We often hear about the dates of further progress--both medicinal and regulatory-- before the trial data itself.  Just as Elizabeth Holmes repeatedly promised Walgreens, Safeway, and other business entities dates they would be ready to launch the obligations of their contract when she didn't even have a functioning prototype, Moderna routinely tells media and partners about the expected dates their vaccine will be ready before the study phases are complete, or have even started.  This puts their promoters in the same no-win situation Theranos investors were in.  I've read through several MRNA news articles, and it seems that the date of vaccine production fluctuates between two months and 9 months from now, the only difference being slight alterations in wording.  \"Vaccine production\", \"regulatory approval\" and other phrases are tossed around in a confusing melange that leads one to believe they could have a vaccine by the fall, but the fine print and wordplay they employ belies science that says otherwise. \n\n**1b) Sketchy practices by leadership have already led to lawsuits**, but quashed by media and the memory loss granted by time.  Suits were filed on behalf of Moderna investors after their initial stunts during early Phase trials in May and June.  Remember when the CEO announced great results coming and then dumped his stock, and we forgot about it?  His clients--Moderna's own investors--didn't https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200519006005/en/MODERNA-INVESTIGATION-INITIATED-Louisiana-Attorney-General-Kahn\n\n**2) Questionable science:** First of all, if they are talking producing a vaccine as fast as they claim, they have to work out a number of adverse effects in their product in a short period of time.  **While they can cross the 50% effectiveness threshold at producing antibodies, the amount and severity of side affects from their Phase 1 and 2 trials would indicate they have a long way to go in getting a product remotely ready for market.**  That's fine, because large pharma companies like Merck and JNJ are going through the same things-but they are NOT acting like it means they are ready for showtime anytime soon (PFE has recently changed their tune to swifter, as of today).  This is reminiscent of when Theranos swore they could do blood tests on their proprietary devices when they didn't even have the inner mechanics down.  What did Theranos do?  They ended up using EXISTING devices from pharma giants in secrecy and pretended it was their own proprietary devices, which sat discarded in labs between varying levels of disrepair.  Don't be surprised when you see Moderna latching onto JNJ, PFE, AZN and others' \"distribution methodology\"\n\n**2b) the big boys are catching up to them**, and their results are getting better than Modernas.  A look at the most recent trial data from PFE shows a much more robust immune responses than Moderna's, they just both happen to exceed regulatory federal requirements. \n\n**3) People expect them to do the impossible, and that is not their fault.**  Just like people wanted to believe every business in Silicon Valley had a legitimate shot at an insane valuation with the right promise. Warp Speed for better and worse has made it easier for smaller companies without the expertise to respond crucially to believe they can.\n\n**4) Patent issues:** Theranos was rife with patent issues, including a battle centered on the fact that they didn't own their own patent for a crucial part of their process.  Neither does fucking Moderna! https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/moderna-stock-sinks-as-patent-case-spurs-concern-for-covid-19-vaccine\n\nThis is another serious hurdle to profit that investors are overlooking.  *MRNA already has to keep pricing in accordance with new Presidential mandates and public demand; now they likely have to share the research they claim will be their golden ticket with another party.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nElizabeth Holmes and Theranos kept rising in popularity, prestige, and valuation until the reality of unrealistic expectations according to the science took over.  In that way, this situation is no different.  Just as Holmes graced the cover of almost every magazine including Forbes, Fortune, and WIRED, Stephane Bancel is becoming ubiquitous as we approach Phase 3 results.  But then what?  Even if they succeed in regulatory approval first, then what?  This company is going to revolutionize a vaccine and get it mass distributed before the other companies?  After the fall of Theranos, Quest and other diagnostics gaints came in and made changes based on some of their general concept, but mostly bolstered their current business. This won't be any different. \n\nPFE, Merck, and JNJ are the companies that will profit off of this pandemic.  **This vaccine race is not the creation of apps, or some TechCrunch call for \"disruption\"; this is the distribution of potentially multiple-shot vaccinations to billions of people that every politican, market, and human is counting on.  Passable trial results aren't enough, and a wink and a pat on the back from the President aren't good enough--especially when any Pharma company worth their salt is saying they won't initially profit and is prepared for short term losses.**  By the time a smaller, less-experienced business like Moderna has figured out how to distribute their first batch of 150,000 doses in conjunction with the government, the big pharma companies will have improved their own vaccine and stolen Moderna's; they will have the public's trust due to not being some new untrusted company and offering at cost, and therefore soak up the remaining government funds grants, and partnerships.  \n\n*Meanwhile, Moderna will be be fighting for their own damn patent so they can profit.*\n\nI don't think MRNA is purposefully deceptive, or evil, or that Bancel is anything like Holmes, but I do believe they are riding a hype train straight to hell.  And **I think the problem here is not Moderna, but that the desires of the administration have earned them a fall-guy position as poster children for Operation Warp Speed and America's answer to AZN.** What I stated in the opening sentence about Theranos applies here to Moderna; they're coming fall speaks more to the time we're in than MRNA themselves.\n\nAsk yourself; next year, when you go to get your vaccination shot, will the name Moderna mean anything to you aside from the faint recalling of some summer tendies you made that year prior?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\n**TLDR:** MRNA is being set up for failure without good leadership, realistic timetables, and unrealistic administration pressure.  Look for them to fall immensely behind once the hype from being \"first\" gives way to the reality of need for \"best\".  They on some Theranos shit.\n\n**PFE 12/18 45c**\n\n**JNJ 12/18 160c**\n\n**MRNA 1/15 75p** (wait until MRNA mania reaches a fever pitch closer to Phase 3 results)\n\n**VXRT 1/15 15c** *(Vaxart is creating something critical--a tablet version of the vaccine.  Once the big companies have gotten the vaccine ready for production, logistical uncertanties around distribution of multi-shot treatments to billions will send their value skyrocketing, and they are not far behind the others)*\n\n**I'm now prepared for you all to tell me \"Sir, this is a Wendy's\" and downvote me for length of post.**", "id": "hzgndu", "created_utc": 1595950022.0, "score": 233, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "That's a funny way to spell NKLA", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "That’s unfair, Theranos at least had fake blood test machines to show.", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Solid burn.\n\nThat's an upboat.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lolol", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Maybe moderna could hire them to create some CGI vaccines ?", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "As someone who started trading options one month ago with a sub $10k acct, the seemingly random fluctuations of relatively small-cap pharmaceutical companies are totally inscrutable to me (where can I find the clairvoyance to know why some company I've never heard of rockets 15% in a day)?

They are positioning themselves as an oral route of administration that is, at worst, just as good as the injection while reducing the need for an intramuscular injections. For this reason alone, managed care organization will flock to cover this medication because of the time it will save pharmacists and the storage capacity/extended shelf life that will come with an oral medication.

The fact that there are cases of reinfection for previously cured patients means that there is already a large enough volume of mutations currently circulating throughout the population to reinfect people. Also the fact that the virus can mutate within such a short time frame is also of concern. Getting a vaccine is not a guarantee to getting immunity. It takes years of continuous vaccinations among the entire population as well as the development of herd immunity for a vaccine to wipe out a virus completely. \n\nFor these reasons, I believe VXRT will successfully show positive results in their preclinical trials for COVID which should cause a large pop in the stock market.
