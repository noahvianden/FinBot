{"title": "Recovery may come sooner than you expect", "selftext": "I think the big players are watching the situation in Italy and how it'll unfold. That is the closest model for America and Europe in terms of culture (Western democracy that isn't welding people's doors shut), medical quality, and demographics (Italy is full of boomers but America is full of fat fucks, so they're both equally susceptible to death from the virus) because we'll never copy China's or Korea's containment measures, and Iran has no containment measures. Right now the market is dropping because of the UNCERTAINTY of how bad this thing will get. If new cases taper off soonish in Italy then there's a higher confidence of lower global damage (unless reinfections are possible...). Not saying we'll be back to ATH immediately because damage has already been done/will be done, but at least it'll slow the hemorrhaging.
