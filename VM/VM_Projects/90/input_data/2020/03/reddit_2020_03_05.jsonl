{"title": "YSK: Execution quality is far more important than the commissions you pay.", "selftext": "With the mass exodus from Robinhood occurring and people complaining about paying commissions at the other brokers, it is important to understand why execution quality is more important than your commissions. I’ve pointed this out to a few people, but figured everyone could benefit from understanding why this is important. All it takes is a $0.01 difference to make up for the commission paid. Let’s look at an example.\n\nYou’re looking to buy a call, bid is $4.99 and ask is $5.01. On RH, you’re likely going to have to pay the ask, so you get filled at $501 for 1 contract. At another broker, you can get filled at the midpoint or the bid. Let’s assume the midpoint of $5. Order is filled and you pay a total of $500.65 ($500 for the contract + $0.65 for the contract commission). \n\nThis is a small example on an option with a tight spread, but what about when volatility rises or there options are illiquid? Let’s look at another example. \n\nLooking to buy a put. Bid is $8.50, ask is $9.00. At RH, which has poor execution quality, you get filled at $8.80 so $880 total. At a reputable broker, you get filled at $8.75 and pay the $0.65 commission, so $875.65 total. Which would you rather pay? \n\nBut OP, RH fills me at the same price. No, no they don’t. There is actually a lawsuit against them right now for not filling at NBBO. \n\nAlso, payment for order flow is negotiated by each individual broker. This information is all published in the broker’s 606 Report. Read about execution quality. Read about price improvement. \n\nYou are much better off paying commissions at one of the big 4 rather than getting “free trades” at one of these start ups that have other glaring problems. Again, execution quality only needs to be better by $0.01 per contract to makeup $0.35 in savings on the total.   \n\nThis is a difficult concept to grasp, because people can see the commissions they are paying on paper and assume the price they get filled at is irrelevant to bottom line. For said reason, don’t place market orders or stop orders on options. Use your limit orders, get better fills, pay the commissions, and you will be much better off in the long run.", "id": "fdoq6o", "created_utc": 1583377172.0, "score": 441, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "A+ post", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "This Honestly is,  I use fidelity and there are many times I get a better price or even the price I want by putting a limit order in for the Bid.

AI really is in its infancy, *Silicon Valley* (the show) was just fiction after all, so whether to invest / how much to invest is still quite debatable.\n\nThat said, I do think within 30 years AI is more likely than not to be a common aspect of our lives.  One important question is how proprietary can that sort of tech be, though, but if anything that does point you more towards a fund rather than individual companies.\n\nAnyway, yes certainly, you can buy ETFs from other brokerages - it's in the fund's interests to have more buyers.
