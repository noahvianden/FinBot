You can’t compare the peak daily rate of a virus who’s most significant danger only lasts weeks or months to an activity which is consistently dangerous for a lifetime. \n\nThe chance of the average US citizen dying in a car crash is a little less than one percent. The chances that any individual worker would BOTH contract AND die from the virus is lower than that by at least an order of magnitude, and that would hold true even if millions of Americans end up contracting it.
