Central banks would rather have hyper inflation than have markets go down and our current president(and most presidents) would rather run huge fiscal deficits as well. Modern Monetary theory, which most central bankers follow, will result in rising prices/markets in the long run and because no present day central banker/politician wants to “contract” the market/economy it will result in ever increasing deficits and eventually hyper inflation. They will debase the currency before they ever allow markets to reach true equilibrium or get back to what we had in 2009.\n\nMy reasoning for increasing growth is that people continue to try and improve their lives by making processes more efficient, it’s human nature. Capitalism incentives these individuals to have to continually improve or invest in people/businesses/assets or provide service/use to people or risk eventually running out of purchasing power due to inflation and going hungry.\n\nThere’s a reason people like Warren Buffet can say with certainty that markets will be higher in the future.
