The virus is still spreading rampant and my best guess is that most of you fuckers will end up getting it.  So you're (hopefully) going to stay inside and not spread that shit around. I probably have it, you probably have it, and I have no fucking clue but I'm pretty healthy and feel like shit right now so it's hard to tell. \n\nAll of these people going out to bars because they have \"nothing else to do\" are going to spread it. The guy that put the bottles in the boxes and shipped them out are going to spread it to the people at the bars. People at the bars are going to leave it for the next wave of bar comers.  This goes for EVERY SUPPLY CHAIN not just bars.  More people are going to turn up sick and infected, and they'll be a ton of unreported cases.\n\nStates are turning patients AWAY and REFUSING physician testing and treatments in hospitals.  I also know a PA which is how I know this as well.  Pilot friends are saying flights are empty as fuck and government friends are shutting down our watershed here (specifically in Atlanta).  The watershed shutdown decision was literally TODAY. \n\nThey are doing everything they can in the media to hold the markets down and keep it steady, I'm not trying to fear monger but this shit is NOT over YET.  I've been living in Atlanta for four years now and I have NEVER seen the interstates so empty during rush hour times for as long as they have been, ever.  And this all started middle of last week.  So the \"stay home\" ramp up has just begun.  Trumps lack of confidence in his answers of questions asking about a recession or depression are big.  Markets are sideways right now, there will be another dip before a run back to the top. \n\nThis market crash isnt a market based on financial incompetence like it was in 2008, it's a market based on a global health impact.  The more people that stay at home, the less money in circulation.  Demand lowers. Supply is SUPPOSED to increase, but is totally fucked up right now in global supply chains, supply has decreased.

{"title": "Fundamentals, technicals, market action all point towards shorting TSLA", "selftext": "What up autists. I was reading [market wizards](https://smile.amazon.com/Market-Wizards-Interviews-Top-Traders/dp/B00BYKKJPQ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=market+wizards&qid=1584480584&sr=8-1) today and the first autist they interviewed talked about how the best bets have all 3 things that point a direction: fundamentals, technicals, and market action. And I'm here to tell you that all 3 are pointing towards TSLA going down.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nWe all know we're headed towards a recession from the bat flu, and WSBGod himself could not design a company to be more vulnerable to the situation. Growth stocks do worse during a recession because growth slows/reverses and people go into value. Luxury goods and expensive big ticket purchases go down because people are trying to save money, which is why China automobile demand was down [81.7%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-auto-sales-plunge-in-february-amid-virus-shutdown/2020/03/12/5d4bbe02-644b-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html) in February. And the specifics of the bat flu has already caused supply chain problems for TSLA: they had to use an [old autopilot processor](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/03/05/coronavirus-forces-tesla-old-autopilot-processors-chinese-model-3/) in their Chinese Model 3 shipments. Everything on a fundamental level points to them getting fucked.\n\n# Technicals\n\nI'm not very good with crayons, but just look at Tesla's performance over the past few months, or as I call it, the sad mountain. Why would anyone ever buy a stock that looked like this?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8b92cq50bn41.png?width=2780&format=png&auto=webp&s=d579137db809bdeb8cca2733e07973a233c5ccc7\n\n# Market Action\n\nFinally, there's how the stock reacts to news: if a bull cycle, all bad news get ignored and the stock keeps going up. This is not specific to TSLA, but we're definitely in the bear market: remember how the market tanked 10% the day after the Fed announced QE on Sunday? That's very much a bear market indicator. And today, even though the SPY went up 6%, TSLA was actually **down** 3.5%! Even on the *incredible* news that the SPY was mooning, TSLA still went down. Nothing's going to make this shit moon. As further proof, look at how it's performed compared to some others in the past month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w79pzndu0bn41.png?width=2992&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b89b74138370b5311fe97060e414270e4aefd67\n\n# But it's already down 50% and puts are expensive...\n\nThis doesn't fucking matter. This is the exact same argument that people made against buying AMZN in 2017, saying it's PE ratio was 100+ and it's went up too much and blah blah blah mew mew mew. Just like in bull markets you have to pay for quality, in bear markets you have to pay for inverse quality.  I think that's the lesson I've really learned from this past month is that stuff can fall faster and harder than ever imagined. Thinking \"it's already down so much...\" is the reason people missed SEAS and SIX and we shouldn't make the same mistake here.\n\n# But I don't wanna bet against Papa Musk\n\nAh... here comes the real objection. If anyone other than Papa Musk helmed TSLA they would have never even risen about 100 bux, much less now be in a position now to fall from 900 to 420 again. Normally I'd agree with you, but Elon has fallen victim to the affliction that so befalls many great men: hubris. He may have bested the SEC and short sellers, but then he got cocky and went up against the great bat god himself, and now he knows fear. Here was his original tweet on March 6, just 11 days ago:\n\n[Flying too close to the bat stew...](https://preview.redd.it/vnhhn1492bn41.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=77649568a437a9daa441580577b04eb898ad98a1)\n\nAnd here's his tweet just yesterday:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9r96idve2bn41.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c6b235ae6e7781be0ac3542ae69e7fd0623e7d\n\nChloroquine is a drug the Chinese found has some help for bat flu treatment. If the panic is dumb, why is he reading up on treatments/tweeting about it? **He's shook!** He knows he fucked up and now it's gonna cost him. He's panicking by [keeping the Telsa factories](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/musk-keeps-tesla-open-shutdown-zone-downplays-virus-risk) open during all this despite every fucking reason not to, and it's going to cost him. He knows he has to make delivery numbers to keep his stock up, but he's gonna slip up and half his work force is going to get the flu. This flu has shown that even gods like [Heimdall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/arts/idris-elba-coronavirus.html) are mortal, and Elon Musk is just a man, and all men can bleed.\n\n# TSLA 350 Puts 5/15 Expiry (after 4/22 earnings)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/366g0jbw3bn41.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ce9a8f1757b38c1e943a64f596e33978bdb8da\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Lots of people are saying don't bet against Musk, and normally I'd agree with you: one of Musk's greatest strengths is his ability to spin stories and inspire his base. But you know who else had that strength and has shown that he can get fucked by the bat flu? The other papa, PAPA TRUMP. Both of them have seemed invulnerable before this, but that's because they were both battling other men before, not a force of nature like the coronavirus. All their usual meme tweets won't do shit in the face of actual biological decline and people getting sick and dying in hospitals. Everyone bleeds.\n\nEdit 2: Just read [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjrjkt/some\\_actual\\_tesla\\_dd\\_for\\_you\\_all\\_phone\\_call\\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjrjkt/some_actual_tesla_dd_for_you_all_phone_call_with/).
