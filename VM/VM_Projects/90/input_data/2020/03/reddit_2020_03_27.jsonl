This data is from a few weeks ago and the stock has been volatile, so take it with a little grain of salt. I am talking about Diversified Gas & Oil, ticker Symbol LON:DGOC. If you enjoy it, I have made a few videos explaining their unique business model.\n\n\n  **Fundamentals**\n\n1.\tHas a positive free cash flow (yield of less than 4);\n\n2.\thas a good p/e ratio of below 3 (changes a lot due to volatility);\n\n3.\thas an amazing dividend yield of 12-15% (changes a lot due to volatility);\n\n4.\tall these valuations are expected to increase due to company policies and production;\n\n5.\thedged >90% of production for the next 18 months, so resilient to the current drop in commodity prices;\n\n6.\tROIC of 25% - for comparison, shell has an ROIC of 8% and is considered to trade at an attractive price right now;\n\n7.\tProduction growth of 1700%+ since IPO;\n\n8.\tCAGR of ~200% since IPO;\n\n9.\tBreakeven price of gas production at 1,48 USD, while competitors in the area tend to break even in the 2,70 USD – 3,20 USD range.  \n\n\n  **Management**\n\n1.\tSolid operational cash flow policy; 40% to dividend, 40% to pay off loans; even though the balance sheet looks bad, this policy makes it a financially healthy company;\n\n2.\tstrong cash policy; the price of cash (no interest) causes them to rather lend when necessary than to have it on their bank account doing nothing.  \n\n\n  **Events**\n\n1.\tIn April 2019, they started a buyback program. Prices hoovered around 120 pence back then (currently trading around 60). They had 2 options what to do with the extra cash (because they will not go further than 40% of cash flow to dividends); pay off loans or do share buybacks. Pay back loans would return 5% interest. At a dividend Yield of 10%, share buybacks are considered to give that yield back. This basically means that the company management is comfortable enough that A) they are able to pay off loans and B) that they will have a higher rate of return annually than 5%;\n\n2.\tsince then, prices have only dropped. In June 2019, both founders bought 100k shares each at 111 pence. In august 2019, several other management members bought shares, averaging around 101 pence. In February 2020, 5 board members, including the CFO, CEO and cofounders, all bought back shares at prices of 91 and 92 pence. As of me writing this, the share price is trading at 72 pence, so you are able to get it at a 20%+ discount compared to the insiders;\n\n3.\tthe share buyback will draw its conclusion in April 2020. On February 14th, 2020, they bought a whooping 5,5 million shares back, causing the share price to go from 85 to 89 in an instant. Because of this, they haven’t been able to buy back the remaining 2,6 million shares to conclude their buyback;\n\n4.\tin the unlikelihood that the company does not grow any further and just milk the fields that they currently possess, over 6,2 billion US dollars is expected to be generated as cash flows in the next 38 years (over 10 times the current market cap);\n\n5.\tof this amount, 2,9 billion US dollars is expected to be paid out in dividends (over 5 times of the current market cap); again, this is only when they are unable to obtain any other fields. They are still looking to buy more assets.\n\n\n  **Upcoming events (possible catalysts)**\n\n1.\tNatural gas is currently trading at historically low levels. A price increase this year will cause a surge in the stock price;\n\n2.\tWhen the natural gas prices drop further, buying opportunities become more likely. A good buying opportunity could cause a price increase; \n\n3.\tDGOC is looking to get to the main market of London in early Q2 2020. This will cause an increase in stock demand, since they will be included in the FTSE index (e.g. index fund managers will be forced to buy this stock, regardless of what price it is trading at).
