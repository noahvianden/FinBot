{"title": "Bad news kills bear markets", "selftext": "You dont understand why the markets go up when 3,283,000 Americans were in the queue of newly registered unemployed on Thursday.? \n\nThe paths of global stock markets may seem irrational, which became evident in the past week when both price declines and negative sentiment in a split second turned to notable increases.\n\nThe unemployment figure not only exceeds everything we've ever seen, but it also puts so much distance from the previous record of 695,000 in 1982 that you can hardly grasp it.\n\nThere are, of course, good reasons for the remarkable fluctuation. Because with the corona virus we all know all too well that shutting down societies and calling for social distance puts everything on pause. You don't have to be an economics professor to understand that it can have huge consequences, cause massive unemployment and put global economics under serious pressure. Even the fucking autists on here, and their wifes boyfriend know to buy puts.\n\n**In other words, Thursday's US unemployment rate was decidedly bad news. But how on earth did bad news turn into good news in the global stock markets?**\n\n**They did this by creating clarity.**\n\nSecurity beats poor key figures. Investors are concerned about companies' future earnings and opportunities. Therefore, they are often something similar to six months ahead when assessing whether an investment is interesting or not.\n\nSix months of great uncertainty due to the corona virus is a lot, and any element that can eliminate uncertainty is met with a kissing hand. Likewise, huge state aid packages and central banks want to do whatever it takes, of course.\n\nWhen the sellers in the market have got everything that is lousy prospects on the table and do not have more scare and doomsday scenarios, they also get ready to flip the cart and buy up\n\nWhen the unemployment figure was published on Thursday, it was probably a tummy tuck to many, but a tummy tuck you can feel, so to speak. There are facts on the table and real information that you can relate to. It is uncertainty that is converted to security. And it is fear of even worse data being put to shame.\n\n**No doubt the uncertainty remains high in the global financial markets, but with the initial sensations of how bad the current crisis is (and will be), investors can incorporate it into the current stock prices.And that is exactly why bad news often kills a bear market. When investors get real data, they can take into account the ills and difficult times ahead, eliminate the uncertainty and recognize the facts.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I think, unfortunately, the coming weeks and maybe even months will offer much more uncertainty and great volatility - but my guess is as good as yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Bad news are good because it reduces uncertainty**\n\nPositions:  [https://imgur.com/a/KCK4AGw](https://imgur.com/a/KCK4AGw)", "id": "fqlu1t", "created_utc": 1585407961.0, "score": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "If bad news is good, and good new is good.
