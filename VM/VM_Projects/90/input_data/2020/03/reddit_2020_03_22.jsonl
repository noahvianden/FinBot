{"title": "Uber and Lyft", "selftext": "Alright so here‚Äôs the thing, they are absolutely fucked no matter what these analysts want to sell you.\n\nUber has yet to turn a profit. In fact was it their last quarter? They had spent 1.4 billion and had a revenue of 1.2 billion?\n\nBy the end of 2020 Uber had said they would finally turn a profit however look what‚Äôs happening. If they make a profit (they won‚Äôt) I‚Äôll donate plasma for a year. \n\nThe better argument for why Uber and Lyft shares are currently inflated is the following, which was pointed out to me last night. In fact if you research it you can see the biggest reason why they are priced currently at $21. \n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/011516/companies-are-funding-uber-and-lyft.asp\n\nThat‚Äôs like 99% of the worlds wealth being rolled into Uber and Lyft despite them getting fucked right now. MM‚Äôs and Analysts will shine that shit until there is nothing left because they have the most to lose. \n\nBut reality looks more like this:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/uber-drivers-say-earnings-fall-and-many-have-no-other-income\n\n‚ÄúThe capital markets continue to be exceptionally bountiful for growing upstart companies such as Uber and Lyft. However, those conditions can change overnight if markets hit a speed bump, limiting or delaying growth for the ridesharing business as venture capitalists and Wall Street hit the road.‚Äù\n\nNow here‚Äôs my anecdotal evidence;\n\n‚ÄúToday I went driving for the first time in about 3 weeks. When all of this (Coronavirus) started I was moderately worried but thought the immense grocery shopping and toilet paper hoarding was nothing more than a hype.\n\nI had decided to sign up for Uber Eats for the first time ever for more business as I figured it would be booming. Having driven for quite sometime I was approved for Uber Eats in a matter of 10 minutes.\n\nAfter more than 2 hours of driving sitting outside a manufacturing plant in a major city surrounded by college campuses and food industry I made $11.00. \n\nMy toilet paper I purchased from Walmart was $20. I had 3 ride requests, one for Uber Eats which got canceled because the restaurant didn‚Äôt have the food available. The next one had been a rider who was getting laid off next week worried about not being able to find a new job.\n\nI asked them if they‚Äôve had issues finding drivers when using the service; that was not the case. My assumption is there is a high supply of drivers all vying for the decreased market to pay their bills. \n\nWe are the portion of the population who will be forgotten about. People are getting laid off, they aren‚Äôt taking Uber‚Äôs or eating out. I had thought business would be booming but it‚Äôs anything but. \n\nI don‚Äôt think I could even apply for unemployment as an Uber driver because outside of California we aren‚Äôt considered employees but independent contractors which means sick leave is also not an option. \n\nSo yes Uber and Lyft are fucked, especially Lyft.\nBut the MM‚Äôs will do everything to keep them propped up beyond reality.", "id": "fn2zj3", "created_utc": 1584896811.0, "score": 126, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "MM is the new scare monger of this sub", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "And that's when they made their 9th move...", "score": 43, "replies": []}, {"body": "Jeff Bezos alone has more money than all of reddit users combined.
