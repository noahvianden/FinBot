{"title": "Update from Robinhood on the outages", "selftext": "[https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders)\n\nThey acknowledge the issues encountered today morning on the platform. Issues are primarily scaling to the volume which has increased significantly during past few days. For example, Friday SPY registered volume of some 385-400 million against an average of 134 million. I am guessing RH infra isn't used to such volume. I have experienced this first hand plenty of times lately. For example, limit orders at market open are just bad bets and almost always will turn in losses for options. Regardless of the actual price of the option, it have consistently filled my order at my limit price, which can hurt pretty bad while buying if the option price is significantly cheaper than your limit entry. Yesterday only RH executed TSLA 3/06 500 Puts for $3 each where as the bid-ask was in the range of $1, I instantly lost 2$ per contract because of this shit and its not the first time. My bad for putting limit orders as I didn't wanna get up early on my freaking birthday (PST 630). \n\nTLDR: They've clearly mentioned that outages are infrastructure issue which reflect about poor scaling architecture design.  This means it's a bigger problem to fix and such outages will definitely continue at least in near future which is a bad sign for us to trade options which is a blink and miss game. I will be moving to ToS as there's absolutely no reason to stay with RH at this point.", "id": "fd5arv", "created_utc": 1583285357.0, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "At this point, the USERS would be financially irresponsible to continue investing with Robinhood in any capacity.\n\nThey're done.", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "kinda, but there's a big problem.\n\nACATS takes about a week.  probably longer, coming from rh.  this would lock most people out of the market for a week.\n\nand to close our positions/transfer money out, we'd have to be able to actually log into robinhood, in the first place.\n\nso... we're between a rock and a hard cock.\n\nie:  i'm getting the hell out of there, but this transition is going to unfortunately take time.  no matter how i do it.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Applied for a full transfer to Schwab last night.

Throwing more CPU power at a distributed system only helps for so long until significant investments need to be made to re-architect the solution and C-Level executives rarely ever listen to software engineers telling them that feature work needs to be halted to refactor the code. I am at a company that was recently dubbed a unicorn, but the code we are running on came from a startup mentality that will not work at scale. This is a common problem with companies trying to scale up but at the same time stay competitive. I would bet a lot of money Robinhood is under extreme stress from investors trying to stay competitive, which leaves fewer engineers to deal with underlying problems.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "This. Also, a lot of companies, even start ups, run on old-hat ideas around virtualization and server costs. Things like keeping CPU utilization around 70-80% (why would you pay for more cycles if you don’t use them). \n\nAlso - with Robinhood they may not be able to take their data into the cloud as easily as your typical e-commerce startup. Fintech falls into the same regulation hole that the healthcare industry does - they have to protect incredibly sensitive data. That can often require on-premise compute and storage, which is a lot harder to scale than something like AWS. So for a startup to reach that kind of scale, they need to invest heavily in upfront server costs, which most companies these days would never do. Cloud is just infinitely more affordable and flexible to demand. \n\nAll of that being said, fuck Robinhood.

Budgets are allocated long before any potential high-demand events. You can’t just always be running double the server capacity just in case, servers are really freaking expensive at scale. The larger and more bureaucratic the company, the more of a hassle planning and budgeting can be. \n\nIt’s possible RH doesn’t even use an automated virtual server provider, which would make scaling quicker if they could get immediate budget approval on a dime. Instead they may operate on custom servers on bare metal that require new deals with their data center to provision the new hardware. Then that hardware needs to be bootstrapped for their application and that’s a process that takes longer than a few hours. \n\nMoreover, it can just as much be that the way the code was written had a flaw that was exposed by a short outage. Making recovering from the outage take even longer than fixing what the problem was in the first place. For example, say they forgot to account for a leap year and immediately realize it 10 minutes after market open. They push a fix but they have their entire queue of orders that piled up in the meantime pointing to the wrong day, they then have to fix all of that data in the queue, test their fix, run QA, and increase their server capacity to account for processing of the data cleanup, new orders coming in, and ensuring that the order in which they’re executed is correct. As time goes on they realize they might not get it all resolved by market close and they need a strategy for dealing with expiring contracts and the code to boot. \n\nIt’s a lot more complicated that just throwing money at it.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Agree.
