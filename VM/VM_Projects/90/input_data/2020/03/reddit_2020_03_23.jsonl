For the uninitiated, IV is Implied Volatility and in Gayman's terms, it's stonk going up and down a lot bigly. For your OTM SPY puts, this means premium go down even though stonk go down. \n\nSo did it peak? VIX, something used to track volatility, hit its (as of now) peak at $82.69 on March 16th. Since then, it has declined to around $60. This spike was largely caused by former God Emperor (he has since been demoted to the role of tendie taker) Trump declaring a national emergency on March 13th, and the Fed cutting rates to 0 on March 15th. So the current answer is yes, it did peak as of now because of  Trump and the money machine going BRRRR, which took the shortsighted retards on Wallstreet by surprise. \n\nWill it go up again? The hope (for my SPY puts) is that volatility will increase with the (un)jobs report coming out on Thursday, which is expected to show an increase in the number of NEETs nationwide. The market seems to have been increasing its tolerance to bad news which means it'll take more bad stuff to happen to make SPY puts go up.
