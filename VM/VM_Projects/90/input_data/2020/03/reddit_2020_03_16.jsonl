This doesn't mean it'll recover, it just means it's fairly confident that the worst has happened and now it's a matter of putting the pieces back together again. This could be months, a year, or maybe several years during which the market meanders.\n\nFor the markets to calm down and start bottoming out, I think we at least need the infection rate to plateau. We are about to go exponential in North America. Asia has plateaued, but is China reporting accurate numbers? Is a redux possible in that region? How are places like Singapore even functioning at this time? Can we mimic them?\n\nWe'll probably also need some form of temporary Universal Basic Income for those who can't work from home.
