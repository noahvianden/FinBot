{"title": "VIX Futures for Autists", "selftext": "I've noticed a few of us autists likes myself have had questions regarding VIX and a couple of it's related derivative funds, VXX, ~~XIV~~. I would like to share some information to help clarify things and potentially be clarified by smarter autists than me. \n\n\nThis post may be a bit derivative (pun) and for that I am sorry. \n\n\nTldr: VXX $37c 3/13\n\nBackground:\n\nTrading VXX is not trading VIX. In fact, you cannot trade VIX directly. You can only trade using derivatives of VIX, such as futures, options, ETFs or ETNs (1). The ticker symbol for INDEX:VIX is $VIX.X and options holders should be aware that it trades European style. That's the thing where you swap spit with your partner's Italian lover. \n\n\nFor the special people among us who don't know what VIX is, go Google it now, dummy. Because, if you don't know that VIX is itself based on S&P 500 options interest then shit is about to get very weird pretty quickly because this means that when you buy or hedge on VIX derivatives you are basically trading a derivative of a derivative of a derivative (1). Mind=blown. \n\n\nIt will benefit you to think about where other people are hedging on VIX, and by extension the S&P 500, because VXX leverages futures interest on VIX. It is important to know that VXX is a derivative fund of VIX futures. It is based on VIX but it is not VIX. You should also know that VXX had a *now defunct* twin named XIV. \n\n\nIn fact, there are quite a few other ETFs and ETNs that are derivatives of VIX, which include VIXY, VIXM, VIIX, EXIV, VXZ, not to mention the leveraged ETFs TVIX and UVXY. Unless you like shooting cocaine directly in your dick I wouldn't mess with any of those.\n\n\nVXX buys the first two months of VIX futures while ~~it's less sexy twin XIV sells short the futures contracts of VIX~~ (2). The fluctuations in price of VIX derivatives values lead to a sexy situation known as contango and backwardation, which also just so happens to also be the names of the best sex positions.\n\n\nRight now we are in backwardation which just a fancy way to say that near term futures are more expensive and futures curve of VIX is downward sloping (3). This boosts the sale of VXX and drops XIV's feet in the air. Eventually VIX futures swap positions and the opposite action will happen. VXX will be bottom and ~~XIV will be on top~~. This is when VIX goes contango, which is when near term VIX futures are cheaper than longer term VIX futures (1). When they swap they touch eachother and that can be fun to watch. \n\n\nStrategy: \n\nA contagion like CoVID-19 creates a situation where the long term outlook isn't ideal and we expect further volatility. We expect that the market will be overvalued in certain assets based on the future assessed value of a stock so the futures and options interest for the S&P 500 fluctuate. If shit hits the fan now what will happen to earnings reports in the Spring? This leads VIX to rise which in turn allows VXX to bend in ways you never thought imaginable. \n\n\nPositive changes in VIX tend to be less frequent, but greater in size than negative changes (1). VIX will rise pretty quickly and drastically and fall at a slower pace. VXX moves similarly against the price movement of VIX since it is based on VIX futures.\n\n\nDo you think that COVID will be cured tomorrow and the S&P 500 will rise in the near term causing put and call volume to point VIX downward? If so, then keep your puts on VIX, or better yet try trading on SVXY. If you think that shit is going to hit the fan tomorrow then buy calls on VIX or trade VXX. You also can buy calls on VXX, which is what I do because I think it provides me more time to pull out (6).\n\n\nSources:\n\n(1).https://www.macroption.com/trading-vix/\n\n(2). https://qz.com/1066015/the-vix-vxx-svxy-and-volatility-linked-etfs-betting-on-risk-is-risky/\n\n(3). http://tradinggods.net/what-is-vix/contango-and-backwardation/\n\n(4). https://www.macroption.com/vix-futures-curve/\n\n(5). https://www.macroption.com/vix-calculation/\n\n(6). My ass.\n\nEdit: \n\nI am an idiot don't follow my trade you dummy. \n\nAlso, VIX and it's derivatives suffer from decay over time so holding them is not a wise option unless you are trying to leverage the decay via puts but only Einstein's know how to do that move.\n\nAlso, XIV is defunct now. I thought it was reissued along with the new VXX and I was wrong.

{"title": "Doomed to Boom. Sectors that Eat Vectors", "selftext": "Every time you put your snout to the trough, you raise your ass to the wind. It’s raining dicks out there, and I’m the guy with the umbrella. Don’t believe me? Keep reading.\n\nShortly after the H1N1 fiasco I shared a flight to Denmark with a highly placed WHO official who basically gave me a nine-hour seminar on virology (the real deal, not the shit Pearl Jam album). He made such an impact that last year I decided to write a hard SF novel on a near-future viral pandemic—which I now have no hope of selling whatsoever. Because of that cosmic coincidence I’ve been on this crisis since the first [stories](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/01/cases-spike-wuhan-mystery-pneumonia-cluster) began circulating in the New Year. It sounded so much like what dude had talked about that I began regularly trolling the web for reliable data. Then it was a matter of checking the boxes. Transmission rate substantially higher than flu. Asymptomatic transmission. CFR substantially higher than the flu. I realized very early that this was the real fucking deal, that it would be the biggest thing to hit us humies since WWII.\n\nThat’s when I entered the WTF phase. It began with WTF are the Chinese doing, until they dropped the hammer and it became WTF is the WHO doing? I mean, the dude who told me was WHO! They. Fucking. Knew. And yet they not only jumped on the wishful thinking bandwagon, they gassed her up and stomped on it. Sure, they’ve hit the brakes since, but tell that to your Grandpa’s tombstone.\n\nThe CDC, however, didn’t surprise me. I had learned about Trump successively cutting the CDC’s budget, and dismantling the Whitehouse’s pandemic preparedness team while researching my novel. What isn’t widely reported is that he also tried to close down the [National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Biodefense_Analysis_and_Countermeasures_Center) at Fort Detrick, MD. I mean, what the fuck?!? I even—and this blows my mind now—joked to my buddies last summer that the Russians had probably instructed him to do so in preparation for a biological attack. (I don’t believe this, being a big fan of [Hanlon’s razor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/Hanlon%E2%80%99s%20razor), but I hope some investigative reporter follows up, especially if the bug magically spares Moscow).\n\nMy biggest WTF, however, I reserved for the markets. One tenth of humanity was locked down, and they kept racking up record after record. I’m still bedazzled by the daily demonstration of mass idiocy that is the world’s financial system. Great Recession is a best case scenario. Remember this when it [begins raining CLO’s](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/09/22/leveraged-loans-and-collateralized-loan-obligations-are-riskier-than-many-want-to-admit/#467276506602). \n\nUp to this point I had been a pretty passive investor, chasing megatrends in my self-directed registered retirement account, and doing quite well. Thinking that every WTF must have an ETF exploiting it, I figured it was time to leap into financial action. I mean, I knew what was about to happen next. Not only was it written into SARS-CoV-2, it was written across Hubei province. What happened there, was going to happen here, only absent the Tyranny needed to set things aright.\n\nBut of course, there was no WTF ETF. So I decided to invent my own, and off I went into the thrilling, endlessly fascinating world of researching those sectors doomed to boom. Now I’m not sure what to make of this sub’s rules at this point, because it seems like I’m supposed to be upfront about my positions without actually endorsing them. (I only found this (fucking brilliant) sub because of Bloomberg fretting about retail investors [actually passing enough wind to change the weather](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market)). So, I’m going to stick to sectors and say, yes, I own a shitload in that sector.\n\nA little breather so that millennials can gas up their sputtering attention spans…\n\nI’m not a gambler: my only interest is to make enough money for my kids to have a chance of surviving the wheezing shambles my generation has made of this world (and for that I am more bloody sorry than you can know). Vaccines are hard as fuck to make, and even harder to make right. Remember that the common cold is a coronavirus. If you want to invest in a cure for the common cold, then, well, you’re not investing, you’re gambling. At least Vegas has buffets and hookers.\n\nDiagnostic testing isn’t quite so bad as vaccines, but there’s so many players, so many approaches, technologies, that you would need a big basket indeed to cover your downside. Just set aside a little money to straighten your crossed eyes afterward. To think of the t t i i m m e e I’ve wasted.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a no brainer—I made enough dough to compete with Papa Johns, but that ship has largely sailed investment wise. Short bait now, as far as I can tell.\n\nWhat’s been entirely overlooked (because the market has been conditioned to see these as false alarms) is what happens to all that equipment: the instant it’s used, it becomes medical waste, and medical waste requires specialized handling. Just check out Wuhan, which is [struggling to deal with mountains of it](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-china-struggling-deal-mountain-130909288.html). As with the PPE sector, there’s only a couple of players that are not either privately owned or overexposed to the suction that will be generated by the greater market. \n\nWhat’s also been (almost) entirely overlooked is respiratory medical devices and services, especially ventilators and ECMOs. You need to take care, here, because some companies (like the one inspiring my weaselly ‘almost’) are utterly dependent on the big red Chinese teat. Read those Q4 teleconference transcripts!\n\nAnd the thing to remember about SARS-COV-2 is that it’s not going away with the bad weather. It’s already considered endemic, meaning it’s going to pass through us in waves that might be seasonal, or might not. There's a good chance all these sectors all across the world are going to need to expand permanently, as well as build in the excess capacity required to handle periodic surges. This is the new reality. The new economy. Bioeconomics.\n\nAnd at present, (almost) all the companies comprising them are trading (like WHO is speaking) as if the pandemic hasn’t already happened. Like I say, WTF.\n\nConsider your ass covered. \n\nThe veil of tears is almost upon us, my friends.
