{"title": "Deutsche Bank - On the Brink of Insolvency", "selftext": "On this week's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD; yes this is what I'm going to be calling this), we'll be looking at Deutsche Bank. Once one of the largest banks in the world, it's now a shell of its former self after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up.

Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**A Brief History of Deutsche Bank (and Deutschland)**\n\nLet’s first start with some background around Deutsche Bank, because it has some very interesting history behind it. In particular, it’s somehow taken part in causing some of the worst crises and scandals in world and economic history ever since its founding in 1870. Here’s a brief timeline:\n\n* Founded in Berlin in 1870 with the original mission to facilitate trade between Germany and foreign nations\n* Rapidly expanded overseas in the late 1800s, opening branches in London, Shanghai, and South America\n* Financed the Holocaust in the 1930s, including the construction of the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Gestapo\n* Broken up to 10 smaller banks after Germany’s defeat in WWII by the Allies, but those banks later merged back together less than 10 years later\n* Acquired a bunch of overseas banks, including banks in the UK and the US, during the 80s and 90s, growing to become one of the largest money management firms in the world\n* Drove the market for CDOs in 2007 and even created CDOs consisting of their bad subprime mortgages, somehow got an A-level rating on them from the rating agencies, and aggressively marketed the CDOs to investors while knowing that their CDOs were shit. Their head of CDO trading, Greg Lippmann, knew about this and told everyone that CDOs were effectively a Ponzi scheme, even shorting CDOs himself through Credit Default Swaps. He then went around to different funds in Wall Street and told them that CDOs were going to collapse and sold them Credit Default Swaps as a way to short the CDO market, creating synthetic CDOs, the asset on the other side of that trade, with them to sell to other investors. This entire scheme was the inspiration for The Big Short, in case you didn’t realize this by now.\n* Also the bank that finances businesses of the current President, which might be worth considering for political motives / implications if something bad happens to Deutsche Bank\n* Today, they focus on Corporate Banking, Investment Banking, Private Banking, and Asset Management\n\nLet’s see how $DB’s performance has been the past few years\n\n[$DB, 2002-2020, Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/x0a7r7x6i3u41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c81fcd6c44a250984dce8a7e42f3277192f54b)\n\nYikes, it went from an all time high of $140 in 2007 to $6 today in 2020. In terms of their market cap, it went from $70B from its 2007 peak to $13B today. So, what happened? Let’s look at their [2019 SEC annual filing](https://www.db.com/ir/en/download/Form_20-F_2019.pdf).\n\n**10-K Deep Dive**\n\nIncome Statement (omitted boring parts)\n\n|Revenue|€ 22.4B (Net Interest = 13.7B, Credit Losses = -723M, Commission & Feed = 9.5B) |\n|:-|:-|\n|Expenses|€ 25.1B (mostly Compensation and G&A) |\n|Net income after taxes|€-5.3B (includes 2.6B of losses from taxes) |\n\nFrom their interest income, 19% comes from Corporate Banking, 39% from Investment Banking, 30% from Private Banking, and the rest comes from some other various operations.\n\nSo in a good year, in a period of “high” interest rates in the US (at least relative to the past decade), Deutsche Bank is still somehow losing billions. In fact, it states that their slight 4% YoY increase in net revenue income was driven by the fact that the US had a more favorable interest rate environment during that year, and their reduction of deposits in Germany, where they were experiencing negative interest rates.\n\n[German Interbank Rates](https://preview.redd.it/48vnrbb8i3u41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a0a59307e28b9d70cd48969d4e17cd9fbdec55a)\n\nNegative interest rates mean that banks need to pay the central bank to safely store their reserves with them, making it really hard to make a profit for banks. Luckily they had the relatively high interest rates of the US to make up for it in 2019. With interest rates cut to 0% again, this will be a very different story for 2020, and they’ll likely see even larger losses for this year.\n\nBalance Sheet (omitted boring parts)\n\n|**Assets**|€ 1.3T |\n|:-|:-|\n|Cash & Central Bank Deposits|€ 147B|\n|Financial Assets|€ 531B (Trading Assets - €110B, **Derivatives with a positive value - € 333B**)|\n|Loans|€ 430B|\n|**Liabilities**|€ 1.2T|\n|Deposits|€ 572B|\n|Financial Liabilities|€ 404B (Trading Liabilities - € 37B, **Derivatives with a negative value - € 317B**)|\n|Long Term Debt|€ 136B|\n|**Equity**|€ 62B|\n\nSo there’s a few very interesting things here. First, is the fact that their book value is €62B, or $67B USD, giving them a leverage of 26, which is way higher than literally every bank in the United States.\n\n[Top 100 US banks, sorted by leverage](https://preview.redd.it/h2y0z38bi3u41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=04817dd2930c7c388559b1e904fa5648e7f4cc58)\n\nWhat does a bank leverage ratio mean? It’s a quick way to see how well capitalized a bank is, and its ability to withstand negative shocks to its balance sheets without becoming insolvent. It’s harder to think of a more severe shock to the economic systems and people’s ability to pay back loans than a complete worldwide lockdown.\n\nAnother thing fishy with their book value is that their market cap is sitting at 13B USD. Even in January, before the stock market crashed it was sitting at 17B USD. That’s a big red flag, because theoretically if Deutsche Bank’s assets were all liquidated today, investors should theoretically be left with €62B, or $38 per share, which is way higher than the stock’s current $6 share price. This should especially be easy because the vast majority of their balance sheet consists of liquid assets or assets that should be easy to liquidate… or are they?\n\n**Derivatives**\n\nLet’s take a closer look at their derivatives. In their annual statement, they mentioned that they were trying to discontinue their derivatives business, which already helped cause one banking crisis a decade ago. They restructured and put all their “bad” capital, like their derivatives, in its own entity, called the “Capital Release Unit”, with the goal of liquidating these assets to release capital and de-leverage themselves. In 2019, their Capital Release Unit lost a total of €3.9B and held the €333B of derivatives. It also looks like they’re doing a bad job of releasing this specific class of capital, because their derivative assets and liabilities actually increased since 2018. That’s because a lot of these derivatives are not traded in exchanges, but instead over-the-counter with parties that have an ISDA agreement. As anyone who’s watched The Big Short can tell you (so literally everyone else on this subreddit), these OTC derivatives tend to be illiquid and difficult to value due to lack of price discovery.\n\nThis is why Deutsche Bank’s book value is more than their market cap, even before COVID-19. There’s doubt as to what some of the OTC derivatives are actually worth. They have a book value of €62B with derivatives supposedly valued at €333B, meaning if the actual net value of these derivatives are 19% or more lower than what they say they are, they become insolvent. This is the bank equivalent of buying SPY puts on margin in Robinhood (yes I know you can’t do that), but not knowing how much your puts are worth until you try selling. If you were like most of r/wallstreetbets you probably bought SPY puts when SPY was at 220. You know if you tried to sell your puts you might find out that they’re now worth a lot less than you originally bought them for (in the case of OTC derivatives, they can actually have a negative value!), realizing your portfolio value (equity) is below zero and you get a margin call (insolvent). In fact, they’ve [allegedly done something similar in 2008](https://whistleblower.org/in-the-news/financial-times-deutsche-bank-show-of-strength-or-a-fiction/) by failing to recognize losses related to the explosion of super senior tranches of CDOs, which may have led to joining Lehman Brothers in the bank graveyard if they did.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at these derivatives, specifically the ones that mature in 2020.\n\nDerivatives maturing in 2020 by nominal value\n\n|**Type**|**Bilateral**|**Central Counterparty**|**Exchange Traded**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Interest|€2.5T|€8.7T|€4T|\n|Currency|€4.3T|€95B|€17B|\n|Equity|€98B|0|€184B|\n|Credit|€39B|€63B|0|\n|Commodity|€2.7B|0|€31.9B|\n\nFirst a few things to clarify. Bilateral Clearing is an agreement between some party with an ISDA agreement with the bank, where the bank acts as the counterparty to the derivative being sold. Central Counterparty Clearing is when an institution facilitates an OTC derivative transaction by ensuring both sides of the transaction are financially sound enough and have enough collateral to not default on the derivative, and if any party defaults on the derivative, the central counterparty is now financially responsible for their side of the trade. This was put into place after 2008 when the risk of counterparties like AIG defaulting on credit default swaps became a huge systematic problem.\n\nAlso, a nominal value is different from a derivative’s actual price. For example, if you bought a SPY 4/20 220p, the nominal value of your derivative is $22000 (100 shares \\* $220 per share) but the actual value of your put is $0.\n\nWe know that since Dec 2019\n\n* Interest rates got cut all around the world\n* Currencies exchange rates have dramatically changed since December with oil-exporting countries. For example USD / CAD went from $1.30 to $1.42 during this time period\n* Equity values exploded, even with the bull run we’re currently in\n* A lot of BBB-rated companies got downgraded, and we might see defaults come in, even with the Fed buying bonds\n* Oil is fucked\n\nThese recent events will probably change the valuation of these derivatives by a lot, some of which are going to be realized on their balance sheets immediately (eg. exchange traded derivatives) because their valuations can easily be calculated. The key here is that the net losses needs to be below €62B or they become insolvent.\n\nNow, we’re in the age of too-big-to-fail businesses and the US government and Fed bailing out everyone, which is a real risk of taking a short position against $DB, especially considering how connected they are with other US financial institutions by acting as the counterparty or the central counterparty clearing house to many derivatives that they hold. If Deutsche Bank goes under, a lot of other financial institutions are going to have problems. The problem with Deutsche Bank is that it is not a US company and can’t be hence bailed out by the US government. In fact, they weren’t eligible for TARP, the last government-funded bank bailout back in 2008, which is partially why they’ve been a financial mess ever since.\n\nTheir Q1 earnings call is on April 29, so we’ll find out how much trouble they are then.\n\nTLDR; DB 5p 10/16", "id": "g58rkl", "created_utc": 1587443980.0, "score": 352, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Omg.

AMDs leadership are engineers.\n\nOh yes. This canard. AMD's leadership has been engineers long before the ATI merger. Didn't stop them from the travesty that was Bulldozer. The top brass has little to do with the quality of the chip. The engineers and r&d spent largely determine that. Intel spends around 3.3 billion every quarter on R&D. AMD spends around 400 million. TSMC, AMD's chief chip fab, spends around 880 million. A single EUV scanner from ASML costs about 180 million. To teach HVM with EUV **at a single fab** for the logic portion of the wafer requires anywhere from 20-40 scanners. If anyone is going to get to HVM with EUVL for the next architecture of chips first, it's going to be Intel.\n\nIntel fucked up bigtime by trying to push 2.7x transistor density in their 10nm process while still relying on DUVL. EUVL wasn't ready for HVM back in 2017, so they really had no choice considering they locked themselves in on the 2.7x statistic. That resulted in a ton of multipatterning on the wafers which meant that they could never reach HVM with their chips. That's why desktop and server-grade 10nm Intel chips haven't made it to market and why they're on 14nm+++.\n\nWhen 10nm gets quickly pushed out and forgotten, 7nm will be promoted **heavily**. Expect it to quickly retake that desktop marketshare from AMD and crush them on IPC and TDP. Ryzen is a good product, but AMD's timing was just super fortunate rather than there being some massive problem with Intel.

But it seems that no one is talking about SPY falling like a rock to either a second bottom, or a completely new low.\n\nI have forecasted this for a minute  since its been setting up for days and have called this happening days in advance. I could post positions i took from today and screenshots of me telling friends spy is gonna drop this week + next week, but fuck you all youre getting is some crayon drawings as to why we fell in the first place, how you couldve seen this coming if you werent an anti-technicals autist, and where were going from here out out.\n\nbackground: i have 0 fundamental experience other than reading the shit you guys post on here, but i can guaran-fucking-tee you that the drop in the spy IS NOT a result of oil dropping you fuck. This has been setting up on TA for atleast a week if not since mid-late march and ill show you why, all you have to do is believe.\n\n1. Right off the bat you take a look at the futures (why futures? because it tells you the future you autist) and we can see that since last week, price has been forming an ascending wedge. What does this mean? It means that big players are offloading their position, forming a distribution pattern, one of such patterns is an ascending wedge which are followed by big drops in price (which we can see from today that price did indeed drop and will further).\n\n[ascending wedge + divergence](https://preview.redd.it/gxssbxpc29u41.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=c45a399b1384dd803fc66742749d3e76f43f8008)\n\n2) in the picture above you can also see that once we broke and closed below the ascending trendline, we immediately retested it. AKA bull run is over, puts are boutta print, calls is for those who cant read between the lines.\n\nStill dont believe TA works?\n\n3) In the picture above you can also see that there is a divergence forming between the higher highs of price, and the lower highs of the MACDaddy indicator which further indicates that we are in a fucking distribution phase.\n\nStill dont believe in the power of TA?\n\nIn the picture below, we can also see that this drop is supported by price retracing to the 78.6% fib line... (no you dont draw fibs from the swing high to the swing low, thats not even how you fucking draw them). I dont particularly like fibs at all cuz i think its all horse shit and TeChNicAl aStRoloGy, but these drawings other than the fib are purely based off of price action patterns if you can read a chart.
