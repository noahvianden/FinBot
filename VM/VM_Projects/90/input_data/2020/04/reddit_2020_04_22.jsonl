{"title": "Zynga DD $ZNGA", "selftext": "**TLDR;** **$8 calls for June 19**  \n\nEdit: If it goes below $7.30 I will most likely exit.  \n\n[Position](https://imgur.com/a/cytdqyR)\n\n**My play:** dumping before earnings or legging them out to further OTM calls if there is a strong run up. Save a few to exercise and wheel them until I'm exercised.\n\n**Estimated earnings date:** 05/06/2020. $ATVI and $GLUU also have earnings that week.\n\nI'd love some feedback. So let me know why and how I'm a retard. I already got in with 50 calls. I got burned by the witching hype. So just letting you know how smooth my brain is.\n\n**Thesis:** Entertainment spending has not been significantly affected yet by Coronavirus(see $NFLX subscription count) and people are entertaining themselves on their phones(see $SNAP +20% DAU). These easy conclusions could lead to a runup for Zynga to earnings. Also, smooth brains spending stimulus money. $500 per kid and $1200 per adult.\n\n**Back of napkin math:** If Zynga sees a 20% increase in DAU that translates to \\~107m(4M additional DAU at $0.223 per day) additional revenue on the high side. Zynga's Q1 is typically a slower quarter, so $375m revenue was probably their projection when they gave the 1.6bn guidance. 33% of that $107m puts them at $410m on the quarter. This is inline with analyst estimates but it doesn't include the progress that they've made in Asia or the impact of content updates to older proven games.\n\n**DD**\n\n* [Zynga makes $0.223 each day from 20M daily active users.](https://investor.zynga.com/static-files/81439da7-73e8-4012-9087-8f514b5dddc1) (last sentence page 3)\n* Expanded their newly acquired Empires & Puzzles game to Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.

More smooth brains on their phones.\n* Netflix blew out subscriptions estimates, so entertainment spending is still strong. NetFlix sub is $8.99, monthly spend on Zynga is $6.69 on a DAU.\n* CSR Racing received new customization content\n* Empires & Puzzles starting Season 3 whatever the fuck that is, I assume it'll bring back old players  \n* Over 1bn cash on hand  \n* Merge Dragons is #7 grossing game on Android App store, above Call of Duty Mobile.

Also, GLUU has 3 games which are declining fast and their falling revenue may offset gains from their growth games. Ad revenue is also only 11% of revenue which is kind of disheartening. Zynga's ads generate 19.4% of revenue. Glu also only has \\~124m cash on hand which is about 25% of their yearly revenue versus Zynga which has 75%+ of this ratio.\n\nGlu's [earnings report](https://glumobile.gcs-web.com/static-files/800ac227-148e-4c71-ba6d-cf2714935aed) is super transparent which is cool.\n\nGLUU feels like a YOLO based on your estimation of Disney Sorcerers Arena revenue.\n\n[Zynga's newest 2 titles seem to be dominating GLUU's top 2 games interms of search interest.](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fg%2F11g65g1q2n,%2Fg%2F11f4ql574h,%2Fg%2F11g9jnhq68,%2Fg%2F11c67vrw1y)\n\n[But Call of Duty Mobile dominates all of them](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=%2Fg%2F11g65g1q2n,%2Fg%2F11f4ql574h,%2Fg%2F11g9jnhq68,%2Fg%2F11c67vrw1y,Call%20of%20Duty%20Mobile)I might pick up puts on $GLUU and more $ATVI calls.\n\nStill looking at TTWO, but I feel like the Borderlands franchise is getting pretty tired. They're still being carried Rockstar's GTA and Red Dead Redemption. These are great games, but I'm specifically looking for games that appeal boardly to anyone with a smart phone.\n\nZNGA, ATVI are attractive to me.  GLU and TTWO might be worth playing run up if they haven't already soared. But I'd be pretty happy with leaps on ZNGA and ATVI. Kind of pissed I didn't buy leaps when I grabbed calls on them both a while ago. :/\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry the formatting is shit on this lol. I didn't think I was going to write so much. It started out as just a rambling of my findings but I don't really see anything that warrants digging further from GLUU or TTWO. Glu's audience on new games is too young and TTWO is too top heavy with AAA and sports titles. Although I'm sure microtransactions are doing well in NBA2k and stuff, but I'm trying to focus on games with mass appeal.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "CaRe to share why?
