{"title": "Weekly Theta Gang Thread", "selftext": "Another good week, I knew the banks would do poorly but I didn’t think it would be that bad. After seeing the reality of the earnings numbers I bought back the puts I wrote on GS and C in a panic but the market clearly doesn’t care how poorly earnings go. If I had held they would have expired worthless. This market is starting to scare me with how much it’s gone up but I’m not fighting the trend. I still think oil is close to the bottom, so I’ll wheel into USO again once they fully roll into June contracts. \n\nThis week is huge so I am planning to write options every day. Big ones I plan to be focusing on are: IBM, KO, NFLX, DAL, DPZ, INTC. I’ll probably write some USO puts too. Let me know what options you’re writing.\n\nThis app is finally letting me post proof: https://i.imgur.com/HXZ2lY4.png https://i.imgur.com/Jc1j2Qm.png https://i.imgur.com/K836w2v.png", "id": "g4edq1", "created_utc": 1587326670.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Why the 5/15 strike on AMD?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "5/15 is the *expiration* the strike is $49", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I had NOK calls last week too far otm.
