{"title": "Apple will tank, and the market will follow", "selftext": "Okay, hear me out,  [u/Controlthenarrative](https://www.reddit.com/u/Controlthenarrative/) wasn't wrong to short Apple, he was just too early, like a true genius autist. Here is why I think Apple will tank in the coming months.\n\nI will be using AAPL prices from closing from today and AAPL's financial statements.\n\nAAPL closed today $267.99, and it has a ttm EPS of 12.60, so it's trading at a trailing PE of 21.27, which is way too high if you compare it to how Apple trades historically. Apple usually has a PE ratio of between 12-15, just take a look at this chart:\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)\n\nAlright, so now the question is what will be Apple's earnings in the future, since forward PE is what investors think about when investing (I know you autists don't tho, don't worry). Assuming earnings STAY THE SAME (which they won't) this year for Apple, fair value for the stock should be around:\n\n$12.60 x 15 = $189\n\nSo Apple is trading at a premium of $79, or around 40%. And that's if they have the same earnings as last year. Okay, so let's took a look at their earnings:\n\n[https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q1/Q1-FY20-Consolidated-Financial-Statements.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2020/q1/Q1-FY20-Consolidated-Financial-Statements.pdf)\n\nLooking at their net sales, $91,819,000,000, all services only represents $12,715,000,000, or about 13.85% of their net sales. All the rest comes from sales of iPhones, Macs, iPads, and accessories. Let's say that the services portion remains the same, or even grows, this year, I can't imagine their sales of phones, computers and accessories not getting hit by the virus. Now I'm no prophet, and I'm certainly not an insider, so I can't tell how much sales will be affected, but it sure as hell will be affected in a big way for at least 1 trimester, if not 2-3. You think even after the virus is gone people will go back to buying iPhones? Hell no, they'll be behind on all their bills are buying a new iPhone will not be their priority, and even fucking Jerome can't print enough money to cover everyone's bills (although I often underestimate his BRRRRRRRR). With retail sales representing over 85% of Apple's net sales, their EPS for Q2 and Q3 will be awful, thus the share price will tank.\n\nIf they get an EPS of like 10 this year, fair price would be $150, but it will probably trade at like $175-190 since people will look at 2021 earnings.\n\nSo the true question: when will it tank? I sadly do not have an answer, but maybe after they report Q1 earnings and come up with their guidance. If not, after Q2 earnings.\n\nSo position: Apple puts, 1 month after Q1 earnings if you feel ballsy, or 1 month after Q2 earnings. I say 1 month after so you won't get killed too much by theta.\n\nBonus prediction: Big tech that are dependent on ad revenue will also tank (Facebook and Google) since most of their revenue comes from ads and ads & marketing is the first thing that gets cut when a company is bleeding cash. So Apple with big tech that are dependent on ad tanking will bring down the whole SPY since tech is now over 30% of the SPY. Other companies in the SPY will follow them down since people will be panicking, but not enough to bring the VIX back up to 80, so careful with your options, fellow autist.\n\nSorry for the long post, I know this is a MacDonald's\n\nTLDR: Apple will fall below $200 sometimes in the next 6 months. Either hold cash if you lost too much money are too fearful to lose more, or puts expiring 1 month after Q2 earnings, or 1 month after Q1 earnings if you feel courageous. SPY will follow afterward.", "id": "fy0frv", "created_utc": 1586465556.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "Monday headline - \"Apple inventory stuck in China quarantine.

As I say, everyone is chasing yield, so I don’t think AAPL p/e will be less than 20 if you check back in 12 months (unless inflation is that bad fed have to raise rates).\n\nI actually agree with you that AAPL will have a pull back, not to a 15 p/e, and not for the reasons you put forward mind.
