Just because they compare the graph to the great depression doesn't mean they think it is going to be as bad or as long lasting, inherently it shouldn't be if economist have learnt anything in 100 years, they should be able to better mitigate issues.

People seem to forget that the high just 4 years ago of the S+P was around 2100. 4 years is not a long time ago.
