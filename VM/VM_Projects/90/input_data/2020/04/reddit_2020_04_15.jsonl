Protesters have been [chanting outside the Ohio state house](https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-dewine-protest-end-social-distancing-reopen-economy-coronavirus) for a couple of days now, blaming the local health department officials for keeping the state closed and calling for it to open back up. What's my takeaway here? We all know lots of folks are in denial and we have been expecting our puts to print as the bad news keeps hitting, but the market keeps going up. The reality is, many folk haven't been hit hard by illness of friends dying, partly because of social distancing and all the state closures. Yet many have been hurt by furloughs, layoffs, and pay cuts. Many still agree with the president's sentiment to open back up, and feel it will happen. Short term, this is why calls are printing, and long term, this is probably why puts will print. People think the worst is over and that once the states reopen, things will go back to normal.
