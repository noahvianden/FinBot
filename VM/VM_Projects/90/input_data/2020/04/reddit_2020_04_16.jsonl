{"title": "Some lessons learnt in due course (with loss porn)", "selftext": "Wrote originally for WSB. Someone suggested it would be applicable here as well. Some important lessons gained through course of time with options:\n\n1. **Profits are never profits until you realize (book) the gains:**  I see many posts here saying 100k to 2k whereas they actually started  only with 10k: 10k->100k->2k. So it is actually 10k to 2k, not  100k to 2k. So never shy away from booking profits. If not entire gains,  atleast a fraction of it. It's okay to be greedy but combine some  common sense with it. Best would be to take out your initial amount and let the rest ride.\n2. **Do not buy puts/calls when the market is gone too much down/up. Think opposite**:  A classic mistake that many of us make here. Me as well and lost a lot  due to this. So when your options become deep ITM, your portfolio bloats  up showing amazing gains?!? but what are the gains when you have not  booked them? Here is where the greed+FOMO kicks in and we end up buying  more OTM options for the same direction because we have made amazing gains (but they are not realized). When the market swings to other  direction, you have lost a lot: your ITM becomes OTM and your new OTM purchase becomes impossible. So again, never feel shy to book profits!\n3. **Cannot daytrade?**  So tracking the options throughout day can be distracting, if you have a  job. If this is the case, there is nothing bad in set limit order with  profit margin acceptable to you. Set this thing and let it roll. If  market swings to your direction, you are going to make it automatically. Have a look near EOD or aftermarket and get an idea how markets are  moving. You can fine tune your sell limits, if needed.\n4. **Gain/Loss porn:**  As we see, our sub is growing crazy and will continue so. This is  because the markets are going to have strong gradients till EOY. Gains  are only possible when the market moves and has gradients. So some will  cleverly/luckily make some good gains out of this. Gain porn is going to  attract a lot more people especially. Of course, equally or maybe more  people are losing here, and are probably keeping quiet. This being the  case, I down vote the gain porn and upvote loss porn. I am happy for  your gains but there should be more light on the loss to prepare the  noobs here.\n5. **Never FOMO**:  Missed the train? It's okay. Let's wait for the next one. We are not  handling stocks here that you have a residue value that stays over the  time. We do options here and if you are OTM on the expiration date, you  are fucked.\n6. **Play monthlies or longer**:  Playing weeklies without any significant upcoming news is sheer  gambling. Considering this, the theta decay will fuck you over the time.  My suggestion is to play atleast a month out and close them before the  very last week.\n7. **Keep track of max pain**:  This might be controversial. I take this as additional info but not  sole one for decision making. Have a look into opricot.com to check max  pain before options purchase. For example, max pain for spy: [http://www.opricot.com/ticker/spy/optiongraphs](http://www.opricot.com/ticker/spy/optiongraphs).\n8. **Try avoiding herd mentality**:  As a believer of max pain theory, try avoiding buying same options as  someone YOLOing ,for example $100k, into specific options. If max pain  is true, there is much more at stake for market makers. They will try  swinging market in the other direction, atleast for that expiration  date.\n\nObligatory loss porn: Total invested 8k. Started with 2k and added 6k after crash. That 6k evaporated. Exited my 4/17 puts today and withdrawn about 1k today. Peak was 23k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26k383tes2t41.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ce6b1c3b552145ee5719df21bbac6c8ef8fe998\n\nEdit: Many have asked about max pain theory:\n\nIt’s a theory that option sellers try to influence the underlying stocks to cause maximum damage to option holders.

I started with about $3,000 before the crash, added $7,000 during the crash sensing the opportunity and needing to defend my portfolio and presently trading for just under $9,500, fairly well positioned to take advantage of the volatility going forward to make this my best year yet. \n\nThe difference in portfolio volatility in our strategies is pretty huge though, you went from $8K to $23K to $1K. I've managed to go from $10K to $8.5K back to $9.5k using the opposite strategy as you have been (aka you seem to have heavily purchased the puts that I was selling, yet I have had smaller portfolio swings thanks to aggressive portfolio management and adding the extra cash to further defend). I am working to position my portfolio to capitalize on collapsing IV as markets return to normal over the next several months and push me to some sweet sweet profits in the long term rather than one huge winning trade. \n\nI don't think I could handle portfolio volatility as crazy as yours. :P Tastytrade has conducted a lot of research indicating that closing winners quickly is a very solid management technique. I tend to agree and it is cool to see you realizing this also. \n\nYou should look into expanding your competency to also selling options to increase your ability to diversify and implement more various strategies. When selling options, it is not any easier, in fact there might be more to learn and the profits don't appear as glamorous, but your number of winning trades will increase regardless of market direction and it will be psychologically easier to trade with a statistically proven system that works in your favor and only requires you to cultivate the discipline to turn the probabilities into profits based on the math built into options pricing (don't worry with today's brokerages they do all the math for you for the most part, unless you are using RH in which case you are out of luck). You also detach your profitability partially from stock price action, allowing you to profit in other ways (i.e. passage of time, decrease in IV, etc). \n\nFinally, by trading much smaller positions you will greatly reduce portfolio volatility and decrease the impact any single position will have on your portfolio, allowing for greater diversification and reducing the need to be \"right\" on every single trade you make. By trading a variety of strategies and positions that make money in a variety of ways you can be wrong and still make money. Also smaller trades means you can hang in there longer even if the trade is losing money because no single trade will ever take you down. In the future, try to keep your positions to no more than 5% of your total portfolio and trade with less than 50% of your buying power. Right now I am only using 30% of my buying power as I wait to see if this rally is a bull trap or not. Looking for some opportunities to add some short deltas to give me some downside protection if things keep going up. :P \n\nKeep trading and create the system that works for you!

Depending on the time frame of your bet, some cheaper premiums are highly advantageous and dare i say it, better. People always say to do this because of time decay. While that makes sense theoretically it didn't gain me much so far in my experience.  \n\nWeeklies can be cheaper and therefore allow more leverage. I've played cheaper weeklies due to my account size, sold them as a day trade, and made out like a bandit. The monthlies in comparison did not allow for that. Sometimes a monthly can cost your entire account... which goes against the rule of diversifying and not going 'all in' on one lone position. \n\nAfter moving the dates to 2 weeks rather than months, i am finding i can diversify much easier and stand a much greater chance breaking even on my positions. The important thing is not to hold on to them. If they're duds, then drop 'em asap and find a winner. What burned me with monthlies was not having the account size to actually play them properly. So what happened was, over half my account would sometimes be a single contract. And i'd be holding on to it thinking \"at least i'm not suffering from time decay!\"... meanwhile, IV crush is screwing me, and the stock price might not even be moving in my favor either... so all in all it wasn't a great move.\n\n\nSo maybe monthlies are great for larger accounts. Sure, i'll give you that. But you need to also take into account the size of the position relative to your account. Playing weeklies allows me to keep a shitload of cash on hand, which monthlies did not do. This applies even more so if you are trading in a cash account, since you may run out of funds to buy more securities some days after closing one out.\n\n\n\nAnother thing to point out is that weeklies, monthlies, ... etc. It's all \"betting\" at the end of it all. If I'm \"investing,\" then i buy and hold (e.g. stocks). When it comes to options, i feel i've developed more intuition by making strong decisions and comitting to them quickly and not allowing emotions to get in the way, whether its forward or backward thinking (e.g. fomo, unrealized gains, etc.).", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can you clarify what a max pain is", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The Zacks of indicators.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> Play monthlies or longer\n\nThere is a good exception to this, especially thanks to theta.
