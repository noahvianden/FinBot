They had to know that the news would send the stocks lower, and I also found it interesting that they dumped a lot more DAL, while only selling enough LUV to get just below 10% ownership.  This makes me think they really didn't want to sell any more LUV than they had to in order to get below that 10% mark.  This also makes me think that there is a different or additional motive for selling more DAL, because they didn't do the same thing and just barely get it below 10% ownership to dodge future SEC reporting.\n\nA lot of people are going to panic and start dumping Delta stock because Buffet sold a little of it, but he also kept quite a lot of it.  Now, he could dump all that as well, with the added benefit of not having to report it, but I think that would be pretty stupid given how much the stock has dropped.  I don't think Delta is going anywhere and will likely recover just fine.  I'm sure Berkshire knows that as well.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the actual intention of this move may be to drive DAL lower, get below 10% ownership to allow for discreet buying/selling, and then buy an even larger stake in the company at a deep discount.  At 9.1% ownership, they have some room before they hit 10% and have to start reporting the purchases again (ie: tipping people off).  If they buy more and break 10% again, the news of that will cause the stock to skyrocket, increasing the value of both their newly purchased and held shares.  This would also explain the more precise sale of LUV if it was just done to make the DAL sale more convincing.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how low it goes next week and how this whole move plays out, whether it is an elaborate stock play or just a simple redistribution of holdings.  Regardless of what Buffet does with the rest of his shares, I'll likely be buying more DAL and thanking him for the discount.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "IMO, Warren buffet does not try and time the market (based on what he has said previously), so selling shares now to buy back lower makes no sense.

I realized that despite this image of Buffet as this humble, unassuming figure, he's still fully capable of large-scale market manipulation.\n\nI thought about it from his perspective: You have a large following that will copy every trade you make. A golden opportunity presents itself because of this. All of your friends see the opportunity too, and they are pressuring you because they want in on the profits. And last but not least, you lack sympathy for those followers because those who blindly follow other people deserve the consequences of being unaware and unprepared.\n\nOutside of speculation, I like what you had to say about him only dumping a small percentage of his shares. He wasn't panic selling- he was \"downsizing\". But the difference between dumping and downsizing is imperceptible to the general audience, so all it took was a small downsize for people to start panicking. The price of DAL reflects that as well. Recently as the overall market bounced dramatically, DAL stayed relatively flat. The negative divergence DAL had with the overall market is indicative of the impact that Buffet's trade had on the market, although this divergence was likely also caused by a number of different factors.\n\nLast but not least, how would Buffet profit off this move? I don't find it likely that he's going to buy back the shares that he sold anytime soon. I think this move will be paid back to him by his network of friends, which may include insiders from those airline companies. Shortly after Buffet's move, insiders from all the relevant airlines [bought back shares](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-warren-buffett-made-a-huge-mistake-selling-his-airline-stocks-2020-05-26), according to MarketWatch. This indicates that the move that Buffet caused was mostly a short-term panic that got bought up by insiders, resulting in only a small loss of the price of the stock in the short term.\n\nThe reason I typed this all out as a reply 3 months later is because I'm saving this as reference material for future trade ideas. I'm also anticipating the move that airlines are going to make, although I have no intention on capitalizing on it due to the opportunity cost of removing my cash position.

Think about it, who would unnecessarily risk a trip to the movies or take a vacation with the risk of a catching HIGHLY infectious disease that spreads in many ways and spreads asymptomatically and can outright KILL you at up to a 25% probability without hospitalization?\n\n>Affordable and effective treatment SOON and vaccines before the next flu seasons are crucial to avoiding lasting economic decline\n\n>But why would there be economic decline? Well, because people will change their behavior as long as the threat of the virus remains. Let's look at what industries will be affected:\n\n>Layoffs will compound upon itself. When airlines, hotels, restaurants, malls, etc are firing workers, the workers won't have money to spend on buying things. This means other businesses may suffer enough to also start firing some workers. Businesses in 2020 overall are so overleveraged that a large percentage of them are not going to be able to handle even a few months of lower business. They simply can't pay all the expenses and the debt obligation.\n\n>So if my logic and assumptions are correct, we are looking at an inescapable catastrophe for the Asian tourism industry at the very least. Just in Time manufacturing keep about 2 weeks worth of parts. Most businesses already adjusted their supplies to account for the normal Chinese New Year shutdown. We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. **I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our \"dip\".**\n\n[Continued thoughts on the global economic impact of covid19](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fede69/continued_thoughts_on_the_global_economic_impact/)\n\n**Mar 6**\n\nThis is from one month ago where I talked about Chloroquine weeks before Trump announced it in his press conference. The Trump announcement was when most of the world learned about the treatment:\n\n>Various currently available drugs like Chloroquine have shown efficacy in treating infected patients. Don't expect peer reviewed studies anytime soon, this is just based on what was observed in China where health officials tried throwing all types of drugs at it until they noticed Chloroquine seems to work.\n\nI talk about the oil industry risk before the Saudi/Russian oil price war. I actually posted about this several days earlier when oil prices were even higher but my thread was censored by /r/investing because one of their mods actively deletes good posts (not even kidding):\n\n>Oil industries will be heavily impacted.\n\n>Different breakeven points for different oil extraction operations.\n\n>The most expensive North American oil extraction stops being profitable below $50\n\n>If oil prices hit $30, expect any type of fracking operations to pretty much stop.\n\n>All the towns/cities/local governments depending on this industry for tax revenue is in big trouble. And so are their municipal bonds.\n\n>States or even the federal government may need to bail out the industry.\n\n>States may need to bail out local governments.\n\nTalked about risk to private jail industry:\n\n>Private jail industry will likely be devastated. This virus has shown to spread like wildfire among confined populations (Chinese jails and Korean psych ward). Almost 100% of patients were infected in Korean psych ward. The private jail industry will need a bailout.\n\nTalked about a bunch of bailouts weeks before they were announced:\n\n>A lot of companies will go bankrupt or get bailed out. The bailouts come in many forms. Some type of loan payment freeze for entire industries (like tourism) is possible. Freeze on tax collection from businesses is likely. Helicopter money into consumer hands. Or outright bailouts like what we saw with some companies in 2008.\n\nTalked about not buying the dip:\n\n>Not the type of market to \"buy the dip\" because even financially secure companies may get wiped out in some industries.\n\nUnemployment weeks before the spike:\n\n>Mass unemployment/underemployment. If you are in the most vulnerable businesses (tourism/travel), try to transition right now if you can. Have a plan to not have a job by May\n\nAnticipated massive Fed fuckery:\n\n>Timing the market may be tricky because of central bank and government actors. But the direction is negative.\n\nAnd finally this was my last big thread:\n\n[Incoming inflection point for general market decline: more studies are emerging showing that existing cheap and widely available treatments have high efficacy in treating covid19 patients](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fldpdy/incoming_inflection_point_for_general_market/)\n\nTalked about chloroquine literally moments before Trump had his press conference talking about it. Inflection was reached 2 days after this post (but this is not the bottom, we're gonna go down much much more).\n\nGave my purely speculative guess here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/fldpdy/incoming_inflection_point_for_general_market/fkyywhj/\n\n>So to answer your question: it depends on completely unknown government actions. I really don't want to talk about this until I see a few crucial data points coming in. But I know that's boring so I'll take a completely speculative guess and say that we'll see a bottom before June 20th. At least a soft bottom where all of the huge nose dive losses will be over. I think that news of lockdowns and earnings reports will be the big drivers of losses. I expect those things to be priced in by 2nd quarters earnings. The treatment drugs have largely relieved me of my worst case scenario: seasonal covid19 with rapidly evolving strains that are 15-20x more deadly than the seasonal flu.\n\n...\n\n>As for entering the market, I will also play it safe and wait for my key indicators to hit the sweet spot. In any other recession, I have pretty strong confidence I can enter the market a couple of weeks before or after the bottom, but this market downturn has developed so quickly that it is outpacing the indicators I depend on. At least my best indicators.\n\n>I'd rather be a bit late than too early to be honest.\n\n**TL;DR** market is about to get gayer, but don't go bull too early.
