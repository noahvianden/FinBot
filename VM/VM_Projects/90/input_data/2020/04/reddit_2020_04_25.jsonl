{"title": "IV Percentile & IV Rank: The Vega story not many know", "selftext": "There was a [wonderful post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6agbg/top_options_trading_mistakes_that_you_should_not/) written by /u/tinkerprophet that highlighted common options strategy mistakes. What I want to do with this post is introduce you guys to something called IV Percentile and IV Rank, as it's an uncommon metric to many new option traders. I wrote this post as a comment in that thread, but I wanted to share it with the rest of r/wallstreetbets.\n\n**First of all, what is Implied Volatility and Historical Volatility?**\n\n>Implied Volatility (IV) is how volatile the market expects a stock to be in the future over a year. IV is forward looking! For example, a stock price of $100 with an IV of 25% means the market is pricing in a stock price movement of $25 in either direction over the next year. IV indicates the annualized expected one standard deviation range for a stock price. This means there is a 68.2% chance (one standard deviation) the stock will move $25 up or down. IV is important because it represents the likelihood of an option pricing swinging in-the-money. The higher the IV, the higher the chance the stock can swing to in-the-money.  \n>  \n>Now what is Historical Volatility? Historical Volatility is what the volatility actually was when looking back in time. Why would we care about historical volatility? Because it tells us if the market's predictions about volatility (IV) was correct. [Take a look at this chart of SPY, where implied volatility and historical volatility are graphed.](https://i0.wp.com/optionposts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/implied-volatility-vs-historical-volatility.png?ssl=1) You can see that the majority of the time, implied volatility is higher than historical volatility. This means the market thought volatility was going to be higher than what it really was.\n\n**What is Implied Volatility Percentile?**\n\n>IV Percentile represents the percentage of days that implied volatility has traded below the current level over the past year.  \n>  \n>For example, if IV Percentile is 5% in XYZ, that would mean that implied volatility only traded below current levels 5% of the time over the course of the previous 12 months. On the other hand, if IV Percentile in XYZ is 80%, that would mean that implied volatility had traded below current levels 80% of the time over the previous 12 months.\n\n**What is Implied Volatility Rank?**\n\n>IV Rank tells us whether implied volatility is high or low in a specific underlying relative to the past year of implied volatility data.  \n>  \n>For example, imagine that implied volatility has ranged between 30 and 60 for underlying XYZ over the past year. If implied volatility is currently trading at 45, then the IV Rank for XYZ would be 50% - exactly in the middle of its one-year historical range.\n\n**How do I take advantage of this?**\n\n>You can use this to your advantage when selling options. You want to sell options when IV Percentile and/or IV Rank is really high (>75%). The reason we do this is because the current IV is historically much higher than what has been seen in the past, and is VERY likely to start going down in the future.\n\n**What if I'm long on an option but IV is starting to fall?**\n\n>You can always hedge your position by going long on SVXY (inverse VIX) or by shorting VXX (Vix Near-Term Futures contracts. Here are some other volatility tickers that you can use to your advantage:  \n>  \n>**Long VIX**  \n>  \n>VXX - 1x leveraged short-term futures (1 month)  \n>  \n>VIXY - short-term futures (1 month) TVIX - 2x short-term futures  \n>  \n>UVXY - 1.5x leveraged front and second month futures  \n>  \n>**Short VIX**  \n>  \n>SVXY - 0.5x leverage inverse short-term futures  \n>  \n>ZIV - 1x leverage inverse mid-term futures  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>From /u/2-leet-2-compete  \n>  \n>Serious question, why do people always suggest these ETF type things instead of actual VIX options? Shit like UVXY has leveraged ETF decay problems. CBOE VIX options are straight up better aren't they? Oh and they also get taxed 40% at long term gains 60% short term, unlike options on the other shit\n\nTo my thinkorswim bros out there, you are able to see IV Percentile by going to Trade > All Products > [Today's Option Statistics](https://tickertapecdn.tdameritrade.com/assets/images/pages/lg/page14.png). In order to view IV Rank on thinkorswim, you have to add your own custom study. To do that, [visit this tutorial that tells you how.](https://winningtheme.com/thinkorswim/tos_settings/11-tutorial-how-to-scan-ivr-implied-volatility-rank-on-thinkorswim-platform) I'm not really sure why thinkorswim doesn't display IV Rank. To my tastyworks bros out there, I'm pretty sure it displays both IV Percentile and IV Rank.\n\nI hope some of you guys found this useful!

While that’s true, none of us on here are taking year long positions. If implied volatility now is 30, and there is a second wave (for example, not saying it will happen), we would likely see a violent drop in the short term that would far outweigh the IV projection, then by next April it would likely have stabilized somewhat. So in the short term, short volatility positions would get crushed even if they would eventually pay out. In other words, I would be curious to see the chart for IV and historical IV on a monthly as opposed to an annual basis. \n\n2) Your analysis ignores fundamental and macro issues. The market (theoretically at least) considers these issues when it prices volatility. For example, IV is much higher now than it was in January. But in January (outside the real sharp people), there was not reason not to expect stocks to continue in steady bull run with no catalyst for a major disruption. Now, we have two widely divergent potential outcomes for the next six months or so. We could realistically see either a complete return to normal economic activity and fast re-employment, or we could see a second wave once places start opening up, leading to more shut downs and continued 3-4million weekly unemployment, mortgage foreclosures, and corporate defaults. That creates a huge range of outcomes and the question is not whether IV is high relative to the norm, but whether IV is high relative to your projections of outcomes. \n\nFor me, I’m nearing the point where I’m going to go back into long volatility after Friday’s movement, even though it is high historically speaking.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Alright Kirk from Option Alpha", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yooo why the fuck are you giving the secret away?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "How consistent is it for IV to go up before earnings?

I can say with high certainty that VIX will start to drop immediately after values of that magnitude is reached, \n\n>**Couldn't >30 be the new average from now on?** \n\nThis depends how long the IV value 30 lasts for. If the IV value is 30 for a whole year, then sure, 30 is the new average. \n\nHowever, if the previous low was 10 and the previous high was 20 for the past year, and now current IV value is 30, this means IV is significantly higher that what was previously seen in that past year.\n\nNow what is important is how long IV stays at that value of 30.

What some talking head on CNN is not evidence.\n\n> No sweden has a higher death rate, straight up not successful. https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus\n\nSweden does not have a higher death rate. That doesn't even make any sense. Why would the mortality rate be any different across similar populations? The infection rate is the only thing that'd be greater. \n\nThat website is as reliable as the DD on this sub for doing cross-country analysis.\n\n> You argue NY asuming deaths, ok minus those 3700 from how many deaths? like wtf is your point, deaths are coming from somewhere, but no you are big brain time and people are making shit up but you are the big brain to enlighten us all. \n\nTake away that 3700 and the rate dramatically drops.\n\n> Saying the death rates are the same based on current numbers, fine. Too bad thats not all there is to an infectious disease process. Covid is much more easily transmissible. Saying go have fun kids is irresponsibly stupid. But go on big brain. You are the smartest one here.\n\nThe only partially rational thing you have said. Yes it's more infectious. Way more infectious which is what leads us to having such a low mortality rate. Even using the old numbers which are out-dated, the mortality rate for young people was <0.1%. Imagine what the true numbers are. Millenials and zoomers should party it up like it's 1999 but you're welcome to stay in your underground bunker.
