People would rather have one good full time job and not be in debt from getting that job and not have the worry all the time of being laid off and working 2-3 shit jobs to support their family and feed them scraps while paying off a number of loans. people are struggling more then ever so to say our economy is resilient right now is a crock of shit. \nEven a few wealthy people I know are saying it and they have enough money for 3 life times. \nEspecially if you live in CA or NYC you feel it the most.\nWithout a doubt anyone can get rich off the market at any time no matter what bubble is being pumped or what recession we enter but that doesn’t have much of a bearing on the market sentiment when there’s a bubble like this.
