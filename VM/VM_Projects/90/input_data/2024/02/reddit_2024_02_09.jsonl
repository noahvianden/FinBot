Technical: the stock crossed $16.40 which is the 20 day average. It loves to spike prior to earnings if technicals show momentum. Added bonus: Also the stock can be a winner if the money from Tesla is looking for ‚Äúother‚Äù EV play or diversifying. \n2. Sentimental: What I find truly unique about this brand that people really LOVE their trucks. That is very important and there is no other pure EV play except Tesla that may POTENT-rally turn into a success. We all know LCID and FSKR are dead. Rivian is a pure SUV play. Think of Range Rover of EV.\n3. Fundamental: The good thing is they have üí∞ cash. The demand is very strong but they need to streamline the production process. There are hopes the company can survive‚Ä¶. Not going into much details, read yourself.\n\nWhy did I make such a bet? I am not gonna tell you why.\n\nThe Plan: I will decide whether to hold thru the earnings or not. If the price is $20 or more. I probably will hold through the ER. If $16-$18 then sell before earnings. Between $18-20 will play with houses money.\n\nAny other questions?", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "‚ÄúPlay with houses money‚Äù means selling 77k worth of the options and just playing with the profit you have made till then?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "plus R2 gets revealed March 7, and they just released cheaper options.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "GL, Ive been YOLOing this as well.
