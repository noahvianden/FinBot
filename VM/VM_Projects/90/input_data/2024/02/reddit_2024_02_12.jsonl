Now, one thing I think should be forced on them is to include stop sign/light interaction in standard AP. As it is now, if you don’t pay for FSD, it will visualize the stop sign approaching and prompt you but if you ignore the prompt it will essentially say “ok well let’s go to Valhalla together” and won’t stop because you didn’t pay $15k. IMO if you are enabling a car to drive itself to that extent and it fully is capable of stopping at a stop sign, you should have to provide that to the user.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> As it is now, if you don’t pay for FSD, it will visualize the stop sign approaching and prompt you but if you ignore the prompt it will essentially say “ok well let’s go to Valhalla together” and won’t stop because you didn’t pay $15k.\n\nwtf lol, didnt know that. yeah definitely seems like something that you shouldn't be able to freemium.
