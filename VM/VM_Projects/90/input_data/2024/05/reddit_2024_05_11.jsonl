MS under 100.. when did you open your short calendars?

I think when I opened up my put trade on SHOP there was nothing between 60 and 55 so that’s why I picked those. Yep I like financials a lot lately but COF seems to have hit a lot of resistance lately around 142-143. Re the calendars my cost basis is very little on most of these because the short paid for 50% of the long cost and sometimes I’ll sell another short less than 30 days away. I’m opening these up at least 2-3 months out so they have time to move up. For MS I’ve sold them more than once so I’m sitting on 10 contracts June 21 longs with zero cost. Worse case scenario is I’ll sell 4 or 5 to cover the shorts and I’ll most likely ride the rest to expiration. For AAPL I had a bunch of different ones much higher and I sold them to get to the 185 when AAPL was at 170. The spreads on the calendars goes up as it gets close to the strike so they are still profitable. If the shorts expire worthless just under the strike then it’s perfect so I’ll see how it goes. Other calendars I have are Fang at 220, MSFT at 435, COF at 150, AAPL at 200 all several months out. Good luck this week!
