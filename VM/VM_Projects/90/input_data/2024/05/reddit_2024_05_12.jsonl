It is entirely possible that the decision will be influenced by personal political preferences of the leaders running these funds. Some others, (I call them emerald mine aficionados) are entirely driven by their emotional and irrational hatred of Musk. I highly doubt the decision will hinge on the hurt feelings of that last, unhinged group.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "If I recall correctly, there was no vote. That’s why it went to court.

It appears the judge ruled against the vote, because the board negotiated in bad faith on behalf of the shareholders; held back key information from shareholders; and didn't provide other options.
