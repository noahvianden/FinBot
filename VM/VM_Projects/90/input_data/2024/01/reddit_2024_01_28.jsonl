I'd advise 10%stocks for long-term less headache", "score": -14, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "As others have said, this is a risky approach. If you don't want to read the long explanation, then just establish two buckets of money: one for the short term goals (ie, whatever you need the 40k for in 2-3 years), and one for long term goals (ie, 10+ years away). The short term money should go in something safe like a HYSA, CDs, TBonds, etc. The long term money should go in a broadly diversified index fund like VOO/VTI/etc.\n\nNow, for the long explanation as to why.\n\nFirst, individual stocks are not simple and reliable investments. Even \"large and stable\" companies really are not. You mentioned some tech names, there is a company you may have heard of called IBM that used to be one of the biggest in the world. Well, even after the tech bull market we had recently, it still has not returned to its all time high from 2014. My point is that individual companies rise and fall. Today's leaders are not guaranteed to still be around tomorrow.\n\nThis sub is biased towards stock picking, so I'm not going to argue that it can't be done. However, it requires careful research and a lot of due diligence, and even then there's a lot of risk involved. Throwing your money in a handful of \"big names you've heard of\" is not that.\n\nFor a simple and reliable stock investing approach, that is where index funds come in. Basically, rather than trying to pick winners and losers in the market, you just buy the whole market. It's the strategy that best combines simplicity and success. While you are not fully protected from market downturns, your downside risk is lower than with individual stocks. You'll also over long periods of time achieve decent growth. The S&P 500, the main US stock market benchmark, averages \\~10% annual compound growth. Again, that's over periods of time measured in decades, which is why it's only recommended for long term investments.\n\nIn the short term, however, the market is extraordinarily volatile. The last two years are perfect examples of this. In 2022 the market dropped by >20%, and in 2023 it rose by >20%. This is why short term goals should never be invested in the stock market. The risk of you not being able to afford your short term goal is incredibly real.\n\nMoreover, with our current higher interest rates, you can achieve decent returns without the risk. High Yield Savings Accounts (HYSA) will give you between 4-5%, depending on the institution. CDs and short-term TBills give you >5% easily, Money Market funds do the same. You therefore have a host of options for getting a return on your money without the risk of the stock market.\n\nAnyway, I hope this information has been helpful.", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "Don’t put more in stocks than you can afford to lose.", "score": 40, "replies": []}, {"body": " No bro.
