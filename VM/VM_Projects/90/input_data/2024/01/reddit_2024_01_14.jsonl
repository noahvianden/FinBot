{"title": "How I saved my small account. Lessons learned.", "selftext": "End of of 2022 I put 1000 dollars into my Webull account. Prior, I had success trading ‚Äúinternet monies‚Äù and was able to turn a relatively small amount into respectable money (started in 2018-present. Don‚Äôt trade ‚Äúinternet monies‚Äù much anymore though. Too much regulation came into the space) I finally decided I wanted to jump into stocks to try them. I was only trading spot and quickly wrecked my account. Initially I was doing fine and turned that 1k into 1130$. What made me quickly descend was a combination of things. \n\n1: I fell into the party life and wasn‚Äôt taking good care of myself and my mental health (which was poor to begin with) suffered which greatly impacted my trading. This seeped into my trading life and I began to trade emotionally.\n\n2: I was mainly relying on technical analysis instead of using it in conjunction with fundamental analysis. \n\n3: I was trading companies I didn‚Äôt understand. \n\n4: I was trading companies that didn‚Äôt have real value and would be unattractive long term buys if I were to actually invest in them.\n\n5: I strayed from my trading indicators I normally used that worked during my ‚Äúinternet monies‚Äù trading era, I was using way too many. There was way too much noise on the charts.\n\nI killed my account essentially and gave up on it for a long time as I dealt with other personal problems in my life. I fell into a deep depression. Not from the account but a lot of things building up in my life. One day I received a thought that felt like it was sent to me ‚Äòyou need to revisit your account. You can‚Äôt give up so easily‚Äô. \n\nI began studying stocks more. I didn‚Äôt paper trade but I‚Äôm able to memorize numbers easily and would mentally take notes of what did what to each stock I was looking at and would compare the results to my thesis.\nFinally I felt confident enough to start trading again. I started very small and slowly began working my way up with the size of my trades. All in all I‚Äôve recovered my account with a 30% total profit over a series of 80 trades I‚Äôve taken in the past 3 months. \n\nThings that helped me\n\n1: The more I focused on market structure instead of using indicators the better my trading became\n\n2:I only traded companies that I would be comfortable investing in\n\n3: I look for good companies that are getting attacked in the media. I wait for them to go on discount and use my indicators to be able to see when a recovery is starting to form and sellers become exhausted. \n\n4: I stopped smoking or drinking. \n\n5: I stopped trading after hours.\n\n6: I leave runners once I‚Äôm in profit on the majority of my position. \n\n7: I don‚Äôt short (for the most part, I recently shorted BITO when the etfs got approved. I already closed those for a profit since I think that certain ‚Äúinternet money‚Äù will retest it‚Äôs recent highs before a massive correction into the 20/25k range). I‚Äôd rather make my money going long and then rotate into another beaten down stock. \n\n8: I stick to my set of rules\n\n9: I reflect on every trade-what emotions was I dealing with? What reasons did I enter the trade? What we‚Äôre some unnecessary risks I took that can be avoided in the next trade? How could I have exited the trade better?\n\n10: I learned how to use options \n\n11: I stopped ‚Äúmarrying ‚Äú stocks in my head. By this I mean I stopped becoming emotionally attached for companies. I became purely methodical in my trades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre wondering what indicators I use it‚Äôs \n2 different EMAs (different lengths depending on the chart) and Keltner channels. I like them better than bollinger bands.\nI have one more script I use but It‚Äôs for personal use only (sorry). If I gave it away it would be worthless. Not for sale.\n\nMy ending advice is to focus on market structure and volume. You can come back from massive failures. One step at a time. Keep learning and don‚Äôt trade more than a few percentages of your portfolio at a time.\nThe only book I recommend is ‚ÄúA complete guide to volume price analysis ‚Äú by Anna Coulling. It‚Äôs not the newest book but it‚Äôs information is great. Got it for a couple bucks on kindle. I will update as my trading journey continues further along. I genuinely thought I would never see my account return to these levels but these last few months have been a great learning period.

These two especially;\n* You are chasing your previous losses. (‚ÄúRecovered my account‚Äù) \n* You are chasing returns, there is not a single mention of risk and how you calculate it in this post.\n\nAnd I have seen many folks get wiped only for one of these reasons. These are catastrophic things to chase. \n\nThis line on your response is also a flag ‚Äúturning 80 trades into 300% gain on low beta stocks‚Äù\nYou are confusing low beta with low risk. And not talking about (or understanding) the risk you took.\n\nIf you did 300% gain in the last 30 days, that just tells me you were probably 30x leveraged or took massive risks that you are not realizing. (Given s&p was +10%‚Äôish). And with this that type of leverage/risk if the market had done something you didn‚Äôt expect, you would have lost a lot. You got lucky we were in one of the best bull markets last 3 months.\n\nSo what should be the correct goals to chase?\n* focus on your risks more so than your gains. Have a system to understand your risk you are taking and how much leverage you are applying - numerically. And how much you are comfortable with. And chase returns for the given risk. (Many systematic traders use sharpe or sortino ratio. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that complex)\n\nThe market rarely has free lunch on returns given the risk. But we are all comfortable with different type of risk. That‚Äôs why focusing on risk is more important factor to play with.\n\n* Have a fish memory. Ignore your previous losses and gains. Especially the gains. And be skeptical about them. Always have a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that special, how the hell did I gain this much over market? Is there some risk or leverage I‚Äôm taking that I don‚Äôt see?‚Äù Type of mentality.
