Large movements in the price of the stock (in either direction) equal larger gains/losses.

People who buy wayyyy out of the money options for a few dollars can wakr up to thousands in returns, but only because the stock price moved so much in that direction very quickly. It was very common during covid lockdowns to pick a random stock just before earnings and make a lot of money, because literally every company was shattering expectations during those earnings reports. This rarely happens anymore though. \n\nAs for AMD specifically, it's basically mirroring Nvidia because AMD is investing heavily into AI. It's no longer competing with Intel.
