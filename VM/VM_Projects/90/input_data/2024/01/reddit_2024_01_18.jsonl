BYD is growing sales only partly by cutting prices (mostly on their older PHEV models) . The main engine of BYD's growth is entering NEW segments. Their new Seagull which sits at the 10k USD price point in China is already selling at the rate of 50,000 units per month.  BYD has also moved on the other EV end of the spectrum by introducing near luxury (Denza N7), MPV (Denza D9), luxury offroad (FCB Bao 5), and high end luxury (Yangwang U8), many of which were introduced less than 6 months ago and are poised to grow sales in their own segments in 2024 without significant price cuts. \n\n\n Further more,  Teslas's golden cow is of course the Model Y, and that is the ONLY  segment that BYD has yet to enter with a throughly competitive offering. Now BYD has launched their Model Y competitor,  not one but TWO models, Sea Lion and Song L. That's not even considering the other Model Y competitors launched in China over the past 6 months, such as Xpeng G6 (now VW backed), LeapMotor C10 (now Stellantis backed), GAC Aion Hyper HT, Changan S7, etc.  And still that's not mentioning the two BIG hitters of the Chinese startup EV scene. Huawei's Aito is finally hitting its stride, now producing at 30,000 units a month.

The Chinese EV makers have been forced to respond by increasing their offerings into new segments, like what BYD and Li and GAC is doing, the only three profitable EV makers over there, or they are just running at a loss because they are state owned or they got cash injections from western automakers.  Tesla certainly won't have a new volume Model ready for mass production within the next 12 to 18 months,  so what else can it do other than continue to cut prices on the only two models they make and thereby further decreasing profits over at least the next 4 to 6 quarters? ", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Your statement makes zero sense.
