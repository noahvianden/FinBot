It is unclear of how an equity stake in ESPN would be accounted for in the CBA.*\r  \n\r  \n*It still could take months for a deal to be finalized. Both ESPN and the NFL declined comment.*\r  \n\r  \n*The NFL has been trying to unload its network for years now. In its recent talks that resulted in its $110-plus billion deals with ESPN, Amazon, CBS, Fox, NBC and YouTube, the NFL searched for a buyer, but was unsuccessful.*\n\n*It still could take months for a deal to be finalized.

In its recent talks that resulted in its $110-plus billion deals with ESPN, Amazon, CBS, Fox, NBC and YouTube, the NFL searched for a buyer, but was unsuccessful.* \n\n*NFL Media consists of NFL Network, NFL.com, Red Zone, NFL Films and NFL+.*\r  \n\r  \n*Since ESPN covers the league thoroughly, there would be synergies if the two sides are able to reach an agreement. Disney/ESPN might be able to secure better carriage arrangements for NFL Network.* \r  \n\r  \n*ESPN has targeted 2025 as the most likely year it will go direct-to-consumer.*\r  \n\r  \n*It is still possible it could move up the date to end of this year.* \n\n*When it does, it plans on offering all its programming without a cable subscription.*\r  \n\r  \n*A subscriber could choose to pay for the service directly through ESPN’s app or would still be able to opt for the ESPN channels through a cable or satellite provider.*\r  \n\r  \n*ESPN currently offers ESPN+ as a separate add-on service, but it has more specialty programming, including one exclusive NFL game.*\"\n\n***................End of article...............***", "id": "197b5h2", "created_utc": 1705331973.0, "score": 185, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "Hasn’t Disney been looking to offload espn?", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Dan Loeb, who owns hedge fund Third Point, made a public push for Disney to sell off ESPN and ABC in 2022. \n\nThis article ignores the fact that Hearst has a 20% ownership of ESPN Inc.", "score": 58, "replies": []}, {"body": "It may be expensive but its one of the few reasons to keep live TV products.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Every few years it seems to be discussed.
