{"title": "NVDA to join Dow Jones", "selftext": "After the split I think NVDA will not only be #1 company, surpassing MSFT, but also will be incorporated into Dow Jones.  Which means brokerages who do not own it would have to buy into it.  Stock will probably go to 160 per share (post split) and retrace to 140 after integration.  Hope I am right, next month will tell.\n\nEdit:  See my reply below of what happens to a stock when it is integrated into Dow Jones. (Separate comment below, a bit of reading, for those that need more info)\n\nIf added to the index, it will replace Intel.  Intel will be removed from DJ index funds and ETFs.  Would be a good time to short INTC if you are into that game.\n\nDoes anyone remember when Institutions dropped NVDA by 10.00% (exact number on the dot) in one day this year, no news or any negative impacts?  None at all, I lost 1/2 of my NVDA shares due to stop loss at 50% profit. I was 120%+ on NVDL and NVDX prior to that. The market makers/manipulators they think they can do what they want.  The reason for this post is to let the retail investors in the loop.  Buy NVDA shares up to 1300 (130 post split).  Once it joins Dow Jones,  institutions that do not own it would have no choice but to buy the stock, sending it up to 1600 (160 post split) to fill their quota.  We retail investors sell it once it get to that number.  Buy back on dip under 1400 (140).  We may not be able to control the market, but we can sell a couple hundred thousand before the makers can unload billions.  How about we let institutions hold the bags for a while?\n\nPersonally once 1600 (160) is reached, or close to it, selling most (emphasis here).  Will still keep 4% (out of 18% currently) of my portfolio in NVDA (in case it goes higher this year).\n\nUpdate:  big KABOOM coming up!
