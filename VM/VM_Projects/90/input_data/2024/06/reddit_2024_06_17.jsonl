{"title": "Plan to short TSLA", "selftext": "Why:\n\nTesla sales have been slowing and tesla inventory has been building. This is apparent from reports of inventory build up around their factories, Q1 reporting, layoffs, and the April 2nd update.  The following site also shows an inventory increase but I do not trust this source entirely since some of the basic functionality on this site is broken. [https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google\\_vignette](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google_vignette)\n\nThe recent tesla layoffs (late April) were a crossed the board and un-structured; reported as \\~10% of the workforce. I suspect that it may have been larger than that but have nothing to back that up. They were un-structured as employees were given no notice and some key divisions were let go in mass (supercharger team) which were later brought back on. Employees were given 2 months of severance pay to prevent a WARN act lawsuit. Payment was scheduled to go out 45 days after termination. All in all we can expect that for this quarter payroll will be approximately unchanged for Q2 reporting while production efficiency will have been reduced by more than 20% (reduced moral, key employees will have been let go, other employees will need retraining to fill vital roles). this means less than 80% of the work for 100% of the pay which means reduced margins in Q2.\n\nSpeculation: Tesla does not have updated models that would entice current model 3/Y (their bread and butter) owners to buy a new Tesla. Most people who wanted a Tesla have already bought one. Competition in the EV market is building; many auto makers now have EV's available that are more attractive to the every day driver.\n\nTesla is way behind now on autonomous vehicles. Waymo is already online in Phoenix and San Francisco and is being brought online in LA. Tesla rejected radar and lidar technology which is rapidly decreasing in cost. GM, Hyundai, BMW and other manufactures already have level 2 advanced cruise control (this is what FSD is) online. BMW will be releasing a level 3 ACC soon. Tesla dropped the ball and is already late to the market for fully autonomous cars and is falling behind on level 2 ACC. \n\n [https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/](https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/)\n\nTesla's robot, optimus, has not been shown to do anything useful beyond acting as a pick and place machine (these have existed since the 80's). Optimus can barely walk and is far behind Boston Dynamics (mostly owned by Hyundai). Optimus is a dead end and a pipe dream; Tesla is many years behind other companies and it's not clear if this technology will be useful considering the competitive wages of overseas workers. \n\nAfter the vote last week TSLA shot up in the pre-market then fell on Thursday and Friday. My guess is that a few, or even one, large share holder was backing out of Tesla; this was expected since this was a very divisive vote. The fan boi's have been pushing Tesla stock hard lately and although I have no proof I suspect that many influencers on youtube, twitter, and main stream media are somehow profiting through a back door means to pump Tesla and have been for some time. I have the feeling that most of us, or at least the people who have enough control to actually move markets, are seeing through Elon's BS and just need a catalyst to take a closer look and drop TSLA from their portfolio's.\n\nWhat:\n\nI plan to use \\~10% of my portfolio to buy out of the money puts on 1JUL24 expiring 19JUL24. Strike price should be about -10% from stock price at that time. Depending on the severity of the 2JUL24 report from Tesla I may see either a sudden drop or a slow decline in the stock price leading into 17JUL24. After market on 17JUL24 I am expecting another drop and will close my position at market open 18JUL24 with out regard to price.\n\n", "id": "1dhou8r", "created_utc": 1718595417.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 week ago\n**Total Comments** | 5 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Be a bear, but be a smart bear.

Tesla's implementation autonomous driving was abandoned by everyone else many years ago as it was found to be unsafe and unreliable; this is only suitable for SAE level 2 at most. They are also training on consumer drivers were as competitors are only using training data derived from professional drivers + using a driving simulator (garbage in = garbage out no matter how much data you have). They have not yet applied for legal permission anywhere to use an SAE level 3, 4, or 5 system. the current level 4 systems in operation are geofenced and speed limited for safety; Tesla would be required to follow these guidelines as well. No level 5 systems currently exist. \n\nThis is all really a moot point though; most Tesla owners did not buy autopilot/FSD and most drivers drop the subscription after the 1 month trial. Even if they achieved level 5 FSD it's not clear how profitable it would be since it is being sold as an add-on for a car sale (guessing it would be about as profitable as current systems are now). It's not clear if robotaxi's will be profitable either. These taxi's will still need maintenance (daily cleaning at least). For a service like Uber the driver would be on the hook for all of these expenses; with robotaxi's Tesla will be. Consumer cars will not be on the robotaxi network no matter what Elon says; imagine the insurance nightmare.
