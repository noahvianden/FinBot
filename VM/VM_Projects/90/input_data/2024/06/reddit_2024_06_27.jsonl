Another dividend raise? I don't fucking know - all I see is Jensen feasting on this joke of a spinach dip over the past week. Even the Wall Street regards are dropping price targets north of $170, couple at $200 already.\n\nJensen has said on multiple occasions now - GTC first, and the iNveStoR's meeting (regards) today - \"Blackwell will be the most successful product launch in NVDA's history\". The CoWos advanced packaging tech from TSMC increased production capacity sizably, which is starting to lead to higher than expected revenue projections for Blackwell this year. \n\nThen there's the GB200 set for launch in the fall.\n\n  \nAnyway, not to digress too much - my post history is entirely NVDA due diligence at this point, so see that if you need catching up on other recent NVDA announcements. \n\nOtherwise the read is simple enough even for regards like me after watching GTC. Especially so after he started getting asked for titty signatures. \n  \nPositions: leaps", "id": "1dpekqb", "created_utc": 1719449571.0, "score": 177, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 1612 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "There‚Äôs more than a few boomers sitting on $4-6 costs basis NVIDIA shares‚Ä¶.wish they knew how to use the internet to share their gain porn screens.", "score": 165, "replies": [{"body": "And they all pronounce it NUHvidia üôÑ", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Fun fact: the name of the company comes from the combination of some Latin root word for ‚Äúenvy‚Äù and ‚Äúvision‚Äù ‚Äî a company with a vision that others envy.\n\n(I probably sound like a walking signal of the top but I promise I try to be objective)", "score": 18, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Oh some of them are definitely around here.
