{"title": "Stock market at all time highs, housing market at all time highs", "selftext": "One must wonder why both the stock market and housing market are both at all time highs? The median price of a home sold in May was¬†**$419,300**¬†‚Äî an all-time record. As we know the stock market is at all time highs as well. Now lets look at what's driving the stock market to all time highs, not hard to figure it out its big tech. Wall St has a love fest with big tech right now. Just buy big tech and get rich right? Not so quick, those of you that remember the [dot.com](http://dot.com) bubble in the 90's remember how that ended. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139, erasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001, most publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. I was a trader back then and bought many penny stocks that skyrocketed in price during the [dot.com](http://dot.com) boom. Lucky for me I cashed out around the highs before most of them went bankrupt. This brings me to the current AI-boom which I missed out on. I am not saying the AI-boom is not justified. However, the market has already deemed the new winners. Just like it was during the dotcom boom there were winners but many went bankrupt. We shall see how the AI boom evolves, but when a sector is only thing leading the market to new highs history tells us a crash will follow.\n\nNow lets look at housing. I lived through the first major correction in the housing market in 2008. I took my gains from the 90s dotcom boom and invested in real estate soon after. I got lucky and sold most of my real estate right before it crashed in 2008. The stock market and housing market crashes of 2008 trace their origins to the unprecedented growth of the subprime mortgage market that began in 1999. Could we have a repeat of previous events? Right now average people can not afford a home. Why is this? Could it be Wall St has become a major buyer of real estate remembering the government bailed them out last time, who knows. What I do know is what my ole grandpappy used to say, what goes up must come down. Baby boomers own most real estate and will soon be major sellers due to death or downsizing, this is just facts. Right now, boomers have a pretty large grip on the US housing market. The generation accounts for about 21% of the total US population, but they own 38% of American homes We shall see what happens in the future but history always repeats its self.\n\nCHEERS!!  \nMAV", "id": "1dr1pu4", "created_utc": 1719630883.0, "score": 191, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôve lost track of how many unsubstantiated points you tried to establish as patterns or rules", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah his ‚Äúboomers will die and flood the housing market‚Äù point is particularly dubious considering the boomers are already dying and the biggest death rate spike for them happened during COVID.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "This.

Japanese carry trade is having problems. For those that don't. Know the Japanese bank have been borrowing yen and buying assets around the world for decades that yield a better rate of return. That was profitable and now appears to be a problem that is costing them money. To unwind the trade they have to sell stuff. A lot of stuff. Estimates are that the entire trade involves around $20 trillion in assets. If they dump a bunch of it then the supply of assets for sale goes up dramatically so prices probably go down. Any thoughts on that?\n\n3. Florida and California housing and insurance. The number of people using the state insurance of last resort has ballooned. That is a problem because the insurance of last resort doesn't have sufficient reserves to pay out large amounts of claims. I won't be surprised if a lot of turbulence in home demand occurs as people move due to this. My thinking is that prices there will collapse when the inventory of homes in those impacted markets start rising dramatically. On the other hand people have to live somewhere so a lot of those people are going to end up moving to other places and driving prices up there since demand will exceed supply for years. \n\n4.

I saw the other day that a particular building sold so far below the previous price that all the related bonds below AAA went to zero and the AAA took a big loss.

They haven't taken the losses yet, but it's going to be really ugly when they do. How do you think that will play out?
