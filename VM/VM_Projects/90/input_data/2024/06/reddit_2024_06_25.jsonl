This occurred to me recently when reading an \"analyst report\" re: a \"short-term buy signal\" re: some stock contrasted by a \"longer term\" sell signal: by short term, they meant 2-4 days, by \"longer term\", they meant 4-8 weeks!!! I was like, who gives a fnck about 4-8 weeks?!?!? I'm planning for retirement here! Might I have turned $100K into $1M in a relatively short time frame had I put it ALL into NVIDIA 1-2 years ago and day traded it back and forth ever since? Sure. But I don't have nearly enough capital to risk putting $100K into a single ETF, let alone single growth stock (I wouldn't even put that much into bonds alone). I imagine I'm not alone on that front here. For those of us who are just trying to generate some decent returns for ourselves so we won't end up homeless if/when we can't work anymore 10-30 years from now, stressing over short-term fluctuations is costing us time, energy, and emotional health. I think those of us in this camp need to decide--based on a meaningful but not obsessive amount of research--whether we think acquiring a given position (or adding or detracting from one) is more or less likely to yield decent returns over the longterm or not, act accordingly, and then just leave it be (save for adding to the position via some version of DCA) until (a) a black swan thing happens, (b) a reverse black swan thing happens, (c) it's time to rebalance, or (d) our personal circumstances change drastically (e.g., we win the lottery and have capital we can afford to play with, we get sick and need to draw down on investments sooner than expected, etc.). All I know is, I felt a lot more relaxed/able to focus on other things today after removing my brokerage app from my phone and logging out of the web platform.

The past 24 hours also reminded me of a lesson I've learned before (and apparently needed to relearn) re: investing: there have been FAR more times in the past 2 years when I've regretted not buying more of a stock/ETF than times when I've regretted a position more than 6 months out.

I remember people who were making 1 hour long YouTube videos when the stock was around $900 and saying that it was just a bubble and not to buy it.

I personally usually follow the RSI of a stock, anything above 70 and that means it's overbought, more demand than supply which drives the price up but there's so few shares being traded because everyone is holding for the long term, that eventually it corrects itself. It was trading around $1150 pre-split and just made its way back, once people started buying the dip it inevitably started to go back up. \n\nIf you buy at say $116 and never sell it could be years before you see any significant return, when in the same amount of time you could have multiplied your shares. Use apple for an example, they went from $195 to $160 back up to $195 down to $160 then shot to $215 in the last year, if you sold at $195 and bought the first dip you'd have been up 20% from your original position if you reinvested the profits and sold when it came back up. Then an additional 34% if you bought the second dip, and so on. \n\nIf you had just held Apple shares at let's say $140/share and bought October 2021 through the highs and lows you'd only be up 38% over 3 years if you sold on the recent ATH but would have made more than that this year alone buying dips and selling highs.   \n\nNVIDIA isn't going to be giving 1000% returns anymore and now is the time to ride the waves. If it drops 10-20% it usually reverses and gains twice as much. A drop from 140 to 116 is a 17% loss but 116 back to 140 is a 21% gain.

You'd have made 5x that at its current market value by selling at its target price and reinvesting on the dips. Up until its most recent spike Apple was trading at the exact same price it was back in 2021.

{"title": "EU charges Microsoft with 'abusive' bundling of Teams and Office ", "selftext": "The European Union on Tuesday accused Microsoft of breaching antitrust rules with the “abusive” bundling of its Teams and Office products.\n\n“The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,” the European Commission — the EU’s executive arm — said in a Statement of Objections, which is sent to inform companies of concerns raised against them.\n\nIf the Commission decides that an infringement has taken place once companies have responded, it can ban the conduct and fine the charged company up to 10% of its global revenue.\n\nMicrosoft took the pre-emptive step to unbundle Teams from Microsoft 365 in an effort to quash antitrust concerns by the EU. However, the Commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were “insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition.”\n\nMicrosoft said it would work to find solutions to address the additional Commission’s concerns. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement Tuesday. The company’s shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday.\n\nThe EU opened its investigation into Microsoft — which remains ongoing — in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams.\n\nThe Commission’s concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software-as-a-service — or SaaS — applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is “dominant worldwide” in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications.\n\n“In particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,” EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant’s advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability — the ability of two or more systems to work together — between Microsoft’s offerings and Teams’ competitors.\n\n“The conduct may have prevented Teams’ rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,” the Commission said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/microsofts-abusive-bundling-of-teams-office-products-breached-antitrust-rules-eu-says.html", "id": "1do4yti", "created_utc": 1719319064.0, "score": 288, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "They should charge them rather for the poor software design.", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "You mean the bloatware too right", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Man this is a fucking stupid take.

This is a really bad example, because you started off with no cookie, and you are in the process of thinking of buying a cookie and then you decide and there are not much description of an influential entity outside of you have great sway in this decision. \n\n\n\nHere is a better example. Let's say you work, and your work has a cafeteria, they sell cookies there. The nearest place you can buy a cookie is 10 minutes drive. Now you are on your break and you want to buy a cookie, so you have to make a decision. Now, you can drive 10 minutes for a better cookie, or buy the cookie from the cafeteria. The cookie in the cafeteria is basically a 5/10 in quality, the one 10 minutes away is 10/10. Out of 100 employees that wants a cookie or a SNACK even, will most likely buy the one at the cafeteria. The choice of what cookie the employees buy, is not really up to the employee, it is made by the Food Manager of the Cafeteria. At any whim one day he can put Oreos and the next day a different cookie that he likes, the choices are up to him, and less up to each individual employee. Now imagine that this Food Manager not only have power over this cafeteria but all cafeterias in the world. In fact all 90% of office buildings in the world comes equipped with this cafeteria chain, and so this food manager dictates what 1 cookie is sold in this cafeteria. Now, your wife, wants to get into the cookie business, she makes a cookie that is 10/10. Can she compete with this Food Manager? She can probably compete at the supermarket as she can do cold calls to all the super market and try to get her cookies carried there. But how about if all supermarkets basically only carry 1 cookie and this food manager also controls that? lol Now she has only access to small shops. Do you think her 10/10 cookie has a high chance of survival?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">What maps app do you use on your phone?

While Teams is operated as a cost leader, meaning they lose money on this product to sustain the dominance of other products. \n\nIf the cookie business is like this, then eventually your wife will go out of business as she will need to be able to access other cookie markets fairly in order to survive.

Is 1 (his friend's cookies) enough? 2? 3?\n\nIn the meantime while all of that is being figured out, is the cafeteria still able to sell their own cookies or do they have to stop all cookie sales?
