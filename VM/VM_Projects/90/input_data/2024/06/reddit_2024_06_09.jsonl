After selling, you have $800 in cash from the sale.\n\nOffsetting Gains: Suppose you also have $500 in capital gains from selling other investments earlier in the year. By using the $200 capital loss from selling Stock A, you can offset $200 of your $500 capital gains. This reduces your taxable capital gains to $300 for the year.\n\nCarrying Forward Losses: If your capital losses exceed your capital gains for the year, you can carry forward the excess losses to future tax years. In this example, you have $200 in unused capital losses that can be carried forward to offset capital gains in future years.\n\nSo, in summary, by strategically selling Stock A to realize the capital loss, you've reduced your taxable capital gains for the current tax year and potentially reduced your tax liability.
