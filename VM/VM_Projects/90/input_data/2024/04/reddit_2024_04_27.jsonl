{"title": "Apple - Regardless of this Quarter; Now is the time", "selftext": "Based on recent market activity I think this is a good entry point for Apple off the lows.\n\nHere are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now\n\n* Fall in phone sales especially in China\n* They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \\~9% for the year.\n* Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given.\n* Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god)\n* Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says)\n* It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense\n\nHowever, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.\n\nInstall Base & Great Product recognition\n\nBefore I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.\n\nApple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?\n\nAI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.\n\n~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~\n\nApparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)\n\nThe fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me. \n\nAs much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.\n\nOther hardware, such as \"The PIN\" and \"the Rabbit\" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.\n\nEdge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.\n\nSamsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.\n\nAll for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.\n\nLook for Apple to begin that story this June.\n\nMy position: Currently I have 1 share but I think now is the time.", "id": "1ce31se", "created_utc": 1714183249.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 6 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 2241 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This mfer said 1 share, I should bonk you but I agree AAPL go BRRR", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don't buy sideways stocks - albeit Nvidia has given me heart attacks lately", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Hate to break it to you but AAPL has been trading sideways for almost two years now", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "you're not breaking it to me if I am making the point", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "OP he meant he wants to break bread with you, he‚Äôs a regard excuse his French.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "French bread my favorite", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'm not sure if you know this, but AAPL has been trading sideways for almost 2 years now", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh I‚Äôll break it to you alright", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I have more than 1 share now :)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lmao wrote an essay for 1 share", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "TL:DR eat apples", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I remember the days when poor person posting was against the rules.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wrote it so you could come here and make this comment lol.

Then a few things may leak, like the Vision Pro project out the apple car project. \n\nApple is the most valuable company in the world. It doesn‚Äôt need to justify its future plans with anyone, at least not now. They the writing on the wall about China years before you did.
