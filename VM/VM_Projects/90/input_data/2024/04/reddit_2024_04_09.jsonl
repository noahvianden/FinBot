{"title": "YOLOing $30K into $BOWL options before earnings—big announcement coming?", "selftext": "**Imagine you and your buds could $200m by increasing your company's share price 35%. You have less than 2 years to do it. The bull market is in full effect. What do you do?** \n\nEnter Thomas Shannon:\n\n[Who do you think you are? I AM!](https://preview.redd.it/bfqa60rd2htc1.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa93ee849b220408e776a8d4064b454767f61559)\n\nThis guy is the CEO of Bowlero, a bowling company (lmfao) with an extremely financially overengineered and rather terrible balance sheet. **He also made $65 million in 2022**, making him one of the top 25 highest paid CEOs! \n\nThis guy likes making money, and if Bowlero hits $17.5, he and his friends PAID. \n\nLook at this:\n\n[So there is an earnout, which means that if the stock price hits $17.5 for 10 days, there will be17.5 \\* 11M  = $200 fucking million for Shannon and other earnout beneficiaries. Who are these other beneficiaries?](https://preview.redd.it/wqiq1yfmxgtc1.png?width=2820&format=png&auto=webp&s=4041a017a6dabf2d6d13aae4c8c94d04ee8fd32f)\n\n**Private Equity and Insider Involvement**\n\nAtairos is a large PE firm that helped bring Bowlero to market through a SPAC. They own a TON of shares. It is my view that they want to get the share price much higher before cashing out. Likewise, company insiders like Shannon own another 40% of shares. So it seems to me that there is a pretty aligned group of smart people with deep pockets who stand to benefit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf7ys4dk1htc1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ca7684d6863a212419f736daf589bc29b77223\n\nIf these guys want to hold for the share price to go up, float is effectively small...\n\n**Adding Fuel to the Fire**\n\nBowlero has been buying back its own shares with major buyback programs! Its float is already small and they are aggressively trying to make it even smaller. They have even taken on debt to buy back shares at times:\n\n[Let's just make our float a bit smaller...](https://preview.redd.it/9v157b3augtc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=8045d15cc37adf11f88a2e94f7a4bc0600784abf)\n\n**Buyback Announcement Increases**\n\nPretty regularly on earnings calls, management announces increases in the already sizabe buyback. Over the last two earnings calls this has resulted in big pops in the stock price. \n\n*I think this is mechanical due to short covering, and spurred on by positive announcements. So even without the \"earnout conspiracy\", I think it's a reasonable bet to go long through earnings:*\n\n[Last Quarter](https://preview.redd.it/lynsbspvygtc1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d0345c86cc10e6e0958d2349e19ddf54a1dda93)\n\n[Two Quarters Ago](https://preview.redd.it/1yegq76zygtc1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=31dea25426462898a081d7d2f5d14e8d5972598b)\n\nAnd why have these spikes been so violent? Well, Bowlero is highly shorted, because, as I said at the beginning, it looks like a rather ridiculous company and isn't \"fundamentally valuable\"—whatever that means:\n\n[Note: I am not sure of these numbers. I see lots of conflicting info. Someone help out?](https://preview.redd.it/nqfgmo9t1htc1.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3cfd46f9b8575aa9639f90d53d29906831d79df)\n\n*Earnings are coming up in Early March—if they announce a buyback, or great results, or a dividend, etc., things could get spicy.*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**You and your PE buddies can get $200m. You love money. You've made your float small. You're highly shorted. Massive incentive to get shares up to $17.5. Aren't you going to do something that makes it happen on earnings May 8, 2024?**\n\nYOLO:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i858w02r3htc1.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a0dff27c76c37b1d689a6ffe1fc9dbd0e1a287a\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.

Buying AMD is like shorting INTC without having to pay interest.   \n\nIntel is not that.  And I was a big Intel fan, I started working with their Nehalem design after college 15 years ago.  This cpu reshaped cloud computing.  It blew everyone away.  This Intel CPU changed how virtualization was done, we went from hosting a few thousand virtual machines to 10 thousand virtual machines in a small part of a colocation.  Our business  went 10x because of this and probably AWS did too.  If you ever owned I think a Sandy Bridge CPU from 2010 you’d know what a beast that was built on the same Nehalem design and was useable for consumers for 10+ years (it’s not a useable design for datacenter too inefficient now) \n\nFast forward 8+ years, Intel did minor tweaks if any to their design.

If you are hell bent on putting money in INTC wait 10 years that’s how far they are behind.\n\nI have never seen anyone ever install an Intel GPU for AI or even given it thought.
