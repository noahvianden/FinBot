Intel is not sexy. It isn't about to post massive earnings while it pours all of its cash flow into reinvestment in itself. That reinvestment is going to take multiple years as these new Fabs and expansions to current ones go up. Intel dipping its toes into a foundry model is a great idea. The reason why is that it is placing itself in a position to work with almost any company of the likes of nvidia or anyone else who needs chips made. It is also working to match the abilities of TSMC with what nm process'es it can acheive. Also, keep in mind the cost of building these facilities is so high that the barrier to entry is jaw dropping. There are only so many players with the ability to make chips at different specifications and there is only so much capacity to service those customers. Nvidia is a profit margin giant because it is a design firm and it outsources its production to partners. What hapens when a competitor has a better design than nvidia, what do they have to be flexible other than cash. Intel may no longer be the go to designer of the chips but I doubt they are going anywhere for the foreseeable future with how they are creating a vertical supply chain and reinvesting in themselves right now. Not to mention the US Government isn't about to let their US arbitrage against TSMC go anywhere. Look at Isreal, they will continue to pump subsidies to ensure the US is not wholly reliant on a foreign company for chip making. The whole world is run on these chips now. Not all requiring 3nm wafer production with its high margins but Intel has just made itself irreplaceble at the present moment to the US Security. I am pro Intel but i think there is a strong case to buy in right now because of its valuation compared to its peers. If you want to buy a company that is hot and overvalued you can.

Even without their fabs, they still sell one of the highest margin, most profitable product on the planet. The problem is, less people are currently upgrading and less servers/data centers are interested RIGHT NOW. Most companies upgrade on a time table, and with high interest rates and a slowdown in VC funding, a lot of tech companies are choosing to hold on with their current tech lineup. That combined with the fact Intel hasn't released any major CPU upgrades since the end of 2022(13th gen) means less people are overly eager to upgrade. Now, this is likely to change. People will begin to upgrade again, especially once 15th gen comes out, and eventually servers are gonna need new chips. This will be the primary revenue driver for the next few years, and should bring the company up to peak revenue and profit during 2021.\n\nAs for the fab side of the business, I really don't get what people are all up in arms about. The fab business has always operated at a loss, because it's there to support the chipmaking side of the business. Now that they're choosing to report fab losses independently of total chipmaking revenue, everyone's all up in arms about the losses. I don't see anyone talking about how Micron loses billions every year on their fabs. Long term, the fab business could be strong, but this again depends on your confidence in current leadership. I personally think Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO that can capably turn this company into a great one, much like he did with VMWare. No one had any hope that Lisa Su would be able to turnaround AMD, but here we are.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good play. It's a Monish Pabrai \"High uncertainty, low risk\" type play. The Capex has always been fairly high, and it's looking like it's starting to come down. The company isn't gonna die, regardless of the US government intervention.

AI will need exponential GPU supplies until someone invents a better processing unit for AI, which could be some form of analog processing, IMO. AMD, NVIDIA, and now INTEL are the only three companies that make AI training-ready GPUs. Intel just had their first generation and is already showing good enough results. The problem with GPU supply to AI developers is not how many GPU designer companies there are; the bottleneck is in the semiconductors. If TSMC or Samsung can't produce more, there is no new surplus of GPUs that Intel can capitalize on. If TSMC makes 10 GPUs worth of conductors and AMD and NVIDIA sell the 10 GPUs in a 7:3 ratio to OpenAI, now OpenAI needs 15 GPUs, but TSMC and Samsung still only produce 10, or maybe 11. The most Intel can do here is steal 1 or 2 GPUs so the ratio is 6:2:1 or something.\n\nBut! That's where why I'm bullish on them comes into play. Intel is planning to make their own factories in the USA and Germany for semiconductors. So if things go according to Intel's plan, it will be TSMC, Samsung, and Intel who are selling the semiconductors. They can sell them to AMD and NVIDIA and to themselves for cheaper. Thereby, they can capture a huge portion of the AI GPU demand in the next 10 years. So, in the new scenario, OpenAI needs 20 GPUs where TSMC and Samsung produce 13 worth of semiconductors and Intel produces 5. Intel then sells 3 of those to AMD and NVIDIA and 2 to themselves to then sell at extremely competitive prices.

On 4/24 I saw QQQ struggling to stay above 427.6 with a low of day around 424.2. Also noticed a gap from the previous day around 420. Couple other things came into consideration: META, from Oct. 2022 to April 2024 had rallied from $90 to $500+, a 480% move.  I figured earnings would need to be next level stellar for it to continue chugging along, also noticed the gap on META from February. I saw people suggesting $600 calls in anticipation of earnings..people posting memes of Zuck’s glow up. It seemed like up was the common consensus, despite the market flashing signs of a local top in the prior weeks leading up to earnings szn. Will post a QQQ chart next that hopefully gives you a better idea of what I was seeing. It was time to take a shot, loaded up on the 424 strike on 4/24/24!", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/fvietlz8epxc1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=346235ba502205ec174138fa2179ecdf92af3d8a", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks so much for answering and sharing! Awesome. Notes taken regarding the gapping from the previous day, plus QQQ being down on the prior days. Also interesting to see how you extrapolated your assumptions for Meta’s after earnings performance into the Qs performance.  I would assume that tomorrow is a good day to buy 0dte QQQ puts. I may buy one or 2 to put my toes on the water, but given all the mistakes I’ve made so far during this learning process I wouldn’t dare to buy more, and luckily, I’m not (yet!) a degenerate gambler. lol.  Keep those great trades going! ", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Do you need to own shares in QQQ to do that? sorry im a regard", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No, you don’t.
