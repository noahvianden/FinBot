In no particular order:\n\nA soft landing could potentially be interpreted to mean a very mild recession. Obviously that's not the ideal scenario, but I would think a super mild and brief economic downturn would still be quite the win under the circumstances.\n\nThe overall idea of a soft landing is slowing the economy without damaging it too much. Economies are not easy to control. The federal reserve does not have absolute control over our economy, nor does the federal government. They all have various powers to influence the economy, and influence it in substantial ways, but they cannot absolutely control it. So achieving this \"soft landing\" is extraordinarily difficult as it is quite easy to overshoot and over-restrict the economy and push it into a bad recession.\n\nTo make the above point even more challenging, the tools the fed has, monetary policy, operate with \"long and variable lags\" as Powell likes to say. This means that by the time the data starts showing X, Y and Z, the window of opportunity to change course may have already passed.\n\nFinally, interest rate policy has a murky concept of stimulating, restricting, or neutral rates, based on the impact the rates are considered to have on the economy. There is quite a bit of guesswork here, although the core of it is the difference between interest rates and the inflation rate. The absolute level of interest rates is not irrelevant, however which of those three buckets the absolute level of rates is very important for understanding what is happening.\n\nAnyway, all of this means that the fed believes that interest rates are both very restrictive, that inflation has come down, and that the economy is weakening. They want to get us to a neutral interest rate, one that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy, quickly before their window to avoid a recession closes.\n\nI hope that helps.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "It simply means no recession as a result of the pandemic, inflation, etc.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Vs a hard landing?
