All those buildings not being used to capacity is a big deal, but a bigger deal is all those commuters no longer commuting along those highways. All those people frequently stopped and made purchases or ate at a restaurant near their workplace. Fewer commuters, fewer transactions for those specific locations. All of that has impacts that are negative, but on the flip side a lot more activity potentially near the home.

All that movement will generate a lot of economic activity. \n\nIf we do see a serious recession it will likely not originate here in the US. It will likely be something rolling out of China in some form or fashion. On that aspect I have no real idea how things will play out over there.
