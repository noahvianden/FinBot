The stock is trading at a $40b market cap with \\~$3b in annual sales. Earnings are very volatile and cash flows are inconsistent.\n2. The business is asset-light but the custody assets are consistently growing on the balance sheet. They've gone from $2b to $200b in custody assets over five years.\n\nI know this is a momentum stock in many ways. Even though the crypto hype has slowed down, prices have doubled since last year. More money chasing fewer assets.\n\n$160 per share is rich. The stock price can get cut in half and I would still think it's expensive.

I hold a relatively significant position in ASTS (long shares). Mind, ASTS risk profile is very different from Mag7, so it's not something you'd want to copy blindly. Also mind I'm in ASTS for 3 years now and did DD every single day since then. I really understand what I play with.\n\nThis naturally gives that I sell much more CCs than CSPs, however, I also hold cash and sell CSPs too. If I'd start with a fresh account, by all means I would stick to CSPs for as long as I can reducing my cost basis to the max before getting assigned.\n\nMy cost basis being way way below current price point allows me higher risk. I still hold high conviction in the company despite the stock price's recent move. I'm ok selling puts ATM, if premiums are that good. E.g. on 9/5 I sold 9/13 $28 puts for $3.4 in premiums which at that time were ATM. Still expired worthless tho. However, I usually settle for something with <.3 deltas.\n\nFor CCs, I sell them further away from the current price because of the same reason - I still believe further move upwards is still possible in the underlying and, while I'm ok getting assigned and taking profits, I also a) want to max those capital gains before I'm assigned b) would attempt to jump back in selling CSPs or at least collect premiums, so re-entry point is important. That leaves my CCs deltas more conservative at <.2.\n\nIn both cases I may make exceptions with the deltas if opportunity allows.\n\nI do weeklies or bi-weeklies. Depends on which one offers better returns. Often it's a combination of both.\n\nI plan my sto orders couple of days in advance and target them to high movement in the required direction days, so big red for selling puts or big green for calls. I will settle for whatever else available if I can't get a desired move during those couple of days as later theta decay will cost me more and will usually sto not later that 9-4 DTEs.\n\nI allow my position to expire worthless or btc them only at \\~90% gains. Some people do 50% or even less if they reach meaningful profitability within first days after selling. That's partly because I mostly (but not only) do ASTS and have little other ideas for wheeling where I would have the same amount of conviction in the business offering the same level of returns in premiums - no better way to employee my cash if rebought early.\n\nI'm also much more likely to btc puts as they affect my buying power. I only btc calls if challenged and theta already did its job (good net credit without rolling out).\n\nBy no means I consider myself a pro in this. But doing weeklies has a short feedback cycle and so far the feedback is ok. I'm afraid of two potential issues: a) there's some significant lose-all/most risk involved that I don't see and the party will be over when I least expect it or b) IV will settle down taking down my returns with it and my returns will revert back to normal (reality check).\n\nI'm open to learning better ways of doing this if anyone had comments.

Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
