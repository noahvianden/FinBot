{"title": "Talking about $INTC Takeover Rumors and Apollo Deal", "selftext": "Let’s talk about the rumors: Qualcomm potentially taking over Intel, and the investment from Apollo. First, the Qualcomm takeover—it’s super unlikely. A takeover is usually either a cash buyout or a merger.\n\nNo way Qualcomm goes for a cash buyout. They don’t have that kind of cash lying around, and there’s no chance they’re gonna take on massive debt just to buy Intel. Intel isn’t exactly rolling in profits right now, so taking on that debt would just hurt Qualcomm in the long run with all the interest payments and losses they'd have to deal with from Intel. So yeah, not happening.\n\nA merger seems a bit more possible, but here’s the thing: Qualcomm is already crushing it in AI chips for phones and probably gonna lead the AI PC game too. What do they really get from merging with Intel? The foundry business is the only thing that might attract them, but the price could be steep. Qualcomm would have to deal with Intel’s losses and those from its subsidiaries. Plus, Intel’s board and shareholders wouldn’t agree to a lowball offer. And if Qualcomm offers a premium just for the foundry, I’m not sure their board or shareholders would sign off either.\n\nSo yeah, a merger? Not likely. Best case, Qualcomm ends up being a big customer for Intel’s foundry business when they spin it off.\n\nAs for the Apollo deal, that seems more legit, but $5 billion isn’t gonna move the needle much for Intel. It might cover one or two quarters of cash burn, but the downside is a likely unsexy valuation and heavy dilution for shareholders. Intel needs the money, so it’ll probably happen, but it’s definitely not great news for shareholders—definitely not the bullish one.\n\n", "id": "1fnco7n", "created_utc": 1727067115.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 year ago\n**Total Comments** | 24 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "qcom wants to break into the pc market and is only interested in intc's chip design group for cpu, gpu, and possibly data center.\n\nreason: to diversify its revenue and generate growth.  \n\nother than that, qcom has no serious capital to support or assume ifs debts. \n\nintc board is highly unlikely to approve the offer to buy out intc cash cow.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "\" but $5 billion isn’t gonna move the needle much for Intel.\" \n\n\n\nI wish i could come back to this particular post in a year to sh1t down OP throat.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "$5B from where?\n\n8B from raimondo & the chip act is only 1/4 of intc last year capex for equipments.\n\na lot of those who are shitting on intc don't realize how domestic chip fabs impact the national security of the usa.\n\nif intc failed, the world will depend on china for legacy chips.  and usa will continue to send weapons to taiwan to protect its chip manufacturing industry including tsm.  \n\ni certainly would rather see my tax money being invested domestically.  🤷‍♂️", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "yea biden is holding out on the moeny from chip act, promising $8.5 but ended up withholding it at the department of commerce.
