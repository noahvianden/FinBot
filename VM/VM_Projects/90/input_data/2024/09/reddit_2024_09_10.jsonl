This case stems from a 2016 decision by the European Commission, which claimed that Apple received ‚Äúillegal‚Äù tax benefits from Ireland for over 20 years, allowing the tech giant to dramatically reduce its tax bill.\n\nTuesday‚Äôs ruling by the European Court of Justice reverses a 2020 decision that had favored Apple, upholding the Commission‚Äôs original verdict. The Irish government, which has always denied giving preferential tax treatment to Apple, acknowledged that this case is now of \"historical relevance\" and will soon begin transferring the funds held in escrow to Ireland.\n\nThis ruling is part of a broader campaign by the European Union to regulate U.S. tech companies, who have faced increasing scrutiny over tax avoidance, data protection, and market dominance.
