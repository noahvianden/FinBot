{"title": "Warning to Options Traders: This Will Destroy You", "selftext": "Options trading is gambling, no matter how you try to spin it. You‚Äôre not some market genius, you‚Äôre playing a random game, and like all gambling, the house always wins. If you keep going, this will lead to financial ruin, jail, or even death.\n\nA lot of people on this subreddit will tell you to ‚Äúrisk manage,‚Äù ‚Äúcontrol your emotions,‚Äù or that you ‚Äújust need an edge.‚Äù It‚Äôs all a lie. The market is chaotic, the numbers move too fast, and large sums of money vanish in seconds. This isn‚Äôt about strategy‚Äîit‚Äôs about dopamine, the thrill of the win, the rush of the gamble. It‚Äôs addictive, and it will wreck your life. Options trading is just a more sophisticated version of gambling, dressed up as investing. You can‚Äôt get an edge in a random game.\n\nThis post is going to make a lot of people mad, and you know why? It‚Äôs the denial talking. Their gambling addiction is making excuses, justifying their losses, and telling them they can still beat the system. But deep down, they know this is true. Most people here are chasing losses, in debt, and barely holding on. They‚Äôre fooling themselves into thinking they‚Äôre in control.\n\nIf this sounds like you, stop now. If you need help quitting, DM me‚ÄîI‚Äôve been there, and I can help you before it‚Äôs too late. Don‚Äôt let this addiction destroy everything you‚Äôve worked for.

Loser does not receive anything at all in exchange!\n\nInvesting / Trading = Buyer makes a payment to the seller. The buyer makes a payment because they receive something (shares / service etc) in exchange from the seller.\n\nBuying or selling an option is not gambling in my view. When I buy a single call contract I pay a premium to the seller for a SERVICE. That service is that they need to fetch me 100 shares of a stock and be willing to sell them all to me at the agreed STRIKE PRICE at any point up to expiration.\n\nI don‚Äôt understand why some haters describe options as derivatives / gambling. With a derivative I don‚Äôt get anything tangible (goods / service) in exchange where as with a call option I benefit from ONE guaranteed element (the fetching of the shares) and a secondary optional element aka the 100 shares available to buy at a fixed price. Now if I chose not to exercise so what, that does not mean the transaction of me buying a call option was a gambling transaction because IMO I paid for a service and received ‚Äútechnically‚Äù that specific service, the shares where ready for me to buy.
