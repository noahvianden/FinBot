{"title": "Why does the China Tech Sector (KWEB) never seem to hit a bull run?", "selftext": "***I bought KWEB back in 2019/2020, was living in Asia at the time so it didn't seem that exotic.***\n\nMy feeling (and those around me) was that the China Tech sector would rise to equal or even overtake the US tech sector simply based on population numbers, large amount retail of participation in the share market within China and general interest in this market from the rest of the world. The fantasy tech portfolio would be 50/50 US/China and have some built in currency diversity (so we thought ;-) ). Big CAP tech with separate markets.\n\nEventually that turned out to be a fever dream, it crashed for a number of reasons, including some regulatory issues certain companies had, after the crash I came out flat.\n\nHowever, unlike US large CAP tech, it never recovered and aside from an uptick 2-3 weeks back based on stimulus news, it's been flat!\n\nJust re-invested a couple of weeks ago based on said news (similar to news which regularly causes the US markets to go parabolic) and got burned again when it fizzled out.\n\nThese companies are all still around (Ali Baba, Baidu, Ten Cent et al) and not making losses. But they are priced like QQQ 10 years ago. Buying opportunity, right?\n\nIt's my feeling that one day this (KWEB for example) will wake up and potentially go 2x to 3x in a year or two, which will still make it cheap vs its US counterparts.\n\n***There's the setup, here's the question***\n\nWhat do I do out of the following\n\n1. *Buy the KWEB ETF and potentially hold a potentially nonperforming asset for a long time and suffer the opportunity cost of waiting for some change that kicks off a positive correction*\n2. *Buy the KLIK ETC (KWEB with covered calls) which underperforms KWEB due to it's recent spike, on the assumption it goes back to being flat, and at least I get some dividends while I wait for it to stop flatlining and go up (then if the rally has legs flip to KWEB)*\n3. *Hold a small amount of KWEB, get an alert when it jumps in a day (or intra-day) and then go read the news and see if it seems like a sustainable bull run is now on the cards. If that's the case, buy more*\n\nFull disclosure, I'm currently doing #3.\n\nBTW, anyone know of a free service that can alert you of an intraday (or day to day) % change over say 5% and provide an alert? IBKR makes you put in an actual price level, which is not that useful.\n\nFeedback welcome from all you China bulls, it's hight time we saw some sustained growth!!", "id": "1g7vcaa", "created_utc": 1729418516.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 20 hours ago\n**Total Comments** | 24 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Doesn’t matter; Xi bought puts", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "Type", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Haha, well, i was intentionally \"apolitical\"", "score": -13, "replies": [{"body": "So were they.
