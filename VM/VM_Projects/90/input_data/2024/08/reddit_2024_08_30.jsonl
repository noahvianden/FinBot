What you have to decide is whether that combination of the business being high quality and the price being right is right in this situation.\n\nThe people telling you 'don't time the market' are not really accurate. You shouldn't try to time the *market* when you buy index funds, because nobody can predict the market. But buying individual stocks does require a timing element - which is actually a valuation element. What price are you going to buy at, what price are you going to sell at? Every security you buy needs to be bought with those things in mind.\n\nYou should not buy a stock right now. The reason for that is you are new to this, and you say you find the information confusing to parse, so you are relying on other peoples advice to work out what to do. That is a big problem. The reason it's a big problem is that the majority of people who invest in individual stocks (as opposed to investing in the whole stock market, through index funds) don't do well. They underperform index fund investors. Probably something like 90% of people underperform the index investors in the long term, including most of the people who post here, and most professional investors too.\n\nGo away and learn about investing *away* from reddit. Books and videos are the best way to learn. Phil Fisher's book *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* is the gold standard.

Learn something about what you're going to buy. \n\nIf you are sitting on a lot of money doing nothing with it, don't be in a rush.
