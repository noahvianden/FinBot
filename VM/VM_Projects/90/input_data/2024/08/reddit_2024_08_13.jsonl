{"title": "I joined the Granma army, guess me luck", "selftext": "# I joinned Granma army \n\n(Position at the end)\n\nList of motivations:\n\n1. I think INTC right now is pretty undervalued. They have issues, of course, but they have a lot of potential in fields that are growing rapidly where VCs and investors are putting money, like AI.\n2. **Gaudi 3**: This chip is very promising, and if they can keep developing AI chips like that, they will sell like hotcakes. The software is not already there like CUDA but it's getting closer.\n3. **Next-gen CPUs**: The current 13th and 14th gen are bad, really bad, but they are integrating AI accelerators (Intel® Core™ Ultra). That is the same move NVIDIA made with their RTX series. I think this is one step ahead of the competition and will pay off in the future when applications that require AI, like Photoshop, use these new accelerators instead of the cloud with simpler versions of their models. Similar to Google and Pixel phones.\n4. [US Security](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/us-chips-act-intel-direct-funding.html): As the announcement said, Intel and other critical chip manufacturers are getting a lot of support from the US administration, and this will continue with Trump's \"Made in USA\" plans. As geopolitical tensions continue to rise, it will be mandatory for the US government to ensure Intel's position.\n5.

Every developer in the field uses CUDA, to convince them to switch you have to offer something significantly better.\n\n3. Intel hasn’t made a next gen anything since 2009. They were the incumbent leader and they wasted their time reselling the same Sandy Bridge CPUs for years. When AMD finally surpassed them they tried to innovate and failed miserably. This what you are betting on, a failure. Catch up to Nvidia? Are you aware how far ahead Nvidia really is technologically? They can rest for the next 10 years and still be ahead, but they won’t since they aren’t as stupid as Intel was. \n\n4. Yeah let’s hope that the government saves our capitalistic assess.
