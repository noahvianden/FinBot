The thing that \" is evident in the long-term charts of UVXY and VXX. These funds have a nasty tendency of absorbing negative roll yield for most of their existence. Because both UVXY and VXX purchase short-term VIX futures, they have to sell the front month futures and buy the back month futures. They must do this regularly. However, the term structure of these futures is usually in contango, which means the front month is cheaper than the back month. The fund pays out this difference to the market in exchange for the convexity offered by the VIX futures in the event of a market selloff. The negative roll yield is effectively an insurance premium paid for protection from a market crash. There is no free lunch.\n\n\"The UVXY, and UVIX plus a few other etfs are known as widow makers.
