Stock is up 4.2% while the mark of the call is up 7.6%. The bid/ask isn't too terrible, 2.75/2.95 on what appears to be a nickel increment.

That would mean a 3.8% gain. With me so far?\n\nAssuming a delta of 0.72, a .25 gain on the stock would translate to an .18 gain on the call. Let's say that at the time you were looking, the bid/ask on the call was much wider, like 2.50/7.50. That makes the mark 5.00.

P/L charts for calendars and diagonals are hard to interpret, because they can only show one date at a time, but calendars have two expiration dates. And since they can only show one expiration date, they may **under/overstate the true risk/reward**, because the market may change between the two expirations. For example, suppose the BE's are based on the back leg expiration and the path the stock follows is worst-case: rises before the front leg expires and then tanks before the back leg expires. That's not going to have that optimistic BE at expiration.\n\nNow, if the BE is based on the front leg expiration and you plan to close the back leg at the same time, the BE would be more reliable, but that isn't always the best way to play a calendar. And it's still less reliable than other structures, like a vertical spread, where all values are known for a given stock price. That can't happen for a front-leg P/L \"expiration\" chart, since the back leg will not be near expiration and will have to be a guesstimated value based on an unknowable amount of IV.\n\n> and said it'd only be profitable if it moved less than a dollar.\n\nThat's not exactly what I meant. As noted above, since calendar P/L is hard to chart, I'm not sticking to your chart. I'm just using illustrative numbers here to paint the big picture. For example, let's say max profit is $100. The calendar could work out such that within +/- $1 of 129 you make between $90 and $100, but more than $1 rapidly falls off. That's the overall shape of the P/L chart.\n\nSo if 10% of all profitable outcomes you average $90+ gains, near max profit, but 90% of all profitable outcomes you average around $3 in gains, on $100 of risk, is that a good bet?

It has a max profit of $6, with a max loss of $44.\n\nYou don't have to include the minus sign for the 19p in a vertical. It's needed in a calendar or diagonal, since the front leg can be either short or long, but for a credit vertical spread, the strike nearest the money is always short. To indicate that the spread is a credit spread, you use -1 at the front, as in sold to open 1 spread, like this:\n\n-1 INTC 19/18.50p 8/30 @ 0.06\n\nA debit spread would just be \"1\" (positive 1). You only need one p (or c) since a vertical spread is always all puts or all calls. If it were instead a strangle, which always uses both a put and a call, then you'd use a letter on both strikes, like 19c/18p.\n\nFWIW, that's a terrible credit spread. Ideally you want the short leg to be near or less than 30 delta and you want to get at least $.34 per dollar of spread width. Since the spread width is half a dollar, that means the *minimum* credit you should accept is $.17. Your spread only pays $.06, so it's pretty bad.\n\n> Why is this considered a bullish trade? \n\nBecause it makes money if the stock price goes up and loses money if the stock price goes down.\n\n>  Is this spread betting that the price of INTC will both go over $19, and under $18.5 in the same day, so that both legs can be sold profitably?\n\nNo. For a vertical spread, the leg furthest from the money (18.50) is a sunk cost that acts as insurance in case the stock price moves against you. It only comes into play if the stock price goes down. If the stock price goes up, you can ignore it. At expiration it will have zero value if all goes according to plan. \n\nIf the stock price moves against you, like it drops to 17, the 18.50 put will gain value and will cancel out losses on the short 19 put.\n\nHere's an explainer: https://www.projectfinance.com/vertical-spreads/", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Even if the stock does move though would that not still be profitable in a diagonal ?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Is any profit, no matter how small, always worth it?
