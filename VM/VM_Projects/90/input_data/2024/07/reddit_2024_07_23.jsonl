Issues in one or more can push back timelines, and if anything requires changes it can cause cascading timeline issues. It’s not hard to imagine how changes to steering geometry mid project might require bodywork changes, for example. \n\nIn my field we talk about “innovation budgets” a lot. Every new, untried thing you pull in causes risks, many of which you cannot see from the planning phase. It’s often better to innovate on a small number of key areas and then choose tried and true technology for everything else precisely to prevent things from getting out of hand. ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Good points.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I believe the next scientific advances will come in battery technology, and this will most definitely benefit the EV market.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "It's probably all small wins from here out - there are lots of promising battery chemistry research going on, but it's all trade-offs for as long as the eye can see - i.e. this chemistry is a little better for charging but a little worse for cycle durability, this is a little better but a little more expensive.\n\nI would be surprised, for example, if we can get, say, another aggregate 50% improvement in capacity, in the next decade.
