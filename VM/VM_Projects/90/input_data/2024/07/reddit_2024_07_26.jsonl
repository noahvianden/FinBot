As such, it's possible to see a volatility spike on a rapid sudden drop in sp500. \n\nThe reason the volatility drops is because a trend has been established... so sharp crash and then steady downtrend would also see ... a sharp spike in volatility followed by a steady decline in volatility.\n\nIt's just that the inherent nature of the sp500 and its annualised return of 10.2% (i.e., perpetual bull market) leads many to come to the erroneous conclusion that low volatility and a bull trend are co-related as an absolute truth.\n\nWhen in truth, it's actually low volatility is related to any stable trend (could be up or down).you can probably see it in the 2008/2009 charts. \n\nThat being said, if you're investing into SPY, it would be better to dca into your position to average out the effect of volatility.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Can you explain this to me like a child please.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "OK, let me try again. \n\nKeep in mind that this is an oversimplification.\n\nInstead of the dollar amount for vix, think of it as war points. The combatants are the bulls and the bears.\n\nThe battle field is the spy currently at 544 level.\nThey get 1 point every time there is change of a dollar in movement. \n\nOn an average battle day,  12 - 14 points are issued a day. \n\nThat means bulls and bears could collect 7 points each of the 14 points for a flat day. Or, on some days, bulls may collect more points than bears and vice versa.\n\nThe day before 19 points were issued.At this point, you don't know what the movement is, only that you have 19 points. And you are not allowed to look at the spy chart\n\nThe 19 points mean the battle is more violent than usual. Usually, when the battle gets so heated up that more points are being issued its becuase one side is a clear winner for the day and is pressing its advantage.\n\nAll you know is that vix spike means fear is the controlling factor of the market, whether its fomo or fear of bag holding is to be determined.\n\nIf you go by historical data, vix spike means an increase in demand, so it means time to start buying as the bulls are winning. Or it could be because it's close to the end of the week and some institutions decide to take some profits off the table and were a bit violent in doing so, leading to the bears winning \n\nIf the next day, the vix issues less than 19 points but say higher than the 13 points avg. It means the losing side is not ready to give up and is still resisting, and the winning side is unwilling to commit more forces to the battle.\n\nIf higher than the 19 points, then it means the greed of the winners has become immortal and are pillaging the vanquished and decimating their holdings. The battle is over the day that 12-14 points are issued because it means both sides have decided to maintain peace (temporarily) at whatever new price point.\n\nIn the future, new soldiers,new equipment will likely be deployed it could either be the losing side - the resistance or the winning side - the empire taking even more resources. \n\nNotice from above you can't really tell whose winning just from volatility? You need spy prices in tandem to get an idea of the picture.\n\nGoing back to the battle report, vix had a peak of 19 points the day before, and the spy was at 537 at its close, which means the bears went on an all-out rampage. \n\nThe next day, we saw that vix dropped sharply to 16, and the spy was elevated to 544. Which means bulls are resisting, but the bears were still committed to their offence, albeit with lesser warriors than the previous day.\n\nIf vix drops to 12-14 next week, that will likely be the new price level for the duration.\n\nSo just buying when vix is down isn't really the secret sauce for magic. 10 days ago, the vix was at 12.57 level.
