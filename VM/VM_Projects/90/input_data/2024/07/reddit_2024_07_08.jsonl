{"title": "MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI.", "selftext": "I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.\n\nIf chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.\n\nNow for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. You're paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.\n\nMSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.\n\nAAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.\n\nThat fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.\n\nI agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line.

(I went to an Ivy and many of my classmates went to law school and they use such strategies as claiming mental illness for extra assignment time or exam alternatives and leverage outside resources for the assistance on papers, etc.) An attorney then goes into their worthless program for a few years which is more or less a glorified internship incubator program without any actual skills nor prep for the job. Once they enter as an Associate at some prestigious firm, they're essentially thrown into big legal matters without much prep and expected to keep up utilization by billing whatever client they're attached to. These arrogant idiots refuse to take direction and often times create complex messes for which they bill millions upon millions of dollars until it's discovered many years down the line. As attorneys progress their career, they really just become glorified salespeople. Partners aren't experts in the real world scientific sense, they just have a client list and get credits based upon their new business origination, managing clients, name recognition, etc.. During their careers, they're expected to promote their names by any means to which I've seen the biggest idiots I've worked with speak in front of audiences with only the arrogance an incompetent attorney can muster or people that came from sensitive senior government roles exploit it by turning around to use their personal connections to protect foreign enemies (and charge a fortune for it). There's also an ultra conservative culture where the partners are treated as gods since they bring in money to the firm, which results in most being absolutely terrible scum of the earth, viewing their title as a license to berate and treat others as subhuman servants.  (notice the guy that originally responded tried to invoke his status \"as an attorney\" without realizing I'm a SME in the field) \n\nI am currently in a position where I am their boss and also a subject matter expert, which has changed this dynamic dramatically. Once you reach this side of things, the role is more about acting similar to what a contractor does in construction (but with regarded children), but also with protecting your firm from risks and predatory behavior. I can't tell you how many times I or one of my peers have had to absolutely tear apart and fire a law partner and their team for providing no value and making up fake bills, which is all considered normal in the legal field. \n\nUltimately, you'll realize most attorneys have no clue what they're doing. I've interacted with ones that type their entire email in the subject line because they can't figure out email despite their job literally revolving around tech and such things as forensic metadata. I've also interacted with many such as the types above that learn just enough to act like they know what they're talking about to land a sale or promotion, but have no depth of knowledge and ultimately pay another firm to offload all the work too. There are multiple tiers of consultants and vendors the law firms hire to do all the real work which they'll mark up to high hell and bill the end client. All the while, the 'legal strategy' for most attorneys amounts to just producing as many documents as possible in order to overwhelm the other side and keep the litigation going as long as possible to bill the client until they retire.\n\nNow, there is a path into law by having a technical background, but I can use a few fingers to count how many amongst the thousands I've interacted with have an engineering degree. What makes this worse is the law degree is essentially a ponzi scheme. Corporate law is what actually pays, but most will never meet the requirements so they end up paying a few hundred thousand for a degree that pays little more than a fast food employee these days. \n\nAlso, many are absolute degenerates that are also psycho/socio-paths. Sexual harassment, open drug use in the office, etc...everyone that's worked in law long enough has a story. \n\nDon't even get me started on personal stories. One involves a woman named Meytal, who used to call a vendor and scream for over an hour that THEY need to be more creative to predict her mistake before she made it and fix it and they better answer within 5 minutes of her emailing. She would bill the end client thousands for these calls...\n\nYou see, modern litigation is very lucrative. I've worked on the client side previously and worked with major companies. Someone like Meta may spend a few hundred thousand per month on a single matter that you see in the news.
