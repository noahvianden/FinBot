Like Sora, looked amazing, but has no real world use case that justifies the cost of its full potential. And then there is their voice model which looked just incredible in demos, but hasn't been delivered. I imagine cost to run that, and reliability is a major factor. The compute to deliver that voice model in the latency demonstrated must be enormous. ChatGPT 4o pro costs over CAD$30, do we really think that regular folks are going to pay more for fancier voice? Their image generation is noticeably worse.\n\nWhat we will likely see is \"good enough\" models enhancing search and other traditional web uses. Everything else is going to be subscription for power users that can justify the cost, and that isn't going to be something widely adopted.\n\nIf Nvidia can deliver inexpensive, more efficient chips then they are seeing the same horizon. But competitors are likely working on this too. And as you said, we might be in a world where cheap CPUs get mashed together to do the lion's share of LLM work that can be ad/user data supported just like traditional web.\n\nThe idea of LLMs being a transformative, new world, paradigm changer is quickly evaporating. The hype is settling down. I skip over LLM \"shocked the industry\" videos because they are all hyperbole demos, speculation, and circlejerk commentary.\n\nI predict Nvidia will slowly spin down to around where it was pre LLM hype.

I got in the trade early at 8:30 central time exactly when the bell rung while I was at work at my retail job.

I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190.

And I am not looking at my individual trades, I am looking at my net gain at the end of the year and seeing how I can outperform the market. I want to win the war, knowing that I will lose some battles along the way.\n\nAnd I study charts every day. I look at multiple time periods. 5 min, 15 min, hourly, daily weekly and monthly.  You need the entire view and I use candlestick charts so you can see the action happening for each time period.\n\nFor instance, SPY is forming a shooting star candle on the monthly as we close the month. RSI topping out on the monthly, starting to turn negative on the weekly, and daily is heading down. August is the month where traders go on vacation. And tomorrow is the EOM so the funds need to rejigger their positions.  \n\nHere is my hunch for Friday 31st. We open higher in the morning to bring in the suckers and drive up the option prices for calls and down for puts. My guess is around 12-1 ET, market holds sideways a bit to kill the IV, and then the bottom falls out around 2-2:30p. And after I typed that I checked a thread that I follow with other traders, they believe the same thing. Sell the gap up tomorrow - so that would mean buy daily puts and be prepared to trade in/out over a very short period of time. 1-2 hours.  Might be able to buy some puts for .30c and sell for $3 if it goes to plan. But they will have stops at .20c if it doesn't. still lose a third but better than losing it all.\n\nIf we open lower and still run up, theory is probably still in tact.
