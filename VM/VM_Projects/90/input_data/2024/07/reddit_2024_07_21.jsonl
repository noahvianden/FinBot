At the end it's just a discussion. Now let me give you a few points:\n\n1. Strategy goes like this: \n\nYou own a futures contract\n\nYou buy In the money 1 Long Put to hedge yourself from market falling, if market falls your Long put option will be exercised at a higher price, thus you'll be in profit no matter how low market drops\n\nYou Sell further 2 Out of the Money Calls to collect more premium and to move your breakeven even Further even though the naked short Call contains risk you're still in a good position with break even price.\n\n  \nNow what are the risks:\n\nWhen you trade Futures, 2 things need to be considered. \n\n1 is Margin when trading options and holding futures, since Futures are based on SPAN margin, that means it's based on a risk the more volatility in the market the more Margin requirement it will take to hold a position\n\n2. Daily settlements: Futures are Marked to Market daily, meaning that everyday  there will be a settlement and considering that /ES or /MES moves 50-80 or even 200 points a day and 1$ for /ES is equal 50$ that means you could loose significant money on settlements.\n\n  \nNow back to strategy:\n\nSince there are 2 short calls that's a risk to get tested and once it starts going in the money your margin will start drawing significantly, one possible solution is to build 1  debit spread further expiring further preferably with long strike the same as the short strike of a previous expiration that way you will lock the margin draw.\n\n  \nNow the strategy is not perfect, but that was my vision of how to give a solution for above mentioned situation, please don't trade it before you test it.
