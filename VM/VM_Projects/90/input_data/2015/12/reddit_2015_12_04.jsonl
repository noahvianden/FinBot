I believe the debt curve is overly lopsided towards the non-graduated (5 years or more since the initial debt was assumed).  Combine that with non-functional degrees (degrees whose holders are afforded no significant economic advantage) and you've got the core of the debt that will be defaulted upon.\n\nBeyond that, the thing to watch will be salary inflation.  Right now, wages are overly sticky due to the GFC.  When the boomers retire en mass, the millennials are going to factor in their student loan costs, that house they've put off and a new car into their salary requirements and that's going to cause a significant amount of inflation... maybe not in the next 5 to 10 years, but surely after that.\n\nFinally, there's the issue of debt sustainability (that will factor into the equation as interest rates rise).  With the current sticky wage situation, extended graduate unemployment and an interest rate increase, student loan holders could easily see their obligations outstrip any 15% garnishment plus income tax withholding refund (largely non-existent) forced payment mechanism, resulting in indefinite debt servitude.\n\nAnyway... all the debt default losses will be socialized, so the arbitrage opportunities are limited.
