My July calls are up 125%! Let's keep it up!\n\nThe next opportunity, albeit not your typical short squeeze, gamma squeeze, or any other squeeze of the sort. It is actually a pretty straightforward bet.\n\nAllow me to Introduce **Uranium..**   ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️  ☢️\n\nAh, sure, you guys can probably dismiss it but here me out. There are 3 big ETFs in the sector. URA, HURA, and URNM. URNM has been outperforming its rival by adding smaller and more speculative names. On stocks that get added to the index, we usually talk about small float and market caps that are sub 100m when added. There is an indiscriminate buy of the underlying equity for the next 3 weeks after the index rebalancing.\n\nIn March, I had done that research and got lucky on a couple of names added to the index. I circled in Red the period at which the index bough, and you can see the surge in volume. The great thing is that this ETF keeps growing in size because of the renewed interest in Uranium. That means that they need to keep buying shares at whatever price the asking price is every month to keep the relative position in % in the ETF. The below stock is Western Uranium and Vanadium. They also have strong fundamentals and are a perfect M&A target for their next-door neighbor Energy Fuels. The current Ceo of Western owns 15% of the shares, and the share structure is super tight. They are currently only in the URNM ETF, and I think they have a good chance at getting into URA, the biggest ETF in the uranium sector. I obviously own a lot of shares, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\n[Western Uranium & Vanadium](https://preview.redd.it/owr8e1nfqa471.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=13053cecc2e1c29fecb86022fe4b4db31a56a285)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should ask yourself which other stock could be picked up by URA in the July rebalancing. That, in my opinion, is simple. You can check which stocks are owned by their rival URNM and HURA. There is only a handful of names that are not in the URA ETF. These names are:\n\nLaramide resources\n\nAzzarga Uranium\n\nMega Uranium\n\nVimy resources\n\nToro Energy\n\nForsys metals\n\nIf you are willing to wait a bit more, the URNM rebalancing happens in September. Currently, the best 2 performing stocks in Uranium this year are **Alligator Energy and Elevate Uranium**. They will most probably get included in the ETF as well. They could also make it in the URA rebalancing in July, but I see this as less likely. Another name that is on the cusp and could well make it into the ETF is Anfield Energy.\n\nAnother short-term catalyst is the transaction of Sprott acquiring the Uranium participation corp. For those of you who have been sleeping under a rock, Sprott has been able to grow its Gold and Silver ETF assets under management significantly. They intend to do the same with the Uranium participation corp, which buys and holds physical uranium. It used to be that when the fund's net asset value was +20%, they would issue more shares and buy more uranium. Sprott, however, will have an NYSE listing instead of a Canadian listing and will be an active buyer every month on the Spot market. The current spot for Uranium is at 32$, and we will need to seed 40$ to 45$ to see the party begin. Many in the space believe this will happen due to this move from Sprott on top of the foreseen shortage from all the supply destruction since Fukushima.\n\nAt this point, you should already have understood that you can front run institution and that this in itself is a great arbitrage-like situation. See the rise in URNM ETF. Quite interesting for a boring bet based on supply and demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[URNM ETF](https://preview.redd.it/gut63asnqa471.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=407bc70ae5d28c4d09b485f8a94ce7e979bcd2c8)\n\nThe current Market Cap of the total Uranium space is roughly 30billion in Market Cap. During the 2004-2009 bull market, the total market cap achieved for the total Uranium was 150 billion meaning an easy 5x from here in total. The granddaddy of performance was Paladin back then which started as a junior and became a big producer. The stock went from 0.03$ to 9.53$ in 4 years. Paladin is still a solid pick as they will be one of the first producers. Still, if you are looking at a story like Paladin today, I think a couple of names have the management and experience to bring an explorer to a producer within the next 4 to 5 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Paladin from 2004-2007](https://preview.redd.it/kms8r9arqa471.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=39c110601cef38b87e1b2d6791b11218afcc0575)\n\nTo reproduce this, you need to be in a jurisdiction that permits fast, or you have to have all the permits already. You need great management. You need a deposit. It helps if you also have short-term catalysts such as the ETFs or the potential to acquire a bigger player. Based on this, I think only a couple of names can be considered.\n\n**Alligator energy**: In South Australia, strong management created billions in shareholder value in the last bull market. Deposit and strong jurisdiction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lt2kbznvqa471.png?width=1561&format=png&auto=webp&s=908c04ad62d33c7a225cbfdb9284cca1171eb41c\n\n**Elevate uranium** located in Namibia. Far from a producer, they have great resources; they are next to mills, which means they would not need to build one; they are in the best jurisdiction in the world. Management is not as strong as Alligator but higher share structure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4q6gj38yqa471.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbd46de10341237dcdaf5687f4f9ce31e6c48187\n\n**Western uranium** can come into production quite fast but need to strike a deal to mill the ore with Energy fuels. The shares outstanding are so small, making it susceptible to massive moves every time there is a buyer in the market with decent volume.\n\n**Azzaraga** has a great deposit, can start production fast, and needs low CAPEX to get there. They have a good management team. Either Encore Energy or Ur-Energy can easily buy them.\n\n**Laramide resource**: Management is top-notch. Great diversified assets. They can come into production or be sold. The CEO has been with the company forever and holds 10% of the shares.\n\nIf you need more resources to double down on, I suggest John Quakes on Twitter, Uranium insider is also another great name to follow.\n\nI also suggest this great podcast discussion if you want to get up to speed as to why the uranium sector will more than 5x in the next 2-3 years.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9tDyYKUhuw&t=6337s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9tDyYKUhuw&t=6337s)\n\nCheers,\n\nMax", "id": "nw51ax", "created_utc": 1623269256.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "I long DNN & UUUU.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Ditto to the max.
