During his tenure, the company opened its first plant overseas in Shanghai, expanded its battery cell supply partnerships and started mass-producing the Model Y. But Tesla also struggled with quality issues, recalls and parts shortages under Guillen that significantly constrained production — the company produced zero Model S and X vehicles in the first quarter of the year before he was moved out of the role.\n\nTesla moved him into the role of president of heavy trucking in March this year, and in June Guillen left the company. The exact circumstances of his departure have not been disclosed.\n\nAccording to Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore, the filings indicate that Guillen exercised options for 451,118 shares of Tesla and likely sold the underlying shares for gross proceeds of $274.1 million.\n\nAfter that, Guillen had 75,780 exercisable options left, Silverman estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla has not announced the appointment of a new head of heavy trucking.\nDuring an April 2021 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk mentioned that Tesla was \"continuing development work on the Semi,\" indicating the company isn't close to mass-manufacturing its debut, heavy-duty vehicle for which Guillen was made responsible. Tesla first revealed the Class-8 Tesla Semi in November 2017. \nOn the same first-quarter earnings call, Musk talked about delays in manufacturing the company's new large battery cell, the 4680, which Tesla designed and aimed to manufacture on its own, in part to power its larger vehicles, the Semi and forthcoming Cybertruck.\nMusk said in April, \"We've made quite a few cells. We're not quite yet at the point where we think the cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we're getting close to that.\" He said Tesla was still \"quite optimistic about achieving volume production of the 4680 next year.\"", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yep he dumped soon as he left.
