{"title": "$WKHS Really Overvalued", "selftext": " Workhorse is a commercial transportation vehicle company that's focuses on sustainable and cost-effective solutions. Their current product line up includes the c-series trucks. Which are essentially electric postal delivery style trucks. They also have a drone business called horsefly, which they claim can help with delivering packages. Finally they also have Metron, an app that can keep track of their trucks and monitor them to help with inefficiencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Product Lineup](https://preview.redd.it/mq0vm13xfo471.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed883919f468ff5014bceee5e6405f8fa6b818d6)\n\nIf we take a look at valuation, at $15 we are sitting around $1.85 billion.\n\n[WKHS Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/3j76xe2tfo471.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fdf821b66ef9b98b018eb804df1c73df9c076f5)\n\nAs you can see on the chart, they reached a high $43 a share back in early February. However, after failing to gain the USPS contract they fell all the way to $7.25. They became heavily shorted, and are now back on the rise for that reason.\n\nIf we look at their financial position, we easily see they are overvalued.\n\nThey have barely started to regrow sales, but they are still minuscule. They are valued about 1000x their ARR (Annual Rolling Rate) if we take the $500,000 they made in Q1. This is absurd. They have been in business for years and still can't sell their products.\n\n[Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/j1clghhufo471.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=f807cfa2aab39c1a7a9cd3dcd5a0a8d7da0ddec2)\n\nThe competition in the space is only increasing. Rivian, Lion Electric, Proterra, and Arrival are all joining the fray, except they already have partnerships with delivery giants. Arrival has a [deal](https://www.fleetowner.com/news/article/21121715/ups-takes-stake-in-evmaker-arrival-will-buy-at-least-10000-electric-delivery-vans) with UPS. [Rivian](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specs) and [Lion Electric](https://www.electrive.com/2021/01/11/huge-order-for-lion-electric-trucks-from-amazon/) both have partnerships with Amazon. And all of them seemingly have a better growth ahead, even accounting for the higher valuations compared to Workhorse.\n\nWorkhorse has never made a profit. The only time they had positive earnings is when their invest in Lordstown Motors blew up. Now RIDE is on the down tread. Their balance sheet is relatively healthy, and potentially a turn around could be possible, but unlikely. Back in October they sold 200 million in convertible notes, which are due 2024. They also have various other liabilities that total $204 million, including long-term. They have about $205 million in cash $200 million in Lordstown Motors. This is most of their liquid securities.\n\nOf course they could last a while with that much money right?\n\nMaybe. But things are still not good. In Q1 they lost $5.7 million in just cost of sales alone. This isn't even operating costs. For every dollar of sales, it cost them twelve dollars just to build. Of course this could be improved if they scaled up production, but they aren't receiving nearly enough sales to make a dent. The cashflows aren't looking good. They lost about $36 million in Q1 alone. That could mean they burn through $144 million in cash for 2021. They also have their drone project which continues to burn money as well, even with no potential near term.\n\nThere was hope a few months ago. They could've won USPS, but probably due to their limited manufacturing capabilities, they didn't get and lost it to Oshkosh Corp. This was surprising to some. They seemed like the perfect fit for the new electric government vehicles. Lots of protest rose up over it from some government officials and Workhorse. However nothing has come out of it. I don't see a future where Workhorse gets the contract, unless the House can pass a bill forcing the USPS to go electric, but even then Oshkosh still might keep the contract. Even Cathy Woods sold her stake in Workhorse a few months ago.\n\nPositions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My positions](https://preview.redd.it/w42xo4pffo471.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=e08dfde646166abf16d397b84da6a5450529b343)\n\nMight add more too if I see a good opportunity.\n\n*Not Financial Advise.*", "id": "nxmcq4", "created_utc": 1623434930.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "Nothing is final yet but supposedly the infrastructure bill has 10 billion for ev funding specifically for the usps.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "They are trying to get that passed, but like you said nothing is final.

{"title": "Canoo ($GOEV), their Recent Big News, Upcoming Catalysts, and Short Interest", "selftext": "**Recent Movement**\n\nIt's no question that Canoo has been beaten down the last few months. It's down over 50% from it's pre-merger highs and dipped well below it's former NAV of $10. The big question is : why?\n\nThe news of their cancelled deal with Hyundai during their first earnings call is what caused the most recent downward move, but was it really negative news? Why have your engineers work for another car company, helping them develop a car and giving them your valuable IP? It makes more sense to focus on your own products, which will lead to much more revenue over the years. \n\nTheir original CEO, Ulrich Kranz, leaving was also a contributor to this movement. But again, the move makes sense. Ulrich is an iconic engineer and designer. That's where his focus should be. Having him step down and putting a business oriented CEO (Tony Aquila) is the right move. Not every engineer is Elon Musk. Kranz decided not to retain an engineering position with Canoo, leading me to...\n\n **Apple Hires Ulrich Kranz for It's Rebooted Car Project** [see here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous)\n\nLots of speculations can be made here. If Ulrich had left on bad terms, most speculation would be bad.\n\nHowever, both publicly stated the departure was made on GOOD terms. \n\nAs you know, Apple tried to acquire Canoo in early 2020, which means their technology is the real deal. What do I think they're targeting? Canoo's **Skateboard Platform**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vrul6ibmo471.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6448dc4281f18423835ddb8ac2d068b03e7f9c3\n\nIf Apple had this, it would speed up their creation of the Apple car since they would only have to design the piece that goes on top. And since Apple couldn't buy Canoo, how could they get their hand on this?    Hire Ulrich and have him make one? : No, Canoo has their technology (a.k.a Ulrich's own tech) patented. \n\nI speculate a deal is in the works where Canoo licenses out their skateboard platform to Apple to build a car on in exchange for some royalty they receive for each sale. And hiring Ulrich Kranz helps them because he knows how to build a car on the platform because **HE MADE IT.**\n\nOf course this is highly speculative, but I believe it's the simplest explanation.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts:**\n\n1. **Investor Day**\n\nCanoo is holding their Investor Day next week on the 17th in Texas where they are actually letting investors attend and see their vehicles. They currently have 3 that we know of : the delivery van, pickup truck, and lifestyle vehicle(a.k.a minivan or BANGBUS). They have teased a sedan model in the past, and it's speculated they will unveil it at this event.\n\n2. **Manufacturing Announcement**\n\nCanoo's CEO said that their contract manufacturer would be announced in Q3, likely during the Q2 earnings call. This is the only thing holding them back right now. Their product is much further developed compared to the other former SPAC EV's, with 3 models that have drive-able prototypes. They may provide an update to us during Investor day.\n\n**Long and Behold: The Short Interest**\n\nOrtex is showing a current short interest rate of 30% of the share float, up 300% from their 10% short interest rate in January. They are betting against Canoo, and there are a few upcoming catalyst that could drastically change the market sentiment and blow them up.\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis post contains highly speculative predictions, and I encourage you to read up on Canoo and do your own research.
