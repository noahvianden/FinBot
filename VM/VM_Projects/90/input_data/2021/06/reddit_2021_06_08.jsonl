{"title": "This Is Why the Plaid+ Was Cancelled - SPECULATION", "selftext": "The Plaid was originally intended to be a 2170 battery based car (the same battery that is in the Model 3/Y vs the 18650 battery currently in the previous - and older - Model S/X platforms). Since the announcement of the Plaid and Plaid+, the 4680 battery production has ramped up and achieved viability ahead of schedule. As a result, the Plaid will feature BOTH the 4680 battery and a structural battery pack - and we could see higher range than originally anticipated. As a result of the 4680 making it into the Plaid, the Plaid+ was cancelled.\n\nHere are the little bits of evidence pointing towards the early deployment of the 4680:\n\n* The Model S Plaid (4766lbs) weighs less than the older 18650 based Model S (4941lbs) for the performance model. 4680 structural battery means less dead weight from casings and the battery serving dual purpose for structural rigidity (as well as being batteries).\n* The newer Model S costs less than the older Model S to build, per Q1 conference call comments by Elon Musk - DESPITE featuring an additional motor, additional rear screen and next-gen console performance level GPUs. Structural battery pack, megacastings and the 4680 battery especially key to being able to push down production costs - enough to overcome the additional goodies that come with the Plaid S? maybe.\n* Tesla has accelerated battery production permitting and production equipment ordering and installation. At the same time, no 4680 batteries have been shipped to Berlin that we know of. The pilot production line at Kato road has been producing batteries for months now, and Tesla has stated its production capacity is \\~5GWh. If Tesla isn't shipping these batteries to Berlin, what are they using them for? 5GWh is enough to supply up to 50,000 units per year of the Plaid assuming 100kWh battery packs going into the Plaid.\n\nThis is all my personal speculation - I'll look real dumb on Thursday when Elon says there's nothing special about the Plaid's battery pack.
