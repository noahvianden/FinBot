Analysts believe they will continue to grow revenue by 20-25% per year over the next several years.\n\nLooking out 5 years to 2026 if we assume conservatively: \n\n-19% annual revenue growth from 2021 projected $3.2 billion \n\n-15% net income margin in 2026\n\n-We get $7.64 billion in revenue and $1.146 billion non gaap net income.

Wish local allows brick and mortar retail shops to store wish inventory for very low cost, unlike expensive Amazon fulfillment center real estate. The retail store gets the benefit of potential new customers walking in their door to pick up wish packages, they have the option to deliver the package for wish (for compensation), and they get to upload their own inventory to wish‚Äôs platform to reach a global customer base. This also helps wish reduce shipping times. It‚Äôs a win win. There were over 55,000 wish local partners as of Q1. \n\nWish is focusing on getting more expensive (branded) products on the platform because they note it‚Äôs more profitable to sell higher priced goods, or at least multiple cheap goods in one delivery. They‚Äôre focusing marketing strategy on retaining high Life Time Value customers, as opposed to people that buy once and never return. \n\nTheir logistics revenue grew 300% in 2020 to over $500 million. This logistics segment alone is worth far more than the current market cap. Logistics margins aren‚Äôt as profitable as market place or product boost (advertising revenue), but their logistics margins are improving and will be a profit center In a couple more quarters. \n\nPlease read the Q4 2020, Q1 2021 shareholder letters. \n\nNot financial advice.

People will want to take a smaller loan out, and use more cash, because inflation creates spending and high interest rates deter people from collecting debt. Housing prices are in a bubble right now due to low rates. That bubble will pop when rates rise. Rates will rise, inflation will rise, cash spending will rise, debt will lower, houses will sell cheaper. REITs will continue to yield great earnings and totally recover; big tendies.   \n\n\n\n\nMITT- [Pre-Covid=$16 Now=$4.4 (5.85% Short)](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/summary?fromPage=overview&display=&fromSearch=true&symbol=MITT)   \nIVR- [Pre-Covid= $18, Now=$4 (short 11.8%)](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/summary?fromPage=overview&display=&fromSearch=true&symbol=IVR)\n\n  \n\n\n\"I don‚Äôt follow that logic, I think higher rates with inflation will cause a net no change to house prices\"\n\n -You don't think higher rates affect housing cost? \n\n \"Yes, higher rates usually drop home prices but wouldn‚Äôt inflation pick it back up?\" \n\n-Inflation isn't considered *in the moment* the way rates are. Inflation takes 3months to two years for change to occur. When you get a quote for an interest rate, at max it'll last 3 months before you gotta pull a trigger\n\n-As inflation rises, people will have more cash to spend, which leads to more cash up front for down payment. Usually, a higher down payment = negotiation of lower house price.  \n-So, people will have both, more cash for down payment and a higher interest on a loan = perfect leverage for a lower price, this means a higher execution of sales... \n\n \"Wouldn‚Äôt that create higher demand?\" \n\n-Demand is high right now, highest it has ever been. But, that doesn't lead to execution if the buyer isn't comfortable with the price. A lot of deals that have gone on this year failed to execute. This is usually because a homeowner sends in the inspector and lists some things to knock price down (which is typical) and the homeowner doesn't budge because they were only ever interested in selling for the ridiculously high prices other homes are selling for. House doesn't sell and homeowner ends up waiting for a better time in the market than in the middle of winter (when rates were lowest and demand was still growing)\n\n-Lower rates create higher demand. Demand is super high right now, another reason prices are ballooned too much. Demand cant get higher than where it is, so I believe it will go down when people get rates twice what they were 3 months prior. \n\n-My point being, the price will come down when it gets to brass and taxes. Houses will sell and people will be there to buy. REITs will still pull hefty profits and will recover.  \n\n\nTL;DR- Mortgage services and the real estate market over all has been unaffected. They still have great earnings and fundamentals will bring the cyclical investing back towards them. They will go up. I made this post a few months ago and have been heavy on all of these.

Typically you DON'T want dividend stocks to increase price too much all at once, because then it hurts the rate of return. Before all this, IVR was bouncing between like $3.76 and $3.99, and had paid a quarterly dividend of $0.09. That's roughly a 9.5% annual rate of return. Then it actually dropped to like $3.40 so the rate of return was going to get even better if it stayed around that amount and the dividend stayed roughly the same.\n\nIf the stock price all of a sudden jumps to like $7 (which is what I see a lot of people calling for) the div isn't going to magically sky rocket with it. If it stays around $0.10 then the rate of return has just fallen to 5.1% annually by blowing up the price.\n\nYeah, the principal investment will have gone up, but that only helps if your entry point was low enough, and only if you actually sell (which defeats the purpose of the dividend).\n\nSo, I dunno, I'd be careful with this one. This isn't like GME or AMC or whatever where all \"long\" stock holders want to see it go up. I think many long term holders would prefer to see it stay where it was, to keep loading up on it at a low price and maintain a high rate of return - so there will be resistance not only from \"shorts\" but also people who do like the stock but don't want to see it go up too quickly.

I've been invested in UWMC since march on a person note, because I felt it offered a much more compelling value, and I'll explain why by giving Rocket's bear case. \n\nRKT's revenues and net income  is pretty much completely bread and butter mortgage refinance. Rocket Auto comprises a negligible revenue mix, and portion of net income. As does Rocket Homes. Sure, it'll ramp up, but there's a ongoing concern about their ability to make up or the refinance activity they will be losing.\n\nRefinance is papering over a lot of warts, and will continue to do so in 2021. Even so, their both having to compress their margins, and simultaneously doing less volume. Their broker channel, which was the channel they were growing in (not their retail channel) is going to shrink and has shrunk and the margins for them in that area have been reduced to 100 BPS or 1 percent for Q2 2021. UWMC has effectively conducted a box out of their business in this channel with their ultimatum, and because their cost to originate is a measly 50BPS. Yes, you heard that right, UWMC's cost to originate is a measly .50 percent. The lowest of any mortgage originator. And their price matching any loan offer from 14 competitors. So, instead of just buying companies at a premium, their cutting their profit to acquire the equivalent in market share.\n\nTo add on, purchases will rise over the next 5 years, but refinance's have been pulled forward and will be negligible in the coming years (regress significantly). As rates rise, wholesale will continue to eat into the mortgage origination market share, as its cost to originate is significantly less than retail due to less fixed cost and the ability to shop around as opposed to having captive customers. \n\nStickiness, or cross selling is 91%, but if people aren't coming through the door you won't be able to cross-sell them on rocket auto, etcetera. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's balance sheet is strong (Like UWMC), and it will continue to make money, but it's forward p/e in 2023 is going to be an ongoing concern.

Regardless of interest rates. We all know rates are going to go up just like they did in 2018 and 19 in which I was originating loan still was making money just like RKT. Yes was 2020 an amazing year for refinancing? Absolutely. However that doesn‚Äôt take away from how much money they will continue to make as well as how much money their revenue streams will create. Your bear case is that you believe the company will fail so hard that essentially the risks they are taking are going to lead to bankruptcy.

Purchases alone isn't raising home prices, it's because there's an 3.8M home under supply that will take years to fill.

That's the thing. Wholesalers have lower margin due to less fixed cost. Wholesale, as a rule of thumb, can give around 15 basis points less than retail. When interest rates rise, more people go to wholesale, it's a fact.\n\nMy bear case is not that they will go bankrupt, it's that they revert to their 2018 numbers or a little lower, where net income was much much MUCH lower. EPS for this year is expected to be 2.11 according to analysts, which makes sense. And this is supposed to be the 2nd best year of their history. Markets are forward looking, and so i don't see anything to like in their future EPS.\n\nFinally, if people move in 5-7 years, their not refinancing their purchasing. If the interest rates are much higher than now, they'll go to a wholesale lender not RKT to try to save thousands of dollars on their mortgage payments.\n\nFinally UWMC's time to close 14 days, which is less than half RKT's, and three to four times better than a retail brokerage.
