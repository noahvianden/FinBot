{"title": "EGLX - leading eSports company is way over shorted", "selftext": "First, let me be clear. I am NOT a GME and AMC ape. To be honest, I hate that crowd and the way they approach investing. I am not an ambulance chaser jumping on struggling companies in hopes that some dumb reddit trend will make me a quick 10%.\n\nBut that does not change the facts about what is going on right now. Enthusiast Gaming, the leading eSports organization in North America (*as measured social reach, web traffic and revenue*) is being shorted to death.\n\nAfter an epic, fundamentals driven rally from $1 to $8.80, the stock has been beaten down to $6.50.\n\nIt's very important to note that **the rally was not a senseless meme pump**. The company's **revenue grew from $15m per year to $127m**. They also announced a litany of high profile fortune 500 and government clients that hired them. The company is not fluff.\n\nIf the company is doing okay, then how come it's down so much? Well the catalyst that kicked off the downtrend was their announcement of share sales. As a newly registered Nasdaq company, they had to file forms with the SEC that would allow them to sell shares over the next 25 months. That process took a few weeks to complete before they could close a deal.\n\nDuring that time, the shorts have had their way with EGLX. You can see a detailed chart of shorting activity over the past several weeks here:  [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX)\n\nThe company has a tiny little market cap and the stock volume has been relatively low. A small number of short sellers have been able to exercise extreme market power over this company.\n\nBut now they have overstayed their welcome. They have raised the capital and the financials are sound. The company's actual business is doing great and the industry will continue booming.\n\nEvery single morning since the deal closed, EGLX has tried pumping back up, and then it settles down. But the stock selling pressure is not coming from long term holders giving up their positions. It is coming from short sellers trying to make a quick buck at the expense of a great Canadian company.\n\n# According to this source, short interest was 38% yesterday.\n\n[https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX)\n\nI am willing to bet the short interest will be even higher on Monday. The stock started popping off this morning and then fell precipitously again.\n\nBut how do I know this company isn't just dog doodoo and shareholders are dumping?\n\nLook at the cost to borrow: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx](https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx)\n\n# This shorting is costing the shorts 9%! Compare that to AMC's 1.16% and GME's 0.59% short borrowing cost.\n\nGet wrecked.\n\nThis high cost to borrow means a couple things:\n\n1. There is an extremely high number of short sellers compared to people who are willing to lend out their shares. That indicates its over shorted and holders are hodling.\n2. It also means this is costing them ALOT every day this stock doesn't go down further.\n\nNow, if this company was a steaming pile of trash that isn't making money, I would say the shorts will just kill EGLX and win the day. I do NOT advocate in investing in dying companies in hopes of some bogus short squeeze.\n\nBut EGLX will not die. It is genuinely a great long term opportunity, and the bears have gotten ahead of themselves on this one. This company is here to stay, for a number of obvious reasons.\n\n**Reason 1: Common sense:**\n\nThe eSports and gaming industry is growing and these guys have developed a real business out of it. They are doing business with: TikTok, Samsung, ATVI, EA, President Biden's Campaign, the US military, Ad Council, Disney, Bell, Nintendo etc etc. What's more, they are producing results for them. Take a scroll through the luminosity LGLoyal twitch page, and you can see that EGLX has been getting about a million views on every single video with the program they developed with TikTok. TikTok has already indicated they intend to continue to do business with EGLX.\n\n**Reason 2: They have cash:**\n\nThey just successfully raised another $44m in cash. Looking at their recent financials, I think that probably puts them around $60m cash in the bank right now. They are not going to run out of liquidity. They are not some business on the verge of bankruptcy, desperate for funding and debt.\n\n**Reason 3: They are NOT overpriced:**\n\nIn a market where most high volatility growth names like say Palantir, Zoom, BB, Score, Tesla, Dkng etc are all trading at like a 10-50X price to sales ratio, EGLX is sitting at a measly 6.5 price to sales. That is a tad high when you compare it to stable value stocks in the Berkshire portfolio, but honestly it's PEANUTS for a growth stock in a hot industry that just expanded their revenue ten fold.\n\n# This stock will rubber band back to $10 when these shorts give up.", "id": "o2v34l", "created_utc": 1624037087.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "I am a gamer, and I am a firm believer that esports are the future.

He regularly talks about how their entire value proposition is getting marketing access to the gen Zers who aren't on facebook, don't watch tv, don't watch sports, and don't read the news.\n\nRight now they are building a massive network of websites, streamers, channels, teams etc. They are literally in the top 100 us companies in terms of web traffic with this network.\n\nSource: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152515/0/en/Enthusiast-Gaming-Joins-the-Comscore-100-Ranking-of-Top-100-Internet-Properties-in-the-United-States.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152515/0/en/Enthusiast-Gaming-Joins-the-Comscore-100-Ranking-of-Top-100-Internet-Properties-in-the-United-States.html)\n\nThe greatest thing about this is that they have been hyper focused on acquiring web assets that live on \"organic growth\". That means they do not pay for traffic. They are not buying google or facebook ads to drive traffic to their channels. Instead, gamers and young people are going to their channels organically for free, and they are selling access to that traffic.\n\n(*As someone who works in digital marketing, I personally think they should start doing paid ad traffic to their sites and just make sure the spread on ad sales to ad expense remains positive. I think they will get there eventually, but for now they like focusing on organic web traffic growth*.)\n\nI can get behind all this \\^ as a stock market investor. But I am unsure if this model alone can drive them to be a real 10 bagger or 100 bagger in the long run.\n\nThe **single biggest flaw** in their business model is that their stuff is so spread out and it's not mainstream. As we all know, the internet is kind of winner take all. Everyone flocks to the top platforms exponentially. Unfortunately, all their fan sites like icy veins are all over the place and have a little microcosm of the internet. More concerningly, all their influencers are on twitch and youtube, which obviously they do not own.\n\nBUT!  Here is where the company becomes a big long term gamble for investors.\n\nThey are actually developing their own platforms, which I think they have big ambitions for:\n\n1. **Upcomer** \\- which is their eSports news source. I see them trying to turn this into the ESPN of eSports.\n2. **Project GG** \\- their unnamed social media platform that was announced a month ago. I foresee them announcing this being something that incorporates a lot of what discord and twitch are doing. They also obviously have intentions of syncing it up with in-game data (as per their purchase of tab stats) and create plugins that game devs will use to allow games to communicate with the social media platform (*potentially stat reporting, friends lists, and automated social media sharing for say achievements and instant replays etc.*)  I also speculate that they will wade into online betting based on recent comments from the CEO.\n\nNow here's how I see it, if Upcomer and Project GG don't come full fruition, EGLX will probably have a hard time becoming anything other than a fringe marketing agency.\n\nHowever, if Upcomer and Project GG end up taking off and catching on, I genuinely see this stock breaking $10B USD market cap.\n\nThe questions long term investors need to ask themselves are:\n\n1. Will they be able to make GOOD platforms?\n2. Even if the platforms are good, will they be able to drive traffic and sign up conversions to those platforms? (*This to me is a definite yes, because that's what they are already doing for all their other customers.*)\n3. Even with the right mix of both 1 and 2, will they be able to sustain the long stretch from a financial perspective? Will they need to dilute the stock too much or take on too much debt and never make it all happen?\n\nIt's a gamble, and I am personally very very long on the upside.\n\nBased on EGLX's client list and partnership with companies like Samsung (the CEO has commented about installing their channels on smart tvs), I see Upcomer having a moderate chance of success.\n\nBut based on their obnoxiously large social media reach and their army of top tier gaming streamers, I genuinely think Project GG has a real chance of getting the attention it needs to get some traction.

If you'd like to market your company towards those gamers, you might consider reaching out to Enthusiast gaming too.I believe Enthusiast is on their way.
