Even if 90% of people go back into cities, that's still a 10% reduction in commercial property. Given how worker can't afford to live in cities anyway, expect the push to work from home to be even larger.\n\nNow one place where most billionaires have stashed their wealth IS property. And given if you can get a global internet connection of 100mb anywhere on earth for as much as your average internet costs now, you're looking at a MASSIVE reduction of commercial realestate in the worlds cities, followed by all those cafes and other industries leaving cities because the people are not there anymore.\n\nPeople think the automation revolution is going to be the next big disrupter? I call bullshit. I'm calling the working from home revolution the biggest disruption in the global economy in the next decade.\n\nNow having studied the guy for a while, Elon definitely lacks social skills, emotional intelligence and can be detached from the reality of regular people. But on the other hand the guy is wicked smart business man and has the money AND knowledge to disrupt the mega rich.\n\nAs for Anonymous? Anyone can be fucking anonymous.
