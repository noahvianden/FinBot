{"title": "Advice request on AAPL call option", "selftext": "I've been playing around with small cash on options, to learn the game. Have lost some, made some small gains, nothing special.\n\nI'm now in a position I need advice on if I would be best in selling my call option, or waiting still more. I specifically own a few 140 call options for July 16 on AAPL. I'm up 150% on them but my gut tells me I would be best to wait till end of next week as I'm expecting the stock price to still continue to rise. I'm aware of time decay but can't really tell if it's too risky to leave it till end of next week.\n\nThoughts?", "id": "occmba", "created_utc": 1625240189.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "1. Time decay only applies to extrinsic value, but right now, you are OTM so extrinsic value is all you have, so...\n\nIf you expect it to go ITM next week by more than the 1.36 it is currently trading at, then you necessarily gain more than you would lose to decay. But that's only if that happens.\n\n2. Any time I have multiple options in a position and I am up more than 100%, I decide to take at least half off the table to make sure I pocket some profit.\n\nAfter that, if it goes straight up, then I make good money on the remaining options and I get over the fact that \"I could have made more if I hadn't sold those other ones!\"\n\nIf it goes down, then the worst case scenario is that I made a small win. But a win is a win!\n\nDepending on your risk tolerance, you could hold it all and take the chance that it won't turn back into a loser.\n\nBut what if there is general bad economic news next week and the general market starts to plummet? Or what if news comes out that there is an even bigger microchip problem than we thought? Or Apple has a big problem with their suppliers?\n\nWith a date of July 16, you don't have much time left so any news can make it turn around and it won't have much time to recover so the risk gets greater.\n\nThe way I see it, taking a small win (and 150% is hardly a small win) and missing out on a bigger win is always better than taking nothing and risking it turning against you because you waited too long.", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the explanation and advice!
