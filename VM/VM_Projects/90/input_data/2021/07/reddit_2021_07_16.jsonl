{"title": "For my GME Bull's! A closer look at Gamma Exposure", "selftext": " I agree that GME is getting close for  a rip. From a TA perspective, its trading in a high volume area. When I look at GME from a weekly time frame, Money Flow has been increasing over the last 4 weeks, this usually tells me its under accumulation. I saw this move in AMZN before it ripped. But as we all know, It is very difficult to time a move.\n\nSince Options dictate a lot of moves, I like to take look at how MM's are  positioned with GEX or known as Gamma Exposure. Gamma Exposure is really good if you like to sell options overall as it can provide information where Gamma Walls are at. Also can use it to know when to take profits. For example, on $DIS there is a Call Gamma Wall at 185. On Monday I took some profits on my calls since it is close to that PT.\n\nNow back to GME. We are currently in  neg gamma territory and under a put wall at 170. If we cant close above  this tomorrow, we could see 150 imo, the next high neg gamma area which I  believe should provide good support. But you can also see, a close over 200, Call Gamma Wall, can make it fly with little resistance above. The screen shot is Gamma Exposure for the next 10 days. \n\n[Gamma Exposure for next 10 days](https://preview.redd.it/j5x5c9f5ahb71.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f99563f07a83379b9b056f64d5df18e4e8c428)", "id": "ol6pti", "created_utc": 1626399235.0, "score": 577, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|17 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can't we go back to drawing triangles on the graph, I like triangles", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "Triangles are fun, but I also like candle shapes like cups and shoulders.
