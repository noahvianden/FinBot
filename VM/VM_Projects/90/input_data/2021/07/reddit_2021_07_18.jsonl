From that moment on, if you had an older car you would need to come in to get the new computer installed if you wanted FSD. Until now there was only one way to get FSD which was to buy it outright. Tesla offered the hardware upgrade for free to anyone buying FSD. Now however there are 2 ways to get FSD. Tesla still offers the free hardware upgrade to those who buy FSD outright, but they do not offer it to customers of the subscription service. Fittingly so, because the subscription has no financial commitment beyond one month of fees. Tesla could end up losing a lot of money putting HW3 computers into cars that rarely ever end up using FSD, or even worse, given the supply chain shortage they might end up using chips that could have gone into a new FSD equipped cars that now have to wait for completion.\n\nIt's unfortunate Tesla was unable to stay true to their word about all cars being FSD capable, but like i said this promise was broken the day HW3.0 came out. In my opinion Tesla has done as much as is fitting to keep customers in this situation happy. As nice as it would be if even owners of older cars could try FSD for $200, it's simply not a fitting thing for Tesla to offer. The $1500 upgrade is in my opinion an appropriate compromise. Maybe someone at a service centre can knock that price down for you if you post your argument to them. \n\nMy recommendation though is for everyone who plans to keep their car 4 more years to just buy FSD outright now while they still can. At the rate that Tesla is improving FSD now i bet the price will be $15k next year and $25k the year after that, if they offer outright sale at all anymore by then.

This scales back some of the uncertainty in the oil market that contributed to a bad week for oil last week. Or so I thought so\n\nInitial news of no deal made oil prices go high then go low, then go lower when no deal and no meeting were scheduled. Now they made a deal, which means more oil in the market. OK, I get it, more oil in the market means the oil price increase will cool down. But why oil price go down? \n\nI feel like it was catch-22 in that no OPEC deal meant people were scared of a price war and too much supply whereas an OPEC deal means less chance of that but more oil in the market. I mean, traders knew OPEC was gonna raise output, why the freakout? Demand is still growing, India and lots of other countries are still locked down, commuting to work and school will start back up again around September, and the OPEC deal locks this in till December 2021 till they meet again. \n\nIs it just me or is the oil market retarded? Many analysts still see upward price pressure throughout the remainder of the year. Goldman Sachs still believes in $80 oil. I feel like this is a real \"keep the faith\" moment for anyone holding oil stocks and that this past week shook out a lot of paper hands. But the question remains if the \"energy trade of 2021\" is losing steam or if this cool down is what the oil market needed to go higher.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: 7/19/2021 sold holdings in $COP and $CVX to realize profit, did not sell $XOM as I bough it low in 2020 and think it's a good idea to hold.
