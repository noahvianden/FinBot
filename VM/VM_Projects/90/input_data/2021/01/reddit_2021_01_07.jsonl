{"title": "Commodity Club - Nickel for your Pickel - $VALE", "selftext": "Alright boys - welcome to a new addition to the commodity club. We continue our narrative today with Nickel. $.05c about to make you so hard. \n\nQuick disclaimer - today's post will focus on $VALE. So much news to share about why this is about to go to $25-27 by March. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earnings** \\- [Link](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aqh0bpkatZYkciY7YA4lH8hq3BQ?e=GA4hvF)\n\nEarnings for Q3 were very solid. If you reference the above link, I've shared details into VALE's Q3 earnings. There's a few key takeaways: \n\n* Reference the Avg Prices tab and see what VALE got in Q3 for each commodity. For Q4, there's a few big winners we should expect: \n   * Iron Ore - up 30% in Q4. This is VALE's largest commodity and likely priced into earnings. It is 80% of their revenue. \n   * Met Coal - also up 30% in Q4. This is another huge line item for VALE and was a loss in Q4. At current prices, this will be an easy winner, but only 1% of their revenue. \n   * Copper - up about 20% in Q4. This is 5% of their revenue and drive about $500m in profits in Q4. \n   * Nickel - up about 15% in Q4. This is about 10% of their revenue. \n* VALE made $2.9b in Q3. That's about $.59/share. They have a 3.9% dividend to go along with this. \n* Production was up over Q1 and Q2, but depressed since 2019. Some of this has been a result of declining ore quality and Covid. There was also a landslide that caused some production loss. \n\n**High-Level Research**: \n\nOkay - so core commodity prices are increasing. We also know that VALE sends about 60% of their product to China. So how does this translate? Here's where I explain why Q4 will be amazing, and how Nickel will be the catalyst for a massive earnings beat. \n\n* Iron Ore is super expensive, and we are seeing massive shipments being sent to China. China is so short on steel that they are buying scrap for the first time ever from Japan. Here's a series of articles/tweets to read: \n   * [Post 1](https://twitter.com/YuanTalks/status/1346356073309978624?s=19) \\- Iron Ore hitting record high prices, but shipments falling\n   * [Post 2](https://www.mysteel.net/article/5020695-0501/WEEKLY--Aust--Brazilian-iron-ore-shipment-over-Dec-28-Jan-3.html) \\- looking at shipping details, we see that VALE's shipments actually increased while iron from Australia fell. VALE shipped 6.5m tons of iron in the last week of the year - that's about $1b in revs in a week. \n   * [Post 3](https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-shipments-from-brazil-and-australia-set-record-high/) \\- even though shipments fell in the last week of December, shipments are at all time highs. VALE is literally sending mountains of iron to China at record prices. Yay! \n      * Also note that the Baltic Dry Index is nearing highs too. Shipping rates are expensive and will hurt margins slightly. \n\n**Projections**: \n\nOkay - so Iron is going to be a huge winner in Q4. Right now, here's the earnings projections for VALE: \n\n* Low - $.5/share (about $2.5b in profit) \n* Medium - $.8/share (about $4b in profit) \n* High - $1/share (about $5b in profit) \n\nAt Q3 output levels and current prices, we should expect to be near the high estimate of $1/share. Revs are expected at $12-13b, but should be much higher given current shipping details we've seen from VALE to China. At the worst, we have a Rev and Earnings beat. \n\nSo why Nickel? \n\n**Thesis**: \n\nIf you reference the Q3 Earnings Call - Nickel was the clear callout for VALE's earnings beat last quarter. You'll regularly see Nickel prices and sales being a major driver for increased earnings. \n\nHere's Nickel's [chart](https://tvc-invdn-com.akamaized.net/data/tvc_b0922c4db148b2c166ae2ff909d8183a.png): \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nickel Futures](https://preview.redd.it/y36ns5ublx961.png?width=1677&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d09c9901ac2abdb4914ae42fd17f097c4e069d2)\n\nNickel just broke out and is entering a massive bull market. Currently Nickel is trading at $18,000/ton, which is much higher than VALE's realized price of $15,000/ton in Q3. What's interesting is that Nickel is rising despite [rising stock piles](http://www.kitcometals.com/charts/lmewarehouse.html) in warehouses. \n\nHere's where we get a bit speculative - reference VALE's Nickel production here: [Link](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/quarterly-results/QuarterlyResultsDocs/PREREPORT3T20_i_vf.pdf)\n\nMining outputs are variable quarter to quarter due to weather, ore grades, demand, prices, etc - sometimes when bull markets or demand increases, miners turn on production that was previously on hold. We see that in Q3, VALE saw soaring demand for Nickel as it relates to sales, and this would be an indicator for a higher demand for Nickel. However, nickel output is actually down from 2019, when prices were at similar prices to today. \n\nWith nickel prices breaking out and appearing to be headed much higher, VALE might have offline nickel production that they'll turn back on to take advantage of higher demand and prices. Additionally, nickel prices are looking like they might go significantly higher into Q4, and have a much higher price target than say iron or coal. We've also seen VALE buy miners in Indonesia for additional Nickel production, which is aligned with this ongoing Nickel breakout. \n\n**Prediction**: \n\nVALE's nickel output will return to 2019 levels and take advantage of the current pricing. We could see an additional 20m tons produced, and a massive profit line item on Q4. Additionally, if VALE can lock in these prices for Q4 and continue to increase production and see rising prices, Nickel could become 15-20% of VALE's business and bring in over $1b in profit a quarter. \n\nBased on an expected earnings/rev beat and future outlook for VALE, I'm expecting the share price to jump to $25-27 in March based on current P/E and other metrics for the stock. \n\n**Positions**: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0r4768skox961.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3185bea658f163e58e1a38f8c66f6e1214d8b8", "id": "ksg8nr", "created_utc": 1610035492.0, "score": 155, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "$VALE and $MT are about to make me so much money that I'll go buy some rebar for no reason whatsoever", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "These two are also my portfolio, so I’ll upvote you to make us both feel good.", "score": 25, "replies": []}, {"body": "All the rebar you want", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "My grandma makes great rebar pie", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "i c vale, i upvote.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t even read the post at first.
