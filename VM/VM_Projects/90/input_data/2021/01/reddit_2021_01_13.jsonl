{"title": "The Demise of Netflix is inevitable and why", "selftext": "Hello fellow Autists, \n\nI am here not to talk about the Tesla bubble. But the Netflix bubble that no one is talking about and when popped, autists will be getting fucked to the equivalent of Asa Akira on an episode of Brazzers.  Netflix is a great company, good product but very soon will be outpaced and future earnings reports will begin to show investors how **growth is dying due to competition, life going back to normal from covid, the lack of ability to funnel customers to it's streaming services, and loss of quality content** that is equal to a shitty re-run of the Maury show where a guy finds that is his girlfriend is both his aunt and sister. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgio2xbcy0b61.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cd79dce1be8173671dcaac08329288d00f0d449\n\nNetflix who has been the background noise hook ups around the world is in a period where they can become the next blockbuster video in 7 years. Market share is being gobbled up by competitors such as Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Disney plus, Youtube, Apple TV, and direct tv on the go. \n\n**Growth dying to competition:** The biggest competitive threat to Netflix is probably Amazon. As of the fourth quarter of 2019, Amazon Prime Video had about 150 million subscribers—a number that's been growing at a fast pace over the past two years as the company has increased production of its original content. \n\nNetflix and Disney had an exclusive relationship, at least until the studio decided to jump into the streaming war. When Disney announced it was going to launch its own service, it ended the deal it had with Netflix. Netflix offered a number of titles from the studio but agreed to cut them all from its lineup in 2019. **Disney owns every Disney movie including every Marvel and Star wars movie that's pretty much every quality movie for fucks sake.** \n\nNetflix basic package for one person to stream only is $8.99. As of May 2020, package subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ cost $12.99 per month. Subscriptions to just Disney+ cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year. Which is way cheaper then a Brazzers subscription. \n\nThe big news for Hulu came in May 2019 with the announcement of a deal between Comcast and Disney which had Disney purchasing Comcast's stake in Hulu for a reported $5.8 billion. This puts Disney in full control of Hulu and consolidates the competition as Disney makes a big push into the streaming services field. \n\nNetflix investors should be equally worried about AT&T’s new streaming service that launches in 2020. It’ll cost slightly more than Netflix at $16–17 month.\n\nAT&T is best known as a cell phone company. But its purchase of WarnerMedia in 2018 turned it into a media powerhouse. It owns HBO, the most successful premium TV network ever. HBO continues to pump out all-time hits like *The Sopranos, Game of Thrones,* and *Sex in the City.*\n\n**The lack of ability to funnel customers to it's streaming services:** Do you know why the Amazon Echo dot was dirt cheap? Because Amazon wants every household in the United States and the world to have a fucking Alexa in their living room. From that every time you go to order something whether it be a fridge, butt plug, or sweater for your wife's boyfriend you're going to buy it from amazon now. this leads to Amazon prime Throw in the fact that google nest and apple homepod are a thing that are working towards this as well will lead to Netflix becoming a non S&P 500 stock and leave call holders in shambles.\n\nNetflix relies off other companies platforms whether it be Google's search engine to find their website, Ipads with their app, amazon fire stick....its only a matter of time before Netflix is overridden by competitors and left in the dust I believe. \n\n**Loss of Quality Content:** Netflix's two most watched shows are Friends the The Office which are both now off the streaming service. Family guy isn't on there. Other then Queens Gambit, and a couple other shows its pretty much shit selection and Broke Back mountain that I know you guys like to watch with your boyfriends. Netflix is going to shit and there are rarely blockbuster movies from theaters on there. You cannot tell me the content is getting better....it isn't and the competitors are growing and their content is more entertaining. I know boomer Amazon prime members who canceled Netflix for Amazon prime video. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Look how the stock is flat and has lost momentum while other FANG Stocks are fucking balls to the walls in Retard Strength Momentum](https://preview.redd.it/3de98ecab1b61.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca0cfad8d0924543f2eb6d81bc1164618dcaa57c)\n\nNetflix was revolutionary when it came out. It was the first in streaming and it is getting left in the dust as competitors fight to get their market share in streaming. Even the CEO has admitted the company is trouble. \n\nGoing forward it will succeed or fail on the popularity of the TV shows it produces.  \n\nOver the past year Netflix's debt has shot up 58% to $10.3 billion. For perspective, Netflix earned $1.2 billion in profits last year. \n\nNetflix’s market cap is about $165 billion—making it the 30th-biggest publicly traded US company. The PE ratio is around 80, meaning every $80 spent is for one dollar of profit.....but **everyday Amazon prime video members, Disney Plus members are cancelling their subscriptions as Netflix tries to raise their prices on their customers and the company is losing quality content every month. Company is overvalued and will struggle to grow.**\n\nNetflix will survive. But it will shrink. Even in the most generous scenario, within three years I can’t see it being worth more than $100 billion. That would put its stock price at about $225/share—or about 40% below its current price. \n\nNext earnings I am buying a FD Put. \n\nThe Netflix bubble is gonna pop. \n\nCannot go tits up. \n\nHere's some more readings and sources\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2019/07/08/netflixs-worst-nightmare-has-come-true/?sh=6a98fea1396d](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2019/07/08/netflixs-worst-nightmare-has-come-true/?sh=6a98fea1396d)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/051215/who-are-netflixs-main-competitors-nflx.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/051215/who-are-netflixs-main-competitors-nflx.asp)", "id": "kwa8ee", "created_utc": 1610516846.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "South Korean zombie flicks are pretty lit.", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Only train to Busan is good.

But a few points:\n\n1. A lot of your analysis seems based in the US? Netflix makes more money from international, and increasingly this is it's growth markets too. \n\n2. Market share is missleading, when the market grows as a whole. Yes Netflix is loosing market share, but when it's still growing strongly it matters less.\n\n3. Netflix relying on other platforms. Firstly this has been really successful, Netflix has seen growth spikes every time it makes a deal with a platform. Secondly, a lot of these platforms have moved out of the content game, only spending directly on sports (note this is a bit of a global trend, you can easily find some exceptions). What this means is that Netflix is not competing with the platforms that carry it. Instead Netflix may evolve into something like the first channel that everyone puts on their TV platform\n\n4. And talking of platforms... It's the new ones that should be concerning for the industry... I'm talking Roku, apple, Amazon channels.... While pay-tv wants to keep spending high, and want buy through for sports, these guys don't care, they just want the numbers... A la carte business models decrease overall spend and tend to be popular. \n\nFinally, I think that the old guys are undervalued. Disney as an example that you use has some great stuff... But more importantly, does more with it. Star wars is a great example... It makes a small amount of money at the cinema... And then Disney makes $$$ off toys, games and t-shirts...
