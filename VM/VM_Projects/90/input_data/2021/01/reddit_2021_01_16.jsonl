There are dozens of big players today with different makers dominating specfic segments or specific geographic markets. The 'EV' market is made up of many markets.

Below is my thinking on a few of the interesting entrants.\n\nTSLA; current market leader, battery day buildout plan and vertical integration are an increasing lead for future market position; geopolitically they‚Äôre walking a tightrope to maintain market access to China which poses a risk, particularly short term. Grade: A-\n\nVW; current market situation is improving quickly, more vertically integrated than most OEMs is a plus but the deficiency of tech talent and high levels of bureaucracy make the future market potential uncertain. Geopolitically they‚Äôre stuck in a weak domestic market with increasing competition and uncertain futures in China and the US, but we‚Äôll entrenched in Germany. Grade: C\n\nFord; Current market position is stable but heavily indebted and largely dependent on commercial vehicles, future market position is uncertain due to supplier dependence, heavy competition in commercial market (rivian, arrival, canoodled, etc) and debt level but the Ford family and management seems to be change oriented, geopolitically the US provides a strong domestic market and good access to global markets. Grade: D\n\nGM; Current market position stable but heavily indebted, future position tough due to supplier dependence, debt and bureaucracy, geopolitically isolated to the US due to past divestments. Grade: D+\n\nFCA-PSA/ stellantis; Current position precarious due to merger, future position unknown due to merger, geopolitical position may be advantageous due to leverage between US and French/Italian governments. Grade: D-\n\nNissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Alliance ; Current position poor due to friction between the Japanese and French management despite success in European EV market, future position precarious because of declining position of the leaf in the US market and high dependence on suppliers, geopolitically in trouble due to French government ownership and Japanese protectionism causing friction on issues from corporate strategy to labor. Grade: F+\n\nToyota; current position strong due to cash position despite declining position of Prius sub brand, future position uncertain due to committal to hydrogen, change resistant Toyoda family, and no current EV models but their cash position gives them options. Geopolitically well positioned due to outsourcing large volumes of production to the US. Grade: D-\n\nHonda, Subaru, Mazda, Suzuki; largely dependent other players due to cooperation with other companies. Honda w/ GM, Subaru and Mazda w/ Toyota, and Suzuki with Maruti in India.\n\nNIO and XPEV; current position strong due to stock increase and domestic market demand, future position weak due to Chinese political risk and demographic worries, geopolitically restricted to China. Grade: F\n\nLucid; current position weak due to late market arrival, future position uncertain due to price and competition, geopolitically risky because of dependence on Saudi money Grade: F\n\nRivian; current position uncertain due to pending market debut, future bright due to management, Amazon contract and backing, geopolitically likely limited to N. America due to market segment. Grade B\n\nArrival; current position promising due to UPS contract, future limited due to niche market, geopolitically stable due to likely British govt support and ability to locate micro factories according to geopolitical risk. Grade: C\n\nTata-JLR; current position precarious due to small market share, future uncertain due to needed restructuring, geopolitically advantageous position due to India exposure and possible UK govt support. Grade: D-\n\nConclusion: I don‚Äôt expect all of the above to survive, but I see them as possible survivors of EV market consolidation.
