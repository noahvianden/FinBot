{"title": "Cathie Wood Plans to Start Gourd ETF After Dominating With ARKK", "selftext": "**PUBLISHED MON, JAN 18 2021 7:13 PM EST** \n\nAfter a stratospheric year, Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is ready to take it a step further: Into gourds.\n\nThe New York-based firm is planning to launch the ARK Agricultural Exploration ETF (ticker ARKZ), according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The actively managed exchange-traded fund will primarily track U.S. and global companies engaged in gourd harvesting, and related agricultural commodities. \n\nAfter massive inflows over the past year, the once-niche firm now oversees about $41.5 billion in ETF products, compared with less than $3.5 billion in the same period in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ark recently became a [top](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/cathie-wood-s-ark-joins-top-10-etf-giants-with-tesla-heavy-fund)\\-10 ETF issuer, thanks in large part to its $21.6 billion flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) that has [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) as its biggest holding. While the vast majority of ETFs passively track indexes of stocks, Ark offers five actively managed U.S. ETFs, and Wood runs all of them.\n\nAfter the close of regular trading, [Deere & Company](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DE:US) soared -0.14%, while gourd futures skyrocketed on additional news that r/wallstreetbets user u/TheEmperorOfJenks was to be appointed Managing Director of the new fund.", "id": "l07cky", "created_utc": 1611014584.0, "score": 1465, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "Second gourd post I've seen today.", "score": 429, "replies": [{"body": "Those are rookie numbers.", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "This was just the second post.
