{"title": "Anyone concerned about any company doing buisness in China ever since Ma disappeared?", "selftext": "Seriously surprised only a few outlets have reporting about Ma's disappearance from the public over the last couple months. But this kinda tells you that one false comment in China can pretty much do quite a bit of damage.\n\nWhich leads me to the question does the risk outweigh the rewards of doing business in china\n\nFirst the positives\n\nChina will become the largest market by 2028 no doubt. It has the largest population in the world which is still relatively untapped by foreign markets and any company looking to grow seems to be adding china into their forcasts from companies like apple, Nike, Disney etc. They also have one of the largest growing middle classes in the world which gives even more incentive for companies to do business in china.\n\nNow the Downsides.\n\nThe Chinese government is no stranger to using its power and influence to get their way. We seen this for awhile but its become more public over the recent years. With Companies like nike, activision blizzard and disney giving very muted responses to some of the governments actions pertaining to Hong Kong. We have seen CEO's having to step down as well due to this as well (Cathay Pacific). With Jack Ma's supposed disappearance from the public eye it seems yet again that the government is flexing is muscles and influence to bring business under them control.\n\nThoughts\n\nPersonally I'm starting to get concerned about investing in business in China. I was a big fan of Alibaba for years mainly due to the leadership behind the company. But ever since China pulled the ANT IPO getting concerned that anyone who tries to do business in china or creates a start up in china will have to tread lightly on a tight rope. While the potential upsides are great the downside has been presenting more predominantly over the past few years.\n\nWhat do you all think?", "id": "kq9yjd", "created_utc": 1609771191.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "There's nothing to Xi here.", "score": 118, "replies": [{"body": "Lmaooo", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Took you till 2021 to realize China is problematic?", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "I treat Chinese companies as if they have aids.

Most games are now online, ready to be played with just a touch of a button. However, I think Ryan sees an opportunity even in these troubled times for this physical retail company. \n\nBefore we even start guessing what Ryan is gonna do, we need to know what he has done that made him a billionaire.\n\nNamely, Chewy. Chewy was successful because of three things.\n\n1. He was how fragmented the pet food industry was.\n2. He was able to build an understanding relationship with Chewy's customers\n3. Top-of-the-line customer service\n\nThere are more points obviously but I know you retards all have short attention span so I'm going to keep it as short as possible. So if you look at those three points you should already be making connections with the gaming industry.\n\n1. Gaming industry is as fragmented as it could be. (Amazon,walmart, Bestbuy, target, etc. or EA play, ubisoft plus, PSN plus, etc.)\n2. The stores mentioned above are not \"gaming-oriented\" stores.\n3. Gamer specific customer service is almost non-existent or it's not really a thing.\n\nI believe Ryan saw this opportunity because it closely resembles his first company model. I'm not 100% sure what he'd do going forward but the gaming industry is booming right now because of covid and with the new consoles coming out now. This is probably the best time to snatch on this opportunity and tap into unlimited potential of gaining millions of gamers in US. \n\nI'd be excited to see a gaming platform on either computer or on consoles that unites all games under a single platform with a monthly subscription that is unbeatable compared to other services. \n\nSure it'll take months if not years but if this is the way that GameStop is going, I'd feel pretty safe with my positions.", "id": "kqe1dw", "created_utc": 1609783423.0, "score": 192, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 146, "replies": [{"body": "Well said", "score": 18, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dog food, treats, and toys are physical items that cannot be downloaded in minutes from the comfort of your own home.
