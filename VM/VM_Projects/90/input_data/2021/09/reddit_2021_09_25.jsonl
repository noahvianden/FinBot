{"title": "A collection of 10-Bagger Index Plays for 1/2022", "selftext": "#10:1 Index Plays for the X-Mas Rally\n\nComing off of a similar correction this time last year lead us to a strong year-end rally. Tom Lee of Fundstrat sees this year being even bigger. These are 8 index positions that can be used to chase 10:1 returns.\n\n-XLY or XRT: Retail and consumer discretionary has been hanging out in a tight range since March '21. XLY is a better pick leaning into names that crushed last quarter and will likely do it again (TGT, WMT, MCD, LOW). XRT gets an honorable mention but it's more heavily weighted towards newer, growthier names like Etsy, Doordash, and CarMax, so I'm not as into it. That said, both will make great plays for the holiday season.\n\nRecommending XLY $205C 01/2022, costs $1.02 (XLY is currently $184.89), becomes a 10-bagger if XLY sees +16% by January (The period between September 25th and January 21st of last year yielded +20%, despite the market being shaky at the time). \n\nComparatively, the XRT $100C 01/2022 (costs 3.3 at the time of writing) would require a *40% gain in XRT* to achieve that same 10-bagger. At best, you could try the XRT $110's (1.05) but that would still require a +27% move - That IV is no bueno. \n\n-SMH or QQQ: Semi's are a no-brainer here. We're about to have a bounce-back to ATH- that's most always driven by semi's. QQQ works too if you're a basic vanilla hoe.\n\nRecommending SMH $305C/$325C 01/2022 (costs 2.12), max return ~10:1 if the SMH can rise +19% before January. \n\nOf course if you're riding the Q's you can grab QQQ $410C/$425C 01/2022 for 1.48, offering a 10:1 return if QQQ can rise +13.5% by the new year. \n\n-DIA or XLF: I'm not huge into banks so I would be more likely to grab the DIA here, but if you're a believer that inflation is going to be more than transitory, you want either of these value baskets in your portfolio. \n\nRecommending DIA $375C/$390C 01/2022, payout ~10:1 if we get +10% out of the DIA.\n\nIf you're more interested in banks specifically, you can grab the 01/2022 $40C for .94 and pray for a *31%* rally to $50 - which would be your (unlikely) 10-bagger. \n\n-IWM: #1 Component in the IWM is a dead movie theater company, so this makes a great put hedge in a long-biased portfolio. I don't think we're really correcting this year, but if we are, and SPY goes -10%, IWM is going waaay further. \n\nRecommending IWM $190P/$180P 01/2022. Costs $1.05, ~10:1 return if IWM drops -19%.\n\n-SPY: Last one and most obvious, but you HAVE to buy SPY OTM spreads on a dip like this. You'd literally be stupid not to. \n\nRecommending 480/490C 01/2022, payout ~10:1. That's a ten-bagger if we get 10% out of SPY over the next four months. \n\nThe idea here is to have a portfolio that is both concise and diverse, using options that have a reasonable OI, high rate of return, and a reasonable probability of happening. If you were only correct about 1/8 plays, you would still be profitable. \n\nTl;Dr:\n\n01/2022 Index plays for 10:1 returns in order of smallest to largest required price move:\n\nSPY $480C/$490C, +10%\n\nDIA $375C/$390C, +10%\n\nQQQ $410C/$425C, +13.5%\n\nXLY $205C, +16%\n\nSMH $305C/$325C, +19%\n\nIWM $190P/$180P, -19%\n\nXRT $110C +27%\n\nXLF $40C, +31%\n\nEDIT: NOW THAT THESE PROFITABLE, TAKE YOUR PROFIT PLS N TY <3", "id": "pvf5vm", "created_utc": 1632602633.0, "score": 265, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "This is fucking gold.
