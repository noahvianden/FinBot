So if I buy a put for 100$ then my max loss is 100$. Put options are a contract that gives you the right **but not obligation** to sell 100 of given stock at a given price. So if you don't want to you don't need to exercise it and just let it expire and all you lose is what you paid at the beginning. Usually people don't exercise them and just sell them to someone else before expiry.\n\nShorting is a different thing. When you short you borrow shares from someone and sell them. Then when the stock falls you buy them cheaper and give them back. However if the stock goes up you then need to buy them for more.\n\nI think the reason why you get a warning is because leveraged ETFs are very risky.
