{"title": "[Detailed Breakdown] Common TSLA FUD, Bull Misconceptions, and Proper Responses", "selftext": "# Overview\n\n(Making this a separate post per mod request).\n\nOn CNBC, I frequently see many well-intentioned Wall Street Analysts, as well as people on online discussions, respond to bearish arguments about Tesla. While their responses are moving along the right direction, I believe that they are not very convincing, have some misconceptions, and may provide fire for detractors. Furthermore, many people on the fence about these questions still harbor these worries. When facing bearish arguments, I think the best way to address them is that if someone has an open mind, provide them with more nuanced information that respects their worries about the company.\n\n# FUD 1 (Autonomy related): LIDAR and HD Maps provide more info than cameras alone.\n\n**Tesla Bull Misconception:** We don’t need LIDAR. Cameras alone is proven to work, and LIDAR is expensive. Also HD maps are like training wheels.\n\n**Why it’s a poor argument:** The problem with the Bull response here is that it doesn't address the belief that Lidar and HD maps could be safer. There could be a misconception that Cameras alone could be 99.99% safe, while Lidar and HD maps would make it 99.999% safe. Some people may incorrectly believe that Waymo, with both cameras and Lidar, is safer than a Tesla with only cameras. Also, this argument doesn't address that concern that HD maps can provide additional safety, and even without HD maps, Lidar could work without HD maps.\n\n**My Actual Take**: Lidar does not provide color / hue information and therefore is worse than cameras. It results in not being able to tell a paper bag from a dangerous obstacle. Furthermore, you can't just say you can fuse Lidar and camera color information. To project camera 2D images to the 3D lidar point cloud, you need an advanced image AI (like Tesla has). Then, if you developed the advanced image AI, you wouldn't want the Lidar sensor. Having Lidar then would actively **harm.**\n\n1. Lidar has extremely high energy burn.\n2. Lidar requires lots of maintenance because it is physically spinning fast and protrudes from the vehicle.\n3. Lidar is immensely expensive in the thousands per sensor.\n4. Lidar does not detect black cars because black absorbs lidar lasers.\n5. Lidar lasers are scattered by fog and rain.\n6. Lidar data can have interference from other Lidar vehicles from interfering lasers.\n7. Lidar point cloud data is immense because it is 3D input. This immense input layer slows down the neural network processing. You either pay the fee with immense latency and energy, or have a poor detection system. High latency with a network could mean death.\n8. Lidar necessitates HD maps because the Lidar cannot map the road lines to 3D location because it can’t see color.\n\n# FUD 2: CATL and other battery makers are selling their batteries to competition.\n\n**Tesla Bull Misconception**: Tesla makes their own batteries. Also, they make some profit from the batteries in Giga Nevada with their joint ownership with Panasonic.\n\n**Why it’s a misconception**: This bull response is weak because other than the batteries made in the joint partnership with Panasonic, they mostly buy their battery cells. Furthermore, in terms of the 4680 battery cells, Tesla hasn’t actually sold any vehicles with 4680 cells yet. Critics who see this misconception view this as a weak argument and proof that Tesla's have the same battery as other EVs.\n\n**My actual take**: Tesla does mostly buy the individual battery cells (today) from third party suppliers which anyone can get. However, Tesla has unique technologies at the pack level, and finally the structure of the vehicle, which cannot be replicated. The battery pack handles power charge, discharge, and thermal management. The system also ensures that if one cell is punctured, the rest of the pack will disconnect to reduce the chance of a battery fire. Finally, the structure of the vehicle makes it less likely for the battery pack to be damaged in the first place. Essentially, even with the same cells, Tesla can squeeze out far more range and power than competition. If you want to see what happens when you don’t innovate at the pack level, look no further than Chevy Bolt fires. And that's with Tesla's batteries today. Once they move onto the 4680 cells, and scale the production, the bull misconception starts to become reality.\n\n# Tesla FUD 3: Tesla’s cutting prices. This signals weak demand.\n\n**Bull misconception:** Tesla is just passing costs to consumers and there is no weak demand.\n\n**Why it’s a misconception**: Obviously, even if you are passing down some costs to consumers, it's illogical to think that Tesla would reduce prices out of the goodness of their heart. If Tesla can make more money per vehicle, they would raise prices. This is what the bears are hinting at.\n\n**My actual take:** There infact probably is weak demand at that higher price (obviously, otherwise they would charge more). However, what is important to note is that vehicle price cuts tend in exponential increases in demand, not linear. Therefore, a minor price cut can drastically increase the total units delivered, and guarantee that Tesla is always supply constrained. Furthermore, within a quarter or year, there can be pockets of weak demand. This is normal. People's desires aren't just a straight light. It moves based on people's income, network effects, etc. What’s critical is that on the long term, Tesla vehicles maintain relatively high prices and profit margins, which they historically do. The key thing to note here is that these price cuts have mostly been minimal, while the margin per vehicle has skyrocketed in recent quarters up to 28%. If the margin was decreasing, I'd agree with bears. However, this margin continues to rise dramatically.\n\n# FUD 4: Tesla exports their vehicles from China, showing weak demand.\n\n**Bull Response:** No weak demand, just fulfilling deliveries.\n\n**Actual Explanation:** Bulls mostly get it right here, although there's a deeper reason to what's goin on here. Partially, there could be a little bit of less demand factoring into China deliveries. This is because China does in fact have some decent competitors. However, Tesla would only need to do a few price cuts to rapidly increase sales. Now, given that China has no import tax unlike Europe and has less logistics cost, why on earth would Tesla deliver to Europe, which likely result in lower profit margin, when they can just reduce prices a little bit in China and deliver in China? The strategy Tesla is employing is \"developing demand\". Tesla increases demand through network effects, since when your neighbor has a Tesla and raves about it, then all your neighbors start to get one, you are likely to want one. Delivering to Europe at a lower profit margin can help to develop this demand organically. Furthermore, Tesla doesn't want to affect their reputation with European customers by making it seem like their vehicles take 1 year to deliver. Tesla penetrates the markets early on, which will hype the populace for the Berlin opening. Once Berlin opens up, Tesla can make small price cuts in Europe and China, and this would skyrocket demand. China and Berlin vehicles could then command immense profit margin despite the price cuts because they delivered locally without any tariffs.\n\n# FUD 5: Tesla is just a car company.\n\n**Bull misconception:** Tesla is not just a car company. It’s an energy, insurance, Robotaxi, and AI company.\n\n**Why it’s wrong (kind of):** Energy is still very low revenue, and even if revenue of energy matches their car business, it’s not clear (or likely to be high margin). Insurance is also just a peanut at the moment, and Robotaxi’s aren’t guaranteed (IMO). Tesla Bot is still too early as well. The problem with the bull argument is it makes it sound like Tesla is overvalued looking at cars alone, and Tesla Bulls are just praying for these things to evolve to fruition. These things aren't bad to look at, but it's not easy to model them until they have been profit and can provide been streams of revenue.\n\n**My actual take**: You don’t need energy, insurance, and robotaxi to justify the valuation. Even with all those at zero, **Tesla as only a car company is immensely profitable** because they command high margin (28% automotive margin) which is steadily increasing. Even without all those other revenue streams, if Tesla was purely a car company selling 10-20m cars / year at 30% margin with 35k ASP, the company would still be worth trillions on that alone. Even without robotaxis, the FSD subscription costing 100 dollars / month that actually worked with very high safety would be valued at trillions. Robotaxi, energy, insurance, and Tesla bot are just massive cherries on top, which just need more evidence before we can add them to the modeling. However, I do respect that Bulls mention these, because even they heavily improve the optics of the company. Even if we only ever had razor thin profits from Energy, Tesla poises itself as not just working for profit, but working to revitalize our energy grid. Furthermore, EVs will demand a great load on the grid, so without Energy, a full transition to EVs might not even be possible. Discussing Tesla Bot, Tesla Robotaxis, and Tesla insurance gets the general public very excited about a company who is trying to innovate on all fronts, and even if not every business stream ends up being profitable, Tesla will definitely make societal impacts that change these industries in a very consumer-friendly way.", "id": "pku6cr", "created_utc": 1631178487.0, "score": 164, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "FUD 1: This has mostly been debunked by Tesla’s ability to remove RADAR and their proof that they can still understand vector space.

Most importantly, every time you introduce a new input you introduce a another new set of challenges you have to deal with, there are no sensors without issues.\n\nFUD 2: Tesla’s current MPGe (Wh/mi) is much better then their current competition and they are targeting are planning to improve their position w/ 4680 and structural pack while reducing costs.  Co-locating and owning battery production alongside vehicle manufacturing is also a huge benefit.\n\nFUD 3:   Not actually a current concern as prices are increasing.

Hence if you start making an ML driver, and your competition does it too, and you both take 10 years to solve the problem - if you chose to use Lidar and your competition goes vision only, then your competition wins hands down because they have the cheaper system.

I understand the argument for building an energy \"ecosystem\", but at the end of the day, what does $10b capital buy in you in that industry? $500m revenue? It's honestly a drain on the rest of the company, which is why someone did an opportunity cost analysis and decided to neglect the energy segment for the past few years. That decision turned out to be a good thing IMO, but going forward I still don't see how they scale the energy segment \"economically\" (relative to the economics of other business units).\n\nThe insurance thing is an interesting and silent complementary addition to the company. The insurance industry is regulated to shit and it would probably provide a better return than the energy segment, but at the end of the day it is regulated. Prop 103 in California for example, wouldn't even allow double digit returns for an insurance company as it would deem it as a consumer abuse by the insurance company. The ARK financial model for insurance wasn't even remotely realistic for those reasons which many people ruthlessly pointed out over twitter.\n\nRobotaxi is a wait and see, I personally don't think it's coming within the next few years, but it's a situation where you treat it as a decision tree to come up with some \"expected value\". Robotaxis could very well have a TAM/nominal value in the trillions, but as soon as you start accounting for the probabilities of this and that, it comes down greatly. Same sort of valuation concept as reserves/resources in natural resource industries. Just because you have $10b in copper sitting in the ground, doesn't mean it's worth $10b after necessary capex and opex to extract it.\n\nAI is what it is, every business should \"employ\" AI and most do, but I have my doubts Tesla will commercialize their competitive advantage, which is the standpoint most companies take. It's an internal IP only policy and that's what separates one business from the next. For those reasons, I'm not so sure it should be treated as an individual business unit other than a cost centre. For all the management accountants out there, you know what we do when we have a cost centre, you allocate the overhead accordingly and it is absorbed by other operating business units.\n\nThe automobile segment does do extremely well, and it's hard to pinpoint where it will end up. On one hand, as you mention in the demand point, ASP will drop overtime to penetrate a larger consumer group, but on the other there is some sort of economies of scale gained in the process. Do I personally think it will hit 30% GM? No. Do I think Tesla could easily maintain 15-20% GM? Yes. At 20% GM, it allows a great deal of flexibility with ASP to match production to consumers. Personally, I think that's how it should probably be treated for valuation modelling purposes especially with such great uncertainty.

The clarifying point that I'd like to make here is that you can already justify Tesla in trillions alone based on car sales as well as FSD software (without robotaxi). The reason that's important is because to most investors value the company based on clear and probable paths to generating income. A lot of the additional aspects to Tesla that you are mentioning are definitely positives, but if you tried to justify Tesla on speculatives alone, your arguments would be less convincing. Basically, I like to frame it like:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"As a car company, Tesla is definitely undervalued (room for 2-3x growth) and has a clear path to success.

So much demand for vehicles that batteries need to used for the car business\n2. Difficulty scaling enough 4680s for the batteries\n3. Regulatory slowdowns in the energy sector\n4. Non uniform power systems in each house makes energy not as easily automatable as car production\n5. Commoditization of solar panels (likely) and 4680s (probably not likely).\n\nThat being said, I do see a very good future where 4680s are properly scaled, Tesla greatly improves immensely on installations, and profit margins remain strong! Looking forward to see how this plays out!\n\n**Software:**\n\nAs of now, most of the in-vehicle software that you mentioned that people enjoy does not necessarily provide direct revenue, and instead indirectly increases desirability for the vehicles and allows Tesla to command higher profit margins. However, I'm slightly skeptical to how much margin the software like an App Store could actually add. For example, most people would want to play games on their phone anyways. That being said, I do see a good future where the software increases desirability so much that Tesla can let their vehicles command incredibly high margin on vehicles through software alone!\n\n**Robotaxi:**\n\nWhen you mention that Robotaxi is not all or nothing, I agree that in the sense that the higher likelihood that Robotaxi is to happening, the higher the stock price we get. However, it is binary in the sense that it either happens or it doesn't (caveating nuances like rolling out Robotaxis only in approved areas). IMO, the only non-binary aspect of FSD is that when it is approved for city streets, I wouldn't be surprised if we get close to 100% take rate at 200 dollars / month, which steadily increases as the % safety increases higher and higher. I tend to lean on the side that Robotaxis are going to happen with a lot higher chance than they won't happen. However, will need to see FSD V10 before I can draw more conclusions.\n\n**Dojo:**\n\nI agree that Dojo as a service could provide great revenue for AI developers using this as their cloud AI training. I only have some questions to how general the Dojo solution will be for all AI workloads, but I do have high hopes for this one.

Back then using machine learning for imagery was still in its infancy (imagenet had just come out in 2007). Google needed a way to perceive the world around the car with precision and depth information or the project could never even get off the ground. At the time, it just wasn’t possible to do with cameras alone and Lidar was absolutely necessary or the project would be a non starter. Fast forward 14 years and we’re just now getting to the point that it’s possible to accurately perceive depth information from cameras alone. And now, Google’s (now Waymo) entire fleet and tech stack has been built on Lidar. There’s a ton of sunk cost at this point which is hard to pivot from. If Waymo were starting from scratch today, I’m not sure they would choose Lidar. \n\nLidar has been and will continue to be an easy way to ascertain depth information with a relatively low barrier to entry from a SW perspective, which is why we see many competitors choosing to equip it on their vehicles. But it is not the only way and is not without its cons. As we see neural nets continue to improve, I am confident we will see other competitors drop Lidar from the stack and just focus on multi camera. It’s hard not to given the high cost and maintenance requirements. Cameras are cheap, last forever and require zero maintenance. \n\nLidar can and will work as has been proven to by Waymo, but it is not necessary if you have an advanced enough vision system.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tesla has achieved a point cloud map in vector space with the 4th dimension inclusion using a set of 8 1280x860 cameras that fuse the final image for use.

Which will massively increase the fidelity of data ingested.\n\nOver time, the sensor ingest fidelity will go up.

It's a sensor deadend.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lidar Interference seems to be solved, just as black objects detection. Price of hardware is going down pretty fast. But I heard lidars still consume huge amount of power", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm late to this party and I'm sure this comment will be buried, but your understanding of Lidar is incorrect. Lidar is a great technology for basic perception. It was necessary when AI models and the inference machines that ran them could not meet the latency requirements of scanning an entire scene accurately. So what early guys did (like Google) was use local Lidar to compare to a HD map in order to bounding box useful dynamic spaces, such as traffic lights and pedestrian crossways in order to focus where the camera vision AI would attempt to perceive things that Lidar was not good at (seeing if the light was green or red).\n\nThe problem with this approach was that it turned out to be insufficient for perception. Pedestrians could cross at any point of a scene (jaywalking, *gasp*). Weird things like a crane could be an obstacle that is in an area bounding boxed as the sky. Your vision system needed to run a YOLO across the full scene regardless.\n\nDue to almost limitless edge cases, your vision system needs to be incredibly robust. However, if your vision system is this robust, why would you need Lidar? This is what is meant by \"Lidar is a crutch.\" This does not mean it's useless, but that it's simply an intermediate solution to something that needs to be fully solved anyway, i.e. vision.\n\nTesla bulls need to stop pretending Tesla cars wouldn't benefit from all having free Lidar. At the very least, it would help them automate distance labeling across all of their data to train their vision faster. However, Lidar does cost money, and in order to work with the 4D perception stack each Tesla would need a 3D Lidar, which is expensive and ugly as shit. Using it simply as a tool to help labeling distances so that one day the vision stack will automatically be perfect on all distances, thus rendering the Lidar useless. That is dumb as hell and why Tesla doesn't use Lidar.\n\nSources: Elon, [the dude who got Waymo into Lidar in the first place](https://youtu.be/nRgplHWGbuM?t=7m33s), George Hotz, Karpathy, etc.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hello, it looks like you know lots on Lidar.

I only argue that it is harmful to use post-training.\n\nWhile I agree with why Lidar was used in the first place, you need to consider the drawback I laid out in the post.\n\n1. Lidar depth estimations as used by all other self driving companies do not measure color, which is needed for neural networks to identify objects texture.\n2. You cannot easily run neural networks on Lidar data. This requires 3D convolutions and an a very large input layer. This also eats compute resources on the neural network chip for marginal benefit.\n3. Even if the lidar was free, high maintenance cost for a mechanical component.\n4. Additional issues that are not impossible to work around, but haven’t been solved adequately, such as poor performance with dark vehicles, rain, energy consumption, etc.\n\nThe key point I want to emphasize here is that Lidar is really bad for neural networks.

{"title": "3 Things to Stop doing That Will Help You Lose Less Money", "selftext": "\"Sir, this is a casino\" \n\nI know, but you can visit the casino without being the idiot who dumps all of his money into the slots. Below are three simple tips that I've learned from nearly blowing up a $60k portfolio. I promise I will not quote Warren Buffett. \n\n**1.) Stop buying during pumps.** \n\nIf a stock has run up over 20% or more in a day or even a week, it's not the time to buy. This is common sense and we all know it, but FOMO is a bitch. It's insanely tempting to jump on the hype train, but 9 times out of 10 you'll get burned (just ask any CLOVtard who bought in on Tuesday). Rub one out, clear your mind of FOMO, and find another play. Don't be a sheep and buy into whatever ticker everyone else is spamming in the daily thread, because it's probably too late. \n\n**2.) Stop consistently buying out of the money calls.** \n\nI'll probably get hate for this one, but buying in the money calls instead of OTM doesn't even limit your upside *that* much. Sure, a lotto-style gamble on OTM calls is fun once in a while, but watching money evaporate (which again is what will happen 9/10 times) is not fun. OTM calls have no intrinsic value and are not worth the extra 100-200 percent gain you get over buying ITM calls. With ITM calls, your upside is still theoretically unlimited, and your downside is protected if you know when to cut your losses. *They're called FDs for a reason, stop voluntarily gaping your own ass.* \n\n**3.) Stop being a perma-bull.** \n\nThe market has been insane over this past year and a half. It's euphoric and no one knows exactly how long it will go on this way, but the music **will** stop at some point. When it does, all those super awesome speculative companies you're holding that lose money will be the first to shit the bed. \n\nI've been caught with my pants down during the peak of a bubble and it's not a good time. When SP_Cs crashed back in late February, I refused to see the crash for what it was and got caught bagholding a bunch of warrants and other garbage. What I hadn't considered is that the ending to SP_C euphoria was inevitable. I should've had a plan in place, I should've hedged, I should've diversified, I should've been more nimble with my trades, yadda yadda. I'm not here to tell you what to do, I'm here to tell you what not to do: don't be the moron who goes all in on shitty companies with unwavering confidence. Not saying you have to go full boomer mode and buy \"solid\" companies based on fundamentals or whatever, just know that if you're making money right now it's probably not sustainable and you'll have to adjust your strategies at some point. \n\nHere's to losing less money. Now you can be more like the guy at the casino who sits down at the poker table having no idea what he's doing, but beats out all of the seasoned players through sheer luck and pisses everyone off.", "id": "pl6ekj", "created_utc": 1631220799.0, "score": 281, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|297|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Didn't read.
