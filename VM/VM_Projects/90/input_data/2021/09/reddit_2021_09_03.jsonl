That is a flying car. That's not a troll that is a feature of an announced product. Just like he announced a robot then immediately backtracked and said it may never make production. \n\nDefinition from bing of levitate:\n\nlevitate  \n\\[ˈlevəˌtāt\\]  \nVERB  \nlevitating (present participle)  \nrise or cause to rise and hover in the air, especially by means of supernatural or magical power.  \n\"he was focused on levitating the backpack\" · \\[more\\]  \nsynonyms:  \nfloat · rise into the air · rise · hover · be suspended · glide · waft · drift · hang · defy gravity · **fly** · soar up\n\nThis is in response to a post where there is credible evidence apparently that Musk intends to make a $25k Model 2 (not called the model 2) that will be 100% full self driving with no steering wheels or pedals. (This is similar to the recent book that said he wanted the Model 3 made without a steering wheel).\n\nTesla has currently ZERO self driving cars on the market (legally they are level 2 even with FSD in the state of California by Tesla's own paperwork submission - this is what I am basing this description off of). Do you really think - as a mod of this thread - that if real full self driving no human involved FSD was going to come it would come in a base model sub 30k car? \n\nAt what point do you start acknowledging he just says things, things that are not realistic or obtainable for a car company that barely can make 2 models globally (3/S) and 1 model regionally (y)  in 2021 (The X refresh hasn't hit customers right? that would be a 4th model) and that the next 2 models and semi were announced \\~5 years ago and are still 2 years away at minimum. This is  for a car company that has been making cars over 10 years. s\n\nIt's like all the talk about how Mojo was making all the pre v9 stuff possible, only to have him announce the new chip, and state Dojo was in bench test state at best this most recent AI day and that Dojo wouldn't spin up until next year. \n\nThis isn't trolling, this is trying to have a realistic discussion on things that should move stocks up and down but doesn't in a sub about investing in this company. \n\nBack to levitation - Merriam-Webster doesn't specifically say levitate is flying but it *does* troll with:\n\nlevitate verb  \nSave Word  \n To save this word, you'll need to log in.  \nLog In   \nlev·​i·​tate | \\\\ ˈle-və-ˌtāt  \\\\  \nlevitated; levitating  \nDefinition of levitate  \nintransitive verb  \n: to rise or float in or as if in the air especially in seeming defiance of gravitation  \ntransitive verb  \n: to cause to levitate  \nExamples of levitate in a Sentence  \n The woman levitated above the stage.  \n *The magician claimed he could levitate a car.*", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "Okay you want to have a discussion?

Like if the car keeps parking in the wrong parking spot. There needs to be an open customer-to-Tesla line of communication for this to work and it just doesn't seem like a Tesla thing to do.\n\nExample: I would like to know how the car will know how to go the exactly the correct route in my apartment complex parking hall so I can log myself in to get access. Where to stop and when to continue. And then how the car will know the correct parking spot I have paid for.

If they have starship orbital in time for next year's window (very dependent on that environmental review) I could see them yeeting up to three ships at mars, if for nothing else than to prove out orbital refueling and the rapid launch of tankers\n\nAssuming the tesla bot is ready, I expect 2024 to involve starships loaded with bots, a few different unassembled prototype ISRU plants, equipment for construction and production of construction materials (like cement), a crapton of solar panels and batteries and maybe even a nuclear reactor if they can convince the government to allow it, and enough starlink satellites to fully cover mars with service for the bots\n\n2026 would have the first humans landing on mars, bringing all the human necessities (food, food production, ECLSS, etc) to be installed in the habitats the robots will have already built\n\nThis puts the 2028/29 transfer window as the earliest point when both basic human luxuries will have been set up, and when the engineering problems Elon becomes most interested in and concerned about working on will be on Mars, trying to make a colony that is entirely self-sustaining without Earth. Elon has repeatedly proven with both spacex and tesla that he prefers to be right there where the action is (be it torquing bolts on the factory floor, or fiddling with the settings on the massive welding machine for his 9m wide rocket segments), and he has previously stated his intent to go to mars to lead the development of the colony to self-sustainability \n\nRealistically speaking, everything I just said happens, just on a one window delay. The FAA figuring out their environmental assessment in time for the 22 window is doubtful, but I highly doubt the powers that be in the military will let them stall things too much more, because we all know the military has all kinds of wet dreams of what they can do with starship. This makes the first yeet at mars 2024. Since it's questionable whether tesla will actually have their bots ready in 24, that puts the bot launch in 26 and the first humans in 28/29....\n\nOh hey, that puts the flight that I feel Elon will want to put himself on in the 2031 transfer window.... 10 years from now (9.4ish if you're insistent on being a pedant)\n\nWeird how that worked out 🤔", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "So true, so thirty.\n\nBut then FSD Two weeks timeline is much tighter lately.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "How many people can legitimately say their retirement plan is to move to Mars?

He can just issue a dividend and wipe out all of his debt in a keystroke if it comes to the point he needs to pay down his personal debt.  That wont happen until dividends are not taxed.
