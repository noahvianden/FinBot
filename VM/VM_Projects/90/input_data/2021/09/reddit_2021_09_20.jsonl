{"title": "Let’s talk. Bulls and Bears invited!", "selftext": "I was asked by my pops when the correction was going to end, and it made me think that it was a good topic to have a discussion on with my favorite retards.\n\nHere is my response\n\n“Well, seeing as how everyone is over leveraged including hedge funds, it could pull back 10%. Right now it's at 5, and everyone swore it wouldn't get to 5 lol. \n\nThe 50 EMA, which is the uptrending channel it's been on for the past year and a half, convincingly broke the past two trading sessions. It is now focused on the 100EMA, if it breaks that, youre looking at a fall to about 390/395 for the SPY, and 3800 for the SPX. (Spitballing here for you gay technical gurus)\n\nTo be honest though, I'm not buying that it will be a crash or a major correction past 7%. I believe it falls tomorrow and Wednesday, which allows me to make profit lol, and then soars Friday. There is no way the federal reserve 1) stops buying bonds at the rate they are doing, or 2) hike interest rates while delta variant is growing in the US.\n\nAlthough the economy is showing good growth, and inflation is running rampid (not transitory like  they try to say), the fed will continue to print infinite money therefore ruining the economy and setting up another great financial crisis event. The crash will severely destruct the country. \n\n1. The debt ceiling raise is being opposed by the republicans , without that raise, America essentially defaults on debt, which makes the evergrande (you need to google that, that's important) situation look like a walk in the park. They are probably doing this to delay the infrastructure bill (which will \"help\" the economy by pumping even more money into it, therefore causing a crash)......excuse my language but basically either way we are in a shit ton of trouble . \n\n2. In terms of the bill, it's coinciding with a tax rate for every class, let's start from the bottom up, there is a 11 million dollars getting pumped into the stock market every day by retail investors, this is largely from shutdowns, stimulus checks, and no incentive to put money in savings (see: interest rates) this slows down when the public opens up unrestricted, and when taxes are hiked to pay for the bill. Now, here is the trick that is lost on a lot of people. The administration doesn't want to hike taxes for anyone under 400000, but what they are missing is taxes are being put on popular items that people under the 400000 limit typically spend their money on (see: tobacco), moving on from that, those with incomes ranging 400000 to 5 million will be taxed at 28%, this is the somewhat important money, not as much as corporations but has the ability to drive prices unlike retailers. A lot of loopholes like the mega roth back door and criptoe (see: mods 🙄)  being treated as a property rather than a security would be reversed. That has big implications into the next part. Corporations. The administration hopes to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 39%. The one thing the rich know how to do, is get around the system that was built for them to succeed. What this will do is force a further sell off by the big money in order to escape the new tax rate, and buy at a cheaper price in order to capitalize/make up for the tax rate during the economic recovery. The corporations will make off with more money than they had before, in a resurgent economy that is powered by the money of the only losing party who started the year and half rally in the first place, the retailers. \n\n3. I don't know if you remember, but I spoke to you all in the group chat about the federal reserve and their bond buying program, I was betting on that it stopped, but it didn't and reversed to its last ATH. The fed stated that the economy was not ready to go in its own and decided that tapering was off the table, the stock market rallied from its 2.5% low to an ATH in 3 hours. 10 days. 10 days later it created its last ATH (all time high) and has fallen for the past 3 weeks. Which is a clear sign that it is over valued. & furthermore, several fed board members have sold exactly at that ATH (which is illegal), Congress and pelosi has as well (which is illegal) and the only people who think the stock market will reverse back to ATH are, the retailers. The fed has two options, continue printing infinite amounts of money to stabilize a already stable economy further losing up the bubble to Great Depression proportions (which would not serve their best interest since they all have capitalized and SOLD already 😬) or taper the economy and have the equivalent of the great financial crisis sell off for the next month . Technicals or news doesn't move the markets, people do. \n\n\nI'm hoping for a 10% correction, which is healthy for the economy and also for my bank account, I've already made my profit thus far, but if it doesn't continue correction and reverses to all time highs, we are going to enter a year long recession. There just isn't anymore money to throw at the economy without it coming back. \n\nAnd technically, the S&P/Nasdaq are tech heavy and controlled by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, google), if there is a sector rotation there isn't one single sector that can hold a candle to them. The economy will falter.”\n\nI’m not the smartest in the world on any of these subjects. I suspect neither of you guys are either. Jokes are welcomed. And I’m also willing to learn on shit I was probably wrong on in here.

Here is some food for the discussion:\n\n* SPY is made up of about a dozen different sectors, with different weightings: 24.19% tech, 13.82% healthcare, 13.55% financial services, 11.18% communication services, 9.04% industrials, 7.17% consumer defensive, 10.99% consumer cyclical, 2.86% utilities, and 2.52% real estate. They have tickers like XLK, XLV, XLY, XLC etc.  Look up the rest.  In other words, if tech and healthcare are doing good, that's 37% of SPY.  If Tech (XLK), Healthcare (XLV), and Financials (XLF) are doing good, that's 50% of SPY and it's basically impossible to crash the S&P500.  \n* Over the last few weeks, most of these sectors have been flat or starting to break down, but Tech and Healthcare and Financials were doing fine.  \n* Healthcare, XLV, has dropped to its 50 day MVA. \n* Within the SP500, the top 10 weighted stonks are: Apple Inc., Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook Class A, Google Class A, Google Class C, Tesla, NVIDIA, Berkshire, and JP Morgan. These make up 28%!  The Big Tech companies make up 20%.  That's why SPY has kept booming; because these big companies are making tons of cash.  As long as these guys are in an uptrend, most likely SPY will be.  \n* Most of these guys are sitting on huge piles of cash, and none have broken down severely.  \n* Before the 1987 crash, like 5 of the top 10 companies had already nosedived.  IBM, Ford, Exxon, General Electric, etc.  In comparison, Apple, MSFT, Amazon, FB, and Google are either flat, in clear uptrends, and/or are sitting on cash.  \n* Agree with you that we could see a correction, but not full bear market mode yet.  To enter full bear mode we would need:\n   * Amazon to run out of Chinese junk to sell\n   * JP Morgan to have Chinese contagion effect\n   * NVIDIA, Apple, and Tesla to be constrained by chips\n   * Buffet to pass away and BRK to drop\n   * Something bad to happen to FB and Google . . . government regulation?

One of the aspects to trading that I've learned over time is that the groups that have the money play games with that money. Economics is rational, but trading is more like chess or poker in that there's a system that applies to game theory and social psychology, and when you have control of the center of the board in a game of chess, which is about control of real estate on the board, you can control where people can and can't move. One of the fake-out methods of winning a chess game is to trick your opponent into playing into your field of control... in the stock market, that center of the board field of control is effectively controlling price movements through exploitation of capital.\n\nIn other words, market makers, institutions, and funds hold the majority of the shares in play depending on the stock we're talking about. This gives them primary control over how the price can move. Sometimes it behooves market makers to let a stock run, sometimes it doesn't. The market maker's primary motivation is getting return on initial investment and then some. The goal of a fund or institution is to grow return. Once you have a position, you then have to execute a risk reduction and increased return strategy, which if you own any significant amount of stock that means playing spreads.\n\nIf you let your spreads just play out on expansion of the market, you'll never reduce cost basis... so one pattern you'll see is that a stock that has a big run will go for a period of time where it doesn't move very much. It will be actively suppressed on big moves where it looks like it might break out around contracts. (See: AMD)\n\nThat's market makers competing for positive or negative position in an attempt to reduce cost basis. I think sometimes these big moves occur around those kinds of dynamics.\n\nAfter a quad witching phenomenon, these funds will likely be repositioning because they've run their strategies to their logical conclusions and new positions need to be created, and the best way to create a new position is in a slump. So you have these drawdowns which occur around specific events where people expect them to go down... if you're a market maker repositioning for an ideal trade, that's a great time to lean into a sell-off. It's like firing a gunshot when you know a loud noise is going to happen... people don't necessarily connect the outcome with the actual strategy.\n\nNote: I'm not suggesting a conspiracy here, but rather that game theory dictates that in any system with rules like the stock market, you're going to have entities which develop similar strategies.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "What you’re saying makes complete sense, and I now will dive further into that with my own research, but just like I didn’t know that, which it seems like is a routine ordeal to happen in the market, in terms of psychology a lot of people don’t know that, which can fuel a sell off, I’m not saying I’m smarter than everyone one, but I know I research more than the newbie who started trading yesterday, and there’s more new people everyday. They buy red, see green, and sell deeper red because they don’t know what the hell they are doing.
