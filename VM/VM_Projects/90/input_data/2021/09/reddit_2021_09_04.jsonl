Tesla Daily talked about it in one of the most recent episodes (on Thursday I think).", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I listened to Rob on this afternoon... I think the truth is somewhere between Cathie and Rob here. \n\nDemand for Trucks and luxury/near luxury SUVs has stayed pretty much constant, and the best efforts of the auto OEMs hasn't been able to keep up with this demand, despite the industry focusing the chips they can get on these high profit vehicles. This is what Rob is referring to when he mentions that days of supply are at record lows. However, the Trucks and SUVs that are being produced (many small CUVs and Sedans have been out of production as chips aren't available) are at much lower days of supply, basically selling of the factory line. At the same time though, there are still plenty of sedans for sale (many with significantly more than 50 days of supply, hence the average). Many of these sedans still have OEM discounts (the \"clearance\" Rob mentions) despite the fact that many of these sedans have been out of production for months out of the last year waiting for chips. Even less desirable trucks are still easily available, the Nissan titan has 100 days of supply and steep discounts. I believe this indicates that while there might be a demand for some new trucks and high end SUVs, there isn't a broad demand for vehicles across the market. \n\nCorroborating this, used car prices (still high vs where they were 2 years ago) have been falling since June, despite the number of used vehicles available for sale continuing to decrease. \n\nA recent study have shown that 40% of the consumer base says they are at least considering an EV for their next vehicle purchase... if 25% of these consumers (10% of the buying public) have firmly made the decision that their next vehicle will be an EV, then that could fully account for the YoY drop we saw in August. \n\nConsider that the demographics of this 40% (younger, less wealthy, better educated) is directly opposite the demographics of the pickup truck market. Then consider the markets hyperfocus on selling in demand trucks right now, the excess inventory in non-trucks, and the fact that the SAAR still fell significantly...
