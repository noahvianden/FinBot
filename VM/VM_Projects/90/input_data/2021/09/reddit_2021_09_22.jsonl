With a ripple effect across the world, it would stall everyone’s economies like 2008. During the 2008 crisis, we saw exports and imports both drastically decline. All due to globalization. \n\nGood excerpt from top article: \n\n“Since the major trading partners of the U.S. were in a recession at the same time as the U.S. in 2007-09, foreign demand for U.S.-produced goods declined, which hurt U.S. exports. Similarly, since production fell in the major economies from which the U.S. imports, total U.S. imports declined. In contrast, in the recession of 2001 only a few of the major trading partners were simultaneously in recession, and the magnitude of the recession in those countries was substantially less severe than in 2007-09. Consequently, the effect on U.S. trade was less severe in 2001.\n\nThe magnitude of the collapse in U.S. trade in the latest recession was not merely due to the severity of the U.S. recession. Instead, two forces magnified the trade collapse. First, most of the major trading partners of the U.S. were simultaneously in recession, something that didn't occur in previous downturns. Second, countries are more linked via the global supply chain now than they were in previous recessions.” \n\nChina is the 2nd largest economy in the world. If they shake, we are shaking. Really China’s economy grinding to a hault wouldn’t be unique in terms of supply chain issues, it seems to be a common occurrence of the past, but as globalization continues to increase and we become more dependent on each other, it just become a growing issue.
