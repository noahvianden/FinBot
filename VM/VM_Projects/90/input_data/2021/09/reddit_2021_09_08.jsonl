They literally take steel slag from steel refineries (the shit that's left over after making steel) and they further refine it into zinc & other trace metals and they manage to sell this for a CONSISTENT profit. This line of business is not easy to get into, you need expertise, machinery and above all you need decade long contracts with steel mills! So their competition is literally nil, cause there's no one around to directly compete with them by taking their work from. Of course they are at the mercy of Zinc prices, but so is their non-direct competition.\n\nThe Global Atomic management team determined that they are at the max capacity/efficiency that they could reach in the slag/zinc refining business and they decided to get into uranium, using the profits from the zinc business to fund the uranium venture. Of course at the same time they made public offerings for other ppl to get in on it.\n\nThey are cash positive, but also burning thru cash as they ramp up their projects. They have met their deadlines date for date, so the Q4 2024 startup seems quite reasonable. \n\nStill 3 years away right? well consider how far away everyone else is?
