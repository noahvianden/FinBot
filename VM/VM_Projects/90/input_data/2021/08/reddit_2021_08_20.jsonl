{"title": "The valuation of the S&P 500 is based on rapid projected earnings growth, and not necessarily overvalued as many assume.", "selftext": "I see a lot of posts these days proposing a relatively simple analysis: the stock market’s P/E is historically very high so it must be overvalued, and the only reason it has stayed high is because the FED is being extremely dovish, which it will be forced to stop soon as inflation heats up, thus leading to a bubble pop in the stock market. I am leaving aside my feelings about the inflation bit of this argument (I disagree that inflation will continue to run hot and that the FED will be forced to be more hawkish). Instead, I want to focus on proposing an entirely different and more justifiable reason why P/Es are so high and why the market is likely not overvalued.\n\nThe reason for the high valuations in the market is simple: growth. If the companies in the market are expected to grow faster than they have in the past, then they should be valued higher. This is in fact the case, as the current expected long run (5 years) earnings growth rate of the S&P 500 is 21.8% compared to the historical average expectation of ~12%. So how do we adjust valuations for growth? Enter a ratio that is not considered often enough, the price to earnings growth ratio (PEG): simply divide the forward P/E of the market by the long run earnings growth rate. The current forward P/E of the S&P 500 is 21.1, implying a PEG ratio of 0.97. The only times the S&P 500 PEG ratio has been lower in the past 27 years (as far back as the data goes for me) is late 2008, mid 2011, the last day of 2018, and in March 2020. Each of these times was followed by a historic period of outperformance. The median value of the S&P 500 PEG over the last 27 years is 1.25. \n\nSo by PEG standards, the stock market is actually undervalued quite a bit! Now naturally, the next question should be whether the long run earnings growth analyst consensus estimates are realistic. This is debatable and a discussion worth having, and I would hope that the bears don’t simply hand wave earnings estimates away and say they’re way too high. Even if we discount their estimates significantly, the S&P 500 has quite a bit of room to run through the end of 2022:\n\nLet’s consider long run earnings growth estimates are too high, perhaps by a very significant 20%, and by the end of 2022, the PEG reverts back to its long run mean of around 1.25. Therefore, the actual long term earnings growth rate would be 17.44%, and the forward P/E at the end of 2022 should be 21.8. Current analyst estimates for S&P earnings in 2023 are $236/share, so the implied S&P price by end of 2022 is $5,145, 16% higher than it is today, even if long term earnings growth is overly optimistic by 20%!\n\nI welcome your critiques and encourage avoiding hand waving or overly simple analysis without nuance.", "id": "p8a45o", "created_utc": 1629481316.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "Two things that should be kept in mind.\n\n1: The way that growth in revenue and earnings is determined is important, especially considering how last year was anomalous. Some companies, for instance, are expecting sky-high growth YoY **compared to 2020**, which isn't surprising given what COVID has done to the economy. But this sort of growth is obviously transient---there's no good reason to extrapolate the growth much further out than a year or two. Depending on how you define \"growth\" and how you bake it into some measure of forward P/E, you're likely to get wildly different conclusions.\n\n2: Future performance is not guaranteed. At the end of the day, these projections of growth are forecasts, and as someone who forecasts for a living, it's a truism that forecasts are rarely to be taken for gospel. Not to mention, given the euphoric sentiment perpetuated by a surge in retail participation and the demand for analytics to help answer the all-too-common question, \"What stock do I buy?\", and the reflation trade anticipated by some, future projections of growth are probably skewed toward the optimistic side of things.

It must still include earnings growth for Q2 this year, which right now is at 86.8%. Once this quarter officially ends, I'm guessing that 21.8% number drops pretty significantly. Consensus earnings growth for Q3 is 27% and Q4 is 20.3%. Beyond that, 2022's earnings growth is expected at 9.1% and 2023 at 7.5%.
