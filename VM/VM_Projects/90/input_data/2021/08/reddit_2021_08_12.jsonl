{"title": "Predictions on tomorrows $PLTR : Let the Games Begin…", "selftext": "What an awesome Earning reports for PLTR, kudos… it managed to close at around 24.70$, but I feel this is just the Tip of the Iceberg!!! Shorts and Hedgies have been playing around this stock for a long time and Every Retail\nInvestor was irritated by that, Good results - price down, new deals - price down, positive announcements - price down, how long this could go on… even last night many were skeptical with the expected Good Earnings report by saying - PLTR GOOD EARNINGS = Price Down… such was the mentality of frustrated investors for so long…\n\nFinally, PLTR turned the tables, and the stock price started climbing up. Funny part is : just after the Good Earnings report - shorts were scared and started their bombardment of negative PLTR sentiments on Stockwits by trying to scare the bullish investors. Even when Palantir was at 24$ today - Bears tried to convince all to take the profit and run away 😂 but This time their trick didn’t work…\n\nCouple of months back, $PLTR had touched 40$ line, but then got pulled back, but now with another great earning report and easily achievable guidance value - Palantir is going to Shine on top of all and if retail\nInvestors realize it’s worth and stay bullish behind it then it can easily cross 40$ again and may be even 50$+ \nRemember, $PLTR is not a meme stock (in a way it can be though, lol) - but a REAL COMPANY WITH AWESOME TRACK RCORD, Good Earnings, Incremental Focussed growth, great management team, Top of the Shelf software company which enables Private as well as Govt / Defense agencies, and it’s a Pioneer in its domain. It’s even considered as one of the top 12 AI companies in the world. So all I can see is Uphill for PLTR\n\nSo this is my personal view, and I know many here have similar opinion on it 😇 I’m not against Shorts, but I’m against their practice of scaremongering the retail investors for their own be if it’s Even when the Company is doing Real Good, that’s against the ethics of stocks investment. If a company is doing good then we want to invest there- and not to doom That company by shorting. That practice needs to stop. so I hope tomorrow PLTR  shoots up and teaches the lesson to shorties and it’s price crosses moon, May be even Mars and Beyond 😇🚀🚀🚀\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/12-best-artificial-intelligence-stocks-141203223.html\n\nPalantir Reports 49% Revenue Growth; US Commercial Revenue Up 90%\n\nQ2 2021 Highlights\n\nTotal revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $376 million\nUS commercial revenue grew 90% year-over-year\nClosed 62 deals of $1 million or more, of which:\n30 deals are $5 million or more\n21 deals are $10 million or more\n20 net new customers added in Q2 2021, total customers up 13% quarter-over-quarter\nCommercial customer count increased 32% quarter-over-quarter\nCash flow from operations of $23 million, representing a 6% margin\nAdjusted free cash flow of $50 million, representing a 13% margin\nGAAP net loss per share, diluted of ($0.07)\nAdjusted earnings per share, diluted of $0.04\nH1 2021 Highlights\n\nTotal revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $717 million\nCommercial customer count increased 61% since December 31, 2020\nCash flow from operations of $140 million, representing a 19% margin\nAdjusted free cash flow of $201 million, representing a 28% margin\n\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210812005243/en/Palantir-Reports-49-Revenue-Growth-US-Commercial-Revenue-Up-90-YY\n\n\n——————*——————\n\nCustomers:::::\n\nPalantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms\n\nPalantir Foundry clients include Merck KGaA, Airbus and Ferrari.\n\nPalantir partner Information Warfare Monitor used Palantir software to uncover both the Ghostnet and the Shadow Networks\n\nU.S. civil entities\nPalantir's software is used by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to detect and investigate fraud and abuse in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Specifically, the Recovery Operations Center (ROC) used Palantir to integrate transactional data with open-source and private data sets that describe the entities receiving stimulus funds. Other clients as of 2019 included Polaris Project, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,the National Institutes of Health,Team Rubicon,and the United Nations World Food Programme.\n\nIn October 2020, Palantir began helping the federal government set up a system that will track the manufacture, distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across the country.\n\nU.S. military, intelligence, and police\t\nPalantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community and United States Department of Defense, fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor (responsible for the GhostNet and the Shadow Network investigation).\n\nOther clients as of 2013 included DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, the Joint IED Defeat Organization and Allies. However, at the time the United States Army continued to use its own data analysis tool.Also, according to TechCrunch, \"The U.S. spy agencies also employed Palantir to connect databases across departments. Before this, most of the databases used by the CIA and FBI were siloed, forcing users to search each database individually. Now everything is linked together using Palantir.\"\n\nU.S. military intelligence used the Palantir product to improve their ability to predict locations of improvised explosive devices in its war in Afghanistan. A small number of practitioners reported it to be more useful than the United States Army's program of record, the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS-A). California Congressman Duncan D. Hunter complained of United States Department of Defense obstacles to its wider use in 2012.\n\nPalantir has also been reported to be working with various U.S. police departments, for example accepting a contract in 2013 to help the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center build a controversial license plates database for California. In 2012 New Orleans Police Department partnered with Palantir to create a predictive policing program.\n\nIn 2014, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) awarded Palantir a $41 million contract to build and maintain a new intelligence system called Investigative Case Management (ICM) to track personal and criminal records of legal and illegal immigrants. This application has originally been conceived by ICE's office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), allowing its users access to intelligence platforms maintained by other federal and private law enforcement entities. The system reached its \"final operation capacity\" under the Trump administration in September 2017.[71]\n\nPalantir took over the Pentagon's Project Maven contract in 2019 after Google decided not to continue developing AI unmanned drones used for bombings and intelligence.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\nPalantir was used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify if Iran was in compliance with the 2015 agreement\n\nEurope\t\nThe firm has contracts relating to patient data from the British National Health Service. It was awarded an emergency, no-competition contract to mine COVID-19 patient data in 2019. In 2020 this was valued at more than £23.5 million and was extended for two more years. The firm was encouraged by Liam Fox “to expand their software business” in Britain.\n\n\nPartnerships and Contracts::::\n\nInternational Business Machines\tEdit\nOn February 8, 2021, Palantir and IBM announced a new partnership that would use IBM's hybrid cloud data platform alongside Palantir's operations platform for building applications. The product, Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is expected to simplify the process of building and deploying AI-integrated applications with IBM Watson. It will help businesses/users interpret and use large datasets without needing a strong technical background. Palantir for IBM Cloud Pak for Data will be available for general use in March of 2021\n\nAmazon (AWS)\tEdit\nOn March 5, 2021, Palantir announced its partnership with Amazon AWS.

Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense. In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms. Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\n\nPalantir's original clients were federal agencies of the USIC.

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.\n\nOn any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.\n\nDifferent factors go into interpreting the price action, up or down, in an issue following an earnings report. One of those factors is the open interest in the weekly (or longer-term) options markets.\n\nOn Thursday's show, this dynamic was discussed with respect to Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR), the PreMarket Prep Stock of the Day.\n\nPalantir Price Action Ahead Of Earnings: On May 11, Palantir put in a major bottom at $17.06 and embarked on a substantial rally. That move came to an abrupt end when it put in a pair of highs at the $27.50 area at the end of June.\n\nThe retreat off that high came on July 19, when it bottomed at $20.55. Ahead of the report, it has been in a nine-day trading range from $21.69 to $23.52 and spent a majority of those sessions chopping around in the $22 handle.\n\nIn Wednesday's session, it had a range of $22.09-$23.19 and settled to closer near the low at $22.35.\n\nPalantir's Q2 Report: Before open, the company reported quarterly earnings of 4 cents per share, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of 3 cents by 33.33%. The company reported quarterly sales of $376 million, which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $353.23 million by 6.45%.\n\nPalantir forecast third-quarter sales $385 million vs. a $376.4-million estimate and raised FY21 adjusted free cash flow guidance from $150 million to $300 million.\n\nPotential Impact Of Palantir Options Trading: When the issue was being discussed on the show, it was trading higher by over $2 at the $24.70 area.\n\nBy looking at the huge open interest in the $25 weekly calls (and longer) dated in the options chain, Dennis Dick, explained in great detail how that open interest may have an impact on the price action in the issue.\n\n'The millions of shares controlled by the owners of the options,\" Dick said, \"will affect the price action as they attempt to work out of their positions.'\n\nThe author of this article noticed potential resistance at the pair of highs from early July at the $25.30 level as a potential target for the upcoming session.\n\nThe full discussion on the issue from Thursday's show can be found here:\n\nPLTR Price Action: After a mich higher open ($24.45 vs. $22.35), Palantir peaked at about $24.70 Thursday and had a brief decline to $23.88 before resuming its moved higher. It went on to breach the $25 level and aforementioned highs at the $25.30 level, rallying to $25.76 and reversing course.\n\nThe reason for that may have been owners of the large amount of $25 calls were attempting to lock in profits and have a hedged position as opposed to exiting the option outright.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Holding until MSFT acquisition in 2023.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "MSFT is too primitive.
