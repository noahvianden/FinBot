{"title": "Why is TSLAlounge here today [Explained]", "selftext": "So, in approximately October of 2020, we had asked teslainvestorclub to allow memes, which they promptly denied.  I created a subreddit (this one), thinking if they weren't gonna allow memes this could help for memes while allowing the main sub to run. I thought it would be a fun addition, but rules were rules. Then certain members called for a vote to be moderators (/u/is_joke_comrade), and they were denied, OK not a huge deal, but yet another blow. Then in late January 2021 a few highly prominent members were banned probably temporarily but meh, also conversations around the bans were censored (removed by moderators). I really don't like the idea of censorship, so we quickly resurrected this sitting subreddit in late January 2021, it quickly blew up and is what it is. The main moderator had abandoned TIC and the next 5 moderators don't really show up, you ended up with about 12 moderators with maybe 4 active that rule like an oligarchy, probably don't own any stock and just follow rules that are made up by people who don't care anymore. A messy nightmare. We are here today way less users than RT or TIC, but much more engagement and less bloat. We take great strides to not censor content on this subreddit, but it does come at a cost. If you are welcome then you are welcome, but if not then technically you might be censored, in the sense that you cannot post. This is typically reserved for ultra bears or trolls, and we try to keep an open mind and allow most content. I like the fact that the moderators of this subreddit have a great financial stake in TSLA and are active. I think that makes this a fun place, and hopefully this is demonstrated through our actions.\n\n\nAround June I think a few members broke off to create a discord, different type of service. A program that runs on your machine, and IMO overshares your personal information and lessens your anonymity, but they broke off saying that it's not a competition, users are free to switch between services. This is true to some extent, but I find that the vast majority of users tend to pick sides. Discord is great for certain services (mainly voice talk). But IMO its way to ephemeral for people that can't be present 24/7.It is what it is, but its pretty sad given that we have such a small userbase, and our goal is actually to stay small. We aren't looking for everyone to join, we have a great userbase, and are OK with slow growth of quality users.\n\n\nTLDR: this community was created to solve a problem of over moderation and lack of freedom of expression.

The best. \n\nSome folks here have top level daily thread conversations that are missing context (for example someone might assume everyone has seen a key bit of Tesla news so they fire off a sentence or two about it, or they talk about an Elon tweet such that any Elon tweet fits their comment).

It's really well done, makes it easy for me to quickly absorb news, does a great job of splitting up conversations to be on topic.\n\nI don't post at r/teslainvestorsclub as much as I used to especially after the Cranberry incident, which I still don't really grasp even though he reached out to chat when it went down. Some folks over there are definitely not liked by folks over here but I still like their analysis and their insight into TSLA related stuff.\n\nI use discord a little bit.
