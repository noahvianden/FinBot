Direct listing on Sept 30, 2020.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 139 customers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Financials\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||2020|2019|2018|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue ($)|1.1 Billion|742.6 Million|595.4 Million|\n|Cost of Revenue ($)|352 Million|242 Million|165 Million|\n|Cost of Revenue (%)|32|33|28|\n|Profit ($)|740.1 Million|500.2 Million|430 Million|\n|Profit (%)|68|67|72|\n|Revenue per Customer|$7.9 Million|$5.6 Million||\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, 44% of our revenue came from commercial customers and 56% came from government agencies.\n\nWe have also expanded significantly outside the United States. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 52% of our revenue from customers in the United States and the remaining 48% from customers abroad.\n\nOur business model with respect to acquiring and growing our accounts has three phases: (1) Acquire, (2) Expand, and (3) Scale. We categorize all customers into cohorts on December 31st each year.\n\nIn 2019, we generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which $0.6 million came from customers in the Acquire phase, $176.3 million came from customers in the Expand phase, and $565.7 million came from customers in the Scale phase.\n\nIn 2020, those same customers from 2019 generated a total of $1.1 billion in revenue. New customers acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020 generated an additional $41.8 million in revenue and were assigned a cohort as of December 31, 2020. A more detailed discussion of the three phases, \\[acquire, expand, scale\\] for purposes of illustration of how we manage accounts across the business, follows below.\n\nIt is in the Scale phase of our partnerships with customers that we generally see contribution margin on particular accounts improve. In 2019, we generated $565.7 million in revenue from customers in the Scale phase, with a contribution margin of 55%. In 2020, those same customers generated $613.4 million in revenue with a contribution margin of 70%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we have been awarded by, or entered into with, government and commercial customers, including existing contractual obligations and contractual options available to those customers, was $2.8 billion, up from December 31, 2019, when our total remaining deal value of such contracts was $2.2 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese financials make Palantir look more like a software as a service company.\n\n# New Customers\n\n* [Launching ERP Suite to deliver cost savings for AWS customers](https://medium.com/palantir/launching-erp-suite-to-deliver-cost-savings-for-aws-customers-ceed6e6dd927)\n* [Palantir and **3M** Expand Relationship to Build Dynamic Supply Chain](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-and-3M-Expand-Relationship-to-Build-Dynamic-Supply-Chain/default.aspx)\n* [Palantir Technologies and **Rio Tinto** Sign Multi-Year Enterprise Partnership](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Technologies-and-Rio-Tinto-Sign-Multi-Year-Enterprise-Partnership)\n* [Palantir & **BP** Deepen Partnership, Accelerate Energy Transition](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir--bp-Deepen-Partnership-Accelerate-Energy-Transition)\n* [**Fujitsu** Limited Signs $8 Million Contract as Palantir Foundry Customer and Becomes First Distributor of Foundry Modules in Japan](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Fujitsu-Limited-Signs-8-Million-Contract-as-Palantir-Foundry-Customer-and-Becomes-First-Distributor-of-Foundry-Modules-in-Japan)\n* [Palantir Continues Vital **NHS** Work with Two Year Contract](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-with-Two-Year-Contract)\n* [Palantir Technologies Expands Japan Business with New $22.5 Million Contract (with **SOMPO** **Holdings)**](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Technologies-Expands-Japan-Business-with-New-22.5-Million-Contract)\n\n# News\n\n[Is Palantir the new Reddit darling?](https://twitter.com/OptionsAction/status/1367244988426244100?s=20) (watch the video)\n\n# Purchases\n\n* Vanguard picked up 20,296,523 Palantir shares\n* ARK owns over 6.8 million share combines\n* HSBC Holdings\n* Blackrock\n\nMany others that I'm not listing, but please look them up on Fintel\n\n[Goldman has $34 price target](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-goldman-sachs-q4-earnings-analysis-2021-2-1030092816), representing about a 40% opportunity from Friday's close of $24.\n\n# Counterarguments\n\n1. After 4th quarter earnings, the share lock up expired and insiders were free to sell their shares\n\n* This will make approximately 1.8 billion shares available for sale, representing roughly 80% of outstanding shares,\" William Blair analyst Kamil Mielczarek said in a note.\n\nWho has sold so far?\n\n* Alex Moore, Director, 12,000 shares on 3/1\n* Matthew Long, 220,000 shares on 2/22\n* Ryan Taylor, (roughly) 160,000 shares on 2/22\n\nAlex Moore worked at the company from 2005 - 2010 according to his LinkedIn. He's been out of the company for over 10 years. He likely has limited interactions with the company on a regular basis. Looks like he's in VC funding now. If you started a company over 10 year ago, wouldn't you like some tendies? His selling was not based on the company's performance, but on his desire to allocate funds to other things.\n\nMatthew Long started at Palantir in 2009 and still currently works there as the General Counsel according to his LinkedIn. Once again, he's been holding shares for over 10 years and wants to cash out.\n\nRyan Taylor is a similar story. Been there over 10 years and still works there.\n\nAll these insiders sellings is a good thing for two reasons. 1) It allows enough shares to be available for institutions to make big purchases. Before the lock up expired, there likely wasn't enough shares available for the big institutions to buy. 2) Each time a big sale is made and the price pushes lower, it disincentivizes other insiders from selling. They've seen it from from 40 to 30 to mid 20s. There's resistance at $23.\n\n**Often insiders selling doesn't actually mean anything**. It just means they have **all** their money in one stock and want to diversify.\n\n* Soros Fund Management, which was among the earliest investors in Palantir, said following the listing it had sold all the shares it was permitted to sell and will continue to sell.\n\nSoros wants to sell for ethical reasons, not financial ones.\n\n2.  Palantir is overvalued, with a 29 price-to-earnings ratio (PE).\n\n1. Palantir is not Raytheon. It's a Software-as-a-service company. They are making multi-year deals, which means they collect money every quarter, usually more money as the customer moves from the acquire phase to the expand phase and finally to the scale phase\n2. The software industry has a 73 PE, so if we use that as our metric, Palantir is actually substantially undervalued.\n\nIf Palantir can continue to acquire and expand their customer base, particularly their commercial customers and continue to grow into new industries, there is no reason that they cannot easily go back to their previous highs. My price target is $37 by end of year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; it's going to moon. as institutional investors realize its value and continue to buy large quantities of shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: 2019 and 2020 **were** mislabelled. **Fixed**.\n\nEdit: I own 25k shares.

Shares are trading at roughly 300 times forward price-to-earnings.

The very reason tech has been draining for the past month. Just so you know, the more fiscal spend the bond market anticipates in the coming months or year, the bigger the bond sell off. It makes sense on their part because they expect all the fiscal spend is going devalue the dollar and make inflation a highly likely outcome. Inflation is the enemy of bonds. So the bond vigilantes, in anticipation of inflation in the future, is selling their holding and driving up the yield. The movement up on the yield if steady wouldn't have been a problem, as it would have been more indicative of economic growth. But the recent huge spikes are indicative of a different story boiling under the surface: inflation. Now, whether we would actually have inflation or not is not the problem here. Mere expectation of inflation is enough to make big money scared and rebalance their portfolio. If big money starts believing the inflation narrative, the impact would be observed in the violent swings of tech and equities in general.\n\nThe administration has already made it clear that they plan to big on fiscal spend in the coming years. The Fed has already made it clear that wouldn't be raising interest rates anytime soon - because raising interest rates now would mean slowing down the economy and thus making the efforts so far futile. But, things don't end here. If there is no response to the 10Y sell off, the bond vigilantes might just mount even more pressure on the yield making it push up over 1.75.\n\nWhat impact does a steeping yield curve has? It makes borrowing tougher than say one year ago and also it makes tech's future cash flow discount more, thus making their current valuations unattractive.\n\n\nThe treasury auction due to happen this coming week is going to say a lot about the bond market sentiment. If it goes badly, it is even more worrying speaking in terms of equity volatility and the 10Y yield.\n\nAll eyes are currently on Fed and JPOW for the upcoming FOMC meeting this month. Since raising interest rate is highly unlikely and there is bound to be fiscal spend in the future (accommodated by low interest rates), it is a strong possibility that Fed might resort to Yield Curve Control to temporarily calm the 10Y yield - another term for this Operation Twist. In this unique practice of QE, rather than buying short end of the YC, Fed shifts their purchases to the long end of the YC, in order to flatten the curve and keep borrowing rates low. But, what is the cost of this? The cost of this dollar devaluation and unattractive treasury bonds.\n\nIf Fed resorts to YCC, expect equities to roar back again. If they raise interest rates or do nothing, expect equities to struggle at least in the short term, before there is some sort of stability in the long term bond market.\n\nTLDR: Stimulus not big news for the market, will most probably be a sugar rush. Look out for the treasury auction this coming week - if bad, yield will probably spike even higher.
