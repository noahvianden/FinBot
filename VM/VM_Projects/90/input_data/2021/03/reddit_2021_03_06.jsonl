{"title": "For the unwilling \"Long term investors\".", "selftext": "So it turns out when it comes to \"Selling puts on up-trending stocks you'd not mind owning\" there are sometimes you might mind owning the stock.  Let's have a wider discussion about puts, wheels and dealing with backwards positions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Where to put it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSelling puts into an uptrend feels a lot like free money but not all sold puts are equal. First we'll look at some of the better and worse places to sell puts on an up-trending stock. We'll use CCIV. I think it's a stock quite a few people here might be trading and it's price action correlates closely to other stocks such as PLTR that people might be backwards on.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77nrhm10lbl61.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=585bca355dfe40cfdc5bc37603b1c6dd115f92e5\n\n**Purple: Bad puts.** \n\n**Green: Good puts.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not just picking out examples here based on the benefit of seeing what happened. All of the bad puts are sold after there being a strong move up. One that had moved above the base of the last consolidation.  When this has happened there's always more chance of a correction. The worst possible time to sell puts is after there has been a big push up and then the market keeps going higher and higher but it's doing it slower and slower. \n\nThere are two ways in which you are decreasing your gains and taking up more risk when you sell options after a strong leg and then into a slowing rise. Your chance of a pullback from the current price is much higher and your premiums are lower because IV is dropping based on slowing price action and usually lower IV skew since we're on a move to the bull side.  So you get less for the put. Have to go more OTM to not have a strike with a higher chance of trading ITM or you're going to have more puts trading and even expiring ITM. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe good puts are all sold into the falling market.  Into the conditions that inevitably always come around after we have a lasting expansion and a break away from the previous support base.  When selling these if you're using the same distance in strikes you're going to have less chance of them trading ITM.  There are a lot of times in these situations I am willing to sell puts ATM and would be quite happy if they filled. They are like a limit order because I am waiting for a price that I think is a good one.  When selling puts into this sort of move you're getting higher premium on the IV. Also by selling puts after there being an expansion of real volatility to the downside and therefore a larger expansion in future IV, you have a lot more to potential for vega (Changes in IV) to work in your favour. Price might range and that's lower IV. It might go up slower than it fell and that's lower IV with a positive skew. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stocks have been pulling back since at least the 1700's! You can wait for good entries.**  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# When good puts good bad\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow we'll look at the two entries here that would have looked like great spots at the time based on the criteria we've used, but didn't look that great a while after. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2oxyocbobl61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=f874fb5b1a556f2f141b033378421d3402badc90\n\nWhen you're  getting into a trade it's a good idea to work out beforehand places where you'd know you might be in trouble.  Usually in a big pullback it comes back to the base it made the last breakout from.  That was a price of indecision previously and then a big decision to take the market up was made. Usually the memory of the market kicks in at that level and support is found. But in this case there was an attempt at a rally but it failed. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1q30dpkpbl61.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=084de9969fde1baf77f3424f3068fb0ba8bc8c32\n\nThere are lots of different things you can do when a sold put is in trouble. The thing I like to do is place in orders to short somewhere between 10 - 50 shares of the stock under previous lows (If I have some other things giving me some more bearish sentiment I might short more, but this is what I'd use just for caution to offset maximum loss.  A good way to enter shorts if you do not have a lot of experience with that is to place pending orders under major lows. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbesfi2gqbl61.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=0869daa66fed5d321b514b0b3b7b2f09a826d3b3\n\nIf price is breaking out and downtrending this is going to fill your protection orders as that begins to happen.   And I'm going to trail my stop losses so when the market makes jumps up I'll be getting out of my shorts at a profit. Then I'll place pending orders to sell under the low again.  I'm always setting stop losses when I place pending shorts. They are above the highs of the last big swings up.  So as price falls and keeps making new lows I am taking down a bit of my exposure to the put and also closing out some profitable trades which is improving my cost basis (And it's kicking ass relative to what a covered call would be). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf this keeps going down it's usually going to end up looking something like this. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b3imjvhwrbl61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=c16b0ccbc0890a3b0fb91c6e192516e5ce729ab6\n\nWhich is bad news if you're on the wrong side of it and trying to instinctively manage the position. Because all the times you feel good about the trade in real time are here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15ha2kccsbl61.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=147d8353ce301b8d0514e8ef292932b9f5ed60ad\n\nAnd if you're experienced enough to spot price is trending against you these are places you want to short stock (Getting up to the full 100) which you'll take profit on when there is a break and run away from the previous support base. If you're wheeling, this is where you want be selling your covered calls. These are the only spots where you can sell the covered calls and get some real value to offset your cost basis when the price is doing some kick ya in the nuts falling.  Here you can sell your calls just above the last highs of the previous swing. Selling them close to ATM. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qy4i18y1tbl61.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=a78e7a38d725784510d687cec7629088bbb0e0ee\n\nBut if you're not thinking about things in that way, the times you want to sell the covered calls are into the points when price is moving far away from the previous support base. And you're selling them deep OTM.  Living life in that $5 land. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3cvz9betbl61.png?width=1357&format=png&auto=webp&s=b478aac60730deda1e00834ad888566aea2130b3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Big bounces and reversals \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoing this will work all well and good for a while but at some point there is absolutely surely going to be a move up that is enough to hurt short trades.  Even if the stock is on its way to zero there will be a counter-trend rally that will break the previous recent down-trend and make all this \"Just place the sell below the low and stop above the high\" stuff a lot trickier to implement practically in real time.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what a recovery rally and a buyers trapping rally would look like.  These are pretty representative of how most moves in stocks will go.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kfpeo5kbubl61.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=eda6ce85932e321c4373a6da1a4fb0e7bdcc173e\n\nWhen dealing with a reversal rally the length of the last swing down is going to be the maximum you lose in shorts using the simple methods explained here. Once price goes over there it hits stop losses and never makes new lows to fill the next short orders.  One exception to this is a gapping market. Which will always have some undefined risk to it.  \n\nIn the second one you're going to get your stop loss hit.  Only a bit higher than where your stop loss is price is going to start to turn around and then the crash down to the low is going to be quick. You'll fill  new pending orders and have the stop loss in almost the same place as you were stopped out. It'll be frustrating. It's going to happen. Don't let it frustrate you into making bad decisions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The price of doing nothing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf a stock you've sold a put on does an entire correction swing this is what it looks like.

You'd be best concentrating on that rather than annotating on past graphs where the stock has gone up, and where it has gone down.
