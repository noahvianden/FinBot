{"title": "Shorts Attacking RKT: Business and Stonk Holding Firm", "selftext": "TLDR: I  believe that we, the individual investor now owns over 100% of the float of RKT. (35% float short)  RKT will do fine in the \"mortage slowdown\" coming off a record 2020 and Hedgies will cover and the stock will have to explode higher. \n\nHere Long version DD:\n\nRKT came public at $18 back in August.  In IPOs they sell to mutual funds, hedge funds etc.  Rkt was presented and purchase by bank portfolio managers.  Banks are boring.  When you have a mutual fund or hedge fund, the oldest fart in the room trades the utilities, the second oldest trades the bank stocks.\n\nBut we know RKT is not a bank stock, its a fin tech stonk.  The valuations of fintec are white hot!  see SQaure, Paypal, even that POS Lightspeed.  The market is paying insane multiples of revenue, even when they lack good profits, or in the case of lightspeed no profit.  RKT can be a $60+ stock if fairly valued.  Q1 is not going to be a bust, and they have a history of squeeking out profits in even the worst market.\n\nAsk yourself this:  how did Gilbert build this into the largest in the whole world while maintaining almost 100% ownership?  He never needed to sell stock to raise cash, the only owners are him (90%) management and employees (5%) and us (5%).   They profited all along the way and grew the business with good old fashion cash flow profits.\n\nRKT is a cash machine with double digit long term growth potential.  Now 2020 was a 'peak' earnings year.  \\~$4.50/share is not a regular thing.  But a core earnings rate of \\~$2 to $3/share average each year that grows long term 10-20%/year i think is a reasonable number.\n\nSo ask yourself, what do i pay for just $2.50/share of long term earnings power that grows 10-20%.  Most S&P500 companies are only growing a few percent a year.  They are not innovative but trade around 30x earnings.  Even if $2/share is the 'normal' mortgage market earnings rate, this should be better than $60/share!!!!\n\nShort thesis is dumb:\n\nHedge funds have shorted nearly 40 mil shares as of the last report.  They are trading 2 'negative' data points:\n\n1) Slowing mortgage market because rates are up 1/2%.  RKT made a lot on refis, and that was a sweet bump in 2020 that we won't see in 2021.  \n\n2) Mortgage Service Rights are market to \"rates\", and rates up means a non-cash write down\n\n\\-The truth: refis will slow in 2021, but mortgage market will still be strong.  RKT will make plenty of money on the new mortgage biz, but earnings of $2/share on the new morgage side is more reasonable without the refi-kicker bonanza of 2020.\n\n\\-Mortgage service rights are always profitable, they collect a payment fee from the bank to bill the customer through their platform.  Thats the asset here, they estimate the value at the time of origination and if rates go up they 'discount' the future cash.  The cash is still coming just fine and its keeps them cash positive in new mortgage down turns.  That write down may knock a buck or so off earnings in the next quarter or two, but thats really just a 'reversal' of the valuation that gave us the $4.50 of profit last year.\n\nThats why i estimate the average earnings power of the business: $2-$3/share.  Some years it bumps above, other years they have to write it back down, but thats the long term average and its growing, i think 10-20%/year long term.  Hedge funds want to shake people out when revenues and earnings reverse this quarter or next.  But the power of this business makes hay across the whole cycle.  I don't care  about a couple of soft quarters with RKT is so far below fetching a good multiple of earnings.\n\nShort panicing and selling the stock down.\n\nWould it surprise you to learn that they have been shorting millions of more shares in the last 2 days?  They are desparately trying to bust this stock, and i think they ahve already failed and this will be the next, ehem, rocketing short that busts one or more big hedgefunds.

This is going to be a WAR while many previously thought that RKT could scoop up business until all the middle men were forced out.\n\nI thought changes in technology a decade ago would eliminate real estate agents, but they are still holding significant ground and overcharging with large commissions.  It's a similar story with financing.\n\nIn this red hot real estate market, the ability to close quickly is everything.  The middle men make that happen.
