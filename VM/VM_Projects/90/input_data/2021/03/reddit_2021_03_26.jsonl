{"title": "$PAVE options are dirt cheap and infrastructure is about to take off - DD", "selftext": "If anyone thought that Biden would take his foot off the spending pedal after passing his 1.9T covid relief package, go ahead and put your seatbelt back on because this mother fucker is just getting started.\n\nInfrastructure has always been low hanging fruit for both the Democrats and Republicans, because who the hell is going to push back against the notion that our country needs better infrastructure? It‚Äôs currently estimated that deteriorating infrastructure costs the US family an average of $3,400 per year, and the number is only going to continue to grow. So, the only logical explanation is to immediately spend $3,000,000,000,000 in addition to the $1,900,000,000,000 that was previously spent. In case you weren‚Äôt aware, the Biden administration has already drafted up a plan called the ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù plan and is packing it into a bazooka to blow that shit through the house and senate. Seeing how the Covid Relief bill was passed without any Republican votes or support, I don‚Äôt expect a lack of support or fiscal responsibility will stop this from passing as is.\n\nObviously even the mention of a massive infrastructure bill will add a boost to US companies involved in infrastructure, and the passage of a bill would likely spend those companies to the moon. So here are some companies and ETFs you can buy if you want to pave the way to money town with infrastructure.\n\n$PAVE ‚Äì US infrastructure ETF\n\n$CAT ‚Äì Caterpillar Inc.\n\n$UNP ‚Äì Union Pacific\n\n$DE ‚Äì John Deere\n\n$URI - United Rentals \n\nI like $PAVE for this play because their IV is low (30%) and the calls are dirt cheap.
