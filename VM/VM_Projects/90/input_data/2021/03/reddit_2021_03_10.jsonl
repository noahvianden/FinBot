Treasury yields retreated following the report. The 10-year Treasury yield is at 1.521% at the time of writing. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.46% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.59% up. After recordings its best day since April 2020, the Nasdaq fell 0.29%.\n\nThe [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future. \n\nBrian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco said of inflationary jitters: ‚Äú ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the irony that in year one of a market recovery everybody doubts it and says how can this be happening if the economy isn‚Äôt good, and then in year two everybody struggles to assess whether \\[the economy has\\] just gotten too good too fast and it‚Äôs too hot.

The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify, is expected to easily pass and be signed into law by President Biden in the coming days.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Crazy action in Gamestop (GME) again with the stock peaking at around 40% up before quickly dropping back down. Price action in GME is unlike anything we have ever seen.\n* General Electric (GE) announced a reverse 1-8 split, meaning that every 8 shares of GE will be converted to 1 share worth roughly $112 given the current $14 stock price. The reason is too lower the float of GE to be more comparable with industry peers.\n* The National Hockey League and Walt Disney (DIS) have agreed to a seven-year TV, streaming and media rights deal that will bring games to ABC, ESPN and streaming platforms, the two organizations said on Wednesday.\n* Roblox (RBLX) makes a strong trading debut, rising around 54%.\n* Today, it was announced ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK)  added 949,200 shares of DraftKings to the ETF, bringing its holdings to about 1.7 million shares.\n* **\\*Please note current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday movement.**\n* BridgeBio Pharma (BBIO) target raised by Mizuho from $56 to $86 at Buy.
