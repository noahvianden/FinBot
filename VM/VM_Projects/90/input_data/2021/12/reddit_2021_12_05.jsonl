{"title": "Expected Moves this week: SPY, QQQ, IWM, BTC, GME, LULU, and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week down about half a percent (or $2). That was well inside the 2.4% (or $11) options were pricing for the week. However, SPY traded in a $15 range and was higher by about $10 and lower by about $5 during the week. Implied volatility was higher on the week with the VIX closing on Friday above 30.\n\n**This Week – SPY** options are again pricing about a 2.4% move (about $11 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY 453.50 that is a range of about 442.50 to 464.50.\n\n**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 30.50, up from around 28 to start the week. That means expected moves are large (historically) in all the market ETFs, particularly the QQQ and IWM:\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (Via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **2.4%** (about $11)\n* QQQ **2.9%** (about $11)\n* IWM **4.1%** (about $9)\n* DIA **2.5%** (about $9)\n\nIf the market were to find footing implied volatility could quickly contract, although on some of the higher moves last week volatility stayed bid, as expectations for short-term swings remained high. The VIX is now in backwardation, meaning front month volatility is now slightly higher than outer months. But even outer months are historically high.\n\nFor example: December VIX futures are around 28.50, while Jan and Feb are near 28. May is around 27.50.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nCryptocurrencies sold off over the weekend, particularly **Bitcoin** which is down nearly 30% in the past month. BTC options are pricing about an 8% move for this week and about a 16% into year end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nWith market implied volatility high, expected moves for earnings need to price the event itself but also the moves of the market in the days up to and after the earnings itself. In other words, when the VIX is 14 an expected move for earnings is almost entirely made up the event move expectations, when the VIX is 30, it needs to also account for a market that is expected to move by itself.\n\nThe *expected moves* link to the Options AI Calendar. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the prior quarter.\n\n*Monday*\n\n**Coupa** COUP / [Expected Move: **10.6%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/COUP) / Recent moves: -4%, -8%, -5%\n\n**MongoDB** MDB / [Expected Move: **13.1%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/MDB) / Recent moves: +26%, +16%, -6%\n\n*Wednesday*\n\n**Gamestop** GME / [Expected Move: **14.4%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/GME) / Recent moves: 0%, -27%, -34%\n\n*Thursday*\n\n**LuluLemon** LULU / [Expected Move: **7.9%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/LULU) / Recent moves: +10%, +4%, -3%\n\n**Chewy** CHWY / [Expected Move: **13.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/CHWY) / Recent moves: -9%, -6%, +5%\n\n**Costco** COST / [Expected Move: **3.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/COST) / Recent moves: +1%, -2%, -1%\n\n**Broadcom** AVGO / [Expected Move: **3.9%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/AVGO) / Recent moves: +1%, +2%, +1%\n\n**Oracle** ORCL / [Expected Move: **5.6%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ORCL) / Recent moves: -3%, -6%, -7%", "id": "r9o6a1", "created_utc": 1638735005.0, "score": 335, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for this.

However, LULU, is one of those consumer/retail companies that have a almost cult like following with them. And for good reason,  they make great clothes and the girls butts look nice in em. Lol. \n\nNow for the DD... Q3 was the beginning of the holiday shopping rush which likely included strong sales and earnings growth as shoppers enthusiastically visited Lululemon's stores and e-commerce sites. Management also might have positive comments to make about the crucial fourth quarter that began in November.\n\nRevenue gains are expected to slow to roughly 30% in the third quarter compared to 61% last quarter. But zoom out, and the growth picture looks much brighter. Lululemon said back in September that two-year sales trends, which smooth out the impact of store closures in early 2020, are up 28% compared to about 19% before the pandemic struck. \n\nAs for profit margin outlook...\nProfitability might suffer as Lululemon pays more for transportation and splurges on air freight over traditional shipping options. Meanwhile, the growth picture would be harmed if management can't secure enough of the right kind of inventory, both online and in stores.\n\nStumbles in these areas would show up most clearly in gross profit margin. Investors will be watching to see whether that metric falls from the multiyear high it set of 58% of sales last quarter. Operating margin was an industry-trouncing 20% of sales, too, and might take a small step backward due to supply chain issues.\n\nQ4 outlook:\nHeading into Thursday's announcement, management is targeting fiscal 2021 sales of between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion. That forecast stood at $5.9 billion earlier in the year, and shareholders are hoping to see another forecast upgrade this week. The earnings picture could also shift, with annual profits currently set to jump to between $7.38 and $7.48 per share.\nBoth those sales and profit figures are much higher than Lululemon was achieving in 2019, when its annual sales footprint was $4.4 billion. Coming out of the pandemic slump just two years later, investors are looking for yearly sales to soar past $6 billion.\n\nThere's lots of room to build on that number, too, as the chain pushes into new geographies and attacks attractive clothing niches like outerwear and menswear. Its product innovations will be crucial to achieving those growth goals.\n But the good news is that the chain is on pace to end 2021 with a huge base of engaged shoppers, who seem eager to support the brand as it branches out into more segments within the athleisure industry.\n\n🙌🙌", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "What do you think about chewy?

{"title": "Understanding Monetary Policy and It’s Relationship with Stock Prices", "selftext": "Many of you just took significant losses in your portfolio over these last 3 weeks (some all year), and sadly there is more to come. What is driving this sell off? A change in monetary policy. \n\nScrolling through the daily chat I often find people discussing QE, even though few understand it. QE stands for quantitative easing and was first introduced in the US by Fed Chair Ben Bernanke as a response to the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). QE(1) started in March 2009 and lasted til March 2010. The purpose of QE was to raise asset prices. During the GFC (2007-2008) many assets lost significant value. Included in these assets were homes, stocks, and bonds. These same assets were used as collateral in the financial system. By raising asset prices, the Fed and Treasury (these two are not independent) believed many banks could avoid margin calls, margin calls that banks couldn’t afford and would result in the fire-sale of the collateral at market price. \n\nThis does not mean QE serves only a singular role. QE is now used to inflate asset prices (triggering the famous wealth effect), monetize deficits, lower interest rates, and increase employment. The Fed is currently tapering our 4th round of QE, which has resulted in the Fed having a balance sheet of just under 9T. This balance sheet is often referenced when you hear people say the Fed prints money. MMTers claim this money is “bank reserves”. \n\nThe Fed and the Treasury are addicted to QE. We are only stopping QE temporarily as a way to control inflation. Inflation was never transitory and will continue well into 2023 (I will make another post about this). QE5 will be here in another year or two, and I suspect it will be at least 160B. Red or blue, the Federal Government loves to spend money it doesn’t have. This is where QE comes in and monetizes the deficits. \n\nI have been cash gang for months and am buying beaten down stocks. There are still many bubbles left to pop. \n\nTdlr: QE enacted by the Fed raised asset prices to bubble levels. Smart investors have sold and are waiting for stocks to fall before buying back in as the Fed tapers.
