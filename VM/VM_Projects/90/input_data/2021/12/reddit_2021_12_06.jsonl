It has the use in how you used it and it has the use that is common in the United States which has more negative connotations. I agreed your definition was technically valid.

What I did was used the same logic and applied them to your own statements in order to point out the contradiction. I was not saying that I personally think you are being emotional.

I attempted to give you the most charitable interpretation as that is a practice that I always try to maintain in the hopes that others will do the same for me.  I interpreted it in a way that made the most sense. If that is not how you meant it then that is fine but your attempt to frame it as some mental failing is….I dont even know what to call it. Silly? It’s hard to take that logic very seriously honestly. Theres a whole lot of reaching going on here. At no point did I not interpret you as an individual person.
