Probably 65-70 delta ones.  IV is a little high now, at least it was a few weeks ago.  Shouldn’t ideally pay more than 15% IV and it was 23% a week or two ago.  Then again…SPY was down 20 pts so you were getting it at a discount.  So either you get SPY leaps when it’s down and pay more in IV, or get SPY when it’s up and pay less in IV.  I did a calculation once and the break even tends to be about the same or within 1-2% overall.\n\nI would probably buy 2 year Leaps, and take profit if the option doubles, and maybe occasionally sell calls against (but not regularly!!!! only when it’s optimal) to make a little more against it.  \n\nYou get some good leverage on SPY.  The Jan 23 450 call strike sells for about 50.  If you bought 100 shares of SPY now it would cost you $47,000, and if you bought the call options you can buy 9 and have the same notional value.  9x50x100 = $45,000.  That’s pretty good!  9:1 leverage.

It's good to know that the breakeven prices are similar. Also, SPY 01/23 450 Calls look good. 500 is a seriously good breakeven price. I will take a closer look at other strike prices to make the decision. Thanks!", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why not sell calls against it regularly, but at a very high strike?", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "    Shouldnt ideally pay more than 15% IV \n\nCan you elaborate on this a bit? Do you mean you shouldnt buy leaps with more than 15% IV? And what effect would it have on leaps, would it have to do with a gamma crush or whatever its referred to as? \n\nWas considering leaps as well but not having a ton of expendable funds to lock up for too long, not sure that I could manage it.\n\nHow long do you normally hold leaps and what is the end game usually when buying leaps? Buy the shares, sell for profit (curious more so on when to take profit on leaps), and what is the benefit of leaps compared to buying 0DTE/weekly/or monthly calls, I would assume mostly just having more time and not so much Theta, but wouldnt you still get crushed on Theta if the price of the underlying didnt surpass your breakeven by a lot?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The 15% IV is just for SPY.  SPY usually has low IV.  It's fairly predictable.  Not a lot of risk trading options on SPY.  That's why the IV is low.  While 23% IV is low for just about any stock, it's high for SPY.\n\nWith respect to how long to hold the LEAPs for...you should come up with a target profit %.  Basically...with SPY at 470...if you think SPY will go up 20% in 2 years, from 470 that would put SPY at 564.  That would make the value of the 450 strike LEAP be worth 114.  One would pay about 50 for that LEAP.  So that would imply more than a 100% gain on the LEAP.  So I would consider STC or perhaps rolling the LEAP to a new strike to take in gains once you hit 100% profit.\n\nSo if SPY goes up 20% in 2 years, it is reasonable to think that a Jan 23 450.00 strike call bought now for 50 would more than double in value.  \n\nNote that if you want to be more conservative, you buy a deeper ITM call option.  Say a 400 strike call (cost about 87), or a 350 strike call (costs about 128).  Both of these are quite liquid and have over a 1000 OI.  Of course you can't buy as many, but you have more downside protection.  The 350 strike call basically has a delta of 100.  A more risky options play would be to buy an OTM strike call like 500.  That costs about 20.  So the break even is 520.  If SPY goes up 20% from today's price to 564, that call option will be worth 64.  Given you paid 20 for it, you will have tripled your money.  But of course if there's a market correction and SPY is flat, you will lose all your money. \n\nI personally wouldn't write weekly or even 0DTE options on SPY.  I don't want to bother.  That's tons of work.  I don't have the time to sit around the computer and monitor market conditions on a day to day basis.  You could make more but it's so much more work.

Forecasting that far out is simply impossible to do with any degree of accuracy. He might be off by a factor of 10 in either direction.\n\nFor example, just looking at robotaxi, you can look at the total number of vehicle miles traveled in a year (in the US it's about 3 trillion miles per year). Assume that worldwide by 2030 the total is closer to 10 trillion (probably a low number) and Tesla manages to be the only viable transportation-as-a-service company at that time so it's able to capture 30% of those miles at a rate of $0.50/mile income to Tesla (after a split with the owners of the vehicles). In case you're wondering, a fleet of 50 million robotaxis could cover 3 trillion passenger miles pretty easily. That all amounts to $1.5T in income just from the robotaxi fleet. Even assuming only 10% market share gets you $500B in income. This is from ONE product line.\n\nThe numbers can get huge very easily.\n\nThe key point to me is that if Tesla becomes a leader in autonomy, it could easily be earning trillions in profit per year. If not, merely hundreds of billions. All the specifics between here and there are guesswork. If Tesla executes as planned it'll be worth $10T. If it' pulls off autonomy in a big way on top of that, it could be closer to $100T.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely, definitely agree that there is very little certainty in his analysis.
