{"title": "Lightbulb Moment on TSLA CSPs", "selftext": "I was reading the post about favorite stocks to write weekly CSPs on. Seems like a lot of people love Tesla for this. Personally, due to its cost I have never considered it. But I looked at the premiums and they‚Äôre pretty amazing for a weekly contract. With a 200K account you could do three contracts at a strike price $100 less than the trading price and the premium would average about 5.50. That‚Äôs $1650 a week or close to $87K a year. Of course, there is loads of risk due to a lack of diversification and also due to Tesla‚Äôs ability to make huge moves. But with a buffer of 100 points you would have some warning if it started to dive which would allow you to roll a contract or cover it yourself. \n\nJust wondering everybody‚Äôs thoughts on this. Currently, I‚Äôm trading with a 200K account juggling CSPs and CC‚Äôs on a bunch of different stocks and ETFs. It requires pretty much full-time management the way I‚Äôm doing it. This TSLA CSP idea seems like an easy way to make great premiums/income on a fairly regular basis. I‚Äôve been trading successfully for a living now for about two years. My income has been consistent with effort but I‚Äôm not a gambler, so maybe this idea with Tesla is too much. I would love your input. Anyone else trading a bunch of weekly contracts on TSLA? \n\nSorry if this is just a dumb, naive post.

With a $200k account, you can buy 3 of these Call Options using only about 60% of that money (+/- $120k). You can then sell the weekly Covered Call against it at a strike price of $800 which pays around $9 (300 x $9 = $2700).\n\nIf price goes up and you get assigned, then you keep the $9 plus the $5 difference between breakeven and strike price, so roughly $4,200...¬† not bad for a week's work, and you can start it all over again next week.\n\nIf price does go down, you keep the $9 and then look for another lower strike price where you can still at least break even overall. Name of the game is stay alive to trade another day, but even selling the Covered Call options that are a whole standard deviation OTM would still pay around $2, so there's still money to be made while you wait for it to recover. Plus, since you didn't use your entire account for these plays you'd theoretically still have about $80k to average down on your original Call Options.\n\nIn terms of time, like someone else said in another comment, I just adjust the position every Friday, and it doesn't take more than an hour tops to do the research and execute the orders.\n\nAgain, I'm very new to this, but I'm also slowly transitioning to make it my full time job.

Can only sell one contract with decent headroom for maintenance margin. \n\nCould sell 2 before but they have adjusted margins recently and it is a bit too tight. I do however buy a put to lower the maintenance margin and sell additional put these days.
