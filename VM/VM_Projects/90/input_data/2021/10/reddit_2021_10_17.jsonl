{"title": "TSLA to offer disruptive insurance product", "selftext": "Christ, I wrote a wall of text.  TL;DR:  TSLA Insurance is a big bullish pitch for TSLA, get in now.\n\nHinted at in a [tweet from Sep 19](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1439787653394747395) and this article about the [full self-driving feature](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/other/tesla-owners-to-soon-gain-full-self-driving-access-at-the-touch-of-a-button-prompting-criticism-from-regulators-and-safety-advocates/ar-AAONcOv).\n\nIn order to opt in to FSD, Tesla owners must consent to having data about their driving beamed back to the mothership.  Currently [TSLA uses 5 factors to rate a driver with a safety score](https://electrek.co/2021/10/14/tesla-officially-launches-insurance-using-real-time-driving-behavior-texas/):\n\n* Forward Collision Warnings per 1,000 Miles\n* Hard Braking\n* Aggressive Turning\n* Unsafe following distance\n* Forced Autopilot disengagement\n\nMakes sense, doesn't it?  The article links some sample insurance rates.  Safer drivers would be getting a substantial discount from their GEICO rate (the *de facto* industry standard); unsafe drivers might pay double. \n\nHere's why this is disruptive and interesting:\n\n**Car (and other) insurance made Warren Buffett his pile.**  In case you don't know, Berkshire Hathaway's core business is insurance, not just GEICO but General Re.  The investible idea is 'float' - insurance premiums are paid immediately, claims are paid later.  The result is that insurance companies at any given time hold a huge pile of cash money, some or all of which eventually must be paid out as claims, but which meanwhile can be invested for profit.  Musk has shown he's not afraid to invest Tesla's working cash aggressively - he gets it, his prior business Paypal was also a float business - and so a source of free float would presumably be quite valuable in his hands.\n\n**TSLA can rate better.**  Insurers have traditionally relied on 'the demos' - age, gender, occupation, income, education level, how much alcohol you buy monthly at the grocery store - all information that is available to them - in order to determine your premium.  It makes some sense, older people *on average* crash more than middle-aged because their senses and reflexes are failing, yet younger people *on average* crash the most because they are stupid and reckless and have higher risk tolerance.\n\nBut in those groups there will be some older and younger drivers who are a better risk and some middle-aged persons who are worse.  What better way of predicting how good you are at driving a car, than by analyzing how good you are at driving a car?  This gives TSLA a disruptive competitive edge over other insurers.  Most competitive edges are one-way - A does something more profitably than B, A skims the extra net profit that B can't capture.  But this is a two-way edge - TSLA skims off only the more profitable customers, shunting the less-profitable or even loss-creating clients to Geico, which is a one-two punch - TSLA Insurance wins, BRK/Geico at the same time takes a hit as its driver pool becomes composed of shittier drivers, causing their rates to go up and making TSLA Insurance even more competitive for the customers it seeks.\n\n**This burnishes TSLA's rep/image/PR/perception.**  For decades it's been the same: you want a safe car and cheaper insurance?  Buy a Volvo.  At this point Volvos are no more or less safe than other cars on the market - the era when Volvo had a 10-year head start on safety features is long past - but Volvos continue to have fewer accidents *because people interested in safety continue to buy Volvos.*  TSLA has an opportunity here to grab that PR crown and they are going to take it.  I don't blame them - seems like every time a Tesla crashed in the last 5 years it's made the news - and the availability of TSLA-specific insurance will attract a certain kind of buyer, the kind of buyer any car company would want buying their car.  And in fact, being surveilled continuously will probably actually make most TSLA drivers safer drivers, so it won't just be smoke and mirrors - it'll be true.\n\n**They have a captive audience**.  GEICO spends a hell of a lot of money on advertising - you know who they are and you know their mascot, don't you?  TSLA won't have to bother - they know exactly whom they're after and they have a channel to reach them without spending any ad dollars.  They can even restrict their promotions to the viewscreens in the cars with the best drivers, if they choose.  TSLA has already sold 1 million vehicles and they show no signs of slowing down - they literally make the market for this product.  $120 a month on a million vehicles is $1.44 billion in float every year, by the way - it'd be worth doing even if they eventually paid out $1.44 billion in claims.  And their addressable market will only grow.\n\nApologies if you read all this and already knew about it - I haven't been hearing much about it, thought it deserved a wider distribution.

Ultimately it will be interesting to see what happens with insurance. No doubt they can create a insurance business. I think that much is obvious.

But companies can do similar things with just a data plug in.\n\nBut their FSD will be interesting to see develop too. But... regulators definitely have their eyes on it.

People: \"TSLA is a car company, the next 20 years of car sales are priced in already.\"  Yes.  No one who can do simple arithmetic would dispute it.  That's why a totally different and novel revenue line, not traditionally associated to car companies, and with a baked-in competitive advantage (and even a moat - no other company can insure Teslas like Tesla can), would be of interest to anyone who pays attention to TSLA valuation.\n\n>We don't know yet whether (FSD) can be to level 4/5 standards of driving.\n\nI just spent a week dodging Waymo-equipped Jag SUVs in San Francisco.  The tech works, maybe not perfectly but from what I saw, far better than the human drivers around it.  \n\nIn general, this bet: \"This technology, which already exists, may not be ready for prime-time\" is a dangerous bet, and doesn't make you any money if you win it.  I prefer to bet the inverse any time I am given an opportunity.  \n\nFor instance, I started with AAPL in 1981, bought my first AMZN share in 1999.  I recall explaining to a co-worker that the model wasn't just books - they sell CDs now too - and he cut me off with a withering glare and a patronizing comment before I could explain the rest, which was that any model that could sell books and CDs too, could just as easily sell a wide variety of retail goods, maybe *all* the goods.\n\nThat guy?

Cause if you did you awesome. Hope you bought again when it dipped over 95%. Also apple and amazon didn't have major valuation stretches until the dot com bubbles like we are seeing now with Tesla. Funny enough Michael Burry bought Apple before the dot com bubble as he saw it as a solid value bet. A Warren Buffet stock he called it.\n\nLook obviously you did well with Apple and Amazon. But we are talking about Tesla right now.\n\nLook they kind of already priced in as well for a lot of this new disruptive stuff. I mean if they were just a car company... they would probably worth just a third of todays value in a really high valuation then.\n\nI just think you reach a price where the risks out weigh the reward. Yet they have been growing like crazy, but as they branch out into other ventures, we aren't sure they will succeed into it. And a lot of them they don't have first mover advantage anymore. Solar, battery storage, pickup trucks, self-driving, they all face a land field of competition. They are already falling behind on their Cyber Truck.\n\nAll the OG manufacturers aren't going to stand around like red box, Nokia, and block buster. They will adapt, because they have to. They have seen what new tech has done to older businesses. Plus you have startups getting into the game, whether its developing batteries, making new vehicles, or self driving semis, its a huge amount of resources being poured into this.\n\nBut I do think insurance, if done right, could be big for them. But exactly how much value would it add? You just said it could be big, but never really crunched the numbers. You said 1.44 billion in float, but how would they actually make if they insured certain percentages of their vehicles. That's what I really want to see.\n\nNot to mention macro economics, but that's another story.\n\nBut let me be clear, I think you are right in terms that insurance could be big for them and needs to be accounted for. I just think ultimately they will face competition in the insurance field, even with their own cars.  And I don't know how much their stock has priced into that. I want you to tell me how much money they could make from it.\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: Amazon never did get that high. I thought it did. But buying in 1999 depends on a lot of things. I mean if you bought all the way down... cool. But odds are you would've had abyssal returns for the next few years.

Amazon's price to sales when I bought my first 100 shares was 385, just as a point of reference - they had a negative P/E until very recently - and that and other valuation metrics scared me off buying more until 2011, although I never sold that original stake.  If I learned anything, it's that traditional valuation metrics simply don't matter when a company proves it can disrupt.  And they really don't matter even and especially when \"the thought of buying a share at this inflated value after a big run\" makes your nutsack shrivel up.\n\nIf Tesla can get to 100 million cars on the road worldwide in the next 20 years, insure only the top 30 million of those drivers, roll with $50 billion of float?  They'll be putting up BRK numbers.  Warren can make 20% a year on average on his sizable float when he bothers to invest it; if Elon can do even 8% that's $4 billion of *extra* FCF per year, about how much the $80B WarnerMedia acquisition was *supposed* to accrete to T's bottom line.  From this I hypothesize that it's worth about an extra $80B in market cap.  And those are very conservative numbers, you get an extra billion a year if TSLA only decides to insure the top 40% instead of 30% of its drivers.  And that's assuming break-even on underwriting, which is a shitty assumption at that scale; BRK keeps about 20% of its float year in and year out as underwriting gains, and so that's another $6 B for $10 B of extra annual revenue by 2040, which is worth an additional $200B of market cap.\n\nThere's a reason Ajit Jain's special talent with underwriting didn't get chosen to head BRK after Warren kicks it, by the way.

Even at well over 1M Teslas on the road, it's a fraction of a percent at best of the 1st world fleet.\n\nWhile they are experiencing tremendous growth, they are still at a fraction of non-Teslas made globally. So my point is that the market for Tesla insurance is niche at best. Where it will be in the future it TBD. Also, I'd like to note that almost all insurance companies now offer telematics based insurance. Nationwide has been able to pull data directly from select GM cars for a few years now. Not all telematics is the same and I do agree that Tesla has more granular data than anyone else.\n\nSource: Licensed P&C broker by trade.\n\nEdit: I'd like to add the average premium I write on a Tesla driver with a clean driving record is +/- $100/month in major Texas cities.
