But VR is like stepping into the internet, and can open up whole new experiences and market opportunities. Even if they don't control the actual servers or spaces you go to, if they keep control of the headsets and continue to force a Facebook login to use the headset then they will know exactly what you're looking at (and possibly thinking) and will have the most valuable data possible to sell to advertisers. \n\nI really hope they get broken up or some other company competes with their headset for a similar cost.
