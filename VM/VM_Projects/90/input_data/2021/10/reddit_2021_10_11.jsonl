If the Republicans gain seats and put a stop to the unilateral power of the Democrats then we may well see an orchestrated attempt to crash the economy heading towards the next election 2024 so the Republicans can come out of the other side blaming the Democrats. We'll see. But I don't think the plug is due to be pulled anytime soon.\n\nThen with Tesla. I've always thought the PE was far too high, the margins in the car industry are tight. They've got some first mover advantages and are scaling rapidly. My issue is they don't own the IP for battery tech, and they've said they want to jettison Panasonic, however Panasonic are collab with Toyota and there is likely to be a solid state battery soon... that could really put the brakes on Tesla because Toyota/Panasonic will own the new IP and Tesla has been rapidly scaling which exposes it... who wants a Lith iron old tech vehicle when you can get a better battery car from Toyota. Too much bravado from Tesla. \n\nHowever, Tesla has huge value in its brand now, it really can do a Apple type branding on all sorts of Tech. Everything from Vacuum cleaners through to phones etc. I think Tesla can beat Apple.\n\nSo, to me the milestone breakpoint is if Tesla can survive the switch to better battery tech and the next economic crash (As I think they're putting it all on the line expanding so quickly).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This agreed with a million percent.\nA short or put may be the yolo play that this should be.
