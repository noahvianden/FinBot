{"title": "Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 9 - Understanding and Trading Skew", "selftext": "# This post explains what skew is and gives 2 examples of how to trade it. \n\n# If you understand skew it will help you understand why options are being priced the way they are. \n\nIt opens many doors for trading opportunities.\n\nSkew is used to infer the implied distribution of the stock in the future. One thing to remember is that options are based on the future distribution of a stock. \n\n# Before we jump into it.. we first we need to understand some of the basics. \n\n**Take a look at the Graph below**. \n\nIt is a chart that shows how often different returns happen for a stock. What do we notice about it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[X axis is daily returns for a stock. Y axis is how frequently that daily return occurs.](https://preview.redd.it/kttyf87qcfu71.png?width=536&format=png&auto=webp&s=70ee691eac662d2709a514fe8dff94eedccc6bab)\n\nWe can see that the *most frequent* return is 0%, and the likelihood of a big move up **or** down is even (same frequency of a 5% up move vs a 5% down move). We call this a \"normal distribution\".\n\nIf we looked at a stocks returns over the last year and saw that it was normally distributed, what conclusions could we draw? Well, we could say that :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Most of the time the stock will move about 0%\n2. There is an equal chance of a large up move and a large down move\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEasy right? But here's the thing..\n\n# Stock returns do not typically look like this. \n\nYou ever hear the saying: \"***Stocks go up like an escalator, and down like an elevator****?*\"\n\nI'm sure most of us have heard that one before. What is this telling us? It tells us that stocks tend to go up slowly, and then crash down quickly.\n\nOR...\n\n***Most of the time, we see a small move up in stocks. Occasionally, we see a large move down.***\n\nBecause of this, the distribution of a stocks returns aren't typically normally distributed. The look more like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[X axis is daily returns for a stock. Y axis is how frequently that daily return occurs.](https://preview.redd.it/fouttvv0dfu71.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9c73eec534f093e7a6f55a1c6f8be3e4539859b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can see on the graph above that most of the time we have frequent small up moves,  and infrequent large down moves. The top of the line is slightly to the right of 0, and the left side of the graph is a bit more elevated than the right side. \n\nSince this is how a typical stocks returns look, what conclusions can we draw?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The most frequent daily return for a stock is a small up move. \n2. Big down moves happen with more frequency than a big up move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**As we can see, the distribution is** ***skewed.***\n\nA skew in a distribution is when one of the tails is longer than the other. If we look at graph above we can see that the tail on the left is skewed. This is known as a negative skew since it has a long tail in the negative direction. \n\nIf the big positive moves had more frequency than the big negative moves, we would call it a positive skew.\n\n# An interesting question..\n\n*Given this is the typical distribution for a stock returns, and knowing that options are used to make a bet on the future volatility of a stock, how would we expect options to be priced, puts vs calls?* \n\n(Remember, options try to price the future distribution for a stocks returns).\n\n# An even more interesting answer..\n\n*We would expect to see puts more expensive than the calls on equities because* ***the risk is to the downside****.* \n\nLet's break this down. \n\nSkew is the difference in implied volatilities between the out of the money puts relative to the out of the money calls. **It shows us where the demand/supply is located on the chain.** \n\nFor example:\n\nOn a $90 stock you might see something like the $100 call is trading at 40% but the $80 put is trading 60%. \n\nWhat this is telling us is that the *put options are more expensive than the call options*. \n\n**Most people who are long equity look to hedge their exposure to a crash by buying puts, so you would typically see high demand for puts with relatively low supply.** \n\n# This makes sense right? Let's think about the S&P500 options for a second. \n\nThe whole world is basically long equity. So where do they go to hedge? Typically Pension funds and the like will be buying puts or writing calls on something like the S&P500. This creates huge demand on the put side, and lots of supply on the call side. \n\nThe odds are we have small moves upwards, but if there’s going to be a blowout, it will likely be to the downside. Protection, or exposure to that, costs money!\n\n# This difference in price for calls and puts is what we call skew.\n\nLooking at the skew tells us 2 main things\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. What direction the market thinks the most likely move is\n2. What direction the market thinks the big move risk is\n\nThe key word here is that skew tells us the ***market implied*** likelihood of different moves.\n\nThis is important to note because the way we make big bucks as traders is by identifying areas we disagree with the market and trading them accordingly.\n\nIt is important to understand what the market thinks is going to happen so you can compare that with your view on the market. \n\n# Let's pull up the skew for SPY so we can see what it actually looks like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Skew for SPY 19\\/10\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/zoyl48bqtfu71.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dbcd190e020957a89e2e155467544c115f0a7a4)\n\nBasically, on the X axis we have the call deltas, and on the Y axis we have implied volatility. \n\nor in simpler terms\n\n*The left side is OTM Calls, the middle is ATM calls/puts, the right side is OTM Puts.*\n\nnote: Some softwares will plot it the other way around. \n\nBy visualizing this, we can quickly see how the different portions of the option chain are priced relative to each other. \n\nAs we can see, the OTM Puts are higher than the OTM Calls. This is what we would refer to as  \"put skew\".\n\nThis is what we would typically see for a stock. \n\nOnce again, this is because they typically make small frequent moves to the upside, and then large infrequent moves to the downside.\n\n# Does a stock's skew always look like this?\n\nThe market is alive, so things change. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Market conditions change\n* Stocks have big news releases\n* Insiders know about a buyout before it happens\n* WSB tries to squeeze a stock\n* A big court case is about to get settled\n* A new drug is awaiting approval for a pharmaceutical company\n\n# Depending on how different variables in the market change, the skew changes to reflect what the market expects to happen in the future. \n\nIf a stock gets squeezed and jumps up 100%, what is the skew most likely to look like? \n\nWe can take a guess by answering the following two questions:\n\n1. What is the most likely move in the future?\n2. Where is the risk in the future?\n\nIn the case of these meme stocks that get squeezed, the most likely thing to happen is that it moves down a bit. The **risk** is that it keeps moving up by a huge amount. So the skew might look something like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMC 30DTE Skew 03\\/03\\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/i0x4k6g0xfu71.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=c228c5a61658cf727ce465f47d8b364406833faf)\n\nAs you can see, on AMC, the skew was heavily to the call side! But is it always like this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Green line is AMC 30dte skew in November 2020. Blue line is AMC 30dte Skew in March 2021](https://preview.redd.it/kcumzu8gxfu71.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd005f9c8694088c96325731acefe3f5622bf438)\n\nHere is a prime example of the skew changing! Before the whole meme stock craze, AMC had a lot of put skew. This makes sense, because the *risk* was that the stock would go down a lot. \n\nBut after it started squeezing, things changed.  The risk was now that it moons! So the options market changed to reflect this. \n\n**The OTM Calls went from being cheaper than the OTM puts, to being more expensive!**\n\n# Over time, the skew changes to reflect the market's view of what could happen to a stock between now and the expiration you are looking at.\n\nYep, each expiration has it's own skew. This is because we are looking *across the strikes, and every expiration has its own strikes!* I know, it can be a bit confusing.. but once you wrap your head around the concept of skew you will be able to understand the market a whole lot better. \n\n# How can we take advantage of the skew? \n\nThere are so many different ways to trade the skew. Risk reversals, spreads, selling or buying options.. \n\nIn short, we can trade the skew when we disagree with it.\n\nHere are 2 example of how we can trade the skew (there are more, but here's two):\n\n# 1) We can trade a change in the skew\n\nHere is a time series of the 30 day skew for TSLA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TSLA 30dte skew over last 30 days. the higher the number, the more put skew. The lower the number, the more call skew. 0 would be flat skew.](https://preview.redd.it/ksluqgzwfgu71.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1e8d9d670af85cbffc944207b95076434cb8928)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat can we see? We can see that TSLA put skew got REALLY steep last week. The highest it's been in 2 years. We could have taken a trade here that bet on it coming back down to a more typical level. \n\nThe optimal trade here would have been a **risk reversal**, since it would have made money on the skew coming back down AND on the positive deltas!\n\n# How to find trades like this: \n\nThe first thing you will want to do is scan for stocks that have elevated skew. You can use filters like Skew Rank (It's like IV rank, but for skew) or just \"Skew\".\n\nThen I will look at the skew time series (like the picture above) and use that to help me gauge what the change has been relative to what we see in the past. \n\nFrom there, I will look at the skew for different expirations to see where it is most out of line. \n\nOnce you have found a stock where the skew has changed drastically (to the upside or the downside), the second thing you do is ask yourself the question: **why is it happening?**\n\nIf we can understand why, we can then determine the *rationality* behind it. Are people overly hyped about something? Is there too much fear right now? \n\nIf we think the market is overreacting to something (or under reacting), we can put on a trade like this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2) We can take advantage of the skew to get a high R:R trade\n\nSomething I like to do is trade unbalanced flys into steep call skew. It's basically the best lotto tickets you can get in the market.\n\n**Check this out:**\n\nI did a scan today for stocks with expensive call skew. COIN came up on my radar. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgqecqodcgu71.png?width=1966&format=png&auto=webp&s=6961bd31ca032a679eb6b2e78fcff6d889bec569\n\nHere's what I saw:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Relative to historic skew, it is now the most skewed to the call side that it has ever been!](https://preview.redd.it/pholjik88gu71.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=332efa99760705008c98f5e38e4fe0a656876c2e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Looking at a few different expirations, it seems the skew is steepest in the near dated options \\(green line\\).](https://preview.redd.it/y4gjejlscgu71.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=153c248fae06db969afa5f7590807646449dde4a)\n\nCOIN skew is at the highest call skew it has seen!\n\nThis is pretty crazy, the market is pricing in a lot of risk to the upside here.\n\nNow let's say I am bullish on COIN. I think it will rally another 5% in the coming week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3oidaexc8gu71.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&s=0447f3005107637ead3a895cb4e940a1accd37c0\n\nWhat we did here was trade a 1-3-2 fly *into* the call skew. \n\n**We are paying $65 per fly, with a max payout of $935 each!**\n\nWe bought a call at-the-money, and financed it by selling 3 out-the-money calls! We then went even further out and bought 2 as a hedge, giving us this nice risk defined trade. \n\nThese are my favourite little YOLOs. Low risk, super high reward. \n\nI like to do them around earnings especially, and sometimes you can find wild trades like this one!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSkew just shows us the balance in supply/demand for calls and puts. Are people more hungry for calls? Or more hungry for puts? \n\nWhen we can understand this, a lot of doors open. But remember this: Knowing skew isn't an edge. It's just a feature of the options market that we need to understand if we want to be able to understand what we are seeing and create better ideas of our own. \n\n# Skew helps us see what is actually happening.

Do you or /u/tutoredstatue95 have any tips for doing flys?  I have recently started looking into them and really like the idea of them for my meager account.

I understand it's probably best to start out with an ATM or even ITM initial call now that I have read more about it, but it just seems like even though AMC spiked about 10% after I got in the position, all my position did was stay flat.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for better understanding how to pick strikes for flys that are not basically neutral moves?

Seeing early red on flies isn't uncommon, I'd say it's 50/50 for me.  Short term vol and direction are very hard to predict, so its better to go for a mid term trend or longer when starting out.  \n\nAMC, GME, etc. are very hard to trade flies on in my experience with how I trade them.  I'm sure someone has a successful strategy with the super high IV stocks, but they move too much and too fast.  I've found a little success with super short term and wide flies before, but I stopped doing those as it turned out way too risky for me.  Maybe pick a high IV, but not one of the highest IV stock to start.\n\nIf you want to get directional, try targeting your short body strikes around the .4  delta and then build your longs around that.  Normally, a directional fly will look like .7 long, .4 short, and then a .5/.6 long again.  Keeping the near wing close to or in the money is usually a good place to start.\n\nYou're goal should be to have the underlying stay within the strikes for as long as possible (or move into and stay).  Inside the body is where the theta and negative vega will really pay off.  Those Greeks don't really give you any value outside until you get the necessary delta move.  Try taking the opposite approach to your TA and find the range you want the stock to stay and not target a specific move.  If you have a directional bias, go slightly OTM and aim for total position 10-20 delta.\n\nThey key to a successful strategy with these is risk/reward on entry and setting yourself up to capitalize on a reduction in volatility.  The directional component is more of an added bonus.  I tend to look at my delta/gamma as the gas in the tank of my trade.  \n\nIf you still aren't a getting the results you want, you could look into credit spreads.  You can get way more directional with narrow credit spreads, and they'll move a bit quicker.\n\nI can't go much deeper as the topic is just too broad, but if you have any specific questions I'll do my best to answer.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That is amazing information.  Thank you for taking the time to explain this for me.  Based on what you are describing it sounds like you treat these more as a market-neutral strategy vs. a directional strategy.

So for my AMC trade, just to keep things simple, if I think $48 is the target top, I could do something like a long $40 call, short 2x $48, and then long a $55 if I wanted to keep it as balanced as the strikes will let me for Nov. 19th.  That would be just over a 1:4 risk v. reward but means that the break even is much lower.

The general conclusions and logic make sense to me, but the following quote that was repeated a couple times was very surprising to me.\n\n>\"options try to price the future distribution for a stocks return\"\n\nThis is somewhat counter to my expectations as I thought options pricing was generally based on cost to dynamically hedge (e.g. BSM models). My guess/assumption was that the typical IV skew is due the models that institutions/MMs use to price options being based on their expected costs to dynamically hedge the expected changes in the underlying prices. That is to say, the risk of a large downward move is more costly to dynamically hedge than repeated small gradual rises. So the pricing is tied to expected market moves (and their associated hedging costs), but NOT to the expected distribution of future prices of the underlying. I think drift would be a major driver of differences between the two, but there may be other sources I'm not thinking of.\n\nAm I wrong? Or are we just talking here about times where short-term supply/demand spikes overwhelm typical pricing models?

Now again…all that being said IF you have that luxury making money day in and day out being able to enter and exit at will is NOT a difficult task. Look for stocks that fluctuate by season and locate certain stocks at their lowest annually…buy…hold for 2-3 weeks or until you reach a respectable 3,5,8 or 10% profit and sell.

Once that breakout happens sell and move on bcs what goes up will come down to some degree. Set a trailing stop loss/ take profit and let the trade take its course. It will protect you and get you max. Profit if entered correctly.

Once I've hit this goal, I'll channel most, if not all of this 30% into my broker). So this is what I do for saving money. \n\nNow, diving into \"growing one's wealth through investing\"\n\nThe strategy to investing and growing one's wealth is very simple, but not everyone's willing to put in the time and effort to read each company's quarterly earnings transcript and dissect every single thing.\n\nTo find out any company's earnings transcript, Google \"(company name) investor relations\", click on quarterly reports, press releases, etc. explore and have fun! \n\nLet's use AMZN as an example. Do you follow their earnings call (EC) every quarter? Are they in talks about developing a new product/ service?\nhttps://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx\n\nLet's dial back to when they were still doing e-commerce only. Were there signs that they were considering to move into providing cloud services (i.e. AWS) from their EC?\n\nI didn't dig into AMZN's EC back into the years leading up to its launch in 2006 cuz I don't think there was motley fool or seeking alpha back then, but I might be wrong.\n2006 share price: ~$30.\nAnyway, I found this 2016 article (https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/amp/) where there were talks about launching AWS back in 2000s. Key here was to understand their objective and whether there was a market demand for the product. Those who did made big bucks.\n\nThere was also some news going on and about in 2013 (2013 share price ~$350) about how AWS would be their core business moving forward (https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/jeff-bezos-believes-aws-could-be-amazons-biggest-business/amp/). AMZN had 11x since then. Most people would start thinking: wow, is this peak performance? But no, they moved into AWS marketplace in 2012 to increase their market reach. Should've been able to find this in the ECs leading up to 2012.\n\nOther tell-tale signs could be that they are hiring aggressively (check via LinkedIn etc) - what roles are they hiring? Software engineers? What are the job descriptions? How does this match up to their growth plans as mentioned in the EC? How do they intend to use AWS as a SaaS product for its customers? How aggressive are they performing S&M from their financial statements? \n\nFast forward to the present, where AMZN's share price is roughly $3.4k, with a 2020 rev of $113b. Revenue for first 2 quarters of 2021 being $221b. What are their estimations going forward for the next 2 quarters? They've clearly made TWICE their 2020 rev within the first 6 months of 2021. Can they keep it up? What are their projections? What are they doing to reach this goal? \n\nAMZN plans to increase headcount by 150k for holiday shopping season, seems like e-commerce will most likely see a jump (https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-hire-150000-us-workers-holiday-shopping-season-2021-10-18/). FYI, they hired 100k workers for 2020 seasonal jobs. So surely this should mean something, but of course, I'd dig deeper to understand how they performed for the quarter with seasonal festivities. \n\nIn summary: follow their quarterly ECs, what are their growth plans and projections. Any new developments? Who are they hiring to front these new developments? Are these people capable and possess the relevant skill sets to execute? Did they manage to walk the talk? Was this reflected in their financial statements? The last thing you want is a fluff story and poor execution/ inability to deliver.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I see thank you for the advice.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Difficult to take money out to buy more stocks without falling into schoolboy error #1 Don’t sell your winners. Your example would be a clear cut case of Why would you sell a winning stock to try and find another winning stock? The only time you would do this 8 when you have a winning stock that is outperforming for example takeover speculation makes a stock jump 40% in a week. Then you could justify selling out for the profit. Or if you perceive a bubble you might sell and plan to rebuy later when the stock pulls back like the tech bubble/pull back earlier this year.\n\nSo as to strategy you need to think long term until you feel confident to take a more risky investment approach such as day trading. Most people should never even consider that anyway. It’s like trying to be a sports pro or famous musician, however good you are the odds are against you.\n\nLong term investing can be quite straightforward. Build a list of growth industries: electric vehicles, green energy, ai, robotics, semiconductors, online software tech, etc then build a list of to performers in each industry. Rule out any grossly overvalued companies, look for companies with a decent P/E ratio, profitable, well regarded by the various share advice firms. \n\nSetup a spreadsheet to show the result of various growth rates 5/10/15/20 % over the years between now and when you retire.\n\nDivide up your investment money and spread it between 15 - 20 stocks and watch and wait.\n\nAdd money when you can and adjust share holdings when you feel a companies situation has changed fundamentally.\n\nNever sell when the whole market is down. Don’t sell a stock that goes down if you knew it was volatile when you bought it or you still believe in its long term future.

{"title": "How to ACTUALLY play earnings", "selftext": "NEVER BUY NAKED OPTIONS ON EARNINGS PLAYS. YOU ARE ALMOST ALWAYS BETTER OFF BUYING OTM DEBIT SPREADS. \n\nFor example, lets take Tesla. I’m a bear on it and expect a 5-10% drawdown by next week. I can buy 10/22 puts. But the ATM puts go for 2000 a pop. Lets say I buy one and Tesla tanks $50 by Friday, closing at 815. I only make 3k on that trade. \n\nNow lets say I bought five dollar wide debit spreads at the 825-820 mark for that same $2000 in premium. They go for $93 a pop. If TSLA drops to 820 I make 407 dollars PER spread. \n\nDivide 2000/93 and you get 21.5 which means you can buy 21 spreads. If TSLA closes at 815, you go beyond your lower 820 strike and collect the full five dollar premium between both strikes. Instead of making 3k, you make $8200 if TSLA closes below 820 on expiry. In order to make the same amount of money from a naked option, TSLA would have to move another $50 by Friday for the same return. It’s retarded. \n\nThey also progressively get juicier the lower you go, but don’t go crazy because the options market is efficiently priced. \n\nPeople don’t realize how much money you can make on this shit and how superior it is to naked options during earnings. \n\nYou are essentially selling an option against your long option which sells back premium and reduces your volatility and theta exposure A LOT. This is CRUCIAL during earnings. \n\nI chose TSLA because it has a very big skew to the put side and the delta of the 820 strike was .25 when I bought (meaning the options market is giving it a 25% probability of being ITM by expiry. I’m getting 6-1 returns and have 1 in 4 odds so it’s a +EV play. \n\nPositions:\n\n40x TSLA 825/820 debit put spreads expiring 10/29 that cost me 3k and will net me 20k (17k + 3k in premium that I paid) on expiry if TSLA closes below $820.\n\nTSLA fanboys stay out of the comments.
