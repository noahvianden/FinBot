They get access to customers from around the country and sometimes the world. Amazon does sell some products but they compete with other businesses on their own site. Amazon takes a portion of the sale revenue in exchange for getting the product from warehouses to customers. They can also advertise for you.

It isn't just Amazon. That's just what happens when you have cheap labor and manufacturing. It isn't anything to do with Amazon but it does happen to be the case that there are lots of Chinese products. Many of them are decent quality and some aren't, but it is easy to tell the difference these days with reviews. I don't believe it is bad for American businesses. It creates opportunities for entrepeneurs to start small businesses because Amazon does things that small businesses struggle with and make scaling up easy. America hardly has any manufacturing compared to China so I don't think it is hurting American manufacturing since there isn't much to begin with. American business owners get a cut, Chinese manufacturing gets a cut, American shippers get a cut, American advertisers get a cut, and Amazon an American company gets a cut. So while China does make some money, Americans are getting most of it. And frankly it wouldn't typically be profitable to have the business at all without Chinese manufacturing. American made makes things cost 2 or 3 times the price for businesses most of the time. I seriously tried to start an Amazon business so no I haven't been brain washed.

You could in part blame our higher standard of living. Also China devalues its currency faster than we do so products from China are cheap to buy, creating a trade surplus for them. Despite all that America is still the richest country in the world, but all that money goes to the top business owners. Reaganomics is largely to blame because money doesn't just \"trickle down\" from the top.
