First thing you’ll notice is the support at $62. After breaching $62 in June, it tested that support on 10/30, 3/5, 3/24 and is very close to testing it again. It has also been consolidating (w/ very low volume) since end of February with lower and lower highs. What this tells us is there are machines or people who buy at that $62 resistance line, but not much enthusiasm to keep buying.\n\nNext, I look at what happened prior to the stock breaching $62 back in June. There was a consolidation between $43-$48 in early June. That means support at $43 and resistance at $48. After it breached $48, it freely ran up above $62. That means there are no reference points for algorithms to start buying at, so chances are they will wait for it to get back to $43-$48. Furthermore, you can look at a VolumeProfile study (on ThinkorSwim) and see there is extremely low volume between $48-60. Again, it provides no reference point to trigger algos to buy.\n\nSomething to keep in mind with chart reading.
