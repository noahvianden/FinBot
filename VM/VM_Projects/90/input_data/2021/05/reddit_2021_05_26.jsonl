Every free analyst report I could get from Fidelity.\n\nTheir BEV business is a mirage.  They are Verizon buying Yahoo,  or AOL buys Netscape for 2.3billion, then buys MapQuest.  They're all media companies, what could go wrong?\n\nIn the almost 2 years since Ford published the electric F150 pulling a train, Tesla built 2 gigafactories in Shanghai, a supercharger factory,  and they are now scaling to 500K units this year.  Expansion is underway for even more capacity (or the 25K model).\n\nNo legacy company has ever built more than 10K EV's in a month.  EVER.  Barely even breaking 10K/quarter.    Tesla scales a line to 25K per month in the first year.  10K in within 90 days.\n\nThe Mach-E is 8200 units YTD.   So what's the problem?\n\nFord has not invested 7 billion in EV tech as they claimed--unless they are very creative with the books, they have slashed Capex to the bone, cancelled the dividend and have amassed a ton of cash as a result.  Capex is 5 billion total for last year,  the lowest ever.\n\nThis massive delta in flow has driven the algo driven \"analyst reports\" green in a huge way.\n\nYahoo’s “street consensus” growth estimate is current year 139%, past 5 years: -0.69%, next year 70.40%.    These wild numbers are in the many algo written analyst reports I downloaded.    The equations they use fucking love these deltas!\n\nRead those numbers again.   Those number look legit?   How about a 5 year growth rate higher than Tesla?   That's right.  [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/analysis?p=F), boys and girls.\n\nSo what's happening?   Corporations that care about the stock price do things that make the stock price go up.  This has been Farley's job.   He is heralded as a great leader for getting Ford stock from 4 to 13, over 300% appreciation.   On paper, it's a huge success.\n\nBut the one analyst report written by actual humans?   That would be a Sell.\n\nJefferson Research:  “The ability of Ford Motor Company to earn a profit is in part the result of how rapidly it converts its collection of assets into revenues and the resulting earnings and cash flow margins available. Operating Efficiency is measured by a combination of factors including: return on invested capital (ROIC), gross margin, EBIT margin, asset turnover, equity turnover, and lastly Staff, General, and Administrative costs as a percentage of sales (SGA). The operating efficiency rating for F declined from STRONG to WEAK as the equity turnover deteriorated since the last quarter. Even though the gross margin increased from 2.9% to 14.8%, equity turnover offset this, decreasing from 4.1X to 4.0X. The lower equity turnover indicates that F is generating less revenues per dollar of equity.”\n\nAnd that's just a taste.  There's troubling numbers everywhere, but the algo reports have this thing where they always expect a \"reversion to mean,\" so they dump all the outlier results--or as I call them \"red flags\"--in favor of sector peers and market momentum.\n\nSo there will be things like \"Low intrinsic value ranked in the 29% percentile\" and then flip to Overweight just because the sector is moving up.   That happens a lot.\n\nIV is cheap, so I bought some ITM puts.  Done it before and made money,   Even cheaper now.    If the market goes full bull, I'm long stocks, if not, well, I don't see much more going into Ford. The algo's may like it, but there's a lot of price target out there below $7.\n\nThe effect of those delta's in their financial condition are going to have a time limit.  I don't see Q2 as quite so wonderful for all that.\n\nReferences:\n\nUpdated link to better database for EU:\n\n[https://eu-evs.com/bestSellers/ALL/Brands/Year/2021](https://eu-evs.com/bestSellers/ALL/Brands/Year/2021)\n\nOther great stuff:[https://www.eafo.eu/vehicles-and-fleet/m1](https://www.eafo.eu/vehicles-and-fleet/m1)\n\nFilter for BEV on the page.
