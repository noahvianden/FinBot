Director level? There's probably a mix of people who absolutely knew and tried to warn others (who were probably let go early in), and others who were willfully ignorant.\n\nThe truly fucked up part of it is, those companies that IBM acquired to create WH originally were doing good at staying in their lane with their tech stack and customer base.
