I was relatively flat and way underperforming a simple SPY(VOO). After 2014 I stopped looking and went 90% funds and ETFs. I had to because I started working for a real investment firm and I need to preclear all my stock trades. For my 10% stocks...I do semi annual rebalance to buy or sell. That has greatly helped the performance compared to when I was actively trading. \n\n\nMistakes I learned: \n* don‚Äôt trust business news when they make recommendations. The experts that makes them don‚Äôt actually always believe it. Sometimes the show producer ask if they can make a case. \n* we always end up holding losers longer than we should and sell winners earlier than we should. - new rule 50% loss triggers an exit. Winners stay until the signals goes negative  \n* figuring out how much to buy is just as hard - I started applying a risk control to the stocks.  I would split 10,000 to 4 sectors. Then buy them based on market cap. So large cap gets a higher weight within my 25,000 sector. \n\nHow I am handling the recent drops? I sleep like a baby. I never experienced a drop larger than 4% on a given day. Even on the worst days....well that 4% is a 0.4% hit on my total portfolio. The rest of my assets are nicely allocated globally and across different asset classes.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate the insight, great advice.

Back when I was just starting out, I was thinking big. I bought into the local electric company and Ford, because I was sure that Electric Vehicles were going to be huge, and make me money. Welp. My Ford stock is still under water and I keep it as a reminder. Yes, there is such a thing as being too far ahead of the game. I've also learned to sell the cycles with 'cyclical stocks' such as automotive and oil. They go up 100%, then eventually go back down 50% (to the same price where you bought in) then they go back up. Holding long-term can get you absolutely nothing over the long term. And there is no reason you need to sell 100% of your shares in any company. Not a bad idea to keep some shares, maybe 5-25%. I sold out of AAPL, AMZN, PCLN etc. back when they were almost penny stocks. Sure, I sold out of some companies before they went bankrupt, but you can only lose 100% of your position. The maximum you can gain is technically infinity, but for the stocks mentioned, we'll say 10,000+%. And you can always write off your losses on your taxes, which means you lower your tax bill (or another way to look at it: too didn't truly lose 100% on that bankrupt company, because it allows you to write a smaller check to the government)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Pretty much just gonna learn that index funding worked out the best.
