I believe that Activision Blizzard is massively undervalued right now, the Intellectual Property that they own is priceless at a time like this. The value investors on youtube fail to consider its Metaverse potential BTW.\n\nQuote from the wow forums:  \"WoW has had more money and development put into it than any existing Metaverse project on earth. \"\n\nAlso, if you check out [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) you will notice that they have many fans for their games.\n\nNow in my personal opinion, the entire WSJ article was a hit piece meant to do one of the following: Drop share price so that they can scoop up cheap shares, or perhaps get rid of Bobby Kotick so that they can implant their own CEO and BOARD to take over the direction of this company, maybe even give away its IP for CHEAP... (Hey, I've seen certain governments use that strategy to rival countries before)\n\nSo right now you have to ask yourself, does this company deserve to be priced at 60 bucks a share? 48 billion market cap? Simply because of sexual misconduct in the workplace? Woke much? This happens at every workplace...Happened at Tesla recently, but got swept under the rug? WHY IS THERE SO MUCH HATE FOR BLIZZARD AND KOTICK??? it seems irrational to me. I bought the dip. When the world is telling you to sell, sometimes you just have to do the opposite.\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I'M A RETARD.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "r0ts5d", "created_utc": 1637720192.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "ATVI should do a toxic-workplace metaverse game where you can abuse avatars.", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "when ceo steps down stocks gonna pop at least 10%.

You forgot to mention that the company has $9.7B in cash, so if you subtract that from market cap $ATVI is actually selling for $38B.

If you put a pathetic low multiple of 20x the company should be valued at $46B or $75 a share, about 25% upside with extremely conservative assumptions. And that is assuming the company will grow at 0% in the coming years.\n\nI predict the company will announce a $2-3B share buyback program and hire some HR firm to do some non sexual training to the horny employees. The market is looking for an excuse to buy it but I presume many hedge and pension funds can't for PR reasons (buying into a company were the ceo has been labeled as a sexual predator). With this actions they will stabilize the share price and provide a floor for traders to jump in.\n\nSelling puts right now is free money. I might activate full margin and go all in, or if I get a nice payout from my current play I will just buy LEAPs.
