And yes I do have regrets already! ;) \n\n>Did you buy an ITM LEAPS as a capital efficient stock replacement, or did you buy OTM a long time ago and hold excessively long? lol either way, congrats!\n\nYes!

Generally selling options is far more profitable than buying options over time because implied volatility is overstated, i.e., investors overpay for hope and fear.
