This guy caused short squeezes in stocks before it was cool, he engaged in market manipulation of wheat and corn in order to win a personal battle against another investor and made $10 million, he shorted multiple stocks at times using 100 different stockbrokers to hide what he was doing, he was called to the White House to be asked to stop causing price hikes in cotton by the president of the United States, he shorted a railroad company 1 day before an earthquake and became rich, he shorted multiple stocks before a huge panic in 1907 and made $1 million in one single day, he shorted stocks in 1929 right before the big crash and made $100 million which made him one of the richest people in the world at the time and he received death threats and had to hire bodyguards because people thought he caused the 1929 crash, J. P. Morgan told him personally to his face to stop shorting stocks, he often used 400% margin on many trades, he bought a $200,000 yacht, a rail car, and an apartment in a rich neighbourhood. He was part of fancy clubs, he had many mistresses, he was married many times, divorced many times, his granddaughter is Brandi Love(those who know, know), he became rich and lost everything and had to file for bankruptcy due to some bad shorts, he then became rich a second time and lost it all again because some dude told him to bet everything on cotton while that same dude was secretly selling and so he had to file for bankruptcy a second time, he then became rich a third time and lost everything again for a third time and had to file for bankruptcy again. When he lost his money the first time because of bad trades, he wanted to pawn his wife's jewelry to get more money to buy stocks and his wife divorced him because of it. His second wife had a boyfriend, and took $10 million from him in settlement money and also took his house that cost $3.5 million and sold it for $222,000. In the end he shot himself in the face and died by suicide, his son did the same, and so did his grandson, and at the time of his death he was broke for a 4th time.

{"title": "Pretty bullish TA on the weekly chart for $GME", "selftext": "A lot of TA on the daily chart but I want to zoom out a bit to the weekly. A weekly chart uses each candle to represent an entire week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FLAG MACD TTM RSI](https://preview.redd.it/zko9lu2b7ix71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae6b06a7870ba5df6bd4cdf524a10cb96d38a53b)\n\nBasic TA but a few indicators to look at here.\n\n1. First thing is the MACD, this indicator is based on moving averages and the tendency of averages to cross over, showing momentum in either one direction or the other. It has actually been bearish since June. Which is true because since the peak, we have only been going down. The good news is this is showing a strong momentum upwards again as the shorter term average is getting ready to “cross over“ the longer term average. The August run shows some upwards momentum but never showed a crossover. A real crossover can be the start of another big run. At this scale a miniature “golden cross“ is what it is.  \n\n2. Next is the TTM indicator, which is a consolidation and volatility indicator. When consolidation happens it generally leads to some sort of break out, either up or down, especially with a highly volatile stock. The crazy thing is that even with the run up this week, TTM is showing a strong upwards movement, but far from what the indicator would consider “baseline”. The big run GME is on appears to simply be an upwards correction and If we do cross into green we can expect to carry it well.\n\n3. Then we got the RSI, this is a measure of how over-sold or over-bought a stock may be. Rather than momentum, this is based on price and volume. The lower this dips the more likely it will rebound, and vise versa. The price and RSI move relative but not equal. MACD and TTM can usually only be real strong when the RSI still looks reasonable, momentum can quickly end when the stock becomes over-bought and over-valued. Well RSI is still within reason. It is still below where it was during the last few runs ups, showing that there is still room to run, if we run to the RSI levels we were at it gives us room to reach $250-$300 or more, and once that happens no telling where this can go. \n\n4. The giant bull flag in the room. This thing has shown us pennant after pennant. With lower and lower volume each time. With the lowest days and weeks happening just recently. Total textbook bullish TA. It is only still worth talking about because it has proven itself again and again. We may finally see a new bull flag break out but at a much larger scale.\n\nMy opinion? We see another big run in the next days/weeks. We could be approaching buy button lock down levels again. Get in while you can..\n\nBut honestly im kinda retarded and this is like kindergarten TA so yeah thx bye not financial advise.\n\nPositions: 32 Shares plus 2 $220c 11/26, 1 $220c 12/3, 1 $240c 12/3.
