{"title": "Here's a list of the 20 cheapest puts that work great for tail hedging", "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nWith VIX at it's lowest point in a year, premiums from selling puts have seen significant decreases at the same expiry and % OTM level. You may be going closer ATM or selling larger positions to maintain the same weekly profits.\n\nAt the same time, hedges have become cheap, like buying puts back before the 2020 crash. When Boeing was at $300, their 1 year out $150 puts were like $0.30. Puts still aren't as cheap as Feb 2020 but it's getting close.\n\nI compiled a top 20 list of the cheapest May put options defined by **Theta/Strike \\* 100.** (Aka the yield on collateral if you do CSP).\n\nThese options are found by using [FDscanner](https://app.fdscanner.com/scanner) with the following parameters:\n\n* Puts only\n* Option Premium < 1% of strike\n* % OTM < 10%\n* Expiry: May 21st\n\nAfter running the filters, sort by the Theta Annual % column. Theta Annual % is the annualized yield on collateral if you do CSP, finding the smallest value means you're paying the least in theta for the long put position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|IV|Strike|Share Price|Last|% of Strike|% OTM|Volume|Open Interest|Theta Annual %|\n:--|--:|:--|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|CLGX|12.88%|$75|$79.46|$0.25|0.27%|5.61%|9|33|3.41%|\n|FPRX|16.70%|$35|$37.82|$0.25|0.36%|7.46%|1|1|4.48%|\n|HWCC|13.19%|$5|$5.26|$0.05|0.50%|4.94%|21|927|5.11%|\n|GSAH|14.34%|$10|$10.54|$0.05|0.50%|5.12%|691|15213|5.11%|\n|GLUU|13.25%|$12|$12.48|$0.1|0.63%|3.85%|5|19|5.17%|\n|GWPH|12.60%|$210|$217.33|$1.2|0.62%|3.37%|1|115|5.20%|\n|AJRD|14.05%|$45|$47.21|$0.45|0.56%|4.68%|12|257|5.27%|\n|RY|18.17%|$85|$92.48|$0.37|0.44%|8.09%|23|63|5.97%|\n|COST|22.52%|$320|$354.94|$1.5|0.46%|9.84%|191|918|5.98%|\n|VZ|20.71%|$52.5|$58.29|$0.22|0.40%|9.93%|98|2271|6.12%|\n|AJAX|13%|$10|$10.23|$0.1|1%|2.25%|380|13089|6%|\n|AEP|20.93%|$77.5|$85.55|$0.37|0.45%|9.41%|24|489|6.22%|\n|JNJ|20.34%|$150|$162.8|$0.82|0.55%|7.86%|475|1986|6.28%|\n|K|22.34%|$57.5|$63.32|$0.35|0.57%|9.19%|30|264|6.41%|\n|DEO|18.97%|$155|$167.44|$1.05|0.63%|7.43%|27|46|6.45%|\n|MRK|22.43%|$70|$77.08|$0.37|0.51%|9.19%|216|1697|6.47%|\n|KO|23.03%|$47.5|$52.5|$0.25|0.53%|9.52%|800|3972|6.53%|\n|TM|22.65%|$140|$154.16|$0.85|0.52%|9.19%|4|43|6.65%|\n|CM|15.33%|$95|$98.71|$1|0.87%|3.76%|2|133|6.72%|\n|COST|21.75%|$325|$354.94|$2.02|0.61%|8.44%|267|1202|6.82%​|\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you find yourself increasing your buying power usage, like diving into VIAC and similarly affected stocks, consider looking into cheap puts with a fraction of your collected premium for hedging.
