{"title": "It's a solid play...", "selftext": "Ok, this is gonna be a very simple bit of DD...\n\nThe subject is our favourite stonk... You know the one...\n\nNow, there's a lot of very optimistic DD out there, and sometimes I feel that does more harm than good... So here is a simple pessimist DD from the point of view of someone who does believe in the squeeze...\n\nNow essentially every stonk play is gambling... The key to successful gambling is balancing risk vs reward... The ultimate example of this is if you imagine a standard, fair, coin toss. If someone said: \"for every dollar you bet on the coin toss, if you guess right you get 1.1 dollars and if you guess wrong you lose your dollar\", then in that situation the right play would be to take that bet over and over again for guaranteed infinite money in the long run...\n\nSo that's what successful gambling is all about. Making these probabilistically sound bets over and over and over...\n\nNow let's apply that to the stonk in question... In a very simplified yet reasonable, though pessimistic, way...\n\nLet's take a conservative top for the short squeeze to be $1000 and a conservative likelyhood for that outcome, given that you believe it is a serious possibility, of 25% chance of that squeeze happening.\n\nLet's also take a pessimist worst case of $0 price for this stock without the squeeze happening at all, and a pessimistic probability of that happening of 25%...\n\nAnd let's take a conservative case of the stock simply drifting down to it's price target of $170 and staying there, with a remaining likelihood of 50%...\n\nLet's then assume that the average buy in price was an expensive $200 dollars...\n\nSo the total expected value of the play is as follows:\n\nTEV = (1000 - 200) * 0.25 + (170 - 200) * 0.5 + (0 - 200) * 0.25 = 160.\n\nSO THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THE PLAY FOR EVERY $200 INVESTED IS $160 *PROFIT* ON AVERAGE...\n\nNow that's a damn good play...\n\nEnd of DD.\n\n---\n\n*Edit:*\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that good DD should be more informative. So I will include some, again, simplistic data points to inform and back the probabilistic analysis above...\n\n1. Late January FTDs were in the millions. Ryan Cohen and BlackRock buy a lot of stock. Short squeeze ensued.\n\n2. Short squeeze was artificially halted, and immediately collapsed, therefore the full short squeeze was not squoze\n\n3. Late February, FTD data was underwhelming yet we had a gamma squeeze all the same continuing to early March.\n\n4. Lots of calls at 800. Short squeeze halted at 450. Top of 1000 is a serious possibility.\n\n5. Early March the stock was agressively shorted. Shares available are at zero practically.\n\n6. Retail is buying and holding. Price has stabilized at an unexpectedly high 190\n\n7. Points 2 to 5 and 9 below strongly suggest there is significant remaining hidden short interest that has not been covered\n\n8. We know HFs and whales have mechanisms and leverage to massively manipulate the market\n\n9. A lot of data is hidden to us the average Joe's\n\n10. Points above support a significant chance of a short squeeze eventually, yet point 8 tempers that by a lot...\n\nGiven the above information the intial probabilistic analysis in the OP is very reasonable", "id": "mij812", "created_utc": 1617366071.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "I use to go by the simple strategy - *high risk high retard*", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "Marijuana is a market performance enhancer", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "I second this motion.
