{"title": "I Followed The Smart Money with Jon and Pete Najarian...so you didn't have to. Here is what I learned:", "selftext": "I'm a fairly experienced trader..but I felt like I was missing something.  I knew there had to be a secret to making the highest returns but I couldn't figure out what that secret was.\n\nOne day I was watching CNBC and heard this ad, \"The secret to making the highest returns is knowing which stocks are about to make the biggest moves...\"\n\nRight then I knew I had to pick up my landline phone and called in to FOMO order the book and companion DVD. I mean how could I pass it up...the book was free  I just had to pay the low price of $9.99 for shipping and handling.\n\nHere is what happened next:\n\n1. I went to my local Radio Shack to pick up the newest DVD player. I ended up getting a Sony.\n2. I listed my Magnavox VHS player on eBay\n3. I checked my mail daily, and finally when the items arrived I ripped them open, devoured the book and watched the DVD\n\n# What did I learn? And how can you score major profits just like the Najarian bros?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. at 12:30 PM EST, login to your favorite brokerage app and buy thousands of options on literally any stock you want\n2. At 12:50 PM EST, go on CNBC and mention during your segment of \"Unusual Options Activity\" the EXACT SAME options you just bought.\n3. At 12:51 PM EST, sell those calls that you bought 31 minutes ago, after people watching the show FOMO buy them and you make a nice profit.\n4. You do this again, because you always give two stocks with unusual activity on TV.\n\nThe book and DVD did not mention what role the pony tail plays in your success.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u27z2jbg5rv61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09996b2c38b560dc3bb8f7dddaa3b54cb82e00d6", "id": "mztzcx", "created_utc": 1619545097.0, "score": 378, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 141, "replies": [{"body": "I noticed this trend over the past year.\n\nI tracked about 20 stocks they said that people are buying options heavilly and basically 17 of the 20 were sold massively by the end of the trading day.\n\nSuch a joke", "score": 21, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Funny how", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Lol... maybe a little Drakkar Noir mixed in?
