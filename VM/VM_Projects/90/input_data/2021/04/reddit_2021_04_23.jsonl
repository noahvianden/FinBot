{"title": "Investing with Lil Boat, DD based on the album.", "selftext": "Yachty killed the coins when he dropped Michigan Boy Boat and tomorrow he's coming for the SPY. The album is filled with DD. Here's my review:\n\nTrack 3 - **Concrete Goonies** \\- Invest in infrastructure.\n\nTrack 5 - **G.I. Joe** \\- Long RTX, LTM, BA, DFEN, NOC. This is an obvious play you shouldn't need Yachty to elucidate for you.\n\nTrack 6 - **Never Did Coke** \\- This is a short play on KO. Yachty thinks kids are more health conscious now, but his bearish sentiment on Coke long-term confuses me. I think they're well positioned for some CBD beverages and healthy drinks.\n\nTrack 8 - **Plastic** \\- Long oil. This is a recovery play.\n\nTrack 12 - **SB5** \\- If you google SB5 you get PROFUTURA. This is a bullish Latina futures play. GPROFUT\n\nTrack 13 - **Hybrid** \\- He's saying short Tesla, as he prefers a hybrid to a full electric. Yachty is bullish on Detroit automakers. He seems to suggest he's made quite the bag off GM and FORD this year while fucking your little sister.\n\nOverall, Yachty invests like a boomer, which is telling. I agree with some of his observations and will be adjusting my portfolio as needed. I give it a Strong 7 weak 8.", "id": "mwonjm", "created_utc": 1619157497.0, "score": 845, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "I don't find this any more insane than the usual DD around here.", "score": 398, "replies": [{"body": "Its makes more sense than some ive seen.

It was in Queens at Studio Square. They were selling blue drinks there were straight alcohol and there were high school kids throwing up in the corners with blue tongues. Yachty came out looking like Gordons fisherman in those yellow fishing overalls. I was on two tabs and it was pretty magical watching everyone party to some lullaby trap.\n\nWhen Migos were about to come on, the crowd got crazy. Beautiful expensive women came out of the woodwork. All ass and tits and lips. Then they started making gunshot noises and the cops showed up and kicked everyone out. Spent the rest of the night on the docks in LI city watching Manhattan breathe in the distance tripping balls. We ran into a little spanish street party, with music and food, right near the water. I can still remember the smell of the carnitas hitting. You rarely get hungry tripping but that shit got me straight aroused.\n\nWhen the man drops an album, I buy puts.
