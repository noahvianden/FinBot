As for putting \"shitty\" loans in with \"good\" loans into a deal, not necessarily a CDO, but a CMBS, what is wrong with that?  That is the entire reason for doing CMBS.  It is \"more efficient\" in that you putting the high-yield stuff in to get a higher total return on the investment.  The probability of default is accounted for if you are not a moron, and you are taking a bet that you can get more dough out of the deal than it costs to finance the position if you are a hedge fund, or will beat an index if you are a doing money management.\n4. These guys have cut risk like crazy since last year.  Look at their balance sheet: [https://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=14748711-152969-157455&type=sect&TabIndex=2&dcn=0001577670-21-000009&nav=1&src=Yahoo](https://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=14748711-152969-157455&type=sect&TabIndex=2&dcn=0001577670-21-000009&nav=1&src=Yahoo)  Loans out standing down $1B, carried CMBS down $0.5B, cash up nearly $1.B.\n5. This took all of five minutes to look at that.  Speculation on what Kenny G is doing with respect to this and the option market is wanking in the dark.  You have no idea.\n6. CMBS is likely to get into trouble, but you are only going to make money on that if you do CDS, get paid to beat an index, or wait around to pick over the carcasses like everyone did after 2008.\n\nThe bottom line is that these guys might suck, but this not in any way clear from what was presented.  If the management came from UBS, that was indeed an extraordinary cesspool of humanity, so one should not expect them to do anything honorable or honest.  Additionally, they are near retirement age, and so would not feel bad milking the cow until it dies.  \n\nYou just have no idea what is going on here, this is a total punt.
