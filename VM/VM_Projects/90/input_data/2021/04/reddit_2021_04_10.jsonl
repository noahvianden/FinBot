{"title": "What is going on with the equity market? I am losing my rationality", "selftext": "\\*\\*Hi!\\*\\*\n\nFirst off sorry for the vague title. I don't know if this fits here but I decided to take that risk.\n\nStudent here, working part time at an institutional asset manager (and not a native english speaker). I seem to be confused with the current market behaviour as it defies everything I've learned so far.\n\nI would really appreciate if anyone could beat some sense into me and educate me as to why I shouldn't heavily short equities right now.\n\nTo start let me summarize the current situation (note that the selected information will be biased by me, even if it's not conciously). I will mainly focus on the S&P 500 (SPX/\\^GSPC) for simplicity and structure it like this:\n\n\\------------------\n\n1. Index Price and Analyst Expectations\n2. Indicators and Benchmarks\n3. Economic Numbers, Trends, News and Sentiment\n\nThe rant is happening in part 3 mostly.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**1a) Analysts Targets**\n\nDuring this week, I heard about 10 Analysts from Banks and Asset Managers (GM,JPM,CS,UBS, some hedge funds) say that they expect the S&P to have an upside-potential to 4'200. The expected EOY-Median is also 4'200, though the Expectation for EOY 2021 was only 3'950-4'000 at the beginning of this year.\n\n[Short Term Boundaries](https://preview.redd.it/mlsq39aty7s61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=6295d87dcd09754d485859911044a7aff69e233b)\n\nIt seems kind of weird to me how we almost already touched that 4'200 upper limit. Even weirder how every single analyst had the same target for the S&P 500 and every single one said \"we remain bullish on US equities\". Their explanations haven't really convinced me as none of them could really answer the shows hosts on the question why they remain bullish even though we're up that far already.\n\nWe hit ATH 20 times this year, with 5 of them having happened in the last 10 business days.\n\n[ATHs marked red \\(SPX Closing Prices\\)](https://preview.redd.it/agihumz308s61.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=d395b22896c7268af8b992fe33131abe168eb123)\n\nWith earnings ahead, I don't get how this should be going even further up. Especially on the news we're facing (see further down part 3).\n\n\\--------------\n\n**1b) Volume and VIX**\n\n* *Trading volume can signal when an investor should take profits and sell a security due to low activity. (Investopedia)*\n* *In the U.S. stock market and many other developed financial markets, about 70-80 percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading.*\n* *The algos provide great liquidity when there is no news, but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize.*\n\nHmm okay. We had 70 business days so far in 2021 and out of the last 10 there are 7 days in the top 10 lowest daily trading volume (YTD, since 01-01-2021). If we're supposedly in 'bullish' situation, why is the volume going down so rapidly and the trading so frothy? Are the algos idling to meet the ESG-benchmarks or?\n\n[Daily Trading Volume S&P 500 YTD](https://preview.redd.it/ato92kkt68s61.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1adea27b4ff2e0f4bee7bc7a07a404c80fcd16a)\n\n[Rank of 10 last trading sessions \\(1=Lowest Trading Volume YTD on S&P 500\\)](https://preview.redd.it/65f387ko68s61.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fa35f60c5e8d3fa44577838832fe3f38d233a72)\n\nWe're also at the lowest VIX-Level on the 1Y-Chart which I learned is usually a sell signal (shortterm).\n\n[VIX 5Y Chart](https://preview.redd.it/t2nlnovv78s61.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=df86cb8f0d7bb8c2c6e33b87ca2fd0a1113c22b7)\n\n\\-----------\n\n**1c) Psychological Factors (SideNote)**\n\nApril has been the best performing month for US equities for the last two decades. April was performing net-positive in 14 out of the last 15 years (excluding 2008).\n\nThe best performing equities in april are historically european stocks, followed by US stocks.\n\nKnowing that this month started at 3'992 (ATH) I'm having doubts that the trend will repeat this time though.\n\n\\-----------\n\n**2) Technicals**\n\n**2a) MA, MACD**\n\nI'm kind of a believer in the theory that most technical indicators only work because actual systems and people trade by their principles. Having said that it's obviously kind of misleading to use momentum indicators as all of them are giving us strong buy signals even at ATH levels:\n\n[Barchart Indicators with their buy signals](https://preview.redd.it/k5lvh37598s61.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=848bda20c938189d32330efacc0f541b9a6e3966)\n\nJust to note; we're obviously above moving averages at this point:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29jhp1lw67s61.png?width=1322&format=png&auto=webp&s=e70aa871fda3be5ae205e7ff3c4394caf04c7a96\n\n\\-----------------\n\n**2b) RSI, PE Ratio**\n\nIt's really difficult for me to evaluate the usefulness of value-based indicators like the buffet-indicator or the PE ratio. They ignore the decrease in interest rates and the influx of retail money into equities:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mos6wyua8s61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b84ca31be9228a0323466b8ed100ba128c84eb2\n\nWithout that in mind the stock-market values would look pretty wild at this point;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rpsg5sxa8s61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=0168296221bc823428333316d199a642673617a4\n\n**2b) PE Ratio**\n\nThe same logic applies to price-to-earnings ratios;\n\n[Shiller\\/CAPE PE Ratio for the SPX](https://preview.redd.it/k0hvjwu8v7s61.png?width=1330&format=png&auto=webp&s=c150c0401983a4a3dbe5adea4fed9d6278f4d1a3)\n\nStill ... what bothers me is that the PE ratios of US indices are so much higher than the rest of the world:\n\n[Shiller\\/Cape PE Ratio major equitiy indices](https://preview.redd.it/rfv5c7cmb8s61.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c83b816aad561bfa70412fde2c510fd38f9b2e6)\n\nThe worst one is not even listed here - the current ratio of the NDX (Nasdaq 100) lies at 50.19!\n\nIt's as if investors don't expect any growth outside of US companies or am I interpreting that wrong? It's not like inflation is higher in the US either (though there is a certain depreciation in the USD).\n\nAnd if the earnings so obviously don't matter (anymore), how can analysts like this guy from Credit Suisse say that the prices are soaring due to the strong earnings??? (Src; Bloomberg-Link)\n\nAnd lastly I understand the 21day-RSI crossing 70+ as a sell signal or is that wrong again?\n\n[SPX 21D-RSI on lower chart with BS-boundaries on upper chart](https://preview.redd.it/jw1afsttf8s61.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3b064f7305badc6f472550b1bca4fcdbd2af4d4)\n\n\\----------------\n\n**3) Economic Data, Trends, News, Sentiments**\n\nOh god here we go. I will not provide as much details and pictures so let me summarize the most important points IMO a bit:\n\n3a) Job Market\n\n|Date|Actual|Expected|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|25-mar 21|684|730|\n|01-apr 21|719|680|\n|08-apr 21|744|680|\n\n* The weekly jobless-claims reached a pandemic-era low **2 weeks ago** (25-mar) which resulted in the index going up 50bp.\n* **Last week** we had larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 50bp.\n* **This week** we had way larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 30bp.\n\nIt's weird how these numbers were celebrated and being sold as the reason for rising equity prices with one reason being that the FED seemingly only talks about the job numbers as their motivation for propping up the economy.\n\nNow that the numbers went bad they suddenly do not matter anymore. It actually pissed me off how Tom Keene saw these numbers on Bloomberg TV and said \"if we're being honest, how much do these numbers matter anyway? They are just transitory\"... like ... why did you care about them before then?\n\n\\-------------\n\n**3b) Inflation and Yields (fixed income)**\n\nYou guys probably kept an eye on the treasury yields too as they seem to have caused a small taper tantrum in the first days of march. Analysts expect the 10Y US Tr. Yield to reach about 2% this year. As the treasuries usually act as benchmark for other assets, mortgage interest rates and bond rates have spiked as well.\n\nThis SHOULD be bad for high-risk assets (also as in high debt-ratios) short- to mid-term like overvalued stocks as found in the Nasdaq/SPX-Components. News Outlets were talking for WEEKS about the reflation trade and the shift from growth to value stocks. There were theories about quant funds shifting big time etc. ... as it stands we're kind of back with our major growth indices though?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[YTD: NDX and SPX above and 10Y Tr. Yield below](https://preview.redd.it/yacawd7lk8s61.png?width=2445&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2319e7c5f82606dc45f8bc1a75d0ea16aa616cd)\n\nIt's not like the treasury yields have retreated much, but for some reason the major tech stocks all jumped 5% to 15% this week... and they're saying that financial corps will do the same next week.\n\nThe PPI data released today only indicates even higher inflation expectations - same in other countries like china (4.4% actual):\n\n[US PPI Month over Month](https://preview.redd.it/sqtuneq3l8s61.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c96357955faaa0d961310503d5f6e525afdcc30)\n\nI get that higher yields are good for the financial sector and that a depreciation in the USD drives US equities as well (and inflation in US = USD loses value c.p.). But I still don't see why tech jumped.\n\n\\------------\n\n**3c) Risk in the financial sector**\n\nWith low yields (well until recently) the leverage ratio increased substantially and even the FEDs balance sheet kind of imploded due to the pandemic. There is so much money in the market and so much leverage just so guaranteed rates can be delivered ... I wonder how this is not a sign of risk to anyone?\n\nWe just had the bust of a fund with Archegos that erased about USD 194 billion of market value and a similar picture with Greensill capital or the supposed short-sellers of equities in january. Even after this, Credit Suisse somehow thinks that they have proper risk management lol. And I wish I wouldn't have to say that about one of our 'national' banks ... sigh. Oh and somehow Citibank just lost 500M in some transactions... woops?\n\n\\-----------\n\n**3d) Tax revolution**\n\nThe current projects on better international tax collaboration, higher corporate and individual taxes, a minimum tax rate for companies etc.... all of this sounds like bad news for companies... but somehow it get's ignored??? Someone help me on this please.\n\n\\----------\n\n**3e) Vaccination Progress**\n\nAt the current rate, we will achieve global herd immunity in 2022 with cases rising again in Europe and developing/industrial countries.\n\n[Low progress in less wealthy countries](https://preview.redd.it/66dpywwxm8s61.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=30d9738c543ff9d2832fcb6a297c8b7377b1eec4)\n\nIt seems like the lagging progress outside of the US doesn't concern the market in the least as we can see with ATHs on european and asian indices. I guess Tom Keene would say that these numbers are irrelevant anyway.\n\n\\-----------\n\n**3f) Chip Shortage**\n\nMajor car manufacturers halted production (GM, Ford) this week and many tech products can't meet demand due to the delay in production (like the current MacBooks). It's a consensus that this issue will stay for a few years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4orw8mfn8s61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=1527fc2582fd5a703ba239cf9f104215c0c5abcf\n\nThis is pretty bad news, right? Obviously this means that the market has to go up... like ... I don't understand. This is an obvious issue but somehow these stocks just go up ...\n\n\\---------------\n\nThere are many other bad news like the Ukraine conflict (where talks about a possible war exist) or the Oil price dilemma and uncertain future of crypto currencies. But I'm leaving it at this right now.\n\n\\---------------\n\nLastly I want to note my personal destain for Bloomberg News as they seem to be publishing some weird articles lately. There are major news but they kind of spin it into 'good news' and (for example) talk about the potential of SPX hitting 4'100+ this week instead. I mostly resorted to Reuters and selected smaller outlets last week for this reason.\n\n\\---------------\n\nOk guys, that's it. I would be happy to have someone explain me why I should be 'bullish' on the SPX. I just loaded up on puts (structured products) after losing most of my portfolio this week on rather heavily leveraged puts.\n\nThanks to anyone for reading this.\n\n\\*If asked I can provide sources on all the info, though I don't want to link all the sources right away as it takes too much time.", "id": "mnugf5", "created_utc": 1618015028.0, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "This will continue to run as long as cheap money is readily available.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "So it basically comes down to the overwhelming liquidity being available because of low rates and FED spending, right?

The best way to be, imo, is to have \"Strong opinions, weakly held\" follow your ideas to their conclusions, but don't believe in them too much, that's how we get trapped. When you think something \"chip shortages are bad for automakers, short them\" and then the market reacts in the opposite way, take that as feedback. Maybe the market is being irrational, or maybe things are more complicated then you think... For instance, maybe car makers aren't able to sell as many models, but the shortage of new cars allows them to raise prices, consumers can borrow cheaply so they are willing to pay more, and then the car makers have higher margins and thus more earnings on the same amount of revenue.  Also, the market is generally looking at least six months into the future, so maybe the price increases are due to the fact that people think that more cars may be sold because of the switch to electric over the next few years with government incentives. If that increased margins, then that could make the car makers trade at a higher multiple to sales, which will make a much more significant difference in stock price than revenue increases. I'm just making these up, I don't actually know that much about the major automakers, but I'm trying to give you some idea of how many counterfactuals are possible to the narrative that you'll see only reading the financial media or most comments on the internet. \n\nI personally find predicting whole market moves too difficult, so I try to pick companies and understand how they make money and what companies/industries may be underestimated/overestimated. If you're going to bet against the market/entire sectors, you need to be on top of ISM manufacturing and services PMIs (and euro PMIs if you're looking there) to see which sectors will be growing or declining *in the future*. If you're just looking at data that everyone can see and is talked about excessively in the media/trading forums/trading gurus like CPI, RSI, p/e, etc., then its hard to have an edge because everyone has the same info. If you look at ISM, see that a sector is growing quickly (lots of new orders, low inventory, etc.) then you can drill down into the sector and try to find the company that will benefit the most from the trend. If you do that, and then people in the media/forums/etc. eventually have the same thought process as you (OMG this trend is so important!) then you're in at a lower cost basis (if long) and get the liquidity to take profit. If you were watching the ISM over the last six months, you saw some version of the chip shortage (consumer electronics has low inventory and is supply constrained) coming before it became a narrative on CNBC. When you do that, you actually want to look for the companies that have historically *high* p/e's in comparison to their peers. This is counterintuitive because you're supposed to buy cheap companies... but this is the big thing people miss: a p/e is inherently backwards looking, so a historically high p/e multiple can imply that the market thinks that a particular company has earnings are high quality (in comparison to a company in the same sector with a low p/e) and that growth in earnings is anticipated. Betting that a p/e ratio will increase for a company can work too, but you need to really understand why the company has a lower p/e than its peers and have a good reason to believe that the market will change its mind and why it has improved the quality of its earnings.\n\nBasically, all of this boils down to: fundamental analysis is the much more important than technical analysis for making money in the markets as a retail trader. There are algos that can analyze technical trends in stock prices much better than any human, but combining both technical, economic, fundamental, and psychological reasoning can give you an edge if you're actually better than average at predicting trends and finding the trade ideas that will benefit most from the trend/catalyst that will occur.

I already lost the biggest part of my portfolio this week but I just don't seem to be able to change my mind. \n\nTo start let me summarize the current situation (note that the selected information will be biased by me, even if it's not conciously). I will mainly focus on the S&P 500 (SPX/\\^GSPC) for simplicity and structure it like this:\n\n\\------------------\n\n1. Index Price and Analyst Expectations\n2. Indicators and Benchmarks\n3. Economic Numbers, Trends, News and Sentiment\n\nThe rant is happening in part 3 mostly. I'm not sure if it's allowed but I linked some pictures with imgur-urls. \n\n\\-------------------\n\n**1a) Analysts Targets**\n\nDuring this week, I heard about 10 Analysts from Banks and Asset Managers (GM,JPM,CS,UBS, some hedge funds) say that they expect the S&P to have an upside-potential to 4'200. The expected EOY-Median is also 4'200, though the Expectation for EOY 2021 was only 3'950-4'000 at the beginning of this year.\n\n[https://imgur.com/3yr48h3](https://imgur.com/3yr48h3) (Short Term Boundaries)\n\nIt seems kind of weird to me how we almost already touched that 4'200 upper limit. Even weirder how every single analyst had the same target for the S&P 500 and every single one said \"we remain bullish on US equities\". Their explanations haven't really convinced me as none of them could really answer the shows hosts on the question why they remain bullish even though we're up that far already.\n\nWe hit ATH 20 times this year, with 5 of them having happened in the last 10 business days.\n\n[https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ](https://imgur.com/UaU36hQ) (ATHs marked red (SPX Closing Prices))\n\nWith earnings ahead, I don't get how this should be going even further up.

(Investopedia)*\n* *In the U.S. stock market and many other developed financial markets, about 70-80 percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading.*\n* *The algos provide great liquidity when there is no news, but when a big new comes in the algos go away until things stabilize.*\n\nHmm okay. We had 70 business days so far in 2021 and out of the last 10 there are 7 days in the top 10 lowest daily trading volume (YTD, since 01-01-2021). If we're supposedly in 'bullish' situation, why is the volume going down so rapidly and the trading so frothy?

They ignore the decrease in interest rates and the influx of retail money into equities:\n\n[https://imgur.com/S86bESi](https://imgur.com/S86bESi)\n\nWithout that in mind the stock-market values would look pretty wild at this point;\n\n[https://imgur.com/BtImQgc](https://imgur.com/BtImQgc)\n\n**2b) PE Ratio**\n\nThe same logic applies to price-to-earnings ratios;\n\n[https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5](https://imgur.com/mKqm5G5) (Shiller/CAPE PE Ratio for the SPX)\n\nStill ... what bothers me is that the PE ratios of US indices are so much higher than the rest of the world:\n\n[https://imgur.com/2D415BE](https://imgur.com/2D415BE) (Shiller/Cape PE Ratio major equitiy indices)\n\nThe worst one is not even listed here - the current ratio of the NDX (Nasdaq 100) lies at 50.19!\n\nIt's as if investors don't expect any growth outside of US companies or am I interpreting that wrong? It's not like inflation is higher in the US either (though there is a certain depreciation in the USD).\n\nAnd if the earnings so obviously don't matter (anymore), how can analysts like this guy from Credit Suisse say that the prices are soaring due to the strong earnings??? (Src; Bloomberg-Link)\n\nAnd lastly I understand the 21day-RSI crossing 70+ as a sell signal or is that wrong again?\n\n[https://imgur.com/xMAFJrv](https://imgur.com/xMAFJrv) (SPX 21D-RSI on lower chart with BS-boundaries on upper chart)\n\n\\----------------\n\n**3) Economic Data, Trends, News, Sentiments**\n\nOh god here we go. I will not provide as much details and pictures so let me summarize the most important points IMO a bit:\n\n3a) Job Market\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Date|Actual|Expected|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|25-mar|684|730|\n|1-apr|719|680|\n|7-apr|744|680|\n\n* The weekly jobless-claims reached a pandemic-era low **2 weeks ago** (25-mar) which resulted in the index going up 50bp.\n* **Last week** we had larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 50bp.\n* **This week** we had way larger-than-expected jobless claims which resulted in the index going up 30bp.\n\nIt's weird how these numbers were celebrated and being sold as the reason for rising equity prices with one reason being that the FED seemingly only talks about the job numbers as their motivation for propping up the economy.\n\nNow that the numbers went bad they suddenly do not matter anymore. It actually pissed me off how Tom Keene saw these numbers on Bloomberg TV and said \"if we're being honest, how much do these numbers matter anyway? They are just transitory\"... like ... why did you care about them before then?\n\n\\-------------\n\n**3b) Inflation and Yields (fixed income)**\n\nYou guys probably kept an eye on the treasury yields too as they seem to have caused a small taper tantrum in the first days of march. Analysts expect the 10Y US Tr. Yield to reach about 2% this year. As the treasuries usually act as benchmark for other assets, mortgage interest rates and bond rates have spiked as well.\n\nThis SHOULD be bad for high-risk assets (also as in high debt-ratios) short- to mid-term like overvalued stocks as found in the Nasdaq/SPX-Components. News Outlets were talking for WEEKS about the reflation trade and the shift from growth to value stocks. There were theories about quant funds shifting big time etc. ... as it stands we're kind of back with our major growth indices though?\n\n[https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn](https://imgur.com/3Fv1mVn) (YTD: NDX and SPX above and 10Y Tr. Yield below)\n\nIt's not like the treasury yields have retreated much, but for some reason the major tech stocks all jumped 5% to 15% this week... and they're saying that financial corps will do the same next week.\n\nThe PPI data released today only indicates even higher inflation expectations - same in other countries like china (4.4% actual):\n\n[https://imgur.com/vh4TDek](https://imgur.com/vh4TDek) (US PPI Month over Month)\n\nI get that higher yields are good for the financial sector and that a depreciation in the USD drives US equities as well (and inflation in US = USD loses value c.p.). But I still don't see why tech jumped.\n\n\\------------\n\n**3c) Risk in the financial sector**\n\nWith low yields (well until recently) the leverage ratio increased substantially and even the FEDs balance sheet kind of imploded due to the pandemic. There is so much money in the market and so much leverage just so guaranteed rates can be delivered ... I wonder how this is not a sign of risk to anyone?\n\nWe just had the bust of a fund with Archegos that erased about USD 194 billion of market value and a similar picture with Greensill capital or the supposed short-sellers of equities in january. Even after this, Credit Suisse somehow thinks that they have proper risk management lol. And I wish I wouldn't have to say that about one of our 'national' banks ... sigh. Oh and somehow Citibank just lost 500M in some transactions... woops?\n\n\\-----------\n\n**3d) Tax revolution**\n\nThe current projects on better international tax collaboration, higher corporate and individual taxes, a minimum tax rate for companies etc.... all of this sounds like bad news for companies... but somehow it get's ignored??? Someone help me on this please.\n\n\\----------\n\n**3e) Vaccination Progress**\n\nAt the current rate, we will achieve global herd immunity in 2022 with cases rising again in Europe and developing/industrial countries.\n\n[https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg](https://imgur.com/Kh2blNg) (Low progress in less wealthy countries)\n\nIt seems like the lagging progress outside of the US doesn't concern the market in the least as we can see with ATHs on european and asian indices. I guess Tom Keene would say that these numbers are irrelevant anyway.\n\n\\-----------\n\n**3f) Chip Shortage**\n\nMajor car manufacturers halted production (GM, Ford) this week and many tech products can't meet demand due to the delay in production (like the current MacBooks). It's a consensus that this issue will stay for a few years since the building of factory sites and so on usually takes a few years.\n\n[https://imgur.com/4diq83G](https://imgur.com/4diq83G)\n\nThis is pretty bad news, right?

Or upcoming (major) bond auctions on monday with the release of the new fed bond buying program pace on wednesday. But I'm leaving it at this right now.\n\n\\---------------\n\nLastly I want to note my personal destain for Bloomberg News as they seem to be publishing some weird articles lately. There are major news but they kind of spin it into 'good news' and (for example) talk about the potential of SPX hitting 4'100+ this week instead. I mostly resorted to Reuters and selected smaller outlets last week for this reason.\n\n\\---------------\n\nOk guys, that's it.
