{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 5th, 2021.\n\n# **Blowout jobs report could power stocks higher in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/blowout-jobs-report-could-power-stocks-higher-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> April started off with a rally, and the market could continue to notch gains as the month gets underway, strategists say.\n*****\n> The U.S. Labor Department’s surprisingly strong March jobs report this Friday showed that there were 916,000 jobs added in March, compared to the 675,000 expected by economists.\n*****\n> The week ahead is expected to be fairly quiet, with a few economic reports and Federal Reserve speakers filling the lull before earnings season.\n*****\n> The Institute for Supply Management’s service sector survey will be released next Monday and should get close attention after institute’s manufacturing survey came in at the highest level since 1983. Minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting will be released next Wednesday afternoon.\n*****\n> “Literally everything, or almost everything, should be very robust for the foreseeable future, I would think. We’re coming off a low base,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n*****\n> Economists expect a very strong second quarter as the economy reopens and stimulus spending kicks in, and that should be positive for stocks — unless interest rates rise too quickly.\n*****\n> Major stock indices were sharply higher as the calendar rolled into April.\n*****\n> On Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% to a new record close of 4,019.87. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 170 points, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.8%.\n*****\n> The closely watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, was higher at 1.68% Friday morning, well below recent high of 1.77% reached earlier in the week.\n*****\n> The 10-year is important because it influences mortgages and other loans, but recently it has also had a negative correlation recently with tech stocks. When the 10-year yield edged higher, tech went lower.\n*****\n> # All eyes on earnings\n> “The macro calendar is pretty light. I think attention will turn to earnings pretty quickly,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management. “That will be the next thing to turn to.”\n*****\n> He said the market is often weaker just ahead of earnings season.\n*****\n> First quarter earnings are expected to be up 24.2% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. It will be the first quarter where the prior year results included the impact of the pandemic shutdown.\n*****\n> Some strategists expect the earnings season to bring with it more favorable comments from companies that could lead to positive forecast revisions, providing fuel for the stock market.\n*****\n> “Approximately 13 months ago, COVID-19 sent us home from our offices and our kids from school. While the pandemic nearly shut down the world economy, an unprecedented policy response kept the economy afloat, leading to the shortest recessionary decline and the steepest stock market bounce in history,” noted Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\n*****\n> Golub said that the 78% rise in the S&P 500 from the bottom last March was driven in a big way by earnings.\n*****\n> “In each of the past two recovery periods, the trend of positive revisions lasted 2-3 years, providing an important tailwind for the market,” he wrote in a note.\n*****\n> He added that economists have continued to revise growth forecasts higher.\n*****\n> “Our work shows that every 1% change in GDP drives a 2½–3% change in revenues, and even larger improvements in profits,” Golub wrote.\n*****\n> # April is far from cruelest month\nAside from an expected earnings bounce, some strategists have been expecting April to be a bullish time for stocks, as it has been historically.\n*****\n> Tom Lee, managing partner of Fundstrat, for instance, points to the decline in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, to pre-pandemic levels and says that’s constructive for stocks.\n*****\n> The VIX is calculated based on the puts and the calls in the S&P 500, trading on the CBOE.\n*****\n> Lee also noted that when the market closes higher on March 31, the final day of the first quarter, and again on April 1, the first day of the second quarter, the market has had a better April performance than usual.\n*****\n> Since World War II, when those two days were positive, the S&P 500 rose an average 2.4% for April, versus its usual 1.3% gain, Lee said.\n*****\n> “The bottom line is this is [a] positive environment and risk/reward for stocks. This keeps us constructive,” he wrote in a note.\n*****\n> Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the market enters April and the second quarter with a tailwind.\n*****\n> “April is usually good. It’s the best month in terms of average price change. The second quarter is not a bad quarter on average. It’s up 2.8% on average since 1990, and all 11 sectors have posted average gains,” he said.\n*****\n> Stovall said some of the cyclicals may have gotten ahead of themselves and energy, industrials and financials could pause. Those sectors have been outperforming while tech has been lagging.\n*****\n> The market enters the “sell in May” period during the second quarter. The market adage, “sell in May and go away,” is based on the idea that stocks tend to underperform from May through October.\n*****\n> “In that sell in May period, tech has been a pretty good performer. Now is probably not the time to begin bailing out of tech,” Stovall said. “Tech could end up receiving a near-term reprieve.”\n*****\n> # Fed ahead\n> The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and investors will review them for any fresh comments on inflation. With prices for fuel and other commodities already rising, investors are becoming concerned that more stimulus could send inflation higher.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said after the March meeting that the Fed sees inflationary pressures as transient, but the markets are still concerned that it could become a bigger issue. Inflation is currently well below the Fed’s 2% target.\n*****\n> The producer price index — which gauges the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output — will also be watched closely when it is reported Friday.\n*****\n> As for Fed speakers, Powell is expected to discuss the global economy on an International Monetary Fund panel Thursday, which will be moderated by CNBC’s Sara Eisen.\n*****\n> Other central bank speakers include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who speaks Tuesday and Wednesday, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin who speaks Wednesday.\n*****\n> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks on a Chicago Council on Global Affairs webinar Monday on the economic recovery Monday.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/W5VnHdw.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/OWAqXe4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/seUECBP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/8x71bbA.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/B0iQJ5r.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/walbCuS.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pBIopWq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mZ6A4CJ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H4WjcRK.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5iiOoya.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Mx4A08w.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JR37Qxb.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/EHPQCzz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Stocks Love April\n\n> “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Mark Twain\n\n> What more can we say other than few months have been kinder to stocks lately than the month of April. In fact, it was last year that saw the S&P 500 Index gain an incredible 12.7%, for one of the greatest one-month gains in history. We noted at the time that 10% or greater months tended to usually kick off strength, not mark the end of it like many were claiming last year. Once again, history looks to have rhymed.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Just how strong has April been lately? “I had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Other than my Cincinnati Bengals breaking my heart, few things are more consistent than stocks higher in April.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, April is a great month for stocks across the board:\n\n> * Since 1950 it is the second best month\n> * The past 20 years it is the best month\n> * The past 10 years it is the second best month\n> * n a post-election year it ranks fourth out of 12\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-2-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Taking it a step further, here’s what the average April looks like. It sprints out to impressive gains the first 18 days or so, then it coasts in like Usain Bolt in a race.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog-3-3.31.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Strength Day Before Good Friday Weakness Day After\n\n> Good Friday (and Easter) land at the beginning of April this year. Historically the longer-term track record of Good Friday (page 98 of STA 2021) is bullish with notable average gains by DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 on the trading day before. NASDAQ has advanced 19 of the last 20 days before Good Friday. Monday, the day after Easter has exactly the opposite record since 1980 and is in the running for the worst day after of any holiday. Since 2004 the day after has been improving with S&P 500 up 11 of the last 17. The second day after Easter has exhibited consistent strength.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/18c936f61eaab75df8a37f82d9dbe999/1d45246093ca4966-9f/s500x750/8c5d6cb1961e8e706f98e686065bf4690a97bded.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # A Humble Victory Lap\n\n> It has been a little over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and it was certainly an eventful year, to say the least. It’s also been one year since we at LPL Research upgraded our view on equities from market weight to overweight in Road to Recovery Playbook Update believing there had been a shift in the risk-reward dynamic between stocks and bonds.\n\n> It certainly was not an easy call, and it was made with the S&P 500 rallying roughly 15% from its low. Little did we know however, that the S&P 500 would stage the greatest one year rally in history. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the rally from the 2020 low eclipsed the rallies from the 2009 and 1982 lows, climbing almost 75% since the low:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Investing is a challenging endeavor, one that even the most seasoned and successful participants need to remain ever vigilant, for Mr. Market is always ready to serve a fresh batch of humble pie—a lesson we always keep in mind.\n\n> “Few on the Street were willing to lean into the market turmoil and change their outlook on stocks, but it was a call that paid off for us,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Even though we turned out to be on the correct side of history, investing is a ‘what have you done for me lately’ industry, and we have to continue to remain disciplined with our approach.”\n\n> Despite the historic rally off the low, we continue to overweight equities in our portfolios, as the backdrop of an expanding economy and favorable monetary conditions should be supportive of stocks over bonds going forward, but we acknowledge that year 2 of a bull market has a way of challenging investors.\n\n*****\n\n> # Turn Off, Tune Out\n\n> The first quarter of 2021 comes to a close today, and as fast as time seems to fly, it's been a long one. Take GameStop (GME). It may seem like months and months ago, but it wasn't until late January that the stock started to go crazy as the 'Reddit Rebellion' launched and caused a mad scramble by hedge funds to cover any and all of their short positions. Think about it. In under three months, we've seen at least two large funds (Melvin Capital and Archegos), not to mention the collapse of supply chain finance giant Greensill Capital. Sometimes we go an entire year without blowups of this magnitude.\n\n> Despite the tumultuous headlines and market volatility along with the frustrating churn in the market lately, US equities are finishing off the quarter well. Stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.9% so far this year and grouped by sector they're all averaging gains. Leading the way higher, stocks in the Energy sector stand apart from every other sector with an average gain of over 20%. After Energy, stocks in the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors are both up an average of over 15%. On the other side of the chart, sectors underperforming are generally defensive in nature with Health Care and Utilities both averaging YTD gains of less than 5%. One notable underperforming sector given its size is Technology. With an average gain of 7.2% YTD, stocks in the Technology sector are underperforming the broader market by more than 4.5 percentage points.\n\n> Given the underperformance of Technology YTD, we can't help but remember some market 'certainties' over the years that never quite came to fruition. Remember after the initial surge off the lows coming out of the Credit Crisis in 2008 and 2009? While Financials were the best performing sector coming off the lows, the rally in the sector ran out of steam and stalled out. All we kept hearing at the time was that 'the market couldn't rally without the Financials', but rally it did. Now, after Technology outperformed during COVID and through last Summer, the sector has stalled out, and we're hearing the same phrase now as we did back then with the only difference being that Technology has replaced Financials as the sector that the market couldn't rally without. Since September 2nd though, when we first started to see the 'Big Shift' in the market, the S&P 500 has nearly tripled the return of the Technology sector, and despite Tech's underperformance, the S&P 500 has still managed double-digit percentage gains. When it comes to the old conventional wisdom of the market, investors would be best served by doing the opposite of Timothy Leary by 'turning off' and 'tuning out' all the noise.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/avgsectors.png))**\n\n> In the tables below, we list the top and bottom twenty performing S&P 500 stocks so far this year. Starting with the winners, L Brands (LB) and Marathon (MRO) are both already up over 60%, while another five stocks have rallied 50%+. With the exception of HollyFrontier (HFC), which is up 39.9%, every other one of the top 20 stocks is up over 40% - in just three months! What's most notable about this table, though, isn't what's on it, but what isn't. Technology has a larger number of components in the S&P 500 than any other sector, but only one stock from the sector - Applied Materials (AMAT) - made the list of top performers, and only one other besides AMAT (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) made the top 50.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Best-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n> At the other end of the spectrum, there are only 13 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 10% YTD, and the 20th worst-performing stock is down less than 9%. And while there was only little representation from the Technology sector on the list of biggest YTD winners above, there's no shortage on the list of losers with eight of the twenty coming from that sector. It's only been three months, but stretching back to early last September, the market has gotten along just fine without the help of Technology.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Worst-Stocks-YTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Are the Financials and Energy Sectors Due for Rotation?\n\n> As we noted in today's Morning Lineup and an earlier post, the Energy sector far and away has been the best performing S&P 500 sector in Q1. The sector is on pace to close out the quarter with a gain of just under 30%. That is nearly double the return of the next best performing sector: Financials. Granted, Financials have likewise been on an impressive run, gaining over 15%.\n\n> As shown in the charts below, going back to at least 1990, Q1 of 2021 is on pace to go down as the Energy sector's single largest quarterly gain on record. Amazingly, the next two quarters that stand as runners-up have both come within the past year. Those were last quarter when the sector rose 25.78% and Q2 of 2020 when it rallied 28.68%. For the Financial sector, this quarter's gain stands in the top decile of all quarterly moves of the past three decades, and that follows last quarter's 22.52% gain which stands in the top 5%. As shown in the charts below, for both sectors, gains of 15% or more in a single quarter have been fairly uncommon with only a handful of past instances.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Bars-Sectors2.png))**\n\n> That brings to question if strong runs in one quarter result in rotation out of those sectors the following quarter. In the tables below, we show the performance of the Financials and Energy sectors from the end of quarters with gains of 15% or more. Starting with a look at Financials, that rotation has not necessarily always occurred as the sector has consistently risen over the following three months. Of the ten prior instances, there have only been two quarters, Q3 2009 and Q1 2012, in which Financials were lower by the end of the next quarter. Those were also some of the few times that Financials were lower at the end of the first and second month of the quarter. We would note, though, that the current instance is also the first time since 2009 that there have been back-to-back quarters that the sector has seen gains of 15% or more. Back during that last occurrence (Q3 2009), returns were in fact weaker after that second quarter of large gains.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Fin-2a.png))**\n\n> As for the Energy sector, of the nine prior instances where the sector rallied over 15%, this was the first time with two sequential quarters boasting 15% or larger gains. Additionally, rotation out of Energy stocks has been far more commonplace. As shown in the table below, from the conclusion of those quarters with big gains, the sector has averaged a decline throughout the next quarter.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/033121-Energy-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Stocks and Inflation\n\n> As we continue LPL Research’s Inflation Week, today we will examine how stocks have historically done at different inflation levels. For more color on our views on inflation, please read here and here, and look out for tomorrow’s blog, where we’ll examine some of the factors that have kept inflation low and that will likely continue to put a lid on inflation in the future.\n\n> Looking at S&P 500 Index returns going back to 1950, stocks have tended to like low inflation. As shown below, the lower inflation is, the better the S&P 500 Index returns tend to be, although the strong performance for negative inflation may be due to markets rebounding off of lows. Taking it a step further, if inflation is trending lower, then stocks do much better (18.8% on average) versus if inflation is trending higher (6.4% on average).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “You can’t argue with history, as it sure appears that inflation that’s under control is a tailwind for stocks,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It is when inflation starts to turn higher that it can knock stocks down. Given our base case is for modest inflation, this is another feather in the cap for the bulls.”\n\n> Looking at a scatter plot of inflation and the S&P 500, there is a fairly wide dispersion in some cases, so this is by no means a perfect indicator. Still, the regression line moves from the upper left to the lower right, suggesting lower inflation indeed historically has benefitted stocks more than higher inflation.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.31.21-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> The inflation question is one that isn’t going away, especially as the US continues to add more fiscal and monetary stimulus. Although this isn’t a very consensus call, we think inflation will be capped once we get past 2021 and this should help stocks overall.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DzPTCDd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EFoYhPI.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS MONTH'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IAo7GlZ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 4.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n( NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 4.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/LGaokuS.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  4.6.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eu0hmtC.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 4.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ew3RuFT.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Q9506N2.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 4.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/2URCkYe.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hcSTJcm.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qJ2s00r.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.9.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wEoA0Ew.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.9.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/MdchFK4.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # Paychex, Inc. $98.76\n**Paychex, Inc.
