{"title": "AMC Discussion", "selftext": "Recently, I've diversified my portfolio and put it all in AMC. Personally, I think AMC has a ton of potential for several reasons:\n\n1. 99% of AMC theaters are now open, and the pandemic has eliminated many of their competitors. Plus, there is a international surge in movie crowds as the pandemic seems to be slowing down\n2. AMC is a great momentum stock almost certain to climb higher. It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&P have only moved up 2.3% respectively.\n3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up.\n\nAlright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts.\n\nP.S This not necessarily financial advice, nor am i a financial expert, this is just my humble opinion of the stock.\n\nEdit: So a lot of people have been talking about the pandemic and how watching movies at home is the thing now, so I just to point out 3 things:\n\n1. AMC at some point may shift their marketing strategy so we should dismiss it's growth off the the way it is operating now.\n2. Also, watching movies at home is not the same as at a theater, the screen is not as bigger  and the experience as a whole is different. (Think imax and 3d stuff). Plus, people have been binge watching netflix the whole pandemic, by now they are probably ready for a change.\n3. Lastly, when it comes to the pandemic, people are getting vaccinated and they are getting more used to social distancing and masks. The point is not that people will cram back into theaters. They will come back with safety measures (social distancing, masks, etc ) and more importantly, they will feel safe and comfortable with this new normal. (unlike at the start where is was just total confusion.)\n\nEdit: May 13 - AMC is up to $13 dollars today. Not sure long how it will keep going up though.

They're struggling now because they're closed because beyond social during a pandemic doesn't work. But they will all be overwhelmed with demand in 6-9 months. Is bet my life savings on that. I don't know enough about AMC's books specifically to know whether that growth is priced in (I expect so, given the massive speculation on the artificial squeeze) so I'm not buying that stock right now - not sure how price will react.
