{"title": "Dry-Drink Portfolio Guide to Leveraged Smart-Beta", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n# Introduction\n\nHey, it's your girl Dry-Drink. Was a WSBs lurker for years, used to be that this site was about smart but risky DDs, and ballsy bets with good potential. Who can forget the legendary thesmd AMD updates from 2019? But now it seems we pride ourselves on being retards who lose money for a living with options we don't understand. What happened to us? Here's to bringing back some old-school circa 2017 WSBs.\n\nI've [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/) a few [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kspobo/true_wsb_leveraged_portfolio_continues_to_deliver/) about this [portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt0ec3/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_update_now_up_350k_108/) and strategy. I've gotten a lot of questions as to how it works and how to implement it so I've put together my definitive guide on this. From here on out, I'll just post updates of the portfolio performance periodically. I don't have a TLDR, unfortunately if you're interested in implementing this, you will have to read through this short guide. It's not super complicated once you get it, I promise.\n\n# Glossary\n\nCompensated vs Uncompensated Risk: The market rewards you for some risks, specifically the ones that cannot be diversified away (like overall market risk, or the risk of value companies). The market does not reward you with a return for taking on risks that can be diversified away. In other words, no one is paying you money for betting the farm on one stock.\n\n[Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) Criterion: The percent of your account to invest in a risky asset to have maximum compound returns. For stocks, the Kelly Criterion is given by the formula [Sharpe/Volatility](https://www.cashchronicles.com/2019/05/20/the-kelly-investment-criteria-and-optimal-leverage/). So for stocks, maximum compound return (Kelly bet) is around 0.4/20% = **200%** (that is, you borrow as much money as you have, to buy twice as much in stocks as you otherwise could, by using leverage).\n\nMargin Call: When your account equity is too low versus the stocks you hold, your broker can force you to sell stocks with a margin call. In other words, if your leverage is too high, the broker will de-leverage you automatically.\n\nPortfolio Margin (PM): A margin account that determines margin maintenance with risk models instead of set leverage targets. It will typically allow greater leverage (**not that you should use more leverage than I say later)** and, most importantly, will let you [sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) for cheap borrowing with no effect on the margin maintenance.\n\nSmart-beta: Catch-all term for equity indices or ETFs that are not market-cap weighted, but actually tilt towards additional sources of stock compensated risks (value, momentum and quality being the big three). Because these added risk sources are uncorrelated with the market, they lead to portfolios with higher returns and lower risk\n\n# Background\n\nFor maximum compound growth, you want two things: Only take risk that compensate you, and take as much as it is optimal for max returns (Kelly bet size). In this post, I am going to show you the portfolio that has the theoretically highest compound return. History confirms this portfolio works, but don't invest in this because it worked well in the past or my updates. That the theory is well-supported in historical returns and practice is just the cherry on top.\n\nBig-picture, the portfolio can be set up as follows:\n\n1. Buy a globally-diversified portfolio of smart-beta ETFs (a lot of value, quality and momentum firms). You want country, currency and sector diversification to make sure you diversify away as much of the risk you don't get paid for and only take on compensated, equity risk. Using smart-beta further increases returns.\n2. Leverage the portfolio to the optimal, mathematical number that produces highest returns (about 2:1 leverage). That is, borrow on margin to borrow twice as many shares as you otherwise could.\n3. \\- Bonus) [Sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) to get dirt-cheap financing rates for your leverage (\\~0.5% borrowing rate, instead of Interactive Brokers 1.6% margin rate). This is not required, the most important part is the actual portfolio and level of leverage (steps 1 and 2). This is just a cheaper way to borrow.\n\n**Note:** This is NOT riskless. On the contrary, this is a high-risk strategy, with plenty of financial risk. You can lose money and A LOT of money in the short/medium and, heck, even long-term. It would've lost about 83% during 2008 GFC, even more during the Great Depression. But eventually, it has and should come out ahead. All I'm saying is that it is the highest amount of risk that you would rationally take with a portfolio and hence, will have the highest average, expected, compound return. Taking any less risk (less leverage) should result in lower compound returns, that's logical. And taking any more risk (more leverage) also leads to lower compound returns (that's what the Kelly Criterion proves).\n\n# Benefits\n\n1. No position on volatility or downside protection (aka \"theta gang immune\").\n2. Only takes on compensated risk. Better global diversification and access to smart-beta products than you otherwise could with options and futures.\n3. Extremely tax efficient. It borrows as cheaply as you could with options and futures, but gains all stay unrealized.\n4. Much more protected from short-term movements (you don't lose 30% just because your favorite stock missed earnings).\n\n# Audience\n\nThe portfolio has the highest expected compound growth from index investing and requires little active management (no individual stocks or trying to time a trend). **Hence, it is ideal as a base WSB portfolio.** If you believe you can consistently trade for a living, that's great! You should probably ignore this post. But if you've lost enough money to feel like the market is a casino, here's a portfolio where you can let your money simmer and earn high returns before you decide on your next YOLO. I personally only use this; every time I have more money to invest, I just direct it into this portfolio.\n\n# My Portfolio\n\nI opened a Portfolio margin account at Interactive Brokers. You need >$100K for this (see below for smaller-account alternatives) I use a 60% USA, 25% Developed Market, 15% Emerging market split, all with low-cost, smart-beta stock ETFs. I've posted my portfolio on each of my updates but here it is once more. Again, just a bunch of stock ETFs that use smart-beta methodology, have low costs, and diversify globally. Feel free to copy my exact weights below. You'll see different positions because I tax-loss harvested back in March 2020.\n\n[Current Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/rb14mo0640u61.png?width=2952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a242fe349528291cc664942edcacba378ef011f8)\n\nSo far, I am up \\~108% annualized since June 2020 but, again, do NOT do this just because it worked well in the past. Do it because you understand and agree with the theory. I plan to do this for decades. I recommend you use Interactive Brokers due to their low margin rates. Although if you'll sell SPX boxes to avoid the margin rates, you could do it anywhere that offers portfolio margin (ex: TDA).\n\n# Managing the Portfolio\n\nYou opened a Portfolio Margin account, bought twice as much in stocks as you had money for (using your ideal ETFs in the weights shown above, or the ones I use) and even sold SPX boxes to get rid of your negative cash balance to borrow cheaply. What to do now?\n\nAs the market rises, your equity will grow and your leverage (as a percent of the account) will drop. So it is vital you re-leverage further (borrow more against your bigger account) and buy more stocks to get back up to 2:1 leverage. If markets drop in value, you'll do the opposite: control your risk by selling some positions, paying off some of the debt, and bringing leverage back down. This is KEY towards avoiding actual deep, nearly-100% losses and to obtain the highest compound return. Just like boomers rebalance their 50/50 stock/bond Vanguard portfolios back to 50/50 if it gets out of line, so should you keep your portfolio at roughly 2:1 leverage. And no, it's not \"buying high, selling low\". You can't time the markets, so just stay disciplined and rebalance. This portfolio has the highest compound return **despite** having to sell somewhat during down markets. To minimize transaction costs and the cost of weekly whipsaws, I recommend you sell and decrease leverage if your leverage is higher than 2.2x, and buy more stocks by borrowing/re-leveraging back up if your leverage is lower than 1.8x. These are the **rebalancing bands**.\n\nWhen you sell positions to deleverage, you would want to either keep the additional cash as collateral until the next SPX box expires, or just buy back a box. I recommend selling boxes in the near future (3-12 months) so you're always decently close to an expiring box, or a box so close to expiry that buying it back would entail very low spreads. BTW, when a box expires, you don't have to do anything. It is cash-settled automatically.\n\nIf you ever add money into this account, just invest it in such a way to get close to that 2:1 leverage. So if leverage was less than 2:1, you'd buy stocks with your added cash+more borrowing, if leverage was higher maybe you just keep it in cash/ST bond fund like ICSH/buy back a box spread. Play it by ear in your specific circumstance, just make sure your leverage stays within the rebalancing bands.\n\n# Timing the Market\n\nIt is reasonable to let leverage rise a bit past 2.2x if markets are quite cheap because they've dropped in value (like in March 2020). It also is reasonable to let leverage drift down if markets are at ATHs (see my current portfolio is only about 1.75:1 leverage right now). The Kelly Criterion is clear that you'd want to leverage past 2:1 if the equity risk premium is abnormally high and vice-versa, so it makes sense. Don't do A LOT of that but a little bit of opportunistic market-timing (I call it \"delayed rebalancing\" when stocks are either real cheap or real expensive) is likely warranted.\n\n# Looking Forward\n\nNo, you're not late to the party. Obviously, it would've been better to start a portfolio like this back in June 2020 when I first posted about it but hindsight is 20/20. This strategy does not require timing the markets; today is still a good time to start. Even today, stocks are decently priced, especially if using smart-beta. I expect this leveraged portfolio to have a return going forward of about 13% average annualized. Obviously, what you'll actually get short-term might be much more or much less but if you diligently stick to it, that would be the average return I expect. This is about three times as high as I expect for the very-expensive S&P500 (because of the 2:1 leverage, the international exposure and the smart beta vs the S&P 500 at a nosebleed valuation level of 37 Shiller CAPE 10).\n\n# FAQs\n\n\\- Account minimum to start?\n\nIdeally, you start with $100K (somewhat more is preferable to give you a cushion over the $100K barrier) and a portfolio margin account. Otherwise, you can just use regular margin and pay the slightly higher borrowing cost. I probably wouldn't bother if I had less than $20K, but if you have $50K or more, I'd say go for it.\n\n\\- What if I get margin called?\n\nIf you follow the strategy as you should (selling positions if losses mount, to pay back the debt and keep the leverage around 2:1) then you should never actually get to a position where your leverage is so high, your broker is liquidating you themselves. So you should never get an actual margin call.\n\n\\- What about using Leveraged ETFs (ex: SPUU)?\n\nThose have high management fees, sometimes have too much leverage (ex: UPRO), will not let you diversify globally as effectively, there are no smart-beta options and they rebalance daily (instead of using the 1.8-2.2 leverage bands I recommend). IMO, it's better to rebalance a little less frequently than daily (this is what using bands accomplishes).\n\n\\- Where can I learn more about this? How did YOU learn it?\n\nUnfortunately, I don't actually have a good resource for you. I've learned a lot about smart-beta, leverage, the Kelly Criterion and these topics to know what I'm doing here but it has been from a bunch of different sources. I hope this is enough to get you started though.\n\n\\- Why not more leverage for more returns?\n\nDon't leverage more than this. Leveraging further leads to **overbetting (a condition where you're past the Kelly Criterion).** Any more leverage than that, and your portfolio risk goes up and your return goes down. Don't be a Bill Hwang and blow up with margin calls. Be disciplined, rebalance, keep leverage around 2:1, and let the portfolio do its magic.\n\n\\- Doesn't this only work during Bull markets?\n\nThis is the opposite of the above FAQ since it implies I'm using too much leverage. This is the theoretically highest compound returning portfolio **given** the risk of stocks (i.e. including both bear and bull markets). Obviously, in bull markets, it will perform amazingly (like now). And portfolios with even more leverage will be even better. During Bear markets, it will perform worse than not using leverage (and portfolios with more leverage will do far worse). Since I can't time the market or know when good or bad periods will come, I just use the optimal leverage a long-term portfolio would need for max returns. That's 2:1.\n\n\\- This sounds like the famous Hedgefundie UPRO/TMF portfolio no?\n\nI personally think that portfolio has multiple problems (the LETFs themselves, the risk parity weights do not lead to max sharpe, even if it were max sharpe, I'm aiming for max compound growth not max Sharpe, and the leverage of 3x is just about past the Kelly Criterion). [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk71rt/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_still_going_bonkers_up/gtwe5p4/?context=3) a chain of comments where I dig into the math I used to come to these personal conclusions.\n\n\\- Doesn't this lose money during Bear markets? If you use 2:1 leverage, shouldn't it have been wiped out during the GFC (stocks dropped more than 50% then)?\n\nIt loses a ton of money during Bear markets (about 65% personally this past March, much more in historical backtests that include events like the Great Depression). I didn't say it was riskless, only that it had the highest compound return long-term than any other strategy that invests more or less in stocks. The reason it doesn't get fully wiped out is precisely because you sell positions every time your leverage rises past 2.2x, to get leverage back in line. This is crucial. Otherwise, a simple market drop of 50% over any amount of time will fully liquidate you (compound return of -100%, the exact opposite of what we're aiming for).\n\n\\- Can I do better if I add non-stock assets, or use dma200, or etc?\n\nProbably, but not by much. The main issue is that assets like commodities and bonds are so tax inefficient and I don't estimate high-enough returns for them to warrant them. That said, if you're optimistic-enough about them, add them, recalculate your Kelly Criterion, and leverage accordingly. Ditto for any other strategy like dma200; if I felt confident about them, I would add them so if you do, then add them, that's totally fine!\n\n\\- Why do you only show returns since June?\n\nBeen doing this for a few years but only have computed data from Interactive Brokers since June. Before that, I used other brokers and it would be a pain to try to compute my personal overall returns. If you don't believe I got through Dec 2018 or March 2020, then I can't really do much for you. [Here's a backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=5&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=2%3A1+Leveraged+S%26P+500&portfolioName2=S%26P+500&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=200&allocation1_2=100&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-100) since 1985 showing it wouldn't have blown up, even during 2008, (though the drawdowns can be deep, again, there's risk!) and does outperform eventually as theory would say.\n\n\\- Well, I invested in X stock and got much higher returns!\n\nGood for you (srs)! If I knew what stocks to pick to make a lot of money, I would just do that. But I have no clue, so I'm just investing in a few sources of high risk/returns, diversify away all risk I don't get paid for and leverage to the maximum compound return.\n\n\\- This doesn't belong in WSBs, why are you posting it?\n\nI thought a 2:1 smart-beta leveraged stock portfolio, funded with SPX boxes, would be the kind of portfolio WSBs would appreciate. If it's boring, I get it, I'll just post gain/loss porn from here on out any ways.\n\n(Disclaimer: This is NOT financial advice, it is purely for entertainment purposes, I literally have no idea what I'm doing)\n\n# Sources\n\nI placed links to the actual sources where relevant directly in the text above.", "id": "mtmfkk", "created_utc": 1618782884.0, "score": 453, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Hi OP, just poke one of us if you get caught again", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "!wsbgold", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Ur da man zjz!", "score": 33, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This is the high quality DD I was hoping WSB would return to.

When I factor in tax costs, they're just not worth it IMO.  \nDon't know much about dma200, sorry!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">  Any link for dma200 as an investable strategy?\n\nnot sure exactly what you're referring to but there's a paper by michael gayed on leveraged investing using the 200dma as a signal:  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2741701", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": ">\\- Can I do better if I add non-stock assets, or use dma200, or etc?  \n>  \n>Probably, but not by much. The main issue is that assets like commodities and bonds are so tax inefficient and I don't estimate high-enough returns for them to warrant them. That said, if you're optimistic-enough about them, add them, recalculate your Kelly Criterion, and leverage accordingly.
