Amazon Prime Video and Hulu have been getting more of my watch-time lately and Prime is worth the cost just for the delivery benefits, the Music/Video/etc services make their subscription all the more valuable.

Tesla writes off depreciation on their factories and amortize the cost of robots so that counts against the GAAP profits, but those factories and robots have already been paid for or are accounted for in the debt that Tesla has.\n\nThat’s why Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (or EBITDA) is considered a better indicator than profits.

The growth and the fact that they are operting so near full capacity means that while profits are low their working capital and inventory are negative / low and hence they have good cash flow.\n\nMy issue is that is Tesla is not a real \"tech\" company but is priced like one and as such they don't scale as one and are not as capitally efficient. If there is a recession or as their growth slows/stabilizes then they suddenly won't operate at full capacity and the time it takes to sell a car extends. Inventories will grow, working capital will increase and profits suffer as there is increased price pressure and factories are not operating at full capacity. The things that used to results in cash flow > profit can suddenly swing the other way.\n\nTech companies, particularly software, does not really have a concept of inventory and only very small part of their resources go towards actually producing products and often their production facilities are more elastic and a smaller part of their business in general.

This is because of the rising domestic demand and iron ore prices, higher international prices and subdued production and limited imports. As a result, it could be among the key factors for automakers announcing a price hike on its entire model range.  \nDespite the current market conditions, Tata Motors has seen a significant increase in its demand for its passenger vehicle range. The sales of its cars grew by 39 per cent in the first three quarters of the current financial year as compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.\n\n**JSW Steel’s net profit jumps** ***14 times*** **to Rs 2,669 crore backed by a strong recovery in steel demand for the three months of October-December** [Link](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/jsw-steel-s-net-profit-jumps-14-times-to-rs-2669-crore/ar-BB1d0CDZ)\n\n>\"Various high frequency economic indicators are better than the initial expectations pointing to a robust recovery.

Automotive steel sales increased by 57% y-o-y, while India's domestic automotive production grew by 16% y-o-y. Consequently, exports were much lower during the quarter. Overall value added and special products sales were up 12% y-o-y, making up 57% of overall sales versus 51% in Q2FY21. This was mainly driven by robust automotive sales and increased off-take from industrial and engineering, solar and appliances segment.\n\n**Port of Duluth-Superior saw December and January tonnage topping the previous season** ***significantly***\\*\\* [Link](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/other/pounded-by-the-pandemic-duluth-shipping-seeks-rebound-in-2021/ar-BB1d0Kdh)\n\n>The season \"will be remembered for early promise crushed by coronavirus, but the late-season rally was encouraging,\" said Jayson Hron, spokesman for the Duluth Seaway Port Authority. \"**December and January tonnage topped the previous season — significantly**, in January's case — and **with mines reopening, steel demand rising** and COVID vaccinations beginning, it hints at hope for 2021.\"\n\n**Malaysian contractors are asking the government to step in and try to regulate material pricing. Steel prices were called out among others.** [Link](https://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/165251/after-mco-prices-of-materials-have-gone-sky-high-complain-builders/)\n\n>Md Nasir Ibrahim, chairman of the Guild of Bumiputra Contractors Bhd, said that steel in particular had increased in price by nearly 40% in the last six weeks up to nearly RM3,000 a tonne.  \nHe urged the government to “interfere” by controlling the prices of these products and penalising suppliers who take part in unethical price manipulation.  \nThis was echoed by the Master Builders Association of Malaysia, who said price increases are particularly damaging to smaller stakeholders, who may not have predicted the cost of adhering to Covid-19 standard operating procedures, like testing workers and operating with a limited workforce.  \n“The government should implement strict control over prices of construction materials to prevent cartels and monopolies taking advantage of these,” it said.  \nIt further suggested that it be made mandatory for a price variation clause to be included in all contracts to account for fluctuations in material costs.\n\n**US steel buyers continue to struggle to find materials.

The surge in prices and lack of supply are opening the door for imports, some respondents said.  \nSplit between those projecting that the rally is coming to an end and others expecting prices to climb further. Respondents who think the rally has run its course pointed to weakness in the ferrous scrap market and a decline in Chinese flat-rolled prices. Sources who anticipate additional price increases were focused on tight supply, and did not see any indications that the situation will change during the first quarter.\n\n**China iron ore edges higher on supply concerns.

This would likely boost spot prices.\n\nThis is indeed good news for steelmakers around the world, **because this would mean that Chinese export prices will no longer be among the lowest in the world** and would reduce the competitive pressure on suppliers in the Asia Pacific region, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and India.\n\nThere is more granular detail to be found in the various ferrous markets, depending on demand and supply fundamentals, as well as how big a part China plays in these markets.\n\n# Steel Demand\n\nSteel Dynamics Chief Executive Market Millett says he's seeing no indications that demand for steel in the US will weaken soon. \"It's intriguing to me that there is concern about the strength of the market because right now it's absolutely incredible,\" Millett told analysts. \"We can't supply enough steel currently to the appliance and HVAC,\" markets. He's expecting auto production to expand this year and says steel demand even from the energy industry -- the company's weakest market -- is showing \"glimpses of a turnaround.\" Shares down 1.7% at $37.78.\n\nI do not think the banks believe this is real.\n\n[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/12/11/chinas-iron-ore-prices-spike-10percent-to-a-record-high-on-supply-concerns.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/12/11/chinas-iron-ore-prices-spike-10percent-to-a-record-high-on-supply-concerns.html)\n\nSupply concerns have spiked prices, but also, increased demand in finished goods - large appliances, construction materials - rebar, fasteners, steel beams, steel plate, etc\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/soaring-metals-prices-signal-bets-on-global-economic-recovery-11607250600](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/soaring-metals-prices-signal-bets-on-global-economic-recovery-11607250600)\n\n[https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3966372/STEEL-SCRAP-WRAP-Prices-hit-highs-on-tight-global-supply.html](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3966372/STEEL-SCRAP-WRAP-Prices-hit-highs-on-tight-global-supply.html)\n\n# Retail Attention\n\nI first discovered steel because I read from multiple people on multiple stock discords that they know people in the steel industry or are in the industry themselves and steel demand is insane right now. Supply isn't keeping up.\n\nAnd look at this post from Vitard member u/EverythingGunz\n\n*I run a construction business up in Canada, build 3-4 residential houses a year and maybe 2-3 commercial projects a year. My suppliers are Kent’s, Home Hardware and Home Depot. As some of you may or may not know, lumber (a commodity) Is extremely expensive right now. On average a house of 1500 sqft or more is costing 20k or more to build than the same time last year due to lumber price increases. I was just told by all my suppliers that now anything steel is also going up in price to meet lumber and they expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. So we are talking nails, screws, fasteners, clips, hardware, hangers, etc all going up in price the 1st of april. I know this is just a small part of the steel industry but it’s promising considering the current boom in the housing and construction market.*\n\nAnd another post:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2klfe2znzoi61.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4041bda0f7022acfc60fbcf0489a306b6bc88c3\n\n# TLDR\n\nI don't want to sound like a shill and I have no reason to be a shill, but I think that steel is a worthy gamble to place your bids on. There is a huge potential for a steel mania run, all the indicators point towards it, and we are early on in the speculation part of mania.
