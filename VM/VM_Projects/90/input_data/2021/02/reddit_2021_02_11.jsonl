{"title": "I want to short Tesla, but I could be not informed enough.", "selftext": "Hi guys, \n\nI am not a Tesla holder anymore these days but loved to see this company grow into this strong brand and community. \n\nI am not really happy with how Tesla is getting managed these days though, and I am planning to short Tesla because I think they cannot make this valuation come true. \n\n\nI see problems in the European market where other brands like VW and Renault can deliver products that have a better market fit in terms of quality/pricing/performance/comfort and Tesla not really improving very quickly anymore to assume that they will overcome the problems in the areas they are lacking.\n\n\nI feel it was unreasonable of the market to think that Tesla will be by far the most dominant player in the EV market in the future and that Tesla instead will be an important, but only one of the many EV brands who are competing for the market in a few years time. \n\nThat could mean that Tesla probably will never really make a lot of money with their cars if they want to keep their technology-advantage (it's expensive) or they will have to focus on having a more affordable and more reliable product, but that will make them more like the rest of the brands.  \n\nI think that Tesla tried to become too much too quickly and we all loved it, but Tesla ended up being so rich that they bought 1.5 billion of bitcoin ( I love bitcoin, but I don't see how this move makes sense, they could also just open up for bitcoin payments ) which is around the same as the R&D budget for a year. I feel this is a weird flex to the people who have problems with their cars. \n\nThis while Tesla still ranks very low in reliability tests and their margins went down in the last quarterly results so competing on price is also not realistic in the near future. \n\nYes, the factory in Berlin will help with the European market, and further models will be more competitive in terms of price and quality. I am just starting to doubt the fundamentals of the brand here, in the sense that I don't see how they can ever make enough money with their core product, due to the fact that Tesla does not have to compete like other brands. They are rich enough by now and other brands have to improve to survive. The only way to do that is to make their product a better market-fit. You see that now already starting to happen in Europe.\n\nIn an open market that normally means that other brands will outcompete Tesla and that Tesla will lose its dominant position over time. Of course, Tesla has many other things going for it, like being an energy company etc. The reality is that these are cool niches, but the same thing will probably happen: Others will step in and create a better market-fit because they can learn from Tesla and need it to improve to survive. \n\nThe same goes for Elon. Now he is so rich that it will affect him. I dislike his behavior on Twitter, look how many people invested in GME or doge because of him and most will lose money. Why would a man like him do this to his mostly uneducated audience? Why not educate them but also warn them of the risks instead?\n\n\nI feel we all investe in Tesla for a better future, which is a very good reason. But they sold themselves well,  got overpaid, lost focus, and want to be too many things at the same time and I think the market will start to realize it soon.\n\nI come here to ask you guys who are probably way more informed than me, what is my mistake in my thinking here?

How will they ever make the amount of profit needed to for this valuation?\n\n\nI am a trader not an investor, I dont hate Tesla, nor I love them. I am not saying they will go to 0, obvious the company will do well for a while. But there is so much growth priced in the stock, that this cant keep up, even if Tesla will keep on doing really really well. \n\nI dont like elon because he is just a salesguy. He didnt create Tesla, but he is great at shilling it to investors.

Tesla is disrupting both industries and others, they are providing their own insurance, they are their own dealership and service they make money on providing fueling for their cars through the supercharger network, eventually they will start eating into the rideshare business with autonomous robo-taxis too. \n\nIt's also the most vertically integrated company in its segment, making more of its cars in-house. It makes its own batteries, chips, hell, it makes its own car seats and now uses injection molding to cast giant portions of the car that eliminates 100's of parts and entire sections of manufacturing robots. \n\n  \nNo wonder Herbet Diess, CEO of VW held a crisis meeting to talk about how Tesla currently makes cars 3 times faster and more efficiently (including cost) than they can [https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/legacy-auto-advantage-vw-holds-crisis-meeting-admits-tesla-gigafactories-are-more-than-3x-as-efficient-as-their-electric-car-plants/](https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/legacy-auto-advantage-vw-holds-crisis-meeting-admits-tesla-gigafactories-are-more-than-3x-as-efficient-as-their-electric-car-plants/) .

They even sell a $10,000 software option for autopilot that is almost all margin, that's like making another car's worth of profits on the same car. In addition, it has more cash than debt, making it the only US automotive (or maybe global?) to be effectively debt-free. Show me how many companies of this size are growing revenues by 50%+ per year consistently.  \nIn the third quarter Tesla's automotive gross margin, excluding environmental credits, rose to 28.8%, from 25.8% the previous quarter. Despite the fact that Tesla's overall average price fell as it sold more lower-priced Model 3 and Model Y cars. \n\nLet me show you some of a 2014 article on Amazon vs Walmart: \n\n\"Amazon's price explosion is the reason why our Amazon versus Wal-Mart battle gets off to a puzzling start. Wal-Mart's P/E ratio of 15.6 is a typical, reasonable multiple for a large retail company. However, Amazon's P/E ratio has now grown to a bloated 509.8!  \nWhat is it about Amazon that has investors overlooking such an egregious P/E ratio? Amazon has a strong following of people who believe in the company. If you ask the average person on the street which stock is a better buy between Wal-Mart and Amazon, they would likely choose Amazon and give reasons such as \"Amazon is expanding so fast\" or \"Amazon is the future and Wal-Mart is the past\" or \"I shop on Amazon all the time!\"  \nAmazon's incredible growth  \nIs Amazon's \"rapid expansion\" the reason why Amazon's stock is so much more expensive than that of Wal-Mart? According to finviz.com, Amazon's five-year projected annual earnings growth rate is an astounding 46.6% compared to Wal-Mart's meager 7.9% growth rate! That is a huge difference; but if you compare the PEG ratios of the two companies, Amazon's ratio is still a whopping 11.0 compared to Wal-Mart's 2.0. So the growth rate is not the only reason why Amazon is so expensive.Since growth is not the reason why Amazon's stock is so much more expensive than that of Wal-Mart, and Wal-Mart is not riding into the sunset anytime soon, is there something in the popularity of the companies that makes a difference? While the answer to this question should be \"no,\" oftentimes the popularity or public perception of a company is one of the most important factors when it comes to its share price.  \nBoring ole Wal-Mart has been around for decades making the same ole boring $15 billion annual profit. Talk about a snooze fest. Amazon, on the other hand, is the new and exciting company! So what if its annual net income is only only $270 million? Haven't you heard? Amazon is \"the next big thing!\" Sometimes traders get so excited about a company that they don't care how expensive the shares are getting. They just don't want to feel like they are left out of the party.  \nAnd the winner is...  \nI would argue that with a PEG ratio of 11 this excitement surrounding Amazon looks a lot like what Alan Greenspan and Robert Shiller refer to as \"irrational exuberance.\" Others would argue that at $326 per share Amazon is worth every penny and will eventually justify the high share price years down the road. But with the S&P 500 making new all-time highs seemingly on a weekly basis, I would be very leery of stocks with extremely high multiples such as Amazon. Wal-Mart is certainly not a company that is very exciting, but consistently making money in the stock market over time is sometimes a boring process.\"\n\nHere's the thing though.

Their valuation is not based on what they produce, its based on how good Elon is at selling. Tesla is just selling cars and some connected products. Yes, they are in energy because they had to. No they wont dominate the energy market but they will play their niche role. You guys act like they will own every industry they will be in. It wont happen. Its not that easy.

Its silly. ICE market had no reason to invest in EV cars, it would not make them any more money. From their point of view it makes more sense to learn and wait till EV's are economical viable, before they start to mass produce them. Which was like a year ago or so. You see in the markets which are ahead of the US (EU and parts of Asia) that other brands fill in the niches better. Not everyone has the same budget and needs. ICE manufactures are really really good in finding niches in the market and slowly filling them with new models. Which is exactly what they are doing with EV. Mercedes, audi, bmw porsche etc will directly compete with Tesla for the premium market. And there will be 10-100 other brands in only the premium segment in a while. VW, toyota etc will be able to produce and maintain cars better and cheaper than Tesla, so they will fill the needs of the mainstream markets better. Its common sense and you guys act like it wont happen. EV market will grow, Tesla's share of total EV market will drop. Tesla's sales will go up, they will keep having production and quality problems for years. In 5 years there will be hundreds of EV's available in every market in the world. It is inevitable because EV's are just easier to produce that ICE cars, and as you say: Its a huge market and relatively easy to enter and create a car for a niche. \n\n>They even sell a $10,000 software option for autopilot that is almost all margin, that's like making another car's worth of profits on the same car. \n\nPeople paid 10k for it years ago, and still dont have their product.

A large reservation system as well as remote service.\"\n\n\"Second, Tesla maximizes use of electrons in the vehicle. No one does it better than they do. Their customers pay less for a better battery. Their focus ... after they launch the vehicle, their obsession after the launch of the vehicle, to make the customer experience better, to re-engineer the electronic components, to simplify, to address quality based on data coming off the vehicles, to reduce the bill of material based on how people actually use the vehicle, to drive vertical integration, so they do more and they solve the hardest problems at Tesla.

Elon taught himself to code at a very young age and created and sold a video game from scratch at 12 years old. He studied physics at University. Have you ever wondered how he was able to have such an incredible track record at creating extremely innovative companies? (Zip2, Paypal, SpaceX - where he did 'the impossible' according to nasa engineers of creating fully re-usable rockets) \n\nDon't take it from me, listen to these words from Jim Cantrell, rocket scientist who worked with Elon at SpaceX \"I helped Elon start the company and all of these answers are spot on. He still has my book on rocket propulsion.....\n\nWhat I found from working with Elon is that he starts by defining a goal and he puts a lot of effort into understanding what that goal is and why it is a good and valid goal. His goal, as I see it, has not changed from the day he first called me in August of 2001. I still hear it in his speeches. His goal was to make mankind a multi planetary species and to do that he had to first solve the transportation problem.\n\nOnce he has a goal, his next step is to learn as much about the topic at hand as possible from as many sources as possible. He is by far the single smartest person that I have ever worked with ... period. I can't estimate his IQ but he is very very intelligent. And not the typical egg head kind of smart. He has a real applied mind. He literally sucks the knowledge and experience out of people that he is around. He borrowed all of my college texts on rocket propulsion when we first started working together in 2001. We also hired as many of my colleagues in the rocket and spacecraft business that were willing to consult with him. It was like a gigantic spaceapalooza. At that point we were not talking about building a rocket ourselves, only launching a privately funded mission to Mars. I found out later that he was talking to a bunch of other people about rocket designs and collaborating on some spreadsheet level systems designs for launchers. Once our dealings with the Russians fell apart, he decided to build his own rocket and this was the genesis of SpaceX.\n\nSo I am going to suggest that he is successful not because his visions are grand, not because he is extraordinarily smart and not because he works incredibly hard. All of those things are true. The one major important distinction that sets him apart is his inability to consider failure. It simply is not even in his thought process. He cannot conceive of failure and that is truly remarkable. It doesn't matter if its going up against the banking system (Paypal), going up against the entire aerospace industry (SpaceX) or going up against the US auto industry (Tesla). He can't imagine NOT succeeding and that is a very critical trait that leads him ultimately to success. He and I had very similar upbringings, very similar interests and very similar early histories. He was a bit of a loner and so was I. He decided to start a software company at age 13. I decided to design and build my own stereo amplifier system at age 13. Both of us succeeded at it. We both had engineers for fathers and were extremely driven kids. What separated us, I believe, was his lack of even being able to conceive failure. I know this because this is where we parted ways at SpaceX. We got to a point where I could not see it succeeding and walked away. He didn't and succeeded. I have 25 years experience building space hardware and he had none at the time. So much for experience.\n\nI recently wrote an op-ed piece for Space News where I also suggest that his ruthlessly efficient way to deploy capital is another great reason for his success. He can almost smell the right way through a problem and he drives his staff and his organization hard to achieve it. The results speak for themselves. The article is here [End of WWII Model Shakes Up Aerospace Industry](http://www.spacenews.com/article/opinion/37245end-of-wwii-model-shakes-up-aerospace-industry).\n\nIn the end I think that we are seeing a very fundamental shift in the way our world takes on the big challenges facing humanity and Elon's Way as I call it will be considered the tip of the spear.

These are significant supply shortages. Not Tesla. \n\nSeeing analysts complain about shrinking gross margins is kind of embarrassing in my opinion — it really shows the analysts have *zero* experience or insight in global supply chains. Wjen your growing 50% or more, your suppliers are already at 100%, 110% capacity. You gotta pay them overtime, to work at night and weekends to keep up. You gotta constantly be investing in more capacity. To make a tool change, you gotta pay double overtime and bank parts, pay to store the parts, while the tool goes offline for a few weeks to make the changes. Then, you gotta pay the toolmaker overtime to work around the clock. These are what drives gross margins down— they will stabilize. No analyst knows this. Then, covid causes constant supply and lobor disruptions beyond the usual hijinks. When you have to fly tens of thousands car parts by air to work around disruption, **no shit your gross margin falls**.  Of course a smooth steady supply where you have 5 weeks to ship by sea is a cheaper method.

Going from 4 models to 7 models, while updating their older models to keep them fresh. Saying they aren’t moving fast enough to be competitive is just not an honest argument IMO. Even their new models (like Y) are getting completely new architecture when launching— traditional automakers keep a platform for decades. Europe is a smaller market than China or the US, so better to prioritize something like cybertruck which is a larger segment that sells way more for higher profits with polluting competitors, and chase the subcompact market later. Europe is the smallest of the 3 major markets and it continues to shrink for the last decade.
