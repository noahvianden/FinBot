CCIV and Lucid are combining at a transaction equity value of $11.75billion. Part of the deal was financed through a PIPE (private investment in public entity) at $15 /share. PIPE is used to raise money for shares very quickly compared to a usually equity issuance (2-3weeks for PIPE vs many months for secondary offering). This price is much lower than the trading share price as a hedge of protection against share price going down and also acts as compensation for a certain lack of liquidity in shares (PIPE investors in this case have a lock up provision so they cannot sell). CCIV essentially issued more shares at a much lower price effectively diluting the shares causing current shareholders to sell off. The sell off will occur until the issuance is priced in.
