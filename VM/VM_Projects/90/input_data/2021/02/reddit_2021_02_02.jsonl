Bring those downvotes boys, 🌈🐻 love that shit.\n\nPeople who have been here since the start of 2020  or earlier (which is now the minority of subscribers) remember separate-variation's DD in March and how we all diamond handed for the \"second leg down\". That dude might have lost WSB the most collective amount of money I've ever seen. Easily in the millions, if not tens of millions. He nailed the bottom perfectly, but was completely and utterly wrong on the \"second leg down\".\n\nThe March bottom was a quiet event - it was big daddy Jerome Powell announcing that QE infinity is now a policy.\n\nI believe the top of GME was when Melvin Capital was bailed out by Citidel for 2.5 billion. This happened on Jan. 25th. Melvin then used those funds to cover shorts and purchase calls (the 26th and 27th - that was the squeeze) and then was unwound from the trade by Sunday. Short interest reported by S3 tanked on Sunday night while WSB claimed it wasn't legit. But it was. Most of WSB has never written an option before and doesn't understand that assignment can occur over the weekend, taking as long as Sunday.\n\nThe only proof you actually need that this is the top of GME, there is a stripper on the same side of the trade as you guys. https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lac2ka/retarded_canadian_girlyoloing_all_my_tripper_fund/ This was literally a scene in *The Big Short*. **DID YOU GUYS NOT WATCH THE FUCKING MOVIE???**\n\nPositions: Long NVAX shares, Short NVAX put spreads, and long $10k in MT and VALE calls (Steel gang wya it's now officially our time)\n\nBTW - Congrats on taking profits OP.
