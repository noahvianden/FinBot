{"title": "Is shorting bonds the new infinite money glitch?", "selftext": "Good morning my fellow degenerates, hope you all are in good health and spirit. \n\n***TLDR: Shorting bonds could be one hell of a play. Shorting emerging market foreign junk grade - corporate bonds might be the fucking moonshot if I'm right.*** \n\nToday I want to talk about the most boomer investment there is: Fixed Income securities: or bonds. \n\nSo just some background information: Bonds are a debt based security. Meaning that you are loaning a company, municipality or government money in exchange for regular interest payments. But the underlying issue I see is when any significant inflation happens(it's **when** not if, more on this later), and the fed hikes rates, most of the bonds issued now and in the past few years suffer from something called interest rate risk. \n\nInterest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds. So when rates rise --> existing bonds fall. This makes sense because why would you ever keep money in a bond paying x% when the current going rate for bonds is much higher. This kind of market pressure can quickly tank bond prices. Which is why I think shorting certain corporate bonds or ETFs who hold corporate bonds is a good idea. \n\n**Why Inflation is going to spike:**\n\nThis topic has been discussed to death here on WSB by the few 🌈🐻who haven't yet been hunted to extinction by JPOW's money printer. Now I'm not going to waste your time and explain in detail every reason I believe (relatively high) inflation is just on the horizon. That being said I'm going to recap the highlights of the core arguments:\n\nM1(Money supply) has increased drastically through quantitative easing, but unlike '08 where they lowered rates through decreasing yields on treasuries, they've also started buying up other debt securities **directly** decreasing yields across the board. They did this to help ease the burden on businesses, and allow them to borrow money for much cheaper. They also did this because the credit market froze and when the debt market freezes you know shit is about to go down. But this time, also unlike '08 the fed went full BRRRRRR and well...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Does injecting this much money into the system seem sustainable to you?](https://preview.redd.it/fqcibc65ezj61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d0c2609a617f0bab6205f30d1b90c293dac884e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe graph really speaks for itself. So much money has been injected into the economy through the debt markets that bonds yields are practically nothing. The reason we haven't seen that money actually inflate the economy is because the **velocity** **of money** has tanked. \n\nFor the retards in the back who fell asleep in econ 101: the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands to purchase a good or service within a given timeframe. Because economies all across the world are dampened at the moment with all the restrictions and shutdowns the average consumer is spending much less now than they would otherwise be expected to. \n\n[The velocity of money is going to skyrocket as the economies of the world open back up.](https://preview.redd.it/lvzafh5zfzj61.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=735b0e7796514ed098450521303cb7bfcabf0867)\n\nAs all this money, which was previously locked up in households and businesses reenters the economy we'll likely see a sharp uptick in inflation. Now the people who run the federal reserve aren't dumb, they realize that this sharp rise in inflation is bad. The Fed doesn't want to see runaway inflation, and so they'll do whatever they can to counteract the effects of printing this much money. \n\nThe most effective way of the fed counteracting all this printing is by creating a big negative liquidity shock. This is known as quantitative tightening. (Read raising interest rates). Which is going to absolutely decimate bond prices. \n\nWhich is why credit where credit is due: As a liquidity shock occurs the market usually does sell off so the 🌈🐻 converting to a cash position isn't actually the worst thing you could do. But then again being cash gang means inflation gang is slowly eating your effective capital. It also means you hold a position even more fucking boomer (read: boring as shit) than investing in bonds. Congrats!?\n\nNow that we established what interest rate risk is, how it effects bonds and why we're likely to see a substantial amount of it in the coming months / years, it's time to narrow down the pool of bonds we could short. \n\nGovernments across the world are printing money like there's no tomorrow, and this is because the 'growth corrected interest rate' is negative. It's not only negative in Europe and Japan but also much of the developing world. Which means governments there are much likelier to take on higher amounts of debt. Now mathematically speaking this is fine, as long as compound growth outpaces or stays in line with compound interest, this debt is manageable. It becomes less and less of a burden with each subsequent year (inflation). The problem occurs when that growth is strained or when interest rates get hiked. \n\n[Most rates are effectively negative accounting for growth](https://preview.redd.it/7c49p6gckzj61.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=11be27b9e3264f759ebade62098727b026bb1e75)\n\nI think the prime target is emerging market foreign junk grade - corporate bonds, that are denominated in USD. The reason I say this, is in the event of QT by the fed, there will be a liquidity shock, creating a spike in demand for (US) dollars, which is what the world relies on for most global trade. This makes the dollar gain value in relation to other currencies quite quickly and probably unexpectedly. (Unless the market prices this in, which will see these bonds decrease in value anyway \\[making your short position profitable\\])\n\nBonds from companies that primarily do business in local currencies, but hold debt denominated in dollars face: Exchange rate risk: If the price of their local currency falls in relation to the US dollar they end up paying much more than expected (in their local currency) to keep up with their payments. If this is not an investment grade bond it means rating agencies think the company has heightened default risk. So this very well could be the straw that breaks the camel's back and bankrupts some of these companies even if they stay solvent I think the increased risk would cause a decent sell off.\n\n**Now because I'm not blind and I see the sentiment on this sub and their views on short selling:** \n\nUnlike Melvin and co I am not over shorting or illegally (naked) short selling a company and directly engineering the failure of these assets / companies. I am merely using the data available to me and making a bet on where bond prices will be in a few years time. If I enter this trade and / or make money off it I will donate a portion of the winnings to a charity that operates within the emerging markets I shorted. \n\n**Why the fuck are you telling me this now if this isn't going to happen for a while?**\n\nBecause the sooner individual investors recognize the opportunity, the sooner individual investors can pick the best targets. Furthermore all of this is for naught if rate hikes are priced in before individual investors enter their short position.\n\n**tHiS iS aLrEaDy PrIcEd iN**\n\nNo the fuck it isn't. Why do you think there's usually a market selloff and downward pressure on debt markets directly following rate hike announcements? Unless the news is ridiculously old most of the time it isn't priced in. I watched you retards claim Disney + was priced in for weeks and I still saw Disney's stock spike on rollout day. \n\n**DISCLAIMERS:**\n\nDisclaimer: I am not as familiar with debt markets as I am with derivative and equity markets so I may have missed something obvious. There's a reason I post this shit before I actually call my broker to initiate the short position. **I am also not a certified financial advisor**, investment in any security poses risk. Not all positions are suitable for all investors. Keep your goals, needs and risk appetite in mind before you invest. \n\nDisclaimer 2: Shorting debt instruments like bonds carries hidden interest payment risk: You're liable for paying the interest payments until you close out of your short position. Bonds are also much less liquid than stocks, so finding bonds to close out your position could be difficult. Shorting is also an unlimited risk strategy. So idk maybe buy calls on the bonds to hedge. \n\nLet me know what you think! Am I the next Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry or the most retarded thing this sub has seen since Robinhood box spreads?
