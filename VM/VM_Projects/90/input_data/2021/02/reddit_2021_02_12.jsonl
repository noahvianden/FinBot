Gary’s argument is comparing those $5k sales to $50k Tesla sales ...**\n\nYes, he is - because the fact that the Hongguang MINI is cheaper than a Tesla, or that it can’t be sold in the EU or US, is only relevant when discussing US or EV market share. It is irrelevant when discussing *global* EV market share. Tesla competes in the EV market in China, as does the Hongguang MINI - so when discussing EV market share, it’s relevant to the discussion. \n\nDoes the Mini compete with Tesla’s existing products? No, but it does eat into global EV market share. And when forecasting Tesla’s EV market share, this was already taken into consideration.

These are my words, but I think it's what Gary was getting at.\n\nHow so?\n\nWell, let's just take it to a logical extreme.  If Tesla were to produce 5 million cars this year, and post them for sale at today's prices, would it sell every vehicle?  If you answered yes, then consider this: Tesla will produce and sell around 1 million cars this year.  Does that mean that at the end of the year there will be 4 million people waiting to get a Tesla?  Those 4 million people would represent approximately 2.5 to 3 years of production and sales.  So is there a 3 year waiting list to get a Tesla?  No there isn't.  So what's going on?\n\nWell, clearly there is some sort of supply/demand balancing act going on.  The true waiting list for Tesla is approximately 2 to 7 weeks right now (Canada/US Model Y/3) yes?  So I guess it means that at today's prices, and at today's EV adoption sentiment and penetration, and today's customer awareness, there are enough potential Tesla customers to imply a 2 to 7 week backlog.   No more, no less.  The rest of the potential customers either opt to get something else that they can get in a shorter time frame, or they opt to get something cheaper, or something from another brand, and after that the rest of the people either aren't ready to buy an EV or they aren't looking to buy a new car.\n\nTesla could increase demand by lowering prices, or by paying for advertising, or something else.  But my point is, the current demand implies a 2 to 7 week backlog.  Not 3 years.  Not 10  years.  Therefore, to simply keep repeating \"Tesla sells every car they produce\" is very one dimensional and does not tell the whole story.\n\nA more complete story probably involves Tesla playing a very careful game of optimization where they are selecting prices, expansion rates for the growth of the company, and production rates for each model at each factory that optimize their long term growth and business health.  To simply claim that they are \"growing as fast as they can\" and that they \"sell every car they produce\" is at best an over simplification, and at worst a meaningless analysis.\n\nI am still very bullish on Tesla.  I just remember hearing this argument in the past over and over that Tesla sells every car they produce and thinking to myself \"yeah but, doesn't every car manufacturer?\"\n\nEdit: I just want to add, I think a more complete statement (based partly on comments in this thread by u/\\_\\_TSLA\\_\\_ about Tesla's business health and demand for the product is:\n\n\"Tesla sells every vehicle they produce, all while keeping sales prices high and healthy, profit margins wide, and growing the company at over 50% growth per year.\"", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Gary hates bitcoin, Telsa buying bitcoin was his trigger to sell.
