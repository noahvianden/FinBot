No fundamental based investor buys a company with a PE ratio over 1.000. Just none! At least no one who knows a bit about value investing, valuation and reading financial information. People in here will tell different, but thats ok. Everyone needs to have his own opionion. You can justify a high PE with growth rates. If you want to be optimistic- you can say the PE ratio can be double the growth rate. Which means (assuming a growth rate of 500% per year), Tesla would be the only existing company in like 3-4 years. **-> Fundamental based investors only sell right now (or sold months ago) or hold very longlonglonglongterm, but not buying.**\n2. **Momentum investors** (looking at the chart, but not daytraders!). They had a very good time last year and (imo) were the ones who drove Tesla stock that high. Tesla was one of the most positive momentum stocks over the whole year. Now the momentum seems to shift, which will make them sell their shares and move on to other stocks. I am not a technical analyst, neither am I very good at it. But it is easy to see the stock shifted from positive chart signals to negative ones. For example a very important indicator, the MACD, created a strong sell signal on friday on a weekly chart. This could be the reason why the stock was sold heavily in the last minute of friday. Some momentum investors anticipated that the stock will close at around $670 which will strengthen the downtrend momentum in the technicnal analysis. Interestingly, most momentum traders are instituions and not retail traders. I didn't know that for a long time. **-> Momentum investors will start to sell right now due to the technical downtrend.**\n3. **Noise traders/investors** (most retail Investors). Somewhere between 1 and 2. Have no idea how the stock market really works and what they are actually doing. But they think they are smarter than \"the market\". They lose money in the longterm and fuel the investors from 1 and 2. **-> Think they buy the fucking dip because they missed the party last year and so one. They don't recongnize the party is over for now and they are late. They are the most of the buyers right now.** *(*[*https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/noise-trader/*](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/noise-trader/)*)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So as a conclusion, the sell-off at the end of friday was made by the momentum investors.** But that's just my analysis. Everyone fell free to make your interpretation of the last-minute-sell-off at friday :)", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "More likely a gamma effect from all the ITM puts.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "That's also a possibility.

Fundamental investors. No fundamental based investor buys a company with a PE ratio over 1.000. Just none!\n\nIs that a good thing?? Like, does that mean that no fundamental investor has ever bought any shares in Tesla for over a decade?\n\nI think the lowest (positive) PE ratio Tesla has ever had was over 500, and it was only under 1,000 for a quarter or two. Does that mean that fundamental investors were buying Tesla for only 6 months out of the last decade and missed one of the best performing stocks of the last decade?\n\nI don't know if it makes sense to be a fundamental investor if it means you're not allowed to buy companies with \"bad\" PE ratios? It seems like you'd miss out on an the best performing stocks? Which is a real bummer because most long term \"market\" growth is driven by a tiny number of [stocks with great returns](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/06/23/most-stockmarket-returns-come-from-a-tiny-fraction-of-shares).\n\nAll these fundamental investors would've been \"locked out\" of investing in Amazon for the beginning of the last decade and missed out on 10x returns.\n\n\nI'd say it's much more likely that long term fundamental investors are already invested in Tesla, from back when the PE ratios were much worse. And if they're following any \"rules\" for investing they're worried about diversification and concentration?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Great point! As I said, fundamental investors will not buy right now, they only will hold our sell. Which implies they bought at some point. There is no general rule for the whole investing thing. And companies which are new or just started to deliver their first product are treated differently. The valuation changes when the company makes its first profit, you start to see how big margins are and how the company can really stick to its announcements/plans.

I listened to a long discussion on the gameification of the stock market and your #2 and #3 are well represented in the segment of retail stock investors who are “playing” the markets. It’s a very new phenomenon and there isn’t a ton of data for this specific group yet. But it’s huge force in moving prices right now and the hedge fund guys are spending bigly to gain an understanding of the group and to start making some predictive models. For the gamers its going to mean that there were will be some high profile winners from retail, but in the end the big data is stacked against you and me, meaning the large majority of those gaming the market are gonna be in the bag holder camp more often than not. That already happened with GME, for every retail trader that made 20K (or more) there was a hedge fund that made a lot more and a massive group from retail that lost. RobbinHood sells the data from its trading platform, as it happens in real time, to the hedge funds as do the other “free” trading platforms. \n\n\n\nTSLA is an interesting stock to watch in this new era since retail interest is still massive and along with a core group of adherents there is an even larger group of momentum retail (gamers) in the stock all the time. Index funds don’t really move individual stocks after they are established in the index and that usually causes the stock to be stable (as stocks go). Tesla is a real outlier here as well. You would have expected the volatility to decrease dramatically after it was fully bought by the index funds, but that hasn’t happened. \n\n\n\nIn short, its an interesting chart to watch evolve.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It was trading around $150 last March.

Not to mention they got added to S&P 500, which had a big effect on how many shares are available and therefore the price. And while doing that most of the short interest, that was depressing the price, for squeezed out.\n\nI could see an argument that it was overvalued with it was in the high 800s, especially before the Q4 results.\n\n> Be logical, TSLA currently does not produce what their valuation suggests they should be producing. It’s share price is based heavily on its potential.\n\nYeah, obviously, since that's how all stocks work? Stocks are priced off or profits from the next 5+ years (at least) not the profits from current, or past, production. Logical people should be basing Tesla's stock price off the expectation of significant growth over the next few years, otherwise they're going to be significantly undervaluing it.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "First: why Tesla should continue to receive the credits. Then: why they’re negligible.\n\nICE cars have had more than 100 years to improve their technology to become more efficient and environmentally friendly. In this time, they’ve had a ton of government support (incentives to build factories,\nbailouts). It makes sense that Tesla receives government support. ICE cars are messing up the air we breathe, which puts a cost on our lives and health care. It makes sense that this externality has a price.\n\nYes, in the profitable last few earnings reports, the credits were the difference between a small profit & a small loss. But last quarter, the credits were about the same as Elon’s stock-based compensation (only an expense because Tesla’s stock is going to Mars). They’re growing like crazy. If they slowed down growth, they could easily be profitable at current output with their amazing automotive gross margins ~20% and improving. They have something like a billion dollars of cash revenue from FSD (can’t remember exact figure) that they haven’t yet recognized as profit yet. As it becomes “feature complete”, FSD revenue should soon become higher than the tax credits.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "The percentage of profit that comes from credits doesn't really matter. What matters is the percentage of *revenues*, and it's not a huge or worrying percentage of revenue. Tesla overwhelmingly makes money from selling cars (at a very decent profit margin), and their ability to grow sales consistently, while keeping the prior margin high, is a very good sign.\n\nAnd it seems to me too be too much of a coincidence that tesla just about breaks even every quarter (on a GAAP basis) and then usually makes a small profit based on credit sales, even in very different market and production conditions. That says to me that they're probably targeting 0 GAAP profit, and any EV credit sales that come in during the quarter are just a bonus.\n\nI think that's the right choice, and if they didn't care about the stock price at all, they should maybe even be targeting a little more growth and small GAAP loses every quarter?\n\nThey're strongly cash flow positive, so GAAP profits or loses don't really matter in the short term. And they're able to fund most of their expansion from free cash flow, which is great. And they're able to raise cash cheaply to fund even more ambitious growth, which is just a nice bonus.\n\nIf anything, I'd be more worried about how regulatory credits are propping up the EV businesses of legacy automakers by providing a justification for selling cars at a loss, as long as volume isn't too high.
