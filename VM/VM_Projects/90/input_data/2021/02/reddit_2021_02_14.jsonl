I would like to point out that the big advantage with T is the price action. It rarely trades above $29 and rarely trades below $28. In the March lows it fell only to $26. \n\nKnowing this and trusting this is the key element to this trade, if you have no faith it is hard to stay resolute. If the stock does not rally to a gain in the underlying, I will simply sell another weekly call. If the underlying falls in price I will buy another LEAP and sell 2 calls. If the price dips below $28.50 I will still sell the $29. \n\n(2.)If the $29 call expires itm you will be able to exercise your long leg to pay the short leg. Personally I close the trade before this happens by buying back the short call at a loss and selling the long call at a gain. This is because my broker sometimes issues me a margin call even though my long leg can cover the short leg.
