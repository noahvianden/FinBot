It helps if you understand the underlying calculus - they're derivatives. Anyway, without getting into calculus, here's a basic summary:\n\nDelta: If the stock increases $1 in value, how much will the value of this option change? If you buy a call in $ABC with a delta of 0.75 at a premium of $1.25, and $ABC's price increases from $200 to $201, your option's value is expected to increase from $1.25 to $2.00.\n\nGamma: If the stock increases $1 in value, how much will the Delta change? If you buy a call in $ABC with a delta of 0.75 and a gamma of 0.10, and $ABC's price increases from $200 to $201, your option's delta is expected to increase from 0.75 to 0.85. This means the next time the stock price moves, the option price will move even more, because the delta has changed.\n\nTheta: When the stock gets 1 day closer to expiration, assuming everything else remains the same, how much will the value of this option change? If you buy a call in $ABC with a theta of -0.1 at a premium of $10.00, then that option will be worth $9.90 the next day (not accounting for any other changes in price, etc.)\n\nThere are others that function similarly but with different statistics, but for short-term trades like I do, these are what I look at. \n\nNow, keep in mind these numbers can all be positive or negative.\n\nDelta and gamma are typically positive with calls and negative with puts. Theta is always negative because it wouldn't make sense for the option value to decay in reverse. \n\nSo, in short, with calls you want high positive delta, high positive gamma, and theta as close as possible to zero. Do the quick math to see how much your call could go up if the stock hits its 52 week high again. Also consider if the stock goes down (delta works in reverse too). \n\nGood luck!

Remember that you aren't required to take the earnings week expiration - you can go to next month for wider (and still profitable) strikes.  This has really saved my ass on earnings more than once.\n4. compare HV and IV charts, look for better IV, or long term IV trends - sometimes it's really choppy and you won't get paid for it! -sometimes IV just dropped (but rank didn't get the message, or some other issue)\n5. slap a short call and put at 20 delta. might need to tweak if the price is moving around.

I thought about alerts or stops or something, but just keeping a 2nd screen up to watch the price vibrate between my strikes, or even just a list with (cumulative/position) delta displayed is good enough (I'm obviously aiming for close to zero, but can tolerate +/- 20 depending on product). The daily P&L is also very telling.  I can get away with checking in less (2 per day? 1 per day if they're 'safe'?) but prefer more so I just have a display off to the side while I do other work and check in when I can.\n\nThen there's a tradeoff too: I can manage everything in mere minutes a day, but keeping some attention throughout the day keeps me engaged, learning more, and thinking about optimizing.
