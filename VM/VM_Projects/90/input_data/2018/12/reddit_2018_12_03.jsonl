After designing it with an HDL you generate a netlist. After, you need to *exhaustively verify* the design to make sure that the underlying hardware and logic match up. Verification alone is 75% if the job. You need to place and route and then perform a timing analysis. And then verify some more to make sure it matches your spec. After all this you send the design to a manufacturer which, by the way, has an upfront cost of millions on top of the price you pay per chip. If you fuck up one step and realize it too late after the chip has been manufactured, then it's back to the drawing board and you've wasted millions.
