Theres simply too many smart people working on much better AI.\n\nAR - May be something to it. Could tie in with smartphones well. However they still have strong competition from google mainly. Eventhough google has been quickly deteriorating inside as well.\n\nSelf driving cars - They have an ability to work with third parties, but tesla is the leader in this field, and they still will have to pass many hurdles with regulation. I dont see apple really being able to compete with teslas tech for atleast 5 years.\n\nI would consider apple alnost worthless if not for their brand, which is dying quickly, and the fact that they could dominate the market in a year if they would open IOS up as a root level OS with features people like.\n\nApple makes good hardware, but they are overpriced, and the hardware is very limited by the software which relies on very shady bussiness models like trying to force users to use itunes, apple wireless headphones, things like that. Android is much more capable then IOS atm, and android is very locked down to say a computer OS like windows or linux.\n\nThe best thing apple has is their brand, and as more people get used to using their phones more as computers, it is very hard for apple to compete.\n\nI really hope x86-64 with built in gamepads, like the GPD win 2, phones become mainstream soon.

Many people may be like that, but these are my own ideas. I'll admit that I dont like apple, but it seems that every since Steve Jobs passed away, they have went downhill.\n\nThe thing is, i really like that apple is more privacy focused, and I also know that they could turn it around in no time, if they would open up the platform.\n\nThe things you said. AI, AR, and the other things. I dont think its going to save them. The thing with AI, is theres like 100 different products that could end up being the best one. Its also extreamly complicaited and a good ways off. Neural networks take.alot of computer power, and dont offer much usefulness beyond pattern reconition. Id say good AI is atleast 20 years off, if not much more.\n\nAR could be something they develop that is good, and helps them finacially, but their main competition, google is good too, even though google has been going down hill. I see it as maybe going either way. I think apple and google both have a good chance to be the one who gets good tech first.\n\nThe main problem with apple though is their bussiness strategy. They arent very heavy in the ad market I think, and the only real selling point of their phones is the brand. Many people just like iphones, and are familiar with them. However as phones become more integrated in peoples lives and start to be more useful for different things, apples walled garden approch to software is going to strangle them. As far as build quality. Android phones of similar price are good or better, androids UI is getting easier for non tech savy people to use. More and more people are jumping to android everyday. Its a trend that can be seen by looking at sales numbers or other metrics.\n\nApple getting rid of the headphone jack to try and sell their headphones was a big red flag to me. They are doubling down on the biggest mistake they have made since the beginning. They need to open their platform up to third parties, and power users, before they lose too much market share.\n\nThe executive board is the single biggest problem with them. As far as self driving cars, they have a good relationship with auto makers, and could get the tech out fairly easy, but they have to compete with tesla. Tesla doesng license their tech so its possible to do, but they still have to develop it, and the equipmemt needed to do self driving is exspensive, probably adds 5000 at the minimum to the sticker price, anx tbey also have to worry about regulation, which hasnt been a big problem yet because self driving tech isnt very ubiquitous.\n\nAt the current time, apple is going down hill, but they could turn it around quickly if they decided to open their platform up. They have a chance, but if they wait too long they will lose too much market share.\n\nIf i was you. I would sell or diversify and wait a bit to see what they do. You wont lose any money really, and theres a gokd chance imo that they will lose a significant chunck of tbeir value over the next couple of years at their current rate. You could always buy back in later.\n\nDont let your fanboyism blind you. You have alot of money at stake. Im pretty good at predicting the tech stocks.
