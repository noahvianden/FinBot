{"title": "Top Ten Reasons to Buy Tesla $TSLA", "selftext": "1. Tesla is on track to produce 500 cars a day at all production facilities as of this week.  \n2. Elon promised us the \"short burn of the century,\" and if there is one thing we can trust, its his hyperbolic statements about the future.  \n3. News just \"leaked\" about a new China gigafactory.  \n4. Waymo is a stupid name. Who wants to drive a car powered by Waymo?  \n5. All the people who die a firey death in a Tesla serve as sacrificial offerings to the deities of autonomous car driving, propelling the rest of us to tendies heaven.  \n6. When grocery shopping, the frunk in a Tesla 3 can comfortably fit a small bag of grapes or a hot pocket.\n7. A Model X just broke the electric towing record by pulling a Boeing 787, which is relevant to the stock price because hey look over there.  \n8. Apple could buy Tesla at some point in the future hypothetically and was rumored to have done diligence twice. When asked about this Elon got all coy and said 'call me maybe?'  \n9. There are only two hypothetical futures (1) Tesla dominates and scores one for innovation or (2) The incumbents like GM, Porsche, etc continue to own your bitch ass. I know what side of history I'm rooting for.  \n10. Tesla has 450,000 Model 3 reservations. At an avg price of $45k that is $20 billion of untapped revenue. Once the cow starts to get milked we are all going to be sucking at the teat of Elon Musk for decades to come.\n\nEdit: Tesla holdings https://i.imgur.com/fbDT4sE.png", "id": "8jm0nh", "created_utc": 1526394711.0, "score": 103, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": ">  $20 billion of untapped revenue \n\nand $30 billion of untapped expenses :D", "score": 109, "replies": [{"body": "\"We lose 5k per car, but don't worry, we'll make it up in volume!\"", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "Classic USPS strategy ", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "By law USPS has to make profit.

Horrid analogy that you didn’t backup whatsoever.\n\n“Tesla can only operate if its shares trade rich”\nWhat makes you think tesla’s shares are even trading rich now? Another unsupported opinion. Snapchat sells ad space on a shitty app to 12 year old kids and was valued at 20bil not too long ago. If you can’t see the value in Tesla at a 50b valuation after all your research, stock investing isn’t for you, open an ally savings account.  \n\n“If the shares tank, the company has to turn off its lights”\nShares have tanked, many, many times. Guess what, lights are on and new factories are going up.\n\n“Tesla only exists so long as capital markets will continue to fund Tesla”\nCapital markets will continue to fun tesla as long as they have a PROVEN REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCT that is in massive demand.  \n\n“Who actually wants to buy that?\"\nApple has done DD twice to consider a TSLA acquisition and has 250bil+ in free capital. Anyone in half a brain would be interested in tesla and their patents. Their drive chip hardware, car software suite, autopilot software, worldwide supercharging infrastructure and battery pack technology are all industry leading by a massive margin.

And I don't see T. Rowe Price single handedly supporting the price especially in the face of a credit downgrade, poor Q2 results, or a production miss.”\nFidelity has been taking TSLA profit all year and still hold just under half their original stake.
