That's why!\n\nBuying 100 shares at $177 requires you to tie up $17,700 in capital and expose it to risk.  Buying a call with a strike of $180 only requires $85 (assuming price of call option is $0.85).  Whoever is buying the $180 call is anticipating that the price will jump up above $180.85 (break even point).  Options give a 100:1 leverage, so it's a $1 return for every penny above $180.85.  Small chance, but it occasionally happens.  Buying 10 of these contracts for $0.85 each ($0.85 x 100 shares per contract x 10 contracts = $850 total) gives a 1000:1 return.  $10 for every penny above $180.85...otherwise known as the proverbial \"faggots delight\" (FD).  Low probability of happening, but high payout when it does happen.  They're okay with throwing away $85 (or $850) for the 100x or 1000x payout if it hits.\n\nIf someone wanted to own 100 shares, they would just buy them for $177 or sell an ATM put to get it exercised for cost basis of $177 minus premium collected on put...but again, that will tie up $17,700.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for breaking it down I really need to learn more about options ASAP ", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The 180 strike price is for a future date.\n\nIf Apple goes to 180 and just stops, then yeah, buying the stocks would be worth more than the call; but what if Apple keeps going up?
