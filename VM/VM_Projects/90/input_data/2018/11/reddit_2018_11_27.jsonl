{"title": "I think Google is in the process of acquiring Snapchat as we speak.", "selftext": "Google reportedly offered to acquire them for $30 billion in 2016 but Snapchat ultimately chose to go public instead. \n\nUnfortunately, Snapchat's stock is at one fourth of their IPO price with a current market cap of merely $8 billion. \n\nThis plummet in valuation is very reminiscent of when LinkedIn stock dropped by 50% in 2016 due to slowing growth. Remember, that discounted valuation resulted in Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn just a few months later.\n\nSnapchat's declining stock price is largely driven by two factors: disappointing earnings and declining user growth. \n\nGoogle can easily solve both of these things. First, they can leverage existing advertising data from Google and YouTube to make Snapchat ads much more targeted and thus charge more per impression to finally make Snapchat profitable. \n\nNext, Google can have Snapchat come pre-installed on all Android smartphones by default. This would help fuel new user growth in Android dominated emerging market countries in which Snapchat is currently struggling. \n\nGiven the death of Google Plus last month, there's a hole in Google's product portfolio. It's just a matter of time until Google acquires Snapchat to fill it. \n\nYOLO all in?
