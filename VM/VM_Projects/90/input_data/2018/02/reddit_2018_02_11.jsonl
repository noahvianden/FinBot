Right now, the markets are dipping to where people can shift stocks into bonds.  This could be enough to destabilize the market if quite a few banks have way too much invested in stocks and if they borrowed too much or have not enough liquidity to bear the brunt of this.  A lot of what makes the markets crash is the requirement to hold on to assets for too long in order to make the right return.  In 2008, the spike in oil is what was the sharp pop in the markets.  Right now, it is bonds to stocks because no one wants the government bonds because the returns are too great in the stock market and other areas.  So in order for the government to be able to sell the bonds, they have to drive the price down which means a higher return.  This then gets money managers the opportunity to sell their stock and shift that money over into US bonds.  If too many companies are dependent on stock returns and they have over leveraged in order to max out their gains and satisfy their clients then we should be okay.  I don't see a crash but I think we will see a flat return this year.  The tax reform is going to spike in construction and supplies.  The reason that Cali and NY were taxed higher income taxes is because this will incentivize them to move into a cheaper area spiking construction where they go.

Right now though is the perfect time for a \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" type of money making marketing bs that helps motivate people to profit tremendously until the next downturn.
