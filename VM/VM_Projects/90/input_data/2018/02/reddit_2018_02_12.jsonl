Spotify is a big part of that \n\nTheir problem, and it sure is a big one, is Apple Music. Spotify's future success and profitability will, to some degree, be inversely inversely related to iPhone's market share. And we know how \"sticky\" iPhones are with their customers - even if they are upgrading the actual phones slower. iPhone users are choosing Apple Music and considering the kinda group think that Apple fans have when the % of iPhone owners using Apple Music hits like 50% that number is going to grow to its saturation point (estimating here) of 85% quickly. Spotify almost doubles the total users of Apple (though I wonder how many people using Apple Music actually delete their Spotify app and account within the first few months.... could be some ghost users with Spotify's numbers). Considering the importance of Apple diversifying its revenue stream away from iPhone sales this isn't going to be something they turn away from. \n\nSpotify will likely end up as the king of the Android, but since Apple Music is available on Android it won't be a slaughter, I'm guessing more like a 65/35 split for the two companies. iPhone owners will be, as I mentioned earlier, more of a landslide in Apple Music's direction. It is worth noting that worldwide market share of Android is growing faster than iOS, but it varies greatly region to region. In North America iPhones make up about 40% of the smartphone market share which is pretty incredible considering the premium price.\n\nAll in all it is going to be an incredibly interesting contest between the two apps. If I had to pick a winner in global market share 5 years from now I would go with Spotify.
