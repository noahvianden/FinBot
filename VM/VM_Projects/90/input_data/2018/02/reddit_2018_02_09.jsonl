{"title": "Guys, I am introducing a new security: VIX^2, the world's first 2nd order derivative fund.", "selftext": "Are you tired on betting on the volatility of the stock market?  Be bored no more!  Now you can bet on the volatility of the volatility of the stock market with VIX^2 today!  \n\nImagine you are driving around in your Jaguar F-type R and you see a 55 mph speed limit sign.  You come to a dead stop and stomp on the gas.  A cop comes and pulls you over and tells you that you were traveling at a high rate of speed.  You smile and say to that jackass that there is no such thing as a rate of speed limit and that you simply accelerated to 55 mph.  You go on further to explain that speed is the rate of distance over time, and that acceleration is the rate of speed over time.  The cop nods and gives you his girlfriend as a trophy for your superior intellect.\n\nTrading in VIX^2 is just like that.  Why cruise at 55 mph worried about the next speed trap when you can zoom up to that speed in a matter of a few seconds, skid out of control and zoom back up again?  \n\nI am also offering XIV^2 for those who are prone to fatal deceleration events.  Imagine if Paul Walker had a few shares of this, just WOW!\n\nEdit: Keep tuned for my new 3rd order derivatives.
