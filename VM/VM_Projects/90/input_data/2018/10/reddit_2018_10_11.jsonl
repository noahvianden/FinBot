Even if they got approval in the US, the sales would probably be a drop in the bucket of overall IQOS sales. \n\nPeople aren't going to start smoking the IQOS if they never smoked anything before. So they either have to take them away from competitors like JUUL or convert them from regular cigarette customers. If they're already smoking a $PM combustible product, they're just shifting that revenue from one segment to another. \n\nIf you're pitching it as a cessation device, then the whole theory is that people stop smoking it entirely. So instead of killing their customers they're taking them off of smoking entirely. If it doesn't have flavor, I would rather use a flavored device to quit smoking, especially if you're coming off of menthol cigarettes.\n\nAnd let's be honest, they want kids to start smoking. A flavorless, smokeless device isn't going to attract the vape kids at all. ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with most of what you've said.
