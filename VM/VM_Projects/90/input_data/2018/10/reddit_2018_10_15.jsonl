If you were to actually execute a call that would mean you’d be buying 100 shares of that stock at the strike price. If you’re not planning on buying 100 stocks then you really just want the stock to go up by a reasonable amount for call and down by a reasonable amount for puts. If it only goes up or down a little the price of the call or put would go down because options’ values go down over time. It also has a price per share so to speak that’s multiplied by 100.  This is because an option is really just a contract saying you’ll buy 100 of a stock if you execute it. That’s the price you’d pay for the option. Hopefully that helps, but I’d be happy to help you with any other questions you have. I’ll say it again though: do not mess with options until you understand what they are and how they work.

First of all, we’ll need some more specifics to get a good grasp of how this would work so I’ll give you several different numbers here.\n\nSuppose you bought a call at a $100 strike price of $XYZ stock that expires on 10/26 and it costs $1.1 because $XYZ itself is at $100.50. You want $XYZ to go as much as possible so that $1.1 goes up. You also want to sell as possible, preferably on or before the Tuesday of the week of expiration just to be safe. If $XYZ goes far above the strike price the option sell price will go far above what it was as well. If $XYZ hits $104.00 on 10/19 then your option will probably be worth $3.00 or something. You can sell your option at any time. Remember, an option is a contract. If you’re selling an option, you’re selling the right to buy a stock at a certain price. You are by no means obligated to buy 100 shares upon selling. Hopefully that clears some things up for you friendo.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It cleared it all up.
