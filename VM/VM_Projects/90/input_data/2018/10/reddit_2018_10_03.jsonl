Does anybody truly believe it is realistic to think that once the backlog is empty, that there won't be any further demand for the Model 3?\n\nHere is the problem simplified.  Tesla needs to sell X number of Model 3s per week to turn a profit on the car.  If they sell below X (as they did in Q2) they lose a lot of money.  If they sell above X (as they should in Q4) they will make a lot of money.  \n\nRight now Tesla knows that they can produce and sell well above X cars because there is a big backlog of orders, so essentially every car produced can be sold.  They could produce 100k cars next week and sell them all.  No one is arguing that once that backlog is gone there will be no more demand for Model 3s.  Rather, the concern is that demand will be less than X.  And if that is the case, Tesla will never recoup the investments it made into producing the car.
