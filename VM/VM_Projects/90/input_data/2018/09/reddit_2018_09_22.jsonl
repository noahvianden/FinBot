", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "The worst move China has made is reacting with tariffs of their own. That just reinforces the complete misconception that our tariffs “get” them and theirs “get” us. Which leads to the mistaken conclusion that since we import more we can tariff more and thus win. To the extent that Chinese leaders might believe this and mistakenly think they’re losing, it’s possible they capitulate. But I’m not expecting it.\n\nThe truth of the economics is that our tariffs do enough damage on their own, and the right move for China would have been “nothing”. (I mean the right move in general is better IP protections but I’m speaking from the standpoint of “winning” a trade war.) \n\nLook at what we’ve been hearing from our businesses. Whirlpool, who initially cheered a tariff on appliances, lost about 20% of their value on earnings report because steel tariffs are killing them. Walmart just announced they will have to raise prices. Micron had to lower guidance due to margin compression. This isn’t Chinese tariffs hurting us. It’s our own.\n\nThe US is a consumer-driven economy and our tariffs hurt *our* consumers as well as *their* suppliers. It’s a little too diffuse to be an obvious smoking gun but will be felt. But let’s say we weather that for a little while. What’s it doing to China?\n\nWell, the intent is that it costs them manufactring jobs. This is hard to measure because manufacturing jobs shut down there every day anyway. Low-cost labor is a last stop before automation and they’ve been churning through that. Reduced buying from us would hurt Chinese investments more than Chinese workers, and while China may tolerate the rich more than they used to that isn’t where public sympathies lie.\n\nBut despite that let’s say we do put some of their people out of work. (And that the rest of the world - who is fighting with us, not them - doesn’t pick up the slack.) The Chinese government has immense credits, the opposite of our debt. The could make jobs and pay for them easily. And as a Communist country they have experience making jobs and much of the public is accustomed to taking them. Chinese people prefer private sector because they know it’s more lucrative. But they can take public works jobs for years while the US is “being unfair” to them.\n\nWhat would we do if tariffs tick inflation up and GDP down? The Fed can’t fight both at the same time. Do Republicans give in on a minimum wage hike when businesses can least afford it? (Having resisted during a growth period.) Do we stimulus spend our way into more debt at the same time we’re pushing a creditor to stop lending to us?\n\nAnd in the worst case for China, if they “lose”. all they have to do is inflate their currency. They’ve been fighting this for years, thinking a cheap Yuan will provide more jobs at lower income. (Which reinforces my assertion that people there will put up with a lot.) If their currency goes up against the dollar, everyone in China becomes wealthier and their prices go up, basically taking the place of our tariffs but with them as the beneficiaries. No relief for our consumers, less funding of our debt, but equal value of imports and exports. That’s what we’re pushing them *into*.\n\nSo I don’t see a reason why China has to fold and stop pushing self-suffiency. They aren’t trade-dependent because they have excess cash and are conditioned to obey the government. We built up a big deficit and have a distrust of government (even if we’re willing to overlook it for partisanship at times).\n\nWhat we should be doing is thanking them for cheap supplies while we use that efficiency to position for growth into future markets. Instead we’re trying to steal jobs from a country that’s poorer than us. It’s backwards.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "No. No they are definitely not democratizing.
