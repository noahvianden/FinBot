Obviously they are desperate for cash which is a HUGE red flag.\n\nBut Tesla has done a form of this since 2012. For both the Model S and X launches there was a much larger reservation fee (refundable) and a configuration fee (non-refundable). Both go towards the purchase price of the car. The 3 launch has been no different. If you buy an S or X today, you still pay a configuration fee.\n\nWhat is unique here, however, is Tesla decided to clear the entire domestic reservation list in one day, because they need the cash (We know this. This is not new information.), and they're confident that they can produce all of the Long Range Model 3 vehicles the domestic reservation list will order in the next 4 months.\n\nI think it helps to understand why Tesla uses this reservation/configuration payment method. No one else uses it, because no one else sells custom-designed cars direct to the customer, and no one else needs the cash to fund operations up front; they're already profitable. Tesla needed a way to get an accurate account of demand, hence the reservation fee. They also need a way to ensure a customer won't back out after they configure, sticking Tesla with the logistics bill of producing the customer's custom vehicle and getting it across the country to them, hence the configuration fee.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Actually many manufacturers ask for a down payment, or “earnest money” when ordering a new non-stock car.

They generally give more back to the economy than they take, which cannot be said of similarly unskilled and uneducated Americans, who act as an overall drain on the economy. Not to mention that having a diverse population is a benefit in itself.\n\nI think Europe is a cautionary tale about what happens when you let so many immigrants in so quickly without making much effort to integrate them into their new country.

That's why they're called economic migrants and they are absolute testament to why unskilled and uneducated people, often from pretty violent societies will never enrich one that is firmly rooted in western civilization. Period.\n\nAs for migrants in America, we have an unskilled workforce here. This unskilled workforce extends from high school students who are working while going to school to pay for their transportation and learn how to manage their first checking accounts, to a whole swathe of people who just never ended up doing anything substantial with themselves into their adult years. They may have fallen on hard times and found themselves homeless. They may have lost their jobs in 2008 and were never able to rebound (you'd be surprised at some of these homeless people's resumes on the street). There may simply be people who have zero ambition yet still want to work so they can have some pocket money. The long and short of it is, the people who are already citizens of this country should have first dibs at any of these menial jobs. Whether that be fast food or manual labor, and many of them offer opportunities for promotion if they want it. Not everyone is a 'bum' or has zero inclination to better themselves, and the people that want to should have full unfettered access to these entry level positions over anyone else from different parts of the planet who are also unskilled. As for Paul Ryan, the man is a bought and paid for dunce and I don't even listen to anything that comes out of his mouth like many others in Washington.\n\nCountries have the responsibility of giving their citizens every opportunity of a better life over those that come here from elsewhere.

I don't agree with any of it because I've seen the effects it has on jobs as well as the economy. And I'm sorry, cheap labor is often times very unskilled labor as well. I've had friends hire day laborers to help them move and when they were unpacking boxes later on they found half their stuff was broken. Later they realized that the people moving the boxes didn't understand what \"fragile\" meant. Surprise, surprise.\n\nThere's far better ways to get people in this country back on their feet and bettering their quality of life instead of just importing cheap labor from elsewhere.
