Cars have been manufactured for over 100 years. This is masking their execution problems. How do I know? They started automating everything, when people told them not to. That failed, then they went back completely. Now (from the call) they're automating mostly certain things, which is what they should have been doing.\n\nTesla is a young and inexperienced company with a lot of issues in execution.

Would you like it better if they just fell in line with industry and take it nice and slow?  Maybe set guidance so low that they could easily hit those goals to appease Wall St.?  Maybe they could even start making gas cars because everyone knows those are already great.\n\nAnd no, it's not Elon getting to me making me think their engineering is so cutting edge and difficult.

It's like me saying that I set a goal for myself to make $2M tendies per year.\n\n\n> Would you like it better if they just fell in line with industry and take it nice and slow?\n\nYou both can and can't compare them to the industry. They are unique but there are similarities. There's no doubt Tesla is an innovator, but by Elon's own words they've had execution problems.\n\nI'm an engineer as well. Creating a tablet with Software and vehicle control isn't cutting edge, not anymore. They basically reskinned an OS and put apps on it. It's effort and engineering, but they didn't invent anything here. They just create an iPhone like car instead of the closed, limited and not upgradable system that's used by the other vendors.\n\nI don't have a short position on Tesla.
