{"title": "Overview of S&P 500 corrections since year 2009", "selftext": "Graph of this issue:\nhttp://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZsKrS8XcAAKdxp.jpg\n\nRemember the last time stocks fell so hard? You probably don’t, and that’s making today’s market seem harsher than it is.\n\nIt’s a fact of the life of the mind -- things always seem worse in the present. In reality, they’re not. In this bull market alone there’s been five other corrections like this one, and it’s taken around seven months on average for equities to climb out of their hole. Based on that path, the current jitters won’t be fully eradicated until August.\n\nJust because bouts of losses are normal doesn’t mean they’re painless, especially when momentum stocks are leading the way lower. But the statistic is a reminder that it’s unrealistic to expect a market recovery to involve a straight line back up.\n\n“This is very stressful stuff,” said Michael Purves, Weeden & Co.’s chief global strategist. “It’s like going to the gym and lifting weights after you haven’t been to the gym for two years. Part of it is just a very normal psychological, emotional reaction.”\n\nSince 2009, the average correction in U.S. stocks has lasted 200 days and lopped 14 percent from the S&P 500. That means if this one ended this week -- an unlikely prospect, given the index just posted its fourth consecutive move of greater than 1.5 percent -- it would be the second shortest and second shallowest of them all.\n\nIt seems even worse because of how placid markets have been since the last disruption. While individual stocks are regularly rising and falling 5 percent nowadays, consider that in 2016 and 2017 the S&P 500 went through several multi-month stretches without posting a single up or down day of more than 1 percent.\n\nThat hasn’t been the case lately. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7 percent on Tuesday, erasing more than half of the previous day’s 2.7 percent rally. Futures on the gauge rose 0.3 percent at 8:05 a.m. in New York.\n\nStock turbulence as measured by the benchmark anxiety gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, is much higher. At 22.5 now after rising for the third time in four days, the measure is nearly twice its level for the previous two years. There have already been 22 days in which the S&P 500 moved more than 1 percent in the first three months of the year, triple the total for all of 2017.\n\n“You had this incredible low-volatility environment, but markets are supposed to go up and down,” Michael O’Rourke, JonesTrading’s chief market strategist, said by phone. “Relative to how markets should be and how they behaved most of my career, thus far this selloff is not a major event. At this point the selloff relative to history is just a blip.”\n\nSo the rupture is back-to-normal, and normal is usually hard.

QE is quantitative easing, which was a set of programs set into motion after the last recession. The goal was to save the financial market and the method was to buy up government bonds and mortgage-backed securities from institutions that couldn't sell them on the open market without taking a major loss. That way, banks that held these bad assets could get them off their books and be infused with cash, possibly preventing a run on the banking system.\n\nAfter QE1 and QE2, the Fed implemented Operation Twist where they basically swapped out a bunch of the short-term debt they had bought during QE1/2 for longer-term debt. This meant that the Fed was not only controlling the short-term interest rate as it normally does, but now it was heavily influencing long term interest rates because their buying made long term yields drop.\n\nAnyway, with yields dropping for all maturities, institutions that heavily invest in bonds as a safe way to generate a return stream (like pension funds) couldn't meet their expected returns. They had banked on making 6-8% but bonds were yielding less than half of that, so to meet expectations, they were forced further into the equity markets, thereby pushing up the stock market with in influx of capital that would normally reserved for safer assets. \n\nEarly last year, the Fed finally started to hike up short-term interest rates and later in the year, they started unloading their balance sheet by selling back some of those bonds that they were holding on the open market. Their tentative plan is to increase the rate at which they unload these bonds every three months (I think, fact check that). So now you basically have the opposite effect: their selling pressure pushes yields up and all those institutions can start moving back to the bond market. That naturally means they have to lighten up on the equity side, so you have a situation where liquidity in equities is being drained out slowly. \n\nThere's some things I left out and definitely some nuances I will have missed, but that's a pretty basic picture of what's going on as I understand it.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "> the Fed implemented Operation Twist \n\nCongrats.
