But it drives sales of other products\n\nActually, OSX existed way before Iphones/Ipads did. So your argument is moot. It is obvious now, in hindsight, that the iphones/ipads are the infrastructure, not OSX. When people buy an iphone, they are buying into what the iphone has to offer and its ecosystem, not what OSX has to offer. There is more evidence that points to this. Consider that OSX growth in Macs and Imacs desktop have remained stagnant while OSX for mobile platforms have remained strong. Iphones/Ipads are the infrastructure, not OSX.
