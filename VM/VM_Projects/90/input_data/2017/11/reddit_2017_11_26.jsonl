If the corporate tax rate falls to 20%, or even 25%, Altaba would face a lower tax bite on any outright sales of its two main holdings.

Investors are hoping that Altaba can negotiate a purchase of the company by Alibaba for Alibaba stock.\n\nIn a possible end game, Alibaba would buy Altaba – and its Alibaba stake – in a tax-free share deal. In that scenario, Alibaba likely would demand some discount from the value of Altaba’s Alibaba stake to facilitate a deal.
