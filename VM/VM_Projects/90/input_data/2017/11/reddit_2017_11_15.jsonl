They pay you something for this right, and this payment is called a premium. You get to keep that premium no matter what happens next. \n\nIf the stock price goes much above the strike price, they may exercise their option to buy the shares from you, and you then have to sell. If the stock price stays below the strike price, you get to keep the premium AND you still have your shares.\n\nExample: You own 100 shares of XYZ Corp which is currently trading at $10.00 per share. You sell someone the option to buy those shares from you at a strike price of your choosing--say $12--and you pick an expiry date, say Dec 15. That means they have the right to buy those shares from you at $12 each, any time between now and December 15. If the stock price soars to $15, then they may exercise the option (they can also just sell the contract to someone else, which is the more common outcome) because that means they are getting $15 shares for $12 apiece. In that case you would receive $1200 from them on top of the premium they already paid you, which might have been something like $100 or so. If the stock price drops to $9, they won't exercise the option, because who wants to pay $12 for a $9 stock? In that case, you made your premium of $100 which you get to keep, and you still have your shares, so you can then turn around and sell a new option contract on those same shares if you want to.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

What it sounds like you are trying to achieve to me at least is a passive income and active trading is not going to be a good option for you if you are traveling or on the road so much.

So you build a portfolio of dividend stocks in such a way that they are paying you out monthly through the various companies with the hope that each of the companies you are invested in see both their dividend payout and their stock price increase over the long term. On a $50k account you would not really expect to live lavishly, however, as you would really need to spread your portfolio out to ensure a monthly trickle of dividends. I would look for a more stable form of income (a.k.a. a job) that allows you to travel as you like and set up your account to reinvest the dividend payouts with the goal of living off of your passive income eventually.\n\nOn a side note, one quick way to diversify your account is to invest in ETFs.
