Probably the latter, but another great thing about cash is that you can withdraw it from your account, take your ball, and go play somewhere else.\n\nFor example, you could have saved yourself 3% of the losses on SBUX (at the time of this writing) if you had dropped on market open with a stop loss. The computers plummeted the stock 7% and every idiot that didn't place a stop loss is currently in selling panic mode (the -3%). That's the way it always is, for gains and losses after a binary event. \n\nWhen stocks drop violently like this, oftentimes there's a bounce that you can profit off of. It's dangerous to do so on stock that nobody believes in. So if you cut loss at a lower percent and then buy a call or stock at the bottom, you can reduce your losses.
