But then everything changed with Jeff Bezos attacked. The announcement of the Amazon-Whole Foods acquisition sent COST into a death spiral and wiped out almost all gains YTD. The good news? It's time to buy the dip.\n\n[The MACD](http://i.imgur.com/jVyn8U2.png) for the stock has been very negative ever since the fall, but the divergence is finally back to almost zero and we'll start seeing good upwards momentum from here on out. At the same time, [RSI is below 30](http://i.imgur.com/iOPTg2V.png), indicating the stock is heavily oversold and undervalued given the current trend. Combine that with [above average volume](http://i.imgur.com/gsGRKky.png) to confirm the trend and you have the strongest buy signal you can get short of Marty McFly coming back from August 2017 and dickslapping you for not buying today.\n\nTL:DR: Long $COST.\n\n[Proof](http://i.imgur.com/bzafvjf.png)\n\nDisclaimer: This is literally the second stock option I've ever bought.", "id": "6o0vzs", "created_utc": 1500385999.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "Not yet.

As more and more of their offerings can be delivered more quickly and cheaply through alternate services, I expect them to continue shedding stores and market share.

But there's a difference between individual decision criticism and overall growth potential: Amazon user retargeting and customer LTV is top 1% in the world right now among all businesses - and it's going to get even better. When it comes to \"accessibility\" for users, Amazon is innovating every single day (those free dash buttons are a perfect example: I guarantee you every single one \"given away\" represents raw Amazon profit through increasing sales frequency and cementing Amazon as the purchase channel. I.E. when you are ALWAYS stocked up on diapers, you don't need to get them from Target or Wal-Mart same-day). \n\nThe purchase of whole foods, which I wasn't in any way involved in, is obviously not about marketshare or sales growth: it's about distribution channels and presence. \n\nPerishables are much more difficult to sell and source online for a variety of reasons, most of them obvious. \n\nIt does you little good to squabble with a company over your delayed shipment of 2 tomatoes (so now you can't make your BLTs for tomorrow's lunch) or your grapes that arrived with fungus. \n\nIn cases of perishables, it MATTERS for many people which oranges they select (or they'd just randomly grab them), which potatoes go into their bag, etc. \n\nThey want to look, see, hold, smell foodstuffs.
