{"title": "AMD in the coming year.", "selftext": "Preface: I'm about to kinda take a shit on everyone's favorite failed market abortion.\n\nSo, I want to talk about what appears to me to be AMD's business plan for each of their segments, and why I think 2017 is probably going to suck a little for their investors. If I'm wrong, tell me to fuck off.\n\n1) GPU: Ok, so nothing with this has changed. They are still launching products as good as NVidia, but a few months later, right when NVidia slaps a price cut on the current gen, and announces the next. If you think VEGA is going to change this, then you don't know the reason people generally consider AMD's parts less powerful. It's because of their drivers and software.\n\nTheir drivers are shit. Look at history. Almost every launch, AMD's hardware is actually on par or better in RAW TFLOP/s, but when actually put to the test in applications, fall in at around 90%-100% of the performance of NVidia's parts. \n\n\nNow, what people normally think at this point is \"with 90-100% performance and lower cost, they can still capture a large portion of the market!\" Well yeah, but that doesn't fucking matter. What a lot of people outside the software/hardware world tend to forget, is that CPUs and GPUs don't cost 300$ because of the silicon. They cost 300$ because they have to pay engineers and scientists shit loads of money. Why does that matter? Margin.\n\nMost profit in tech comes from 10% or less of actual users. (Gay fucking name incoming) *Power-users* is the lingo the 40-something bald dudes in porches use. These users purely and simply buy whatever the fuck works the best and don't care how much it costs. If you don't have them, the only margin your left with is a loooonnngggg tail of broke college kids whose parents probably shouldn't have had them, but did, and now need to figure out how to retire. NVidia gets most of their profit from thier _____80's, which at this point have been out for months eating the high end market.. in **Q4**. If you don't know why it matters that they were lapping up market in the later part of the year, get the fuck off this board and go read.\n\nEven if AMD captures 50% of the market, if it's the lower 50, they won't be much better off. Don't forget, AMD actually bought their GPU buisness from ATI, who wasn't doing well for just this reason.\n\n\"But, but, GPUs are catching on in servers!!\" Yeah. They are, but so long as their software is shit, the only people that are going to dump tens of millions of dollars into and AMD based super computer are big companies that need a bargaining position with NVidia or Intel. Also, consumer market is a way bigger cash cow.\n\n2) APUs: This is actually something I've been rooting for since the start. I'm an OpenCL/CUDA programmer, and I see a lot of potential here if there is good software execution. HBM stacks on an APU is promising for low power devices and specialized application clusters. However, this isn't going to lift revenues at all until at least 2018, and that's only if they can finally get the software right, which they have fucked up for 6 years running. If you want to baghold until then to find out, be my guest.\n\n3) CPUs: Ryzen. It's cool they are actually getting somewhere in their processor business after so long. Bulldozer was a huge misstep, but I don't think it was a misstep simply because \"They were slower\". I think it was a misstep because AMD made some bad assumptions about the market for specific applications. Bulldozer is actually just as efficient as Intel chips at the time if you use integer operations instead of floating point, maybe even better. I think AMD saw the gaming market, and tried to position themselves to be the best in that market under the assumption that gaming libraries were going to make the move to integer operations.\n\nHowever, nobody ended up actually doing it, as it was just way too cumbersome for anyone to bother changing the way graphics libraries are built just to make things a few percent faster faster. Besides, things like CUDA/OpenCL, better OpenGL/Direct X, and Physx were coming on the scene around this time, and it stopped making sense to really do anything really math heavy on the CPU for games. This means Bulldozer was never competitive head to head. This meant no one bought their high end products. This meant AMD lost shit loads of money. This meant they fell behind Intel.\n\nTL;DR: Unless Lisa has been cooking up some better software herself, shit's gon' burn in 2017.\n\nDosclaimer: I'm high as fuck and have 500$ in puts I don't want to watch die.\n\nEDIT: I'm assuming those of you who say I'm wrong and don't know what I'm talking about, but don't elaborate, are a bunch of shit-bag-holding, AMD ball-lapping, Lisa cream eating, know-nothings :D ", "id": "5s1koy", "created_utc": 1486226629.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR: OP is a fag, ride AMD to the moon like Neil Armstrong on coke.", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "Solid DD", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Like Neil Armstrong on coke.
