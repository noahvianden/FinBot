Nonsense or a real threat?", "selftext": "Despite the fact that numerous analysts are optimistic about the upcoming market evolution as a consequence of Trumpâ€™s promises, many well-known investors including John Hussman predict a stock market crash in 2017. \n\nIt is usually recommended to follow the press and consider the appreciation magnates give regarding the situation. Nevertheless, in this case there is a huge discrepancy between the two sides.\n\nIt might seem like the market is severely overvalued, after so many years since the last crisis, we have never experienced a bear market or any major downfalls, which are a sign that the prices are prone to drop sharply. The low interest on equity is another red flag. Under this circumstances, investors must think twice before choosing the term and the stock.\n\nOn the other hand, as the magnate Warren Buffett said, there is nothing to fear as long as you choose the stocks strategically, reminding the fact that Dow Jones gained 75% since 2000. The stock price will ascend during the next decade, though fluctuating, which means long term investments are key.\n\nNotwithstanding the outlook, it is an advantage if you can foresee a market crash. It might be the moment to sell the stocks currently held and benefit of the consequences of the upcoming downfall by purchasing them at a reduced price.\n\nFinally, considering that during the last 8 years we haven't experienced a drop of 20% or more, is a market crash up to happen or these are just speculations?\n", "id": "61if83", "created_utc": 1490482567.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "\" many well-known investors including John Hussman predict a stock market crash in 2017.\"\n\nLOL!

Hussman does some serious research and his writings are very thoughtful and well-documented and all that, but he was basically fighting the Fed when QE1/QE2, etc were happening and he did what I hate when fund managers do: it's okay to be wrong, it's not okay to be wrong and just sit in that wrongness for years. Admit you're wrong, tweak, change, re-think.\n\nBut to go back to mutual funds, I've often said that there are probably a few dozen actively managed mutual funds that really are quite worthwhile. The problem is that that's 36 out of *thousands*. That's not a real good ratio. There's a few dozen mutual funds I think are worthwhile. There's a few thousand I think are some degree of mediocre, but they're there: they somehow have AUM. Most of them are just \"product\".\n\nAs for Hussman, it's not some fantastic bet that if his shareholders wait long enough will pay off exponentially; he's just been bearish and wrong and hopefully for the shareholders he'll be right at some point and the fund will gradually go to the other way.

His health care proposal would have effectively been just another massive tax cut for the rich that the nation can't afford and that would make life a literal hell beyond hells for the middle class as all of their healthcare costs would skyrocket. This whole administrations sights are CLEARLY on dismantling the social safety net and increasing military spending, both of which are detrimental to the domestic economy. So yes, while Trump has only been around for a little while he has already done or proposed several bad things for the situation at hand (stopping TPP helps but on its own will not offset everything else, and congress just sold our private browsing history out to ISPs which was a major flaw in the TPP that has gotten through anyway). \n\nLiterally look at the mans cabinet which is stocked full of people who are the antithesis for the departments they run, look at assholes like Steven Mnuchin who literally made his riches by graduating from Goldman Sachs to running his own (One West) Bank which SPECIALIZED in foreclosing on people during the housing crisis, he's literally only rich because he exploited a catastrophe created by the banks predatory lending.\n\nIt's not a secret what these peoples' intentions are and they can't see past their own greed to see that there is no more future in this country left to mortgage for their own present, and when you reach the edge of that cliff you send the entire country over the edge as well.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Well, it looks like you know make than I do.

", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Browsing history I just included in the list of bad things, it does have economic effects but indirectly.\n\n\nTo keep it short and sweet, a Depression is a terrible thing that we in the modern era no longer appreciate, it won't be the end of days but will bring a lot of pain in its wake if/when it happens. Also, I'm not in a rush to buy any guns as a result, but we'll see how times change that.\n\nInvesting in gold is a safe bet, as a tangible good gold (and by extension, silver and other minerals) is far less volatile than the market at large but is also insulated from the effects of a bad market and generally moves opposite of the market. When markets are high, gold is low. When markets are low, gold is high. With the market being \"higher than it has ever been\" the bubble can only get so much bigger before it pops or hugely deflates, gold's value is already somewhat beginning to rise due to uncertainty in the market but won't take off until a major economic event occurs. Either way, gold is a safe bet to insulate wealth if/when the markets go sharp south and then perhaps after waiting awhile, reinvesting afterwards in the market once it bottoms out in industries that you think will rebound the strongest will be the best way to go.\n\nAlternatively some people are playing the risk/reward game right now. In the event of a depression, people are sheltering their wealth in cryptocurrencies, deregulated decentralized cyber coin equivalents that potentially could shape the markets as they reform post depression and are already becoming market forces of their own. As uncertainty in the global economy rises, BitCoin and Ethereum (for example) have seen massive jumps in valuation, with the former crossing $1200 per one BTC for some time and with ETH rising from a $9 valuation to $50 as its market cap begins to approach and surpass Bitcoin. The reward here is that, being a decentralized currency, ones wealth could be insulated and actually increased by the effects of a depression, though the value of that wealth may not be fully realized until you come out on the other end of the Depression. All of that somewhat hinges on how the market reforms.\n\nFor me, I have invested mostly in cryptocurrencies which has been pretty rewarding so far, we're at a point of volatility at the moment but I expect Bitcoin to at least stay stable where it is, Ethereum could regress somewhat in the short term but I wouldn't be surprised if it picks up more steam though I don't have any wonky predictions for it outside of the next 5 year window where it could hit $300-$500 valuation pretty safely. The cryptocurrency market is seeing a fairly large influx of value from the crowd seeing market volatility and looking to the decentralized market as a means to shelter and increase what they currently have. There is more risk involved than in gold, but I think it's a fairly certain bet so I'm personally confident in it.\n\nAs in all things, some level of diversification is probably your safest bet and I won't point you in any direction beyond what I laid out. I only suggest that you be wary of the market, watch whatever retirement savings you may have very closely, and be ready to make a move if the time comes where you may have to as it pertains to whatever you may keep in the bank. You're comfortable with what you're comfortable with and I'm sure you'll know what's best for you.

Just let it ride for the next 40 years or risk the other way and sit on my money for \"the crash.\" \n\nI mean, we're decently far over 2008 levels but it's been 10 years. It took us almost 10 years to finally be growing again. Why does it have to crash now? Is \"slightly higher than 2008 levels\" the max the US market can be worth? It'll just keep bobbing between our high now and a bear? I'm just not sure I see that. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My major concerns with the market are as follows:\n\n1) The market is extremely high at the moment which means there is less to be made, eventually as stock growth stagnates people collectively feel out the top and sell, if there is a fire sale in a scenario like this you can see a massive domino effect sprawl out from there.\n\n2) Global uncertainty, especially surrounding the EUs markets. International markets and trade are very intertwined partially due to most global currencies' reliance on debt ownership to create their values. Greece, even as a small nation, creates a massive ripple effect worldwide as its debt and inflation become more burdensome. A good instance to look back to is when the United States relieved South American countries of their debt, the USD immediately took a massive hit that brought the dollar down to Canadian levels. None of these countries are that major and still had a resounding effect, but the weight of debts and interest is beginning to pile up on larger nations, and with global uncertainty manifesting in the form of radical and reactionary personalities taking hold of power in some of these countries, it makes the outlook that much harder to pinpoint. If there's one thing I hate, it is a truly unpredictable near term future regarding the Philippines (Duterte), Spain, Greece, Italy, and especially France. Plus with Brexit taking place, the EU takes a massive hit which is a direct blow to Germany's economy which is a big player in the global market.\n\n3) Deregulated banking. Ever since Bill Clinton undid FDR era legislation that separated consumer and speculative financial banking, the banks are allowed to use the money in ordinary peoples' accounts to invest. What this means is that the banks keep a lot of money on hand but not enough if there was a \"run on the banks\" they can't supply every dollar they hold because it is tied up in investments. This is also why we have withdrawal limits that limit peoples' access to their own money. If there is an economic crisis for any reason, people will panic to withdraw funds and the banks will forcibly try to close their doors to prevent a mass withdrawal from taking place and this will continue happening, eventually resulting in a mass of account closures as people forcibly remove their money from the bank. Eventually the banks will have no raw money left on hand and will be forced to liquidate their holdings and close permanently. If people don't get their money out of the bank before then, their money is as good as gone, just as it was during the depression.\n\n4) Top centralized wealth and the shrinking middle class. Social economic diversity is often an overlooked metric when people speculate on the market and it leads to a massive lack of foresight. We live in a United States where the top 5% of the wealthiest Americans control roughly 60-70% of all money in the nation, leaving the other 95% to fight over the rest. Most earners in the country today live below the poverty line and struggle to make ends meet, this is in stark contrast to the 50's through the 90's where even in economic downturns people still had money to burn. Dollar inflation, low wages, lack of benefits and lower hours resulting from slowing quarterly profit growth and bailouts of major economic sectors and the banking industry have left the middle class decimated. Meanwhile the richest people in the country have been able to manipulate government to obtain tax break after tax break for themselves and their corporations to the point where they are paying lower tax rates than standard earners. Contrary to popular belief, tax breaks are not free, they cost the government dearly and that tax burden is shifted onto the backs of the middle class as well as a growing national debt. Meanwhile the money saved by the private sector is squandered and held away in tax havens, they own so much money that they cannot possibly spend it all anyway. The money doesn't \"trickle down\" in the form of better wages or more jobs at all. Money that is not being spent in the market is absolutely worthless, and having such a massive amount of money tied up in such a way leads to massive consumer market stagnation where the government is literally forced to step in, print money therefore devaluing existing money, to try and stimulate market health as it did for the automobile industry. \n\nThis inflation only served to exacerbate the underlying problem, however. Inflation is known as the \"hidden tax\" as it is an assault on all existing wealth in the market, and for average earners who are already struggling just to keep up with rent and bills in the face of stagnant wage growth cannot shoulder that burden. With effectively little to no money with which to buy product in comparison to past generations they cannot facilitate a healthy economy, and slowly but surely their reduced spending leads to job and hourly losses as quarterly profits stagnate and begin to fall as corporations try to forcibly make numbers work for their shareholders. After a few rounds of lost wages and jobs and one or two more band aid industry bailouts, the economy and the dollar will bottom out under the weight of the roof because the supports that hold it up are not properly maintained. It is an inevitability of unfettered capitalism, all mountains have their peak and once you reach it, you have no where to go but down, only this time we will have already bailed out (literally to the tune of a couple trillion dollars) the private sector already and will not be able to pull from the reserve in the same way again and the cost will only be that much greater as more and more failing industries come crying to the government asking for their handouts.\n\n\n---\n\nFactors like these when coupled with a few other more minor elements make me extremely skeptical of the market going forward and it also leads me to believe that a lot of the inflated bubble we're seeing right now is that last gasp of market air as it literally fills out the largest possible space it can before imploding. That is my take and my understanding of what we're facing and while I don't like do be some doom and gloom messenger, I'd rather accept that the possibility is very real and prepare for the worst even as I hope for the best. Repeating an old adage one last time \"Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it\" we are more or less following the very same path we took when this nation and the world fell into the Great Depression the first time and I'm deathly afraid that we are nearing that same eventuality here again today, too much lines up for it to just be a coincidence.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I don't know what you mean by relief for first-time homebuyers, but I can tell you something.

On top of that, everyone gets taxed more for the handouts being given.\n\nThe only things you can do with the housing market to promote lower costs are to tax speculative practices and force builders and developers to plan more lower-cost entry-level housing.

As those loans failed, the bubble burst and people were thrown onto the streets.
