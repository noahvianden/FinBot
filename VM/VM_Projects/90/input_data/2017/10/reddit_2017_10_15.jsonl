This is done every day *somewhere*.  The way to avoid that is for a region to have their own excess capacity online at great expense outside of peak demand time.\n\nUtilities are always looking for ways to smooth the demand curve to save money.  One scheme already in use in some areas is to have smart hot water heaters that the utility companies control.  My sister had one installed in her vacation home in the midwest, and the thing would always switch off her hot water generation during cow milking time because of the abnormal spike in energy use that cow milking equipment had on the local grid early in the morning.\n\nSolar is great in this regard, because solar generation peaks at the same time that air conditioning demand peaks, making distributed solar a great option for grid management in really hot climates.\n\nFor short term power smoothing, reverse flow from an array of PowerWalls into the grid can help power utilities reduce costs.\n\nIn the US, it isn't a reliability issue, it's a cost and power smoothing issue.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Oh I'm not ignorant to their plan, and maybe it'll work eventually in some areas, but shipping batteries to Puerto Rico for free isn't going to earn them any money or bring any power back to Puerto Ricans. \n\nThat being said, the type of person who would invest in TESLA sees this shit and eats it up, so it's probably going to $1000 by end of October.

I'm all for modernizing things and taking a leap into the future, but it's hard to be optimistic about something that is trying to solve a problem that doesn't necessarily exist in many cases.
