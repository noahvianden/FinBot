{"title": "How to properly YOLO oil (a DD guide)", "selftext": "First of all, a 'go fuck yourself' to everyone reading. Especially those with DWTI/UWTI stuck up their asses or the suckers falling for the WSB signature weekly pump and dump on biotech and pharma...\n\nYou want to make money playing the oil game? Get out of those disgusting ETNs and buy some real companies. I like small cap E&Ps. When oil rises they respond pretty similarly to UWTI, but you're not going to get fucked by decay.\n\nOkay, yacht time:\n\n**What to look for in a E&P for survival?**\n\n**1) Debt.** Debt is killer in a downturn like this one. Debt to asset ratio is pretty much meaningless because nobody is going to buy a rig from your company so you can pay down your shitty debt. Try debt to cash-on-hand to get a good gauge of the financial health of the company. (If it doesn't have cash, then I use debt to EBITDA)\n\nEX: Seadrill\n\n* Cash: 1,044\n* Short Term Investments: 96\n* Total cash and equivalents (because fuck acct receivables): 1,140\n\nBut you have:\n\n* CPLTD: 1,489\n* Long Term Debt: 9,054\n* Total debt: 10,543 (That's 10 billion dollars in bloody debt, on a $1.53B market cap)\n\nVerdict: 9.25x debt to cash on hand, aka pretty fucked.\n\n\n**2) Profit/Loss per barrel.** Literally how much does it cost to take a barrel of the good stuff out of the ground. In Saudi Arabia it could be as cheap as a long straw, and for some shale producers its upwards of $70/bbl. You want to aim for producers that can break even at no more than $50/bbl.\n\nEX: Gran Tierra Energy (Read a 10k for this info)\n\n* Oil Produced: 6058\n* Net income: (3.61)\n* Loss per barrel: Negligible \n* Average sale price: $42.3\n\nVerdict: $42.3/barrel needed to take it from the ground to the customer\n\nI don't really care about the rest of the bullshit or what the company says it breaks even at. This is a simple, back of the napkin calculation of how good the company is at making money.\n\n**3) Net Change in Cash.** Aka how long can this E&P bleed money without needing to beg Goldman Sachs for more money to bleed.\n\nEX: EOG Resources\n\n* Net Change in Cash: (1,368.71)\n* Cash-on-hand: 718.51\n\nVerdict: Stop bleeding money! (They paid a ton of deferred taxes in 2015 so it's not really fair to them. Great company!)\n\n**4) Company Specific Risks.** There is no point looking at industry risks because you're already dead set on YOLOing your life's savings on oil. Oil will go up or it will go down come monday, who the hell cares? It's not like everyone will be riding electric segways in 2017, so oil isn't going away any time soon. \n\nEX: Bankers Petroleum\n\n* Major risk: Corrupt as fuck Albanian government and their tax dispute\n* Minor risk: Liquidity risk, hard for a small company to raise capital\n\n\n**What to look for in a E&P for takeover target?**\n\n1) Clean books and clean stock structure\n\n2) Tons of reserves but not enough $$$ to take it out of the ground\n\n3) Management team that's not entirely stupid\n\n4) Strategic for the big integrated players\n\n5) Undervalued (Don't use BV, BV is BS -- use EV/EBITDA)\n\n--\n\nI've been typing this for half an hour now and I'm tired. Here's my oil yolo portfolio. I'll justify each choice if this post gets some attention:\n\n* Gran Tierra Energy (40%)\n* Whitecap Resources (20%)\n* Ithaca Energy (20%) (A real YOLO)\n* Bankers Petroleum (10%)\n* Crescent Point Energy (10%)", "id": "4bvbtl", "created_utc": 1458882539.0, "score": 244, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "Great post.
