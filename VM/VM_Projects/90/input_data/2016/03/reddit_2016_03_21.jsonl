Basically, I bought a contract which enables me to purchase stock from someone at a specific price, no matter what the actual price of the stock is. That specific price is called the strike price.  Note that I purchased this contract, and someone sold it to me. Now let's fast forward to the expiration date of the contract. If I still own my half of the contract, I can force the opposite side of the contract to sell me shares of tsla for $280, regardless of what the current price of tsla is. So I'm hoping that tsla is above that. In fact, I'm hoping that tsla is anywhere above $292.6, because that's the premium I had to pay to buy the contract. Below $280, I lose all my money. Between $280 and $292.6, I lose the amount below $292.6 per share. At $292.6, I break even, because I could just buy the actual shares and sell them back at market rate, which results in no profit.  Above $292.6, I stand to make a capital gain. Let's say on the expiration date, the price of tsla is $305.2. I can now buy stock (or call it away from the seller of the contract) at $280. I stand to gain $25.2 per share by doing that.\n\nRealistically, I don't want to execute that trade at expiration, because $280x100x6 ~ $168,000, so I'll just sell my option contract back for the market value of the contract, which in the example I gave, is $25.2 per share, which doubles my money.\n\nWhat price do I need to win this yolo? For that, let's try to get an understanding of the market value of call contracts.\n\nRight now, this is an out of the money call - meaning the stock price is below the strike price. Therefore, the intrinsic value of my option is currently zero, and the time value of my option is $54.28, or my break even value minus the current share price.\n\nEach day we get closer to the expiration date, the time value of the option decays somewhat. If the stock price goes up, my option value goes up as well, minus the decay in the time value, and with a few other factors thrown in which determines how much my option would change in value.\n\nI bet on options because it's a way for me to leverage my position. On a given day, if Tesla stays flat, I lose money because of the time decay. However; If Tesla gains let's say $10 ~ 4.2%, I might stand to gain $3 per option, or 24%. \n\nI use Tradeking, so they have a per trade fee (a few bucks per trade) and then an option commission (a few cents per option). \n\nSo what price do I need to win this yolo? I'm hoping tsla goes up to $250ish by the end of the week, which should give me a 20-30% gain or more.\n\nThe only way I turn 7.5k into 150k is if the option value goes to $250, which suggests the price of tsla in September would be $530.\n\n", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Jesus Christ I need to learn options instead of just buying shares and making fuck all you can make bank", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "The risk is significantly more though - play around only with money that you are willing to lose completely.

Consider that anyone can always just sell a contract.  I just so happen to own a contract, so when I sell my contract, I'm just closing my position.  But consider instead what the risk/reward scenario is for someone who just sells contracts: they are now obligated to sell the contract holder stock at the contract strike price, no matter how high the stock is selling for on the open market.  That is the risk.  They can potentially lose **infinite** money if the stock goes way up.  So, to make it worth it, they sell the contract at a premium.  If the stock price gets closer to the strike price, then they would accordingly sell their contract for more, because there is a higher chance that the stock may actually reach the strike price.  The goal of the contract owner is to have the (contract price + stock price) be greater than (stock price).  To improve their chances of making money, a contract seller will increase their contract price if the stock price goes up.  If the stock price goes down, then the contract price must go down accordingly in order to find a buyer for the contract.\n\nThe amount a contract's value goes up, for each dollar increase in the underlying stock, is called delta.\n\nIn my case, delta is around 0.3.  So every time I see a $1 increase in the price of TSLA, my option increase value by $0.30.\n\nDelta is a dynamic number.  Near the money, delta approximates to 0.5.  In the money, and especially as you get closer to the expiration date, delta approximates to 1.\n\nA delta of 0.3 is a decent wag for a YOLO.
