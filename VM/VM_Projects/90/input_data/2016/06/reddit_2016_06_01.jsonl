If their new processor is a success they'll be doing pretty well, otherwise it's hard to say.  Someone was saying due to anti trust laws in Europe (?) that Intel really needs AMD to still be on the market so they have that going for them as well, which is nice.  They're also generally the leading provider of lower to mid range processors/graphics cards so they're big in the budget crowd.
