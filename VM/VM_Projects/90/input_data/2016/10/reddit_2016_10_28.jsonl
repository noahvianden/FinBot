{"title": "Wallstreetbets, is this something useful?", "selftext": "Hi. I'm a novice trader in college and longtime browser of /r/wallstreetbets.\n\nI noticed there was quite a bit of earnings plays on this subreddit, and one of things I do first when evaluating potential earnings plays was to see to check:\n\n* Does this company's stock price commonly react to earnings results and do they correlate with the beat/miss/meet earnings? IE is the earnings play an actual catalyst in stock price?\n\n[I made a tool to completely](http://catalisted.com) automate the process, where you can plug in a company or ticker and see for each earnings report: the forecasted eps, actual eps, and the stock price reaction for each report in a complete list.\n\nFor example, try checking out [NVDA](http://catalisted.com?stock=nvda) or [Apple](http://catalisted.com?stock=aapl).\n\nMost of all, I'd love some feedback: Is this useful?
