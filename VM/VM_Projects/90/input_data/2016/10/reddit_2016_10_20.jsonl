When you buy a stock, you don't look at the price every day, thinking \"oh it went down 1% today, I guess I lost $1,000. That's not how it works. When you buy long term, you're not thinking about prices of today, tomorrow, next week, you're thinking 2017, 2018, etc. \n\nWhen the stock market tanks, likes the 2008 recession, you would think Warren Buffett would be nervous right? Stocks tanked, so he has lost a lot of money right? Wrong. Stocks went down, meaning they are cheaper, he's not selling anything in the near future, so he'd only lose money by selling it at that low. He instead buys when stocks he likes, go cheaper.\n\nPoint is, AMD is still the same exact company it was yesterday, and with the price going lower now, if you're thinking long term, now's the time to buy, not sell. If you're honestly going to sell now, you really shouldn't be investing in stocks. Some rich guy from some book I read said something along the lines of \"bad news is the friend of the value investor.\"\n\nSo if you like AMD, buy some more.
