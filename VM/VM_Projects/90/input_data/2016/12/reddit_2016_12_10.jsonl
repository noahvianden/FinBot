If you find other investors to each put in ~$100k or so you can own (a piece) of a ~$5-$15 million dollar property. Would you rather own a small piece of a gigantic pie or an entire minuscule pie? And once you're in the game everything gets easier. \n\nTrust me you don't want less than 16 units. Tenants, toilets and termites. If you like having to manage a property and dealing with tenants then by all means. There's a reason most people that \"invest in real estate\" own a duplex, triplex or only a handful of units. That's also the same reason why most people don't have a huge Income. Think small, stay small. If you own 4 units and one person moves out, now you're 25% vacant. A duplex and you're now 50% vacant.\n\n16 is too small even. Honestly I would look into properties with 20 or more units, but certainly not anything less than 16.\n \nAlso buy newer properties not a fixer upper. You don't want to gamble especially when you're just beginning. You don't want to speculate and say I think I can do xy and z to the property and raise the rents and improve the value of the property. That's speculation.
