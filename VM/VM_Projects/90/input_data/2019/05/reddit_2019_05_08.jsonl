{"title": "I present to you: My Rules & Regulations to making a successful living day trading", "selftext": "After 4 grueling months of trading and continuously trying different trade methods I have found one I truly love: day trading. After repeating the same mistakes multiple times I realized I need to discipline myself more and make sure I follow certain rules before executing trades before I blow up my account. Here I present to you the rules & regulations I am forcing myself to follow and read every morning before doing day trades. Also for day trades I usually use between 30k-60k for one position. I want to grow my account to at least 100k in the next year. Feel free to add any thoughts or comments you think I should add to this. I now present to you my official rules & directions for day trading:\n\n\n\nGood morning. It‚Äôs time to make some money. Before trading or executing any trades read and abide the following rules:\n\n1. Do not purchase stocks before 10:30 A.M until a trend is established under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, on days where futures are extremely red, and there are important government talks going on.\n2. Read the economic calendar to be aware of any announcements being made. Avoid trading before any important statements or numbers are released. \n3. Only trade stable stocks which you believe in long term in case you get caught in a rough position. For example, trade PayPal, Microsoft, Match, and similar examples.\n4. Do not trade a stock until at least 10:00 A.M, but preferably 10:30 A.M, when a clear trend is established. FOLLOW THE TREND. On rare occasions you may enter a position at 9:30 A.M on the morning dip, only if futures are green, the stock opens green and looks to be trending upwards, and you are extremely bullish on the stock. If entering a position before 9:30 A.M you must use less than 10k.\n5. Always exit morning positions by 12:30 or 1 P.M, unless you are up an extremely high amount of money (over 1%). In that case, the stock might rally till close. Realistically, the most cost-effective and time-effective way to make money day trading is to trade from 10:30 A.M to 12 P.M.\n6. Under no circumstances enter a day trade position after 2 P.M. This is only approved for swing trading positions. All swing trading positions must remain under 15k.\n\nNow that you have read the rules. Here are your directions to make money day trading:\n\n1. Stick to trading high momentum stocks with earnings approaching, or quality stocks which went down after earnings as long as you seriously look into the reason the stock went down. Trade the stock on the month going up to earnings. \n2. Watch stocks on your watch list at open. Monitor several stocks to see what trend they are established by 10:30 A.M. \n3. If a stock is entering an upwards position which you are extremely confident in, enter on the next dip with at least 30k. In certain situations, enter the position with 15k and lean into the position in case it dips more. \n4. You can day trade 2 separate stocks at once just be extremely careful and do not enter another position until you are up confidently in the other one.\n5. At this point, you can sell the stock on the next peak or let it keep rising and keep buying the dips and selling the valleys. \n6. Completely liquidate the position by 12:30 or 1 P.M, unless you are up a huge amount (over 1%) and you think the stock has room to keep rallying.\n7. The suggestion right now is to only day trade on green market days, however exceptions can be made for red days as long as the position is entered after 10:30 A.M and exited before 12. \n\nAdditional swing trading rules:\n1. Stick to trading high momentum stocks with earnings approaching, or quality stocks which went down after earnings as long as you seriously look into the reason the stock went down. \n2. Buy stocks once you find an average low point where it bounces from, by looking at it‚Äôs daily, monthly and yearly charts. \n3. Swing trades must be kept under 10k and positions should be liquidated in less than 30 days. Covered calls can be sold on stocks with swing trades in certain scenarios. \n\nAdditional selling puts rules:\n1. This is only to be done in an extremely bullish market on a stock which you are extremely bullish on and would not mind holding long term.\n2. Sell puts on Wednesday at the earliest. The best case scenario is to day trade with cash, liquidate all positions, and sell puts on Thursday.", "id": "bm4b7o", "created_utc": 1557316385.0, "score": 87, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "You've put some time into this so I'm not going to dismiss it off the bat.\n\nWhat I would be interested in seeing is a trading report of your buys/sells in a month as a follow up.", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "Dude...

It‚Äôs no disrespect, but I would much rather hear from someone who has made 10-15% pear year over the last two years rather than someone who has 5x their money in the last 4 months.**\n\nTo be clear I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre saying bad things.  4 months just isn‚Äôt enough time, that‚Äôs all.\n\nLet‚Äôs look back in time.\n\n2008 through 2012: you could‚Äôve bought leaps (call options expiring in 1-2 years) each year 25% (or so) OTM and made a killing.  David Tepper essentially did this with the big banks near their bottom and made $7 billion.\n\n2012 through early 2015, late 2015 through 2018: pretty much the same, just look at SP500 and Nasdaq charts over that time.  OTM, expiring in a year or two, make bank\n\nBut what about that flat/downtrend in 2015: if you had been buying weekly or monthly expiring just OTM call options and killing it for years, then hit this patch, you could‚Äôve gotten wiped out\n\n2018 had brief periods where things worked really well: times when 1-2 month out, just OTM call options would be almost guaranteed 2-5 baggers (2-500% gains).  Then other times puts were the plays.\n\nJan 2019 to late April 2019: again just OTM calls, some cases weeklies many cases monthlies, on most (not all) tickers again was the ‚Äúright‚Äù move.  But what happened this last week?\n\nIn retrospect the right moves are easy to spot, the real skill is adapting to an abrupt shift and not getting wiped out in the process.

Because it won't matter what he did, that is what happened during the time he traded in the past.. we won't have his situations in the future with our trades, so looking at someone's past performance is fun and all, but that was during that time for him, which may have been a bull market and easy to make money etc.. like last year etc..\n\nSo what happens if this year we have tons of volatility, see what i mean? you can't use his rules and his past performance as meaningful when things in the future are not what happened in the past...\n\n\nWe all know the stock market is computers trading with computers and with amounts of money that we can't fathom.. so I don't know why people think we can beat computers that automatically trade and price in things at the blink of an eye..\n\nThere actually is dark pools and trades and brokerages that do have orders be instantly worked around... \n\nIt's all there, so the problem is that nothing stays the same and you have to react to the matter at hand, not just expect the market to do what your \"rules\" say everytime..\n\n\nA good example would be when news drops and the stock jumps/dumps.. \n\nanyway I think Day trading is amazing and can be used for major profit. There is no reason why we all can't/shouldn't be making $200-800/week just from stupid day trading.. to be honest, it's about just buying shares and covered calls, or selling puts and collecting $100-200 premium a week etc..  But the secret is when you buy options, and the timing, and that is what we can't predict well..\n\nThat is from just watching options prices every day and seeing when and how the computers price in things..\n\nYou'll notice he mentions not to trade before 1030am.. the reason he mentions this is because that is when things are typically priced very high and big moves happen and very fast which can either help or hurt you..\n\ncorrect me if I'm wrong but I'm assuming  that's why he mentions it..\n\nanyway, If we are going to get into day trading, then the futures are where we should be doing that..\n\nOtherwise just day trading shares and selling options is the ticket for others..", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Good post.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I hate these kinds of post...
