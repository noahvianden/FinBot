At most Id risk a few thousand, and could acquire quite a few contracts around 230-245 strikes on far out expiry. I believe should apple return and break through their ATH of about $220 would see a hard breakout closer to 230, and even if it happened after 6 months from today, they would see at least 100% gains on each contract, prospectively. \n\nCan a more experienced trader help me clarify risk vs. reward, with a serious reply only.
