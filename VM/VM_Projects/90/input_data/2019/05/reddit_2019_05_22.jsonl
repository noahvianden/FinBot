If Tesla does solve for full autonomy, however, and its electric vehicle (EV) production surpasses our bear case estimates, TSLA could scale significantly higher than our previous $4,000\\* price target during the next five years, thanks to our newly introduced bull case for electric vehicle volumes. \"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://ark-invest.com/research/tesla-valuation-model](https://ark-invest.com/research/tesla-valuation-model)", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "867-5309\n\nask for jenny", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did aj turn bear a long time ago?", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "This was supposed to be the one standout in Obama's brilliant^TM economic recovery plan.
