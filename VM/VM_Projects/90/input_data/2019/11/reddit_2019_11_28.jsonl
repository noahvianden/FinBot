The HK bill is really just an annoyance, but won't actually cost the USA (things like this can only hurt the side with less leverage, and as the USA isn't that side, it's not really gonna change things).\n\nThe need for soy beans may be down, but the need for pigs is still really high. They even had to scrap the ban on Canadian pork, so if there starts to become a threat to pork from the USA, China loses all leverage (as someone in China, I saw that once the pork prices spiked to 10$ per pound, most of the country started to lose confidence in the government). China is the dependent one here, not the USA.\n\nHonestly, the USA is going into a recession regardless of what happens. However, GDP growth under 6% in China is also considered a recession (that is, according to my econ teacher who is an adviser to the Premeir, when job creation stagnates or reverses). So both countries are going for what is essentially a recession. The difference is that the USA can change its president, but the system won't break (and I don't see a dem coming in and just reverting back to 2016), whereas China's system is extremely rigid and doesn't respond well to unrest. Trump can go all in on betting he is right, cause when hes wrong, the USA just gets a new democrat in office, whereas if Xi is wrong, the country could collapse. Thus, wayyyyyyyyy more pressure is on China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe economy here isn't healthy, and confidence is slipping among its elites (Peking University has long since dropped support for the government, and most people at Tsinghua have the knives out ready to throw the government under the bus). While I don't think it'll result in a coup or anything, China's political leverage has nearly been washed up. That's just not the case in the USA.\n\nThat being said, winning the trade war isn't important at all. What will matter is what comes out of this.
