Apple was never and innovator of hardware.  What set them apart was their marketing and ecosystem.

And I don't think they are doing a streaming service but a game portal of sorts but they are light on the details.  That said as I pointed out mobile gaming in US and Canada made $9.4 BILLION last year.  People clearly play them and they make money.  You can express what ever opinion you want but the money and data says otherwise.\n\n>I disagree in part about their hardware.\n\nYou can all you want but it doesn't change anything.  Apple doesn't invite at all with hardware least since the iPhone.  All they did was take existing hardware and improved on it that's all.  And comparing Apple to Microsoft is apples to oranges.  Apple is a hardware company and Microsoft is a software company.  As to Apple hardware being reliable it really wasn't it was more because Apple products where not widely used they had the appearance of such.

Making it all small and that powerful is going to take years and that decades.  More do to tech limitations that we yet to overcome.  That said I don't know why you bring up personal devices.
