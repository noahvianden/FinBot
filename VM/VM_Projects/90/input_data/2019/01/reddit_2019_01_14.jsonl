It would be a toss up with two clear winners in different yin and yangs of different spaces. \n\nAI- I would say Google. They are both developing really well into this space. Google is developing their AI into phones and consumer consumables than Amazon's AI into learning and processing for businesses. So, pick your poison? \n\nLogistics- Both are the literal cutting edge of the logistics game. Google is developing their side on the consumer user (Alexa being more responsive, Google learning your searches), while Amazon is using theirs to increase their hold on the cloud (AWS), warehouses, grocery space, and now into some shipping routes. Amazon has implementated their delivery capabilities to down stream and independent contractors to thicken the shipping web. This was a great way to horizontal and vertically solidify their weight in this sector. Once again, tie? \n\nIntergration- Both companies have bought up and down stream to ensure their businesses are getting the best deals to either develop or bring the product to the consumer. I mentioned Amazon hiring independent contractors to start building webs of delivery logistics, but then again, Google has positioned themselves as an ad revenue based company too. Amazon I feel has the better edge of their vertical and horizontal intergration.\n\nIn my eyes, I will say I would wait to see what the Bezos divorce has in store. It shouldn't hurt a great company like Amazon, but weirder stuff has taken down a giant. I like Google a lot, but I believe they have a potential of being separated soon to avoid being in violation of antitrust laws and acts. These are my two cents, so do you own due diligence.

While a computer at some point can decide where to land it won't necessary be the best choice.
