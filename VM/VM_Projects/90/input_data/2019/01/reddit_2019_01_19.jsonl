The package, which includes his $1.5 million salary, surpasses the $27 million he was paid for 2017 as the most he’s received since taking the helm.\n\nMorgan Stanley this week posted its highest-ever annual profit, even as fourth-quarter performance disappointed investors. The bank was helped by U.S. corporate tax cuts, a jump in deal fees and a bigger rise in trading revenue than many rivals. Gorman said Thursday he’s looking for acquisitions to build his firm’s asset-management unit, its smallest division.\n\nThe firm’s shares fell 24 percent last year, steeper than the S&P 500 Financials Index’s 15 percent decline, as it was buffeted by market volatility in the fourth quarter. The drop was the worst in seven years.\n\nThe incentive award converts to shares if the firm hits goals for return on equity and total shareholder return. Morgan Stanley must achieve an 11 percent ROE over the three-year period for Gorman to get the full piece tied to that metric, and can get up to 50 percent more shares if the firm achieves a 12.5 percent ROE.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. awarded Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon $31 million in total compensation for his work in 2018, a 5.1 percent bump after his bank also posted record profit.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-18/morgan-stanley-lifts-gorman-s-pay-to-record-29-million-for-2018", "id": "ahh9mf", "created_utc": 1547860228.0, "score": 247, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "Dumb question: Good annual profit.

A mediocre CEO will be paid far and beyond what the best retail workers / waiters etc will ever earn.

This is a left wing ideology. Capitalism is not morally questionable - it improves the standard of living for everyone involved - look at the buying power of the bottom 50% vs 60 years ago in america, for example. Tech that Silivon Valley produced was responsible for 3x as many people being removed from poverty in Africa in the last 20 years than any blue sky prediction from the 90's. That doesn't happen under a left wing ideology as there is no incentive to innovate and execute. If you only apply the capitalist model in some areas where it should be implemented and not others (companies reel it back otherwise DB would have hired Jamie Dimon for $200MM+/yr by now) then as a result you get the best talent wanting to create companies instead of running them. It results in incredible ineffifiencies and stalls innovation and progress, as the companies poised to execute on an area often do not have the appropriate talent to do so, which is why many companies struggle (relative to before) after their founders leave. The gap between creating a a company and beginning to develop a solution to a problem is significantly more profitable than continuing to innovate and remove the problem down the line.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Capitalism is not morally questionable - it improves the standard of living for everyone involved\n\nCapitalism does indeed work well to generate work opportunities and goods. However it does not guarantee a better living standard for all, or that two people of the same ability and work ethic receive similar wages. That's why developed countries have welfare / social programs.\n\n> best talent wanting to create companies instead of running them\n\nI don't see anything wrong with that. CEOs very rarely create anything - they provide direction, but the employees are the ones performing the actual innovation. Smaller companies are more beholden to the people that make them work - the engineers, designers, marketers etc. Unlike CEOs a founder is unique in that they are typically the originator of a company's novel products / ideas.\n\n> It results in incredible inefficiencies and stalls innovation and progress\n\nHow so? Many current CEOs would likely be incapable of running successful startups, as such they wouldn't be so quick to give up their guaranteed salary.\n\nDon't get me wrong, good CEO's definitely deserve generous wages. However, it is insane is many CEOs earn in 2 hours what many earn in a year - yet these CEOs could likely be replaced by any reasonably intelligent person who has familiarity with running a business, and they would achieve the similar results.\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Don't get me wrong, good CEO's definitely deserve generous wages. However, it is insane is many CEOs earn in 2 hours what many earn in a year - yet these CEOs could likely be replaced by any reasonably intelligent person who has familiarity with running a business, and they would achieve the similar results.\n\nI think this is in part correct - some CEO's are ordinary in comparison to their c-suite counterparts (although very capable people) and are there for their 7 years to cash in. However, if the CEO compensation was significantly higher and tied to long-term performance (beyond their tenure) then there is no doubt that they would act more in the best interest of the company as their intewrest would be more aligned than the current, somewhat socialist model encourages a risk-averse approach from a self-interest point of view, for a few reaosns. However, do not udnerestimate the extensive skillset that is required to run a Fortune 500. I know a few very competent high end c-suite F500 execs, and they have noted that everyone around them were absolute rockstars in their earlier roles to get where they are now, regardless of their competency or risk-taking natuire in the c-suite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, your argument also does not check out from a shareholders perspective. the board does not know exactly how a CEO will perform, and a blue sky grey sky estimation is required. Up until a certain point, well beyond the current threshold for CEO's, it is as if you are able to attract the top talent with higher compensation, that move alone. If youa re able to spend more on the CEO, you will pull better talent that would be otherwise retired/ developing companies/ investing etc etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n>I don't see anything wrong with that.

No-one is better resourced to provide value to the world than large corporations. Look at Amazon and CSL. Bezos' and Perrault's love for taking risk is having more of an impact on society than probably anyone else in the world (from an opportunity cost perspective). Correct direction from administrators is far more important than one R&D employees impact - the former is far harder to replicate and find. To imply that CEO's don't generate anything is absurd - it is almost singlehandedly down to them in terms of developemnt. Look at the difference between Grifols and CSL and the innovation that CSL is producing vs Grifols (working in the same industry). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n>I don't see anything wrong with that.

If the correct incentive was there, then these people could be taking over the reigns from the likes of Bezos and musk instead of being involved at a stage that does not suit them. some people can transcend stages (Bezos) but some are clearly more suited to one end or the other (e.g Musk at the early stages).\n\n \n\n>How so? Many current CEOs would likely be incapable of running successful startups, as such they wouldn't be so quick to give up their guaranteed salary.\n\nBut they try because the blue and grey sky situation is not there or move into a heavier effort-return based equity situation such as VC.
