Anyway, you don't buy 25% of a company if all you're going to be doing is buying a few thousand hydrogen fuel cell forklifts.\n\nI think the real curveball that's coming from Amazon is:\n\n1. They're replacing all the diesel generators in their datacenters with HFCs. HFCs are smaller, lighter, more efficient, cheaper to run, require less maintenance, and can be installed by a sweaty dude with a forklift instead of a crane and twenty hairy Italian men.\n2. They're investing into HFC delivery vans for their warehouse arm. Now that the price of Hydrogen is dipping close to the price of gasoline (and gasoline is damned cheap right now), and considering that an HFC EV is more efficient than an ICE car, and that fuel cells are now costing less than fifty dollars per kilowatt (and dropping as production ramps up) this will seem a good investment for the future just for the projected savings on maintenance and oil changes.\n3. Have you ever heard a gas-motor powered drone? They're fucking loud dude. It literally sounds like a helicopter. And battery powered drones don't have enough power to carry a fridge any distance. This is why their drones are going to be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. This is because electric motors are much quieter, increasing the chances of success for the mission, and hydrogen fuel cells can provide a lot more power for the weight compared to batteries.
