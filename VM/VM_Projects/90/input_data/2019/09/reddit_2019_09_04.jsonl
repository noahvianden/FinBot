The liquidity risk one especially seems to completely miss out on the idea that these ETFs are market cap weighted, so yeah even though a lot of the underlying stocks are smaller volume, their share of the index value is also relatively much smaller, so it's not an issue.\n\nOne kinda valid point that he sort of makes between the lines is the idea of ETFs being marketed as \"free money\" safe investments is wrong, and may have led tons of weak hands to invest, which may lead to amplified crash if things ever turn south significantly enough. If one believes this to be the case, then indeed stocks that are not widely held by ETFs (such as small caps) might be relative winners in that kind of crash. Of course the problem with that is that if we ever hit that crash, it's hard to imagine anything being spared regardless of ETF participation... same as back in 2007-2009 everything crashed, not just CDOs. So even if it's a valid point (is there a way to quantify the number of weak hands though?) it doesn't seem to be at all actionable.  \n\n\nAlso lel at investing in Gamestop.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "He has a legitimate point about liquidity. To say that the market cap is smaller so its okay doesn’t make sense. Market cap can rise completely independently of volume, and can reasonably create a situation where index etfs are holding many many times more stock than is traded in one day, or even several days. Even if mcap doesn’t increase, inflows to etfs can still cause index funds to be required to hold this much. \n\nSo, it’s reasonable to fear that if there’s a huge sell off in an etf, the etf actually may not be able to cash out its investors because it literally cannot find enough buyers for these low volume stocks. \n\nIn the Bloomberg article about the same interview he said that in the Russel 2000, 456 stocks traded less than $1 million dollars, with 1049 trading less than $5 mil in a day. Let’s say there’s a sell off in index funds requiring, after considering mcap, you to sell $10 million dollars of these stocks each. In such a scenario, you’re kind of fucked right? You don’t have any good options. You could take what you can get on these stocks, likely causing extreme downward price movements (likely causing a positive feedback loop forcing you to sell even more to protect your asset weighting). You could cover withdrawals by selling more stock of higher liquidity stocks (though this would decouple your etf from the index).
