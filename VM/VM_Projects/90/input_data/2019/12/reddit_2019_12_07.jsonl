He loves money, he works for big shiny blocks, which we call tendies.\n2. Once he makes those tendies he then proceeds to re-invest those tendies back in the market, aka himself because he is a ruthless badass smelting some new armor. We take our bags and throw them back in. \n3. He'll risk it all on big ass yolos like taking down a massive walker thing with a bunch of autists on a fish farming planet. \n4. He throws his bag to some old lady trying to scam him for a small tendie, not caring about the bag because he just yolo'd it all.\n\nBasically, we are all morons and Disney has been trying to tell us to go long, this bull about buck harder than that big slimy thing he fought in episode 2. Fuck this baby-yoda crap, don't worry about the toys, those are nuggets compared to these tendies. Go fucking long and hard on this mandalorian cause he ain't even in europe yet.
