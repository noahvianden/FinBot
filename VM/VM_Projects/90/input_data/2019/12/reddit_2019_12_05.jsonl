It's his full time job.  And Berkshire Hathaway stock is not beating the SPY on a rolling ten year basis.\n\nFor me to assume that I'll do as well as I did when I was young and had much less money now that I have a full time job and a wife and bills to pay...\n\nIt's simply not realistic.  Most guys who are holding on to a stock that outperforms are holding onto 20 other stocks that are underperforming and 1 or 2 that have performed terribly.\n\nWarren Buffet is a pro.  Ray Dalio is a pro.  They are not using their smartphones and Robinhood and Public WiFi access and reddit to make their investment decisions.\n\nIf 99% of wall street professionals can't do it then it's a waste of time.\n\nEspecially when you take into account the emotions.  If you are a stone cold samurai trader with balls of steel who can load up on options when you think MKTX is going to pop...

Or buying more GOOGL after some European country sues them.  \n\nI find it easier to take ounces of gold out of my safe and sell them to buy SPY or QQQ after a dip than selling gold to buy TSLA or whatever stock is hot now and probably won't be the hot stock in 20 years.  The hottest stock in 20 years, is probably not on your list of stocks.  And it will be on the SPY in 20 years.\n\nWarren Buffet missed out on the entire tech boom. Now 25% of Berkshire capital is invested in one stock.... Apple.  I highly doubt his average return will beat the SPY in the long run.  \n\nIf it did... It would be a hot stock.

Had I invested in a leveraged index ETF like SPXL or TQQQ with regular monthly deposits and a small stash of UST...\n\nI would have made even better returns than I made buying dips of AMZN and JPM\n\nlook at a portfolio made up of 33% UST and 66% SPXL\n\n100% of pros ain't beating that mix.\n\nWall Street makes a killing off of people believing they can beat an index fund... So the game still exists.  They get to charge fees on actively managed capital \n\nYou don't get to charge fees.  You just end up paying short term capital gains for all your swing trades. \n\nPut most of your money in a stock index, the rest in a gold or treasury fund... And rebalance every 3 months.
