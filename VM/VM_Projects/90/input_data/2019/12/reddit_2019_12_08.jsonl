Yes, the amount of data Tesla gathers is an enormous advantage, but this is because it allows them to encounter way more rare edge cases and encounter these edge cases at higher frequencies. As of right now, exponentially more data does not mean the software will improve exponentially, because employees still have to fix all the mistakes that autopilot is making. Project Dojo and Project Vacation may change this though, because they are rumored to allow Tesla's autopilot software to improve itself without human intervention.\n\nI personally have always thought FSD more likely to be 5 years away than 10 years, but also thought that Elon's \"1 million robotaxis in 2020\" was way too optimistic. Especially because Tesla was about to raise a round of funding when he first said it at Autonomy Investor Day, so he might've erred on the side of optimism at that point in time.\n\nHowever, during the Q3'19 earnings call Elon once again reiterated his FSD safer than a human in 2020 statement, this time without a need to boost stock price for an upcoming capital raise.

I’m glad it hasn’t lead to a shitload of articles a out accidents on Smart Summon, that seems to be a rare thing.\n\nBut for actual city driving and parking... i don’t think we’re close.  You still see a lot of ‘veteran’ Tesla owners avoid auto-park because it’s just not that trustworthy.  I can’t even imagine how FSD will do in narrow European city centers.\n\nAs for the data aspect: while that _can_ be a huge advantage for Tesla, they’re currently not doing _that_ much with it.  They can query the fleet for specific events, which is really cool and an interesting approach to train the neural networks on things they are _focusing_ on.

He is optimistic in general, which is a good thing, but on the point of FSD he is way too optimistic. Ultimately that goes back to his believes on AI in general. He thinks it is possible we live in a simulation. He believes in the possibility of Turing machines (more accurately: linearly bounded deterministic automata) acquiring all the capacities humans have. He does not see that fully reliable FSD actually requires some higher level cognitive capabilities, like understanding situations, values and the human intentions of other road users, etc. I do agree with him, though that many low-level tasks, like navigating through complex and highly dynamic and congested traffic situations will be feasible. That is just going to need a lot computation power, training and data. It is the lack of higher level cognitive functions that are the problem.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's important to note the difference between where Tesla talks about being versus where they currently are.  Their ideas of fleet learning are great, and it's true that they're pulling data from cars in some fashion, but they're nowhere near the point of harvesting every video of every edge-case from every car - the bandwidth needs alone would be an amazing cost.  My understanding is that what they're currently doing is polling the fleet for examples of scenarios they have already identified and can query for - like Andrej's example of different scenarios where they see bikes.\n\nI bring up this difference, not as a knock on Tesla.  In fact, I think a lot of people underestimate what Tesla could be doing in a year because they are basing it off of experience with the current approach to fleet learning.  It was clear to me from the Autonomy Day that Tesla has some really ambitious plans for autopilot.  As time has gone on, they keep talking about more ways to automate fleet learning and as that gets better, the learning rate should start to accelerate, potentially quite a lot.  Andrej also talked a lot about getting fleet learning involved in decisions, rather than just processing images and feeding that to manually written instructions.\n\nAs of right now, it looks as though there are still a ton of human-hours required for every bit of new driving skill for the cars.  It's hard to know how much of the behavior is human-coded versus learned.  It's hard to know how many hours of humans tagging images are required for each new object identification, each new scenario classification.\n\nSo I find it completely plausible that 99% autonomy will be a battle if inches for quite some time, unless they really improve their learning cycle and find ways to automate and accelerate large portions of that process.\n\nAnd then you have the problem of edge-cases.  It's hard to know now how many weird edge-cases are going to be solvable with the current approach and how many present challenges to the fundamental approach.  Snow covering all lane markings, a low sunset blinding all the forward-facing cameras, an obstacle in the road causing opposing lanes to temporarily need to take turns driving on the one-car-width of drivable space, any number of weird clusters of traffic that only get sorted out by humans gesturing or sometimes talking to one another.  These are all things that we don't know if autonomy can solve, let alone when.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> It just seems like some people are extremely confident that its way off and am wondering why.\n\nMy terminology: \"FSD\" = a product that Tesla users can buy and use right now; \"Feature Complete FSD\" = the main components working and the car can drive itself most of the time under human supervision; \"Full FSD\" = completely autonomous driving, good enough for robotaxis.\n\nI don’t fit the category of OP’s question, because I have no confidence that Tesla won’t meet the most recently stated schedule goals for Feature  Complete FSD and for Full FSD (in use somewhere in the world). It’s possible that those goals could be met within the target timeline, and I don’t see any profit in betting against it.\n\nAt the same time, at the same time as a driver I can appreciate the size of the undertaking. From my daily driving experiences and the experiences of others, it appears that some of the most very difficult tasks involve interactions with humans rather than vehicles. A driver in another car yielding right of way to the Tesla and either just sitting there or waving the Tesla to proceed; noticing that the driver in another car is looking the wrong way and may fail to stop or yield right of way; a driver at a stoplight rolling down the window and asking permission to pull ahead into the Tesla’s lane; a police officer or flagman or school crossing guard directing traffic with hand signals and a whistle. Plus thinking of a good way for the Tesla to respond to humans in a way they can understand. And interaction with the police and other drivers if the Tesla is pulled over or if there is a crash. I can see a path to most of these if a human is available for occasional intervention, but it will be harder to make them completely autonomous with confidence that driver intervention will never be required.\n\nTesla has reportedly been making progress on reading the “body language” of other vehicles, for example judging from a vehicle’s motions that the driver is thinking about pulling in front of the Tesla, so perhaps similar advancements can be made in looking at the hand gestures and body language of drivers in other vehicles. I have not heard anything from Tesla about plans to signal to humans as a human driver would do, for example “OK, you can go ahead” or “thanks for letting me into the lane” or “here’s my vehicle registration, officer”.\n\nI believe Tesla mentioned during Autonomy day back in April that Autopilot / FSD was still using instant by instant interpretation of the world around it (so for example no extrapolation that a rolling trash can is about to cross in front of the Tesla until it’s actually in the Tesla’s path), but that Tesla planned to implement time-based observation and extrapolation sometime later. I haven’t heard what progress has been made in this area since April, but when it is working I would expect it to make it easier to perform tasks such as interpreting hand signals from humans.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the usefulness and benefits of “FSD” will continue to increase tremendously as further capabilities are added, even before “Full FSD” is available, in terms of fewer accidents and more pleasant driving/riding experience. A 99 percent complete FSD would be wonderful to operate, even if it’s not quite ready for robotaxis, and as a TSLA investor I would expect more people to buy the FSD package, if Tesla does not raise the price too high.\n\nAs a person who hopes to buy a Tesla sometime in the future, I also hope Tesla does not raise the price of the FSD package too high, at least until robotaxis are actually running. It’s in Tesla’s interest to have as many Tesla vehicle miles as possible being driven using whatever version of FSD is available at the time, and pricing it out of reach of new customers (and possibly forcing them to buy other brands instead) would be counterproductive. The main stated reason for raising the price of FSD is to prevent “scalpers” from buying up all the Teslas to make into robotaxi fleets, but perhaps the final FSD price boost doesn’t need to be done until that is actually shown to be a problem. Tesla should also be aware that someday their manufacturing capability will be great enough to saturate the robotaxi market, and the price to individuals for FSD can start to come down again. \n\nAgain as an investor, I can see the benefit to Tesla’s profitability from raising the price of the FSD package as its capabilities improve, but until scalpers are really a present problem, they should balance that with the desire to maximize FSD usage, the same way they balance number of vehicles sold versus profit per vehicle.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Because it's really, really hard.
