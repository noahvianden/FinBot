As soon as software starts enjoying the litigation of tort lawyers going after big insurance money (as it will when \"one hand on the wheel\" laws are removed), software (potentially all software) will suddenly be exposed to liability.

Even in the best case scenario, it creates effective monopolies due to  legal precedent of case law for litigation that only large companies could afford to defend.\n\nIf Tesla isn't able to accomplish the removal of those two things, they will fail as the much touted \"automation infrastructure\" that supposedly justifies their valuation.\n\nBecoming an insurance company is literally a requirement for their continued existence.
