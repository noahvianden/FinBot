{"title": "$69K Bet on Microcap Stonk - $CREX", "selftext": "I love FDs and Monthlies as much as the next guy. I played $DIS for 400% a few months ago and recently $MSFT was good to me. There used to be a lot of bad decisions around microcaps and precilinical biotechs on this sub. I miss them. I have been jonesing for some “back to our roots” WSB posts.  So I decided to make one.\n\nHere is my $69,000 YOLO on a high volatility, low volume microcap - $CREX. The volume is so low that it took me a few days to accumulate without screwing the entry price. Check out the chart with arbitrary doodle lines on it and pretend future forecasts. The only time this stock has decent volume is PR or ER.\n\nPlease note, you will see a big dip Sept through Nov of 2018 when you review the yearly chart. During this time, the company acquired another strategic business (allure Global), uplisted to NASDAQ from OTC, and closed a $10M public offering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why I think $CREX it is worth a look –**\n\nThe stock has beautiful, high volume surges with PRs (earnings). These have consistently broken $3.50 the last 3 times.\n\nThe company is becoming profitable and making huge (100% YoY) revenue gains and should really be worth $3-$5 within the next few months. It is winning industry awards and getting industry recognition as one of the best digital ads companies (digital signage and high-end kiosks mostly)\n\n· Q1 2019 revenue up 133% YoY to $9.5M\n\n· High growth in core business\n\n· Gross profit $3.7M , up 144% YoY\n\n· Achieved operating breakeven Q1 2019 with a $0.4 EBITDA\n\n· \\~$40M + revenue in 2019 expected from less than half that in 2018.\n\nYou know how all the betas are whining about service jobs being replaced by kiosks and software? Well, that’s one of the things this company does. It’s the wave of the future until retinal implants and AR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why you should stay away –**\n\nIt’s a low volume, high volatility microcap that you need to keep long or exit within 1-2 days of catalyst (either you watch the stock or set good alerts- both volume and price with contingent logic would be wise).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Give it a look.**\n\nMight be worth your tendies. Might get a captain’s hat out of it.\n\nI think this is an undervalued stock that will at least repeat previous spikes on earnings but may go quite a bit higher with some volume and attention. I made some decent profits the last 2 earnings and wanted to share while the price was still low. Expect ER in about 3 weeks.\n\nWAG reward is 50-125%\n\nWAG risk is 10-30% depending on your entry\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is a microcap/YOLO post.** **This is not a post about sound investment strategies for money that you actually need.**\n\nI know this is a stonk and not an option. Remember autism is a spectrum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOUCH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEND EDIT\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgdi3440wvb31.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=51a10f399b0b342df79b1e9f24bf45aee734f6e0", "id": "cgflo3", "created_utc": 1563813839.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "Micro-Cap/Penny Dumpsters are banned from WSB. \n\n\nWith that being said, this kind of balls/stupidity should be put on display.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Science.
