I can see a few questions that I view as legitimate by someone skeptical of the company:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  Is Tesla on track to be profitable for the full fiscal year?  This is based on Elon's guidance coming out of Q3 last year that they would be profitable in every quarter forever going forward.\n2. How much of the sales orders are for cars the company can fulfill today?  (Excluding the Model Y from new sales, because that car isn't in production yet)\n3. What is the YoY growth for markets they were delivering cars to this time last year, specifically the US?  Is Tesla putting up a great quarter only because they get to satiate initial demand for new markets like Europe and China?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
