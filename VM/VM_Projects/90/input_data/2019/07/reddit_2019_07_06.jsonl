I invest because I expect at their continued growth rates, a minimum 10x return on my investment today which would value the company around 450 billion dollars. I’m of the belief in 15-20 years the company could potentially approach 1-1.5 trillion dollar market cap and they become a mix of Uber, Exxon, Toyota, and Panasonic/LG. \n\nI just wanted to open a discussion to see if my reasons for investing aligned with the others on here.

If they're first to full autonomy in ~2022 with a ~2 million car fleet, ~25% enrollment, and average utilization of 10 miles/hour for 8 hours a day and $1 GM/mile, with a 30% cut for Tesla, that would only be ~ $4.50 billion of additional gross profit in a year that I expect them to build at least 1 million cars for ~ $8 billion of gross profit. Hopefully around then Tesla starts pumping expired leases and excess production into the fleet, doubling each year for the first few years and starting around 200k vehicles that obviously get 100% enrollment and closer to 12 hrs/day utilization at 10 miles/hour and $1 GM -- biggest change is Tesla keeps 100%. So assuming that phase begins in 2023 it would immediately provide additional annual GM of $8.7 billion (say $5 billion since they ramp during the year) and in 2025 the fully owned fleet would provide ~$50 billion of GM in addition to organic fleet expansion via unit sales and traditional GM from those sales and whatever energy is doing, totaling close to $100 billion of GM in 2025. What aren't I considering? Regulatory issues (no point in speculating) and competition -- I really don't think the technology and production expansion is that unreasonable of an assumption. So, given the potential for competition, I'll say the GM per autonomous mile is closer to $.60 and utilization is 20% lower. That would decrease the total GM for the fully owned fleet to ~$25 billion, but the $20 billion for vehicle sales is still there and another ~$5 billion from the customer owned fleet and energy, totaling GM of ~$50 billion.
