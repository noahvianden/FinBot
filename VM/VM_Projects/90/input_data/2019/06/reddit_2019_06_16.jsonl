{"title": "Where the next Big Five of tech could come from", "selftext": "Excerpt:\n\nThe Big Five — Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft — have a combined market capitalization of $3 trillion. Their hold on the wallets and imaginations of consumers appears to be unshakeable, if not constantly expanding. And they have the financial heft to squash or purchase any potential competitor.\n\nWhile it’s true that these five giants hold an incredible amount of power and influence, it’s also true that this sort of business dominance doesn’t preclude a new player or players from joining their rarefied space, perhaps even knocking one, several, or even all off their perch in the process. This will likely be a result of not just a single product or service advancement but of a revolutionary innovation that fundamentally affects society at large, just as the current Big Five have.\n\nLink:\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2019/06/15/where-the-next-big-five-of-tech-could-come-from/", "id": "c19tbx", "created_utc": 1560691234.0, "score": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "So this is a strong buy? 😁😂", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think people are looking at an investment horizon much shorter than that : ) good call though.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I have a hard time seeing anything replace the big five any time soon.", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "I think it's mostly because at this point they will buy any newcomer before they get big and assimilate.
