{"title": "BYND Borrow Rates", "selftext": "I know there have been a lot of posts about BYND. Sorry for making one more!\n\nHere is an update on borrow rates that I have found: Calling around I got 127% (up from 123% on Friday afternoon), but S3 is reporting 134% on existing shorts and 450-700% on new borrows. TLRY peaked at 900%. Apparently 51% of float are still short somehow as of 30 minutes ago...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS3 also believes that most of this run-up has been long buying, NOT SHORT COVERING. I don't know how accurate that is, but I have no way to verify that. If that is the case, this isn't TLRY 2.0. It means that Tilray was the BYND Beta Test.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut SUPER IMPORTANT: at this point we are definitely close to the endgame. DO NOT put a lot of money in this stock at this point, if any. At some point soon, it will crash hard. I don't know when. It could have already peaked. Please don't lose money trying to cherry pick the top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck to everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: In my initial write-up, I wrote that TLRY intraday peaked at $300/share. With 75m shares, that is a $22.5bn market cap. An equivelant market cap for BYND means a pps of $375. I am NOT saying that will happen. But that's if short covering gets SUPER out of hand.

I've checked the short-interest from 2 different sources and didn't go down much on Friday, so I would agree with S3's assessment that Friday was renewed buying as opposed to short covering. Perhaps today is some short covering but I still expect a bigger short squeeze down the line with the catalyst being a trial announcement with a big quick-serve restaurant (McDonald's being the favourite). I think positive news-flow momentum is still in play and my absolute exit date is end of October when the 180-day IPO lock-up expires and insiders / early-investors can sell. Also the additional supply of shares will bring the borrow fee to short back down to earth.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "So this is just my personal opinion, but I wouldn't wait until October to bail. The market is forward looking and it will crash before the actual lock-up ends. I may be wrong/early, but I also don't want to lose whatever gains i have because I held too long. It happened with Tilray and I believe it will happen with BYND. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso- I'm not sure an announcement like MCD will ever come. It is much more likely to go to a company like Nestle that can scale up quickly and actually be able to supply MCD- I believe BYND is not at that point, yet.

The answer was yes but a full launch would have to be staged. This is what BK is doing with Impossible - a staged launch (e.g. lots of news out today on how Impossible Whopper is now available in San Francisco as of today). Impossible has less capacity than BYND and yet they can supply all of BK, so I don't see why BYND can't supply MCD especially after investing the IPO proceeds to expand capacity which is exactly what they're doing. MCD trialling Nestle's product in Germany (which btw I heard isn't great) does not mean they can't partner with BYND in the US. Supply chains are regional and MCD has always had regional variations in it's menu. Nestle is a better known brand in Europe; BYND in the US. Can do both. BYND has products for MCD's normal menu and breakfast menu (for the latter, similar to what Tim Hortons are doing with BYND sausage breakfast sandwich). Former CEO of MCD of BYND board.

So once I got confirmation that earnings were decent, it gave me the confidence that a squeeze would happen and I added to my position.\n\nBut please remember that I can be wrong and have been wrong many times in the past!
