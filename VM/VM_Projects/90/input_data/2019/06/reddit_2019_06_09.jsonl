I think anything tied to esports will get action during the conference and Sea Limited(aka Garena) is pretty much THE Esports play in South East Asia on the NYSE. Plus I think this company is going to do big things in general with Shopee and Airpay. I can't help but shake the feeling that this company might moon. Extra Extra long here.\n* NTDOY - While the switch is starting to enter the middle of its life-cycle, I think Nintendo is finally starting to get their act together from an on-line services standpoint. I expect them to push this hard at E3, and the stock to go up as a result. That all being said I will probably sell this shortly after E3 because their stock is volatile as fuck and will probably correct down afterwards.\n* NERD - I was the dude that made the NERD post currently sitting on the front page, and I see them as a super short term stock play. I think most of the companies in that ETF will do well during E3, but likely drop afterwards. Planning on Selling Thursday or Friday. I might re-enter if there is a correction down and the companies in the ETF made positive moves during E3.\n* (Honorable Mention) TTWO - I already sold my TTWO shares during the pre-E3 run up, but I think they will do well also. I am just trying to be disciplined here and not FOMO back in. I sold them because I thought the run-up was overdone and I expected a correction. I might be wrong, I might be right, either way unless there is a correction early next week I am staying away. Those still holding can probably expect tendies, and a dip right after the conference ends.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "No AMD?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I love AMD products but right now their stock feels like a trap to me. Everyone seems to be assuming that Intel and Nvidia are going to stay down when they have no history of doing so. Even if AMD announces a partnership with one of the \"Netflix for Video Games\" streaming services everyone is hot about, I am skeptical, at least long term.
