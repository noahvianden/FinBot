The tariff would apply to a wide range of products, from live buffalo and primates to T-shirts and shoes. It would also cover laptops, video game consoles, battery cases and other products that tech companies say would increase costs for consumers or harm their abilities to make a profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"No one wins in a trade war, and an escalating tariff fight will inflict immense damage on American businesses, workers and consumers,\" the Association wrote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The trade dispute has forced some tech companies to look beyond China for new locations, mostly in Southeast Asia, to produce their goods.
