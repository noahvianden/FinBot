Their justification was surprisingly convincing to me at least. I did some googling to refresh my memory a bit, but you can find more articles on it from searching. \n\nThere were two main points that jumped out to me.  One is that with their current battery production they can make a TON more hybrids than they could full EV. The number I found from 2019 was about 1 million hybrids compared to 28k full ev. In this way they actually reduce emissions more by having more hybrids in total. \n\nSecond one really got me thinking about EVs in general and is related to number 1. This article or quote I couldn't find again (and may actually have been honda?) so I might butcher some of the numbers. But the summary is that people's general driving patterns don't lend themselves to full EV. A huge portion of driving is short trips,  say like 20 to 50 miles at the end of which you'd largely be able to recharge it. But you can't make a 50 mile battery car because on those instances you're doing a 300 mile trip say every few weeks or months, it's going to be awful. So then you end up making a 300 mile battery, but then your lugging around the full weight and resources (think the mining of resources) unnecessarily for like 90 percent of your driving. So in that way a hybrid makes a lot more sense.\n\nI'm not too keen on a hybrid because reliability and low maintenance cost are my number 1 priorities in car ownership and the nature of hybrids makes me nervous in that regard (perhaps incorrectly).

It surprises people all the time, but it\u2019s statistically more likely for the market to be up 25% or more in a year than for the market to be down.", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "If you are under the age of 50 you shouldn't care.

I would just leave it there and let it compound as is (Mercari's decent). If all of a sudden the USD drops in value (1 USD now only worth 80 yen like in 2012), I can sell Mercari stock for YEN then buy a lot more USD than when I started.

{"title": "Rivian vs Tesla sanity check: back of the envelope calculation", "selftext": "This will be short and sweet as I am down with covid now (Fatigue is a b\\*\\*\\*c).\n\nLet's assume that $TSLA is NOT one of the most overvalued mega cap ever as many argue and **I agree it is overvalued by a lot**. Not a huge TSLA fan here...\n\n**But ....let's assume TSLA is fairly valued.**\n\nCurrent market cap:\n\n$TSLA: 1T\n\n$RIVN: 127B\n\nratio of market cap: 7.8\n\nI am not going to judge RIVN on current (near zero) revenue. Let's look at 2 years out and 9 years out.\n\nA conservative forecast is that $TSLA can add [1.21M](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/09/tesla-growth-in-the-next-two-years-2022-2023/) vehicles to its yearly production. This is based on actual plants in/soon-to-be in production. Assuming 2021Q4 will grow at 15% over 2021Q3 (same growth from Q2 to Q3), TSLA would have produced 900M vehicles this year.\n\nTSLA 2021: 900M\n\n**TSLA 2023: 2.11M**\n\n**TSLA 2030: Elon projects 20M**. This can be super optimistic, I will get back to it soon.\n\nDemand for TSLA? TSLA does not have a demand issue as Elon. For example, currently TSLA is the second largest EV in \\*CHINA\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's Look at RIVIAN ($RIVN) production forecast according to its own CEO, however ambitious and optimistic:\n\nRIVN 2023: [CEO projects 200K](https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/)\n\n**RIVN 2030:** [**CEO projects at least 1M**](https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/)**.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Car production:**\n   1. Whether in 2023 or 2030, TSLA will produce at least 10X as RIVN. I say at least because TSLA can prove based on current plans capacity it can deliver 2.1M in 2023, RIVN CEO cannot really prove that, but let's take his work.\n2. **Demand**\n   1. Much hype has been made about RIVN because F and AMZN invested in it. And AMZN has committed to purchase 100K vehicles over the next 5 years. Let's put things into perspective: **TSLA has proved its popularity in CHINA, EUROPE, and US vs. RIVN has a contract with AMZN.**\n   2. **Some misunderstanding by retail investors about RIVN:** Just because F and AMZN backed RIVN does not mean they will be giving RIVN free money OK?  IF that guarantees that RIVN can finance with future rounds (good thing), this will dilute your shares\n3. **Other production**\n   1. **Unlike TSLA, RIVN is ONLY a car company. TSLA produces solar, batteries, software, soon Lithium, + has proven it can navigate through shortages**\n4. **Management:**\n   1. I think we all agree - even TSLA haters - that Elon is one of the smartest most innovative, most ambitious visionary with a long track record of success after success. We know nothing about Scaringe. He is definitely a smart guy, but it would be extremely extremely optimistic to think he can one up Elon on innovation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally we can talk about returns on your investment.**\n\nRIVN remains largely pre-revenue, it has not proven itself yet. Therefore investors RIVN which is more risky play, needs to deliver higher returns than TSLA. **No one would invest in a pre-revenue company if its expected return on investment does not exceed  more mature companies.** Would you invest in TSLA if the returns on its stock is not going to exceed that of KO?\n\nIn 2030 TSLA/RIVN Car production only **= 20x.** Let's say Elon is too optimistic about 2030 and Scaringe is conservative, **let's say it is 15X**\n\n**Currently the market cap is only 7.8 X half of production ratio.**\n\nThis means that even if TSLA's non-car production (solar, software, chips, etc) does not materialize and is equal to zero (against all evidence) ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR/CONCLUSION:**\n\nAt fair valuation in 2030 **with extremely generous assumption to RIVN** compared to TSLA **the returns on your RIVN investment will be HALF of that of TSLA**.. (1+x)=2\\*(1+y)\n\n**If the return on your TSLA stock is 100% ===> $RVN will be 0%**\n\n**If the return on your TSLA stock is 50% ===> $RVN will be -25%**\n\n**If the return on your TSLA stock is 0% ===> $RVN will be -50%**\n\nIF TSLA crashes by 30% as some TSLA skeptics such as me believe it is possible, RIVN will have to crash by 65%\n\nAgain, this is under the assumption that TSLA (like RIVN) is only a car company and that RIVN will meet and exceed its goals in comparison to TSLA.\n\n**Would you invest in a pre-revenue company with lower returns than a mature company?**\n\nFor more analysis like this you can follow me on twitter: at TCPresearch ...

Is anyone cornering that supply?\n\nIt depends on the type of batteries. Most are Lithium based, which require some rarer materials, however those materials have been getting phased out in newer batteries.\n\nAlso they've been experimenting with alternative batteries. Tesla has been starting to use iron based batteries recently that someone else developed. To sum it up briefly they're heavier than Lithium batteries, and don't have quite as much range, however they're cheaper to make, and don't suffer from battery degradation if you charge them to 100% like Lithium batteries do. \n\nThere's other types of batteries being worked on to, but none of which are really in mass production.\n\n> Then there\u2019s the electricity itself. Can\u2019t Elon use his solar panels and battery tech to power his superchargers? He can sell you the car AND generate and sell the electricity that goes into it. Right? It would be like combining chevron and Ford. Or like how Bezos has his own airports and trucking fleets. \n\nAt least some of the charging stations are powered in part from solar. However there's a reason why the faster level 3 charging is more expensive, it's because it uses a lot more power. Also keep in mind you wouldn't want a charging station to run out of power and potentially strand EV owners because they couldn't recharge. That's what could happen if solar powered chargers run out of power at night, or can't recharge on a day with bad weather.\n\n> Someone smart please ELI5 about the future of batteries, the needed materials, who controls that, who can make batteries best \u2014 then please tell us about charging networks and power generation\u2014 that will tell me who wins the EV game, right?\n\nLike I said somewhat earlier it really depends as there's more then 1 type of battery being used, and there's others being worked on (like the mythical solid state battery, which I personally remain deeply skeptical about hitting the market anything soon). There's some supply issues with batteries yes, a lot of automakers are trying to acquire enough supplies for it.\n\nThat said while Tesla does make their own batteries, they also buy them from other suppliers like CATL, because they can't make enough themselves. A lot of the other automakers have similar plans.\n\nThat said, if you want to learn more about battery supply issues there's an interview with JB Straubel on a channel called \"This week in startups\" you may want to listen to. He left Tesla a few years ago to start a company focused on recycling all the EV batteries when they inevitably reach their end of life.

And so Bernie is trying to find a clear, obvious, message to get through to voters and get them to actually stand up and fight for something.\n\nUnfortunately people like Musk are an easy target because there's already such a strong push to discredit him. And it's easy to pick on Bezos because he's a huge tool that's completely out of touch. And it's easy to pick on Zuckerberg because people think he's probably a lizard, and even Gates isn't as popular as he used to be when he first started putting a lot of money towards charity.\n\nBut the truth is that we could confiscate 100% of everything that Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg and Gates own, and it wouldn't even cover the US defense budget for a year. We could just seize 100% of the assets of one of the richest billionaires, every single year, and it would only be enough to give everyone else a 1% or 2% tax cut.\n\nActually, I think Biden has/had the right idea. Increase the top marginal tax rates for incomes above $400k (which would also apply to famous billionaires too). Increasing rates to a reasonable amount across the board works way better than focusing on a tiny number of extremely wealthy people (especially when the average voter doesn't know the difference between realized and unrealized gains). Biden is suggesting a much more progressive tax proposal than just focusing on the \"extremely wealthy\". \n\nAnd probably more importantly we should be properly funding the IRS, spending more to audit billionaires to catch the ones that actually aren't paying what they owe, and closing obvious loophole like the way we tax inheritance.\n\nUnfortunately, Bernie might be right, and simple common sense tax reform might be too complicated for most voters to understand.

{"title": "Thoughts on Rivians price being at 130$ after IPO? Do you plan to buy, hold or short when options become available?", "selftext": " \n\nTwo days after IPO Rivian has increased by 69.49% to 132.20$ per share and reached a market cap of 112 billion. Rivian is an electric vehicle company and to date has sold >200 vehicles however hopes to expand that to 1 million per year by 2030. Both Amazon and ford have large stakes in Rivian and Amazon plans to purchase 100,000 of Rivians electric vans that they plan to produce in the future.\n\nThe best company to compare Rivian to is Tesla since it's the biggest all electric vehicle manufacturer. When Tesla first IPO\u2019d it had already sold over 1000 vehicles and had a market cap of around 2 billion which is 55x less than Rivians today. I think this is absurd, Rivian has yet to prove it's ability to scale yet has a market cap a 10th of Teslas while selling more than 1000x less vehicles. (this is excluding the fact that tesla has other businesses outside automotive deliveries that attribute to its market cap) Considering that Rivian is at extremely low volume at the moment and is experiencing its first factory ramp there will most likely be delays which could affect the outlook (we have seen this with tesla having numerous delays). We do not know what rivians margins are, they could be as low as 10% like traditional OEM\u2019s or as high as 30% like tesla. \n\nI do think that Rivian has potential , it looks like they have a good product from the reviews I've seen and they have big backers but at the moment the euphoria around the stock is baseless.\n\nWith all of these uncertainties I think that Rivians current stock price is completely unjustified and I plan on shorting it once options become available.

This means that we have enough stock in total to elect someone to the board of these companies. We can elect a member of this community to become a fully-fledged board member of a large multi-national company. Since I'm an Australian, I think I can only be elected to something like Afterpay's board, but in short, if we chose an American national they can be given a full-time job as a fully-fledged board member of a large publicly listed company such as GME or TSX purely through reddit.\n\nGenerally most companies pick insiders to go through the internal AGMs to nominate candidates to become part of the board, however very few people vote in these because they often don't care, since nobody usually cooperates to elect someone to a board. However, with a fully centralized discussion like we have here on r/wallstreetbets, we can elect our chosen candidate to be a member of a board.\n\nNow we just need a process to elect the candidate. I guess suggest your idea for an election process in the comments and we can go for the top-voted, legal one there.\n\nEdit: Alright, it's late at night for me and early in the morning for many of you, I'm going to DM a few of you and then we can get something worked out.

I know a lot of you were present during the mooning phase to 100 so should have some insight. Out of all the streamers VIAC seems to be in the best position to grow.

You have no voting rights, you own common stock. You want voting rights? Buy VIACA.

They're a old media company that doesn't understand the internet.\n\nNow look at what Netflix and Disney do. They create hype by making shorts for internet consumption. Netflix will throw money at basically anything. \"I wanna make a Castlevania anime!\" (Netflix throws money) \"Go do it.\" \"I wanna make a Korean survival drama - in Korean! We'll dub it too.\" (Netflix throws money) \"Go do it.\"\nDisney: \"I've created a series of interconnected TV short series shows that are part of our wider Marvel Universe franchise - oh and we only drop them once a week.\" Means it'll keep subscriptions up because anybody canceling this month will miss the finale next month. Then they'll be out of the pop culture loop on social media.\"\n\nSee how much buzz there is on social media concerning Netflix or Disney.

The shorted daily volume is higher than those companies. VIAC also has a higher Short Interest.\n\nHaving said that, I do remember VIAC having a decent rally before the Archegos incident.

If the price dropped to $10 tomorrow, I would assess whether the drop was due to fundamental changes or additional SHF shorting. Since VIAC's last management reshuffle and its headway into streaming platforms, I haven't seen any fundamental weaknesses. Hence, I'd probably slightly add more to my position and continue holding until a price recovery.
