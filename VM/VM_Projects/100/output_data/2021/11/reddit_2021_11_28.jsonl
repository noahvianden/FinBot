{"title": "Mythbusting TQQQ", "selftext": "It seems many posters are circulating a lot of misinformation about TQQQ (and leveraged ETFs in general) so I'm certain a lot of readers have internalized many false myths that I want to bust:\n\n**TQQQ will always decay over time vs 3x QQQ**\n\nFALSE\n\nBasically TQQQ rebalances daily after the close.  The purpose of the rebalancing is to ensure TQQQ will perform at 3x the next day so it will reduce or increase it's exposure appropriately.  This rebalancing means TQQQ will have a variance to 3x QQQ over time.  If bullish, TQQQ will be >3x, bearish <3x which are both positive developments for investors.  The problem is choppy markets will cause TQQQ to decline in value vs. QQQ which is what a lot of myths focus on.\n\nBloggers have coined this \"volatility decay\" and this is a bad misnomer.  Decay implies the rebalancing is always bad as in negative to the returns on TQQQ.  For example:\n\nOn February 19, 2020 the pre-pandemic closing high for QQQ is $236.98, for TQQQ is $118.06 (pre-2021 split).  On March 23, 2020, QQQ closed at $170.46, a drop of 28.1%.  A 3x drop would be 84.2% and many bloggers would have you believe the drop would be even worse with volatility decay --  WRONG.  On March 23, 2020, TQQQ closed at $35.62, a drop of 69.8% which while significant is still way less than 3x and a *positive* variance of 14.4%\n\nNow, let's take it from there to the close on September 1, 2020.  QQQ is at $299.92, a 75.9% gain.  3x would be 227.8% but TQQQ closed at $169.74 a 376.5% increase and a huge *positive* variance of 148.7% to 3x QQQ.  Thus, the rebalancing or \"volatility decay\" can be positive or negative.\n\n**TQQQ will go to zero one day**\n\nFALSE\n\nThe only way to have TQQQ drop to zero is if the NASDAQ 100 drops 33.4%+ in *one* trading session.  Remember, it has to be *one* trading session.  Just think about that, what would it take for the index to drop that much in a single day?  Probably something that makes money worthless like a nuclear war or huge asteroid strike.  And then we have circuit breakers on the exchanges.  Not going into detail but a drop of 20% should shut down trading for the day and TQQQ will rebalance.  Even if this kept on and on the bottom line is TQQQ will continue to exist.  Want more evidence?  SQQQ is still alive and kicking despite the massive bull market and many reverse stock splits.\n\nAlso bloggers have cited many leveraged ECN's and commodity ETFs closing and citing contango as a built in negative factor.  There are so many problems with this.  TQQQ is based off stock index and while contango is a real thing it is inapplicable to TQQQ.\n\n**My Opinion**\n\nFor me TQQQ has been great for swing trading and writing options on.  But I watch it daily, use technical analysis, and have been lucky to sniff out major drops before the bottom and sell, and then get back in.  Yes, I got murdered on the way down but I recovered it all and then some.  Buy and hold (and the implied *forget*) is IMHO too dangerous no matter what backtesting tells you.\n\nThat is the big question; will you have the discipline to sell out when the next big correction hits?  And also will you buy back in before it completely bounces back?  If you don't think you can do both then I would stay away from TQQQ.\n\nEDIT:  FYI, there have been many posts in this subreddit demonstrating the volatility decay with math.  While volatility decay is real under certain circumstances what those posts fail to explain is in bull (or bear) rallies the positive rebalancing variance will more than wipe out the decay.\n\nQuick example, August 3, 2021 QQQ is $366.81 and TQQQ $135.01, on October 14 after much choppiness QQQ is back to $366.63 but TQQQ is only at $133.24.  That's just a -1.2% decay.  Now fast forward to November 19, 2021 and we have QQQ at $403.99 and TQQQ at 177.14, all decay has been wiped out as TQQQ now has a positive variance of 0.8% to 3x QQQ.\n\nEDIT 2:  I would just state that I would not advocate a *buy hold and forget* TQQQ strategy.

In a bear market, god help whoever holds it.\"* \\- No shit, can be said for literally every single investment ever.

Meaning chances of it happening are so extremely slim, that it's not even worth mentioning it. Just because it's possible for APPL to go to zero in the next week, doesn't mean it's *probable*.

You can have a strategy, keep some money aside and once a market crash comes, average down. Not only that, there will be red flags for why there might be a market crash and guess what, if you are not comfortable holding your shares, there is this thing called \"sell button\".

{"title": "Opinion of Omicron from a lab tech.", "selftext": "Just going to put this out there, and not as a doomer or anything, but omicron has probably spread everywhere and not just 1 of 2 cases here and there. It's been running around probably for several weeks and we just now know what we're looking for. It's popped up in 3 different continents outside Africa in the four-ish days since it was publicly announced so you can safely say these new cases are not the first.\n\nI'm not saying it'll get as bad as delta, but you can bet your already fisted asses that governments are going to impose a shitload of overreactive (potentially who knows right now) restrictions.\n\nVery bullish for covid stonks. Dow might continue to shit the bed and drag spy with it, but ol' nassy should bounce.\n\nBy the by, I'm not an epidemiologist, but I do covid testing in a hospital so i do have some actual knowledge in the area. It is really fucking hard to track variants because most people who walk through our doors that get tested never have samples sent to the state. If it's positive we do 0 further investigation and I've worked in several facilities in the country who follow the same protocol. Most of the cost efficient and widely used tests (see Abbott Id now) don't go any further than testing for all variants and it would be really impractical to go further and send every positive sample out. \n\nEarly covid we had to send samples to the state labs or ref labs and it would take 8 to 10 days to get results back. We won't run into this issue specifically again, but if we were to send out every positive sample for specific genotyping would likely develop a decent backlog. After a certain period it does very little good because by the time we know we need to do contact tracing it's already spread once, maybe twice depending on how backlogged they get. Not to mention that biotech companies would have to design and manufacture en mass the kits to do it. The lag there would put us in the middle of a wave if this thing really ramps up. Now it is easy to design new pcr primers, but again you still need them in bulk and it's really tough to do it in a high throughput capacity because it actually takes skilled labor which we are really, really short on.\n\nTl;Dr it very likely in multiple states and we will see it pop up widely in a couple weeks if it spreads as fast or faster than delta. It's hard to track properly and there will be a shitload of fear-mongering and knee jerk reactions. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80  covid stonks over the coming weeks.us.\n\nEdit- sorry I didn't include position! Nflx 12/3 670/675 call spreads. It's bounced off support recently after being beat up unlike the other megacaps and its tried to go on a run the past two market opens. Pretty confident itll push an ath if the fear mongering continues. That is barring a true market crash, but this isn't the black swan you are looking for.\n\nEdit numero dos- I am strongly assuming this won't bring about a horrible death-toll or put us at essentially a new game + version of covid. My concern is labor disruption due to the unvaccinated population getting run through (even if it is mild) and breakthrough infections. A lot of work places demand you stay home if infected or if you're the responsible type and test positive and decide to quarantine your employer can't say anything because it's an osha violation. This is the big concern on the market - how will it further fuck supply chain issues because of staffing issues. Past that I'm not saying it's a nothingburger, but it's probably just more of the same as delta is.\n\nEdit 3 because I'm tired of explaining it - I'm a medical lab scientist, but its easiest just to say lab tech and far less pompous. I have a 4 year degree with upper level courses in immunology, infectious disease, and a lot of other shit that's not completely relevant to covid. I'm not a doctor nor do I claim to be, but I work 20 feet from an ER and see critical covid cases on the reg and do play a role in those cases. I'm not a high-school grad making minimum wage who can barely be trusted to pipette things. I've also done a few years research in micro, molecular and biochemistry.

From Moderna CMO - \\~30 mutations on the spike protein, 50 mutations in total. Also believes that it will be probable that immune escape will occur. \\*no evidence to support yet.\n2. 2 cases discovered in Canada.\n\n**TL;DR.** *On the variant itself* \\- it is likely highly transmissible (\\~500% more than the virus originating from Wuhan), a small sample size suggests it is less severe.  Immunity escape and vaccine avoidance are unknown.  See link below for details on the above, mutations and actual case counts. Edit: Important note is that the data on transmission and severity is based on limited information, however the WHO states there was enough evidence to make a declarative statement on transmissibility. The facts pertaining to this variant are based around what is scientifically known about the mutations.\n\n*Latest News* \\- Israel has shut its borders for 2 weeks, India has stated they may restrict international travel, CDC states there are no USA cases.\n\n*Positive Information, Path forward and an opinion on the markets:*\n\n1. 14\u201321 days: much more information will be available about the mutations (especially the unknown ones). We will also have more information on severity.\n2. 50 to 100 days: IF the variant escapes vaccines it will take about 6 weeks to release an updated vaccine (this is because in the case of vaccine updates a limited trial of just 24 people is required). Estimate is 50 to 100 days to having the vaccine available.\n\nMy personal opinion: if the markets are truly forward looking and we estimate that a highly transmissible, less severe disease may have some resolution in 100 days then the market should correct it\u2019s recent downtrend (will have to analyze flows tonight).\n\nPositions: long Apple, cash and VIX calls as a hedge\n\nEdit 2: Notes on Friday's market action (26Nov21)\n\n1. It was a half day of trading with low volume (low liquidity)\n2. JPow's announcement had been pulled to earlier in the week (would have been a positive catalyst for Friday)\n3. SPX futures dropped below the vol trigger line (4666) overnight - this means things can get extreme - term structure went into backwardation as well.\n4. Disagreement between OPEC and SPR release for several countries (crude impact)\n5. MOC $2B + (could be funds de-risking)\n6. A lot of put selling occurred at 3800 and 4000 (for Feb) on SPX\n7. The magnitude and volume of the moves on Friday usually indicate we have more downside but this could really have been an overreaction to the Omicron news, so I'm waiting for the market to tell me what to do (my trading style) - I'll be very interested in futures tonight, the volatility and flow positioning.", "id": "r459cw", "created_utc": 1638109041.0, "score": 607, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 489, "comments": [{"body": "Pfizer setting up a Netflix subscription model .", "score": 785, "replies": [{"body": "Pfizer season pass", "score": 265, "replies": [{"body": "Season 2 dlc incoming", "score": 97, "replies": [{"body": "They're hoping to get through the Greek alphabet at least once.

Now, with the vaccine, survival rates are significantly higher. \nPeople die in hospital. If they died at home or on the street, esp in NYC, then something went severely fucking wrong. \n\n2) By observing data: face masks help slow the spread of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19? Yes. Face masks combined with other preventive measures, such as getting vaccinated, frequent hand-washing and physical distancing, can help slow the spread of the virus.\n\nLastly: \n3) The Dunning-Kruger effect: is a hypothetical cognitive bias stating that people with low ability at a task overestimate their own ability, and that people with high ability at a task underestimate their own ability.
