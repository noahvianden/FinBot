JPM then unilaterally decided these defaulted and exercised early termination of the warrants. \n\nJPM then went to the open market to purchase 228,775 shares @ $709 to close out its corresponding short hedge position and are seeking this amount back (228,775 x $709 = $162.2 mil). The basis of claim is that the loss is an early termination amount (defined as covering losses incurred as a result of the termination, including related hedges), which JPM alleges is owed under the contract. \n\nThis isn't something as simple as defaulting on a loan and it's going to come down to a number of different issues. While the tweets do come into play, they are not the basis of the claim. \n\nI think it's very likely they will end up settling out of court for an undisclosed sum.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Right, those numbers are \"the calculation.\"\n\nThey JP Morgan says Tesla has not disagreed with the adjustments, they've just made general statements about disliking that adjustments happened, followed by defaulting. Did they raise specific, detailed concerns with the adjustments? No. And they can't. Their contract says that by announcing the offer to go private, they must accept the adjustments by the Calculating Agent. They even complained that the adjustments were swift! How absurd. The contract says the adjustments are to be made ***on or after*** the date of the related event. As they point out in the complaint, they could have done the adjustment on the same day and it would have benefited them even more than waiting the week that they did, in fact, wait.\n\nAnd the biggest adjustment is from the split, which Tesla can't argue against at all. That is totally mechanical.\n\nThey can't just whine about the market volatility benefiting JP Morgan and hurting themselves. It was in their contract that that would happen, and the market volatility was needlessly manufactured by Elon Musk, an act that he paid a $20m fine to resolve.\n\nI doubt they'll settle for an undisclosed sum, I think JP Morgan not only wants the money, they want future parties to know they enforce their contracts. I think they'll tell Tesla, just pay up and it goes away. Otherwise, they win a motion for summary judgement and get the full amount, because there don't appear to be any disputable facts to argue over, as the SEC action already determined many of the facts. Note that the contract sticks Tesla with JP Morgan's entire legal fees. So why do they need to settle?\n\nBecause of the way the contract was written, with JP Morgan as the Calculating Agent, with sole authority to make the calculations, if Tesla though wanted to dispute the amount in court they needed to pay it, and then sue to get it back.

It's a tiny screen, and you have to stare at it. The interface of swiping etc are limited, and typing on it sucks. It doesn't know what you are looking at unless you hold up the phone with your arm, and of course you need at least one hand to operate a phone. With an AR device a lot of those limitations are not true anymore. Imagine turning on/off lights or getting relevant context-sensitive info / actions just by looking at them (via eye tracking), or the ability to follow recipes while cooking with greasy hands, and a lot of other uses where smart phones can't do today (there are a lot more use cases that I'm not getting into).

This doesn't need access to stable internet connection to work.\n\n> on thing the VR industry isn't talking about is the fact that a lot of people can't use VR because it makes them sick, nauseated or just plain uncomfortable\n\nThis is like one of the top priorities for VR / AR industry... It's very much acknowledged. I spent weeks working on a prototype simulating different scenarios on this kind of stuff. There are a lot of reasons for why motion sickness happens, and each one of them require a lot of hard work to addres. If you look at what Michael Abrash (head of Meta's research on AR / VR) is saying, a lot of the items they want to tackle are on this. It's not perfect today for sure, but addressing this issue is pretty high up on pretty much everyone's list. It's just not the kind of thing you can wave a magic wand and fix tomorrow and require long term development.\n\n(I don't work for Meta btw, but used to work in this industry)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["meta"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3695390820503235}], "tickers": ["meta"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.509283721446991}, {"body": "Metaverses have been around for almost 3 decades already.

So perhaps he will be able to get millions of users on board and make a successful MMO. His best case scenario, and let's just be absolutely ridiculous here and assume that he surpasses World of Warcraft in active users.... well, World of Warcraft has a very robust subscription structure designed to milk players of all their money.

A cinematic VR experience where you are part of the narrative would be really cool.\n\nWhat I don't see is for people to culturally want to throw on a bulky headset just to socialize with their friends using a fake avatar, when they can either just video chat with them, or see them in person.\n\nFrom a consumer standpoint, this already exists with games like VRChat. You can draw on a whiteboard to collaborate, chat with proximity, and move around a VR world with virtual avatars. Basically, what all these big companies like Meta(Facebook), Microsoft, etc are trying to do, VRChat did years ago. It hasn't really taken off besides gamers trying to Role play. It's cool at first, but the novelty wears off fast.\n\nWhile VR/AR is fun with a niche audience, I don't see most 55 year old MBA CEOs trying it and being like \"metaverse in the future, we're moving from Zoom to a virtual Metaverse office\".\n\nMost execs can't even accept remote work, and many are pushing people back to the office despite the impact on employee morale, turnover, liability risks, and costs. If they can't even tolerate Zoom meetings, what makes you think they'll tolerate spending 2 hours in a meeting with a bulky headset strapped to their head when they can just meet face to face or on Zoom?\n\nAs a huge gaming nerd and software engineer that has played VR extensively, I don't even think I would prefer Metaverse meetings. Screen sharing features provide everything I need to collaborate, wearing a bulky headset just to look at a virtual projector screen sounds stupid.\n\nIf I don't even see a use for it, why would someone older, less tech saavy, or someone that prefers real personal connections want it?\n\nI don't see any reason how \"Metaverse\" can transform anything the way the internet does. Why would I want to navigate a virtual 3d shopping mall to go shopping, when I can just type in a text box and get exactly what I'm looking for, complete with photos, reviews, and answered questions?\n\nI do think there are a few niche applications. For example, I can definitely see home sellers using VR to allow customers to preview customizations to their home, or in ther construction projects.\n\nBut the idea that a company will see their earnings grow 100x because they're a \"Metaverse\" company is basically the same thing as companies with \".COM\" in their name getting hyped up.

But sadly I was too young to invest.\n\nWell VR/AR are not at that stage. Heck, AR is arguably not even at the Apple II stage. Something different about smartphones though, is that they were partially an iterative technology, which meant that people understood phones by that point, so convincing them of a smartphone was easier than if phones came into existence with smartphones.\n\n> Shared virtual worlds have existed for decades as long as the internet has been around.

This was always about slim visors/sunglasses and avatars that you literally can't tell apart from a real person. This isn't some sci-fi dream, but tech that has been demonstrated already. It's lab-based for now, and it will remain that way for the better part of a decade, but that doesn't mean it's not coming.\n\n> From a consumer standpoint, this already exists with games like VRChat.

It has a lot of latency and doesn't provide the required tools for good business. Horizon Workrooms and Spatial on the other hand do as far as VR can today.\n\nBut I think the term metaverse is muddled here. The metaverse is not just Facebook's version of VRChat. It's every 3D world in an interconnected network. If VRChat is a website with hyperlinks, then the metaverse is the Internet that ties it together with other 'websites' or in this case other 3D world apps.\n\nThis isn't a solo effort either. FB is building this with many others, and it requires all sorts of new protocols and APIs in place. That's why it doesn't exist today.\n\n>  If they can't even tolerate Zoom meetings, what makes you think they'll tolerate spending 2 hours in a meeting with a bulky headset strapped to their head when they can just meet face to face or on Zoom?\n\nIgnoring the bulky part since I covered that, but it saves the travel, has none of the downsides of zoom, none of the downsides of face to face, and all the upsides of both. So there you go. It's just objectively better for collaboration - or will be as it matures.\n\n\n\n> Why would I want to navigate a virtual 3d shopping mall to go shopping, when I can just type in a text box and get exactly what I'm looking for, complete with photos, reviews, and answered questions?\n\nIt's not that literal.

For non-stationary experiences, VR requires a large clear area to enjoy, which most people don't have space for. Otherwise your options are:\n\n1. Use a control stick to move around, which feels more like the world is moving around you than you moving in the world. Very disorienting and causes motion sickness for many.\n\n2. Use \"teleport\" to move, which honestly limits the experience and hurts immersion as you are constantly reminded that you are using artificial controls to move.\n\nAll of the workarounds I've seen like Omni treadmills are janky and expensive.\n\nAlso, once the novelty wears off, VR doesn't really feel like a virtual world. It feels like you're looking through binoculars into a 3D display. But audio and visual are the only senses it addresses. The disconnect of being unable to feel the world around you is very disorienting, as everything is essentially a hologram.\n\n>It's not like the intent is to say \"Hey, I want to do some shopping.

Everything you brought up as a stop-gap to accessibility and convenience is demonstrably solvable.\n\nSpace seems like a bigger issue than it is, because it's mostly gaming and exercise apps that wants you to move about, which is just a couple out of many usecases. Even then, most games work in a small space where you only need room to stretch your arms out in a 180 degree cone in front of you.\n\nThere are some potential ways to greatly diminish joystick movement by tricking the inner ear with haptics in the left/ride sides of the headset that correspond to left/right footsteps, and general improvements in optics/latency will help quite a bit at reducing things across the board.

It's sort of like the 2007 residential mortgage backed securities issue. You've got these inflated commercial loans being packaged together and sold to unsuspecting investors. You've also got the government buying these things hand over fist. It's a complex puzzel but the pieces are there. If anything, it's an interesting read and listen when you get some free time.

At the time, to make a car that was high volume and relatively affordable, there just wasn't anywhere to get the batteries at scale to make it work. Legacy automakers could buy small volumes of expensive batteries and subsidize their losses with their legacy business. But to make a profitable, high volume, EV Tesla needed more batteries than they could possibly buy.\n\nAnd no battery company was willing to make the investment in a huge new battery factory by themselves, just to supply one \"niche\" EV maker in california. Especially since no other automakers seemed interested in making EVs in high volume.\n\nSo, Telsa built the battery factory, and leased the cell manufacturing area to Panasonic, with an agreement to buy 100% of their production. But that factory could really only make packs for the new Model 3, so they needed to get the Model 3 lines ramped up in Freemont to absorb that production. But they also needed to make sure that Gigafactory 1 ramped up to produce enough packs for the Model 3 lines. Both of those things were huge investments, with lots of fixed cost, operation costs, depreciation, etc.\n\nIf there was a delay in either one that was too long, it could've easily bankrupted the company. And there were delays, and it really pushed Tesla to the limits of the capital they had on hand to keep things running.\n\nThese days, everyone wants to make EVs, everyone's begging for batteries, lots of companies are investing in their own battery factories or making deals with battery companies. And there's lots of companies just planning to expand production with the assumption that there'll be demand for it.\n\nAll these new EV startups have things *much* easier. They're not going to face that risky chicken/egg problem because every big battery company on Earth is scaling production because they know they can always sell any extra to Tesla. A few small EV startups can grab a few gWh's of cells here and there, and it won't even be a blip in annual production.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That is a fucking good analysis. But it still doesnt justify their valuation. For tesla, it was like: Nobody has done it before, therefore you cant either and gave tesla shit all ways to sunday.

They can just raise billions on a whim like Tesla the last year, but they are not even like tesla 10 years ago. They also have it VASTLY easier due to their unbelievable valuation.\n\nIf Tesla would have had anywhere near rivians valuation 10 years ago, they would have not gone almost bankrupt on the attempt to scale M3. HOWEVER, scaling M3 would have been MUUCH more expensive because they would have run longer with existing errors before they had to fix them. Now, Tesla is forged in vulcano fire like no other company was. The efficiency and scalability of Tesla is BECAUSE they almost went bankrupt and BECAUSE they had to get this efficient in order to survive. None of the other new entrances have that problem. They dont have an elon musk and they are not driven by shear will power to unbelievable execution efficiency.\n\nThe newcomers are patted in sugar by investors that are looking for the new Tesla because they missed the train. Its a hype that helps these new companies to survive longer. But does it make them better, stronger? I doupt it. We will see, I whish them luck. Hope I am wrong, but at least for lucid, I dont see much of a future given their secrecy and throttling of customers with NDAs. This is not how the world works any more.

There's lots of investors that wish they would've bought Tesla at any point in the last 10 years, or maybe even wish they hadn't lost all that money shorting Tesla. And now they're just hoping on the next big thing. Which just shows that they don't understand the fundamentals that are, and have been, driving Telsa's valuation. And they still think EVs are something \"anyone can do\".\n\nEven if things are much easier now, and it's possible for new EV companies to ramp up twice as fast as Tesla (which I believe was/is the fastest growing auto company of all time? Even outpacing Ford when it launched the Model T), that would still leave a pretty big runway to get to 87 billion valuation like Lucid has right now. Tesla didn't hit that kind of market cap, until late 2019/early 2020, about 12 years after they delivered their first car. So I could see that kind of valuation if Lucid can cut that in half, get to some kind of volume deliveries, and profitability, within 6 years?\n\nI mean, I can see the writing on the wall. Petrol cars are going away, we're going to be at the point where a majority of all new cars are EVs much sooner than most people expect. And having a startup that's making and delivering anything puts them way ahead of competitors. Arguably even ahead of legacy automakers.

The Delta variant intervened, and mandatory return-to-office plans turned optional. Still, many people chose to report back to their desks: The share of employed people who worked remotely at some point during the month because of Covid, which had peaked in May 2020 at 35 percent, dropped in October to 11 percent, the lowest point since the pandemic began, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A closer look at the New York work force, from a November survey of 188 major employers, showed that 8 percent of Manhattan office workers are back in the office full time, 54 percent are fully remote and everyone else \u2014 nearly 40 percent \u2014 is hybrid.\r  \n\r  \nFew are finding it a smooth transition period. Some companies used their tentative R.T.O. dates as an unwitting excuse to avoid questions about how to balance the needs of their remote and in-person employees, according to Edward Sullivan, an executive coach. That has resulted in a mushy middle ground: video calls where remote workers have trouble hearing, a sense that people at home are missing out on perks (teammates), while those in the office are, too (pajamas). And the stakes aren\u2019t just who is getting talked over in meetings. It\u2019s whether flexibility is sustainable, even with all the benefits it confers.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of companies get this wrong,\u201d said Chris Herd, an entrepreneur and expert on hybrid work.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nImage\r  \n\u201cWork From Work Wednesday\u201d at CommonBond, a student loan start-up with 105 people on staff.\r  \n\u201cWork From Work Wednesday\u201d at CommonBond, a student loan start-up with 105 people on staff.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\r  \nRecently Brett Hautop, head of workplace at LinkedIn, sat in a conference room listening to a pitch from a global vendor. The firm wanted to sell its services to LinkedIn to help facilitate effective hybrid work. But the people making that pitch had turned their back to the video camera, so the LinkedIn employees joining by videoconference couldn\u2019t see them.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAs they\u2019re talking about how hard it is for people who are remote to keep up with conversations, they\u2019re covering the camera,\u201d Mr. Hautop said, adding: \u201cPeople on my team were pinging me saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re doing this.\u2019 And I was apologizing, saying, \u2018Hey, guys, I\u2019m sorry this is happening, they\u2019re apparently not aware.\u2019\u201d", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Last summer, LinkedIn told its 16,000 employees worldwide that its return-to-office plan announced in October 2020 had been scrapped, and that individual departments would decide where their people could work, becoming one of more than 60 major companies that have promised some permanent form of flexibility. Mr. Hautop and his team took stock of the difficulties bred by that approach. They upgraded audiovisual equipment in conference rooms and considered distributing ring lights to in-person workers at their desks so their faces wouldn\u2019t be awkwardly lit on calls. They planned \u201con-site off-sites,\u201d so employees could remember what it was they loved about the office.\r  \n\r  \nDaily business updates  The latest coverage of business, markets and the economy, sent by email each weekday.

Half the participants were at the San Francisco headquarters, and the other half joined by videoconference. The remote workers, including the company\u2019s chief executive, started to lose patience as people in the room talked over one another and made side comments.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe were joking that if we didn\u2019t like what somebody was saying on the screen, we could just mute them,\u201d said Anna Binder, the company\u2019s head of people.\r  \n\r  \nBusiness & Economy: Latest Updates\r  \nUpdated \r  \nNov. 16, 2021, 9:00 a.m. ET31 minutes ago\r  \n31 minutes ago\r  \nMarket watchers say that companies are citing supply chain issues as an excuse for other problems.\r  \nGermany suspends approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, sending gas prices soaring.\r  \nRetail sales jumped in October in a third straight month of gains.\r  \n\u201cWe all had such a terrible experience that we made a decision at the end of that meeting that all executive meetings going forward will be in person,\u201d she continued. \u201cOr they will be fully remote.

Many executives said employees with care-taking responsibilities were more likely to work remotely when given the option. A survey from the jobs platform FlexJobs found that 68 percent of women preferred their jobs to stay remote long term, compared with 57 percent of men. Another study, from Qualtrics and theBoardlist, found that 34 percent of men with children had received promotions while working remotely, compared with just 9 percent of women with children.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIf you give people full choice about what they do and where they work,\u201d Ms. Binder said, \u201cwomen are more likely to take advantage of that work-from-home flexibility. Which means they, in turn, are going to be less in the room where it happens.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine all of the ways remote workers might be undercut: muted in a heated discussion, shut out of lunchtime bonding. But Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford professor who has surveyed hundreds of hybrid companies, said that at many workplaces the in-person employees felt just as neglected.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s the American-in-Europe rule,\u201d Mr. Bloom said. \u201cWhen an American is traveling abroad, you look around the room and everyone is speaking English for your benefit. If there\u2019s one person working from home, everyone in the office dials into the meeting.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThat\u2019s the case at Zillow, the real estate website currently facing a wave of losses and layoffs, where a quarter of people are hybrid workers and nearly two-thirds are working fully remote. The company\u2019s \u201cOne Zoom All Zoom\u201d rule stipulates that if even one person is participating in a meeting virtually, everyone in the office is required to join on separate laptops. Zillow went so far as to take audiovisual equipment off the conference room walls.\r  \n\r  \nThe Zoom rule is in keeping with Zillow\u2019s broad attitude toward remote work, which has included an announcement that its headquarters moved from Seattle to the cloud.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI go into the office every day,\u201d said Meghan Reibstein, vice president for product management and flexible work, who moved to Asheville, N.C., during the pandemic. \u201cIt just happens to be in the attic of my house.\u201d", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Image\r  \nMany companies used tentative R.T.O. dates as an excuse to dodge questions about whether to prioritize remote or in-person workers.\r  \nMany companies used tentative R.T.O. dates as an excuse to dodge questions about whether to prioritize remote or in-person workers.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\r  \n\r  \nImage\r  \nExperts helping companies navigate this period are hopeful that the pains of hybrid work aren\u2019t permanent.\r  \nExperts helping companies navigate this period are hopeful that the pains of hybrid work aren\u2019t permanent.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\r  \n\r  \nImage\r  \nA dying plant at CommonBond\u2019s SoHo office.\r  \nA dying plant at CommonBond\u2019s SoHo office.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\r  \nBut when the attic becomes the office, and the office becomes a site for weekly bagels and banter, executives are left to answer: What\u2019s the point of paying rent? For many employers, luxe spaces occupied by just a handful of office stalwarts have come to stand as reminders of the real costs associated with the ambiguity of hybrid work.\r  \n\r  \nCourt Cunningham felt that sense of unease recently as he toured New York buildings to lease a new office for his online home-buying company, Orchard: If just 15 percent of his employees were working from the office, was the rent worth 2 percent of revenue? He went back and forth. Then he signed a new lease in October, making a bet on some future where people will want to be in the office.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIn two years this is either going to be a genius move where we locked in a long-term rate in the depths of Covid, or the world is going to go completely remote and we\u2019re going to have this millstone hanging on us,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, the experts helping companies navigate this period are hopeful that the pains of hybrid work aren\u2019t permanent. Or at least that they might be manageable: Some advise their clients to be explicit with their staff about whether to prioritize the needs of office workers or remote ones, especially when it comes to facilitating meetings.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBack in Vietnam the prisoners of war who accepted that they had no idea when they would be saved were the ones who survived,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, chief executive of the coaching firm Velocity Group, reaching for a reference \u2014 what\u2019s known as the Stockdale Paradox \u2014 far from the circumstances of the office water cooler. \u201cThe companies that accepted that this is going to be difficult and communicated that clearly to their teams, they\u2019re going to thrive. There\u2019s no more hoping for Christmas, hoping for Easter. Let\u2019s just accept that this will be hard.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd after acceptance comes decision-making. So Asana chose to label itself \u201coffice-centric hybrid,\u201d with bosses articulating that at some point most people will be expected back at their desks. CommonBond calls itself \u201cremote first,\u201d with its chief executive farther from the Manhattan office than the junior workers who come in on Wednesdays. (\u201cOur center of gravity is the Zoomisphere,\u201d said David Klein, the C.E.O.) Both companies rejected the choose-your-own-adventure approach, where people have no sense of where their managers want them to be.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cImagine people could choose whether they drive on the left side of the road or the right side,\u201d said Mr. Bloom, the Stanford professor. \u201cThere\u2019d be accidents all the time.

And it's something that will probably be absolutely necessary as things get more and more automated.\n\nBeing able to specialize in something and trade is amazing. But if we take that idea too far without putting in any kind of controls, then we end up with a system where you need to earn a decent amount just to survive (ie. not starve or freeze to death on the street) and without some basic progressive policies there'll be some part of the population that can't earn enough. There'll certainly be a part of the population that can't earn enough to live a life with basic dignity.\n\nBy making sure everyone gets enough from the system to continue to be part of the system without dying and/or being abused, it actually makes everyone much better off. In fact, I'm kind of surprised that billionaires aren't pushing harder for this, but that's probably because most billionaires are just as short sighted as everyone else.\n\nBut if you have enough to survive, you can absolutely choose not to work, this has a *ton* of advantages:\n\n* The work you would've done is now available for other people. If that's satisfying work, then great. If it's work that unpleasant, then there won't be many people who choose it, and wages will have to rise to make it worthwhile\n* Lots of other kinds of work become feasible. Hobbies or passion projects or art that generate some income but not enough to survive make sense (and honestly, this is the kind of stuff that billionaires love, if you don't have this kind of stuff to buy, what's the point of all that money)\n* Job retraining and education are much more accessible, so that makes it easier for the economy to respond to changes in labor needs as technology changes\n* Running for office, or other public/policy work is suddenly a lot more accessible to a lot of people. It's really hard to take 6 months off to run for office when you don't know how you're going to pay rent.\n\nPersonally, I think that last one is the biggest hurdle to universal basic income in the US. All the politicians know that they're not the best or the smartest or the hardest working. They're just the best candidates from the tiny pool or people who can afford to run for office. If that pool got much bigger because the barriers to affording to run for office got much lower, then tons and tons of smart, talented, hard working and capable people would be running for office. The incumbents who are used to running unopposed or having one poorly funded challenger, would suddenly be met with a tidal wave of competition that would sweep them right out of office.\n\nMost of the politicians in this country would much rather fuck the entire system up, if it means they can keep their jobs, then fix anything.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "And if the Tesla bot becomes a real product, that starts doing all those tedious, crappy, low paying jobs.

Apple is mostly building the hardware for AR (and because of that implicitly VR). Apple is awesome at that, and Apple is awesome at hardware. It's easy to see where Apple leaves room. Look at their current iPhones, how many apps do you use that are of Apple and how many apps do you use that are from any other company? Sure, Apple has some but that's it. In the metaverse, I believe Apple will take a similar approach, which makes Apple mostly a vertically integrated hardware company.\n\nVertically integrated hardware company: hardware + OS + basic apps + ecosystem\n\nThere is definitely competition with Oculus on the hardware side. However, Meta Platforms is a social media company first and foremost and are therefore mostly existing on the software layer. This is the room that Apple leaves to other companies, so there is no competition there. Since there will be competition with Oculus, it means that Meta Platforms will be able to create premium software for AR/VR on the metaverse.\n\nWhat I think will happen:\n\n* Oculus will compete with Apple on the hardware side. This could produce two possible outcomes (IMO). One outcome that won't happen: there's no way Apple will lose. So the other two outcomes are:\n   * Oculus will lose and Apple takes all\n   * Oculus will be its own ecosystem and Apple will be its own ecosystem\n* The rest of Meta Platforms has virtually no competition on the software side from Apple, besides some utility apps, but Meta Platforms has socially generated content + apps.

It may get big, but it also may be a 100 years from now that it gets big since it depends on AI as well, and AI is a finicky beast with all the black box neural nets going on that you can't debug.

Living up to the name (\u2018Adventure Network\u2019) - the company is expected to offer these chargers even in [remote and off-road destinations](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05RkAopAcOe9lvRAQmKWpCsuB0N_v6Je1tLcuWpbHHM94RpjUfllCIbWuhno4NNuG7zCBCZntB7mOwLFhupDcDi6UfM7C4OFu27cMcvaO4phPVGsG1YHerYDCGq5GQuhuHVnSqU97dWt8hKK3fZG4PEcnD4ol8rAlstneirVzaj4v8rJnjM7rU-HWpA3425NdCHfzd5SmmiUUruRQ1tJCCX2-NbLTwynRChVEoJaVu6OtOHf_FRfFlEk3Zh0LOP867LNvF5QeoIFFcamnm-DyR0ynxBakq-9qXPUU6eiQ3zAiW8g5Gb-9edvQTEnL1NPSOrNCt4bpq5UKbt97qkFJcKKk5qz-EtW6l__R_haiKBA) thereby catering to their more off-trail customers.\n\n \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zs3gkcghqyz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=37c90354f4c993948c3bc30aee1300dc42c03664)\n\n**Investors & Partnerships**\n\nEven more than the product, I would argue that Rivian\u2019s management has been exceptional in choosing the right investors in the company. Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.\n\nThey have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.\n\nOne of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021. This is the single largest order for EV delivery vehicles ever!\n\nBut you should keep in mind that big investors and partnerships might not correlate directly with how good the underlying business is.

One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers\u2019 valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.\n\nWhat we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,\n\n>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  \nTesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue\n\nEven if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \\~130k vehicles in 2023 and \\~400k vehicles in 2025.\n\nGranted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.\n\nThis brings us to..\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4php6nghqyz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=86f236a335caa396c1644bec97facf96e30c8f60)\n\n**Delivery goals & Challenges**\n\n>Rivian says it will produce 20,000 to 40,000 vehicles in 2021, its first full year of production \u2014 [New York Times (](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uwyAMxp-m3IbMn0J74LDLXiMi4KasCcnAaZQ9_Uh7m2XZlvVZn_ULnnCYy-4IK7FlrtTRvqDLuNURibCwtWLpUnQsOrAy2J6l2t0K4uTT6Niy9mMKntKcD5WyAoxgd9erG6qoNSgVwfZGnaMCEwzEqIXXl7eZX2PCHNDhE8s-Z2SjuxMt9aQ-T_Kr5bZtPO-UJqw8zFPbSBDX1sAeRbbSrzVlrLWN5fujBl9SHvCjpGfymd9pGllyEqRoYYQUcL5yyY0I2l6EjjehtZSG08-dLvCLJw3TIHhd-0o-PA5XVtzkywOpYj5eycTH9DyUw0HhJWkgutanNSfaO8y-HzE6KisyeuN9EesGzFga9th5csIoC0YbA8LYN5IGsVETWhpg7Yc4t6v83_4PXAaUGA)[**July 2019**](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uwyAMxp-m3IbMn0J74LDLXiMi4KasCcnAaZQ9_Uh7m2XZlvVZn_ULnnCYy-4IK7FlrtTRvqDLuNURibCwtWLpUnQsOrAy2J6l2t0K4uTT6Niy9mMKntKcD5WyAoxgd9erG6qoNSgVwfZGnaMCEwzEqIXXl7eZX2PCHNDhE8s-Z2SjuxMt9aQ-T_Kr5bZtPO-UJqw8zFPbSBDX1sAeRbbSrzVlrLWN5fujBl9SHvCjpGfymd9pGllyEqRoYYQUcL5yyY0I2l6EjjehtZSG08-dLvCLJw3TIHhd-0o-PA5XVtzkywOpYj5eycTH9DyUw0HhJWkgutanNSfaO8y-HzE6KisyeuN9EesGzFga9th5csIoC0YbA8LYN5IGsVETWhpg7Yc4t6v83_4PXAaUGA)[)](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uwyAMxp-m3IbMn0J74LDLXiMi4KasCcnAaZQ9_Uh7m2XZlvVZn_ULnnCYy-4IK7FlrtTRvqDLuNURibCwtWLpUnQsOrAy2J6l2t0K4uTT6Niy9mMKntKcD5WyAoxgd9erG6qoNSgVwfZGnaMCEwzEqIXXl7eZX2PCHNDhE8s-Z2SjuxMt9aQ-T_Kr5bZtPO-UJqw8zFPbSBDX1sAeRbbSrzVlrLWN5fujBl9SHvCjpGfymd9pGllyEqRoYYQUcL5yyY0I2l6EjjehtZSG08-dLvCLJw3TIHhd-0o-PA5XVtzkywOpYj5eycTH9DyUw0HhJWkgutanNSfaO8y-HzE6KisyeuN9EesGzFga9th5csIoC0YbA8LYN5IGsVETWhpg7Yc4t6v83_4PXAaUGA)\n\nThe actual production numbers for 2021 are \\~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.\n\nEven though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.\n\nRivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford\u2019s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.\n\nThe pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders.

It\u2019s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company.

The CEO also emphasized that this was conservative, meaning they could very well advance again. \n* They announced Fayettville, Arkansas (\\*cough home of Walmart \\*cough) as the location for their corporate headquarters, a second factory, and a R&D research center.\n* Announced 3 more facilities in Oklahoma in addition to their first factory including an R&D, Software Development, and Customer Support/Finance centers. \n* By including Arkansas in their state partnership they are receiving an additional $100 million in incentives, making the total incentive package $400 million.\n* They are targeting $100 million in vehicle orders with the states and universities where their facilities will be located.\n* Selected Panasonic as their battery supplier. As you may know, Panasonic supplies batteries to Tesla. When Panasonic picks partners, they don't just pick anyone. This adds even more legitimacy to Canoo as a business. \n\nMy question: Why is Canoo worth barely over $2 Billion? They are only a couple quarters away from production in their own factories in the US and have 2 states on their side. Yet Canoo is currently worth 1/3 of Fisker, 1/40 of Lucid, 2/5 of even Nikola..... It gets almost no coverage on CNBC when EV is being discussed even though it clearly deserves to be in the mix. \n\nCanoo is criminally undervalued when compared with it's competitors and the market will likely realize this very soon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions : 450 Shares, 20 Jan 12.5c's, 30 Jan 10c's", "id": "qva3rd", "created_utc": 1637076013.0, "score": 413, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "Lol why didn\u2019t you post this yesterday", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "I probably should have\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Post after it rips.

First let's address the basic stuff and then the **well-kept secrets.**\n\n**basic**\n\nLast night ser Tony CEO/Chairman/mini-Elon dropped some updates - the key points:\n\n* manufacturing production in the US to begin before Q4 2022 (vs early 2023) \u27a1\ufe0f sooner than exp.\n* $100 million in additional non-dilutive financial incentives \u27a1\ufe0f more cash\n* targeting $100 million in vehicle orders with the states and universities \u27a1\ufe0f would be juicy when set in stone\n* cash left $414.9 million as of Sep 30, 2021\n\n**the bigger picture**\n\n* Canoo HQ is moving to **Bentonville** \\- a city most **famously connected with Walmart.** Tony: \u201cThis is an advanced manufacturing facility that will allow us to produce vehicles for unique use cases as well as accelerate our testing into gamma. We\u2019re looking for ways to take down the traditional go-to-market way and this will produce vehicles that we will sell, as well.\u201d Then during the call Canoo played a video demonstrating the progress of its gamma build, **hinting at a specific unnamed partner for which the company is producing vehicles in the US**. Canoo expects to build 120 to 150 of those vehicles, and \u201csome of them **will be** in the hands of potential **partners**\". [Read TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALpMekhyzJoLaqvSyFMsBQ7sVoiVZZaqAdFyR2OxdEvGaz6boCqNRiQL3KYZtw_JKMlNlukcf5RkXfXVPbszJtU6Gnlx7xWdBclv1jPzA-goRnQny_1X0kuYlRBY3Sz-wg39pbL1d2irsUNh587CWwtUMTDPl158Kv4pq9s0Qd86) for more details and nice global recap.\n* **The short interest is unsustainable.** Depending on which provider you get the SI numbers you will find between **25% and 35% SI** on GOEV. The days to cover based on [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) are **15.5**([meaning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)). The market cap is only **$2.3bn.** Just for context LCID is $83bn and RIVN $138bn. Among the smaller EV US players Canoo has achieved the most beta testing and Apple wanted to buy them out before they went public to use their skateboard and IP as the basis for Project Titan aka the Apple Car. Shorts are cornered but they are also very strong on this ticker and will do anything to keep the price action contained.\n* Today's price action is very indicative of the long/short story. GOEV opened at 8.50 just +0.05 from previous close. Then mini-mooned at 9.00 and 9.50 milestones. Obviously 10.00+ is the nightmare scenario for shorts going onto OpEx week. They will throw absolutely everything they have to keep it below $10.00 on Friday's expiry. On 1st attempt the stock managed to touch 10.01 then ladder down. On 2nd try 10.05 and ladder down. 10CALL 19-Nov has 18K open interest and almost 10K daily volume as I write. No other strike has a comparable activity.\n\n**quick outro**\n\nBtw not financial advice or whatever. I'm long stocks, warrants, and random calls - all ITM. I'd rather accumulate into one of the strongest IP and business plan at $2.3bn valuation and be on-board of the next moon mission rather than chase $80bn+ FOMOs near fully priced in.\n\n**Bonus watch this** [cool video](https://78449.themediaframe.com/incomm/canoo111521_v2.mp4)\n\n**Edit:** *I posted the OP when GOEV was at its 2nd try to consolidate above $10.00 (trading around $9.65). It took 5 intraday attempts to break free of all these $10.00 walls. And as I *luckily* predicted the pain started after that for the shorts with the stock running into day high at close.
