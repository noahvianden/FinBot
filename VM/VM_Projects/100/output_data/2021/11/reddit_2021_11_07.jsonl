It\u2019s currently trading in a small range trying to break the upper resistance trend line again.\n\nIf it drops below 223, you\u2019ll lose most of your investment on this as it will be a break down through the current trading range and can get as low as the 203 area, where the next support is.

We are looking at a -5% Monday, quite possibly more.\n- **Lots of key technicals will be broken & turn bearish**, causing quant funds to sell or outright short the stock.\n- **New shorts** who were itching to short \"overvalued\", \"bubbly\" TSLA but were waiting for a clear top to be defined after a monster +125% run will be jumping on board.\n- Lots of **active funds** are still underweight TSLA. They will buy in eventually, but right now they might wait for Elon's Form-4 that shows the first block of selling. These funds have an active interest in seeing a crash & squeezing retail.\n- I wouldn't be surprised if **retail TSLA margin requirements were increased by various brokerages**. Be mindful of your margin reserves and research the worst-case rate your broker might force on you.\n- But the worst effect: Elon probably won't be selling immediately. A lot of the selling will be investors trying to **front-run Elon.**\n\nThis isn't going to be fun. \ud83d\ude10\n\nAs I warned early Friday at the last ATH, TSLA might take a breather:\n\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/qn4ls5/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_november_05_2021/hje4rmw\n>\n> I'd like to warn everyone that TSLA just had a huge run to well over $1.2t valuation - a +125% run from the lows just a few months ago - on catalysts we here on TIC knew or strongly suspected in January-February already.\n>\n> It's natural for a megacap to take a breather at such a junction - Tesla isn't a meme stock - unless some major new catalyst arrives such as a stock split or a surprise upgrade to investment grade.\n>\n>\n> - In particular low & average conviction institutional investors who aren't forced to buy TSLA might stay underweight in the hope of improving alpha via a correction. Overweight ones were probably already selling into the rally.\n>\n>\n> - The \"OMG, Tesla deliveries dropped in October!!\" FUD - ignoring the 12 Tesla ships underway in Q4 already and ignoring that the same FUD was false 10 times out of the last 10 years - will have its news cycle and might draw in unsuspecting shorts, hedge funds or weak hands.\n>\n>\n> **- Elon will have to sell millions of shares for tax purposes until the end of this year: in the next 7 weeks. A Form-4 will drop when this happens, and a predictable flood of \"dilution, crash, Musk cashing out\" articles might arrive - half of them already written by the usual suspects & ready to be published.

How much of a correction we can expect the Stock to experience?

What if they announce delays in the opening of Berlin?\n\nJust imagine the backslash from that on investor sentiment?  I really think right now for the short term (maybe some weeks)... Tesla may be announcing some controversial (possibly negative) things.  I'm not saying the Twitter announcement of selling 10% of his shares is necessarily negative.

But the thing I am wrestling with in this Casino called the markets is...  What prices will we settle down to now that the brothers are exiting at all time highs?\n\nAnd if you were in my position wanting to bulk up (add shares) what would your strategy be this week?  What prices should we expect.  I personally will start buying once we dip below the high 900s and increase on the way down.  I may start with 10 shares, then another and so on from there... Trying to \"catch\" some sort of bottom or get a good deal. \n\nBut who knows how low we go in the coming days, weeks and months.

Exclusively Tesla and long term\n\nI hold 127 shares at average of $816 total.\nI have another $100k secured to invest more this week.\n\nFew vital questions.  With Dollar cost averaging strategies in mind (which can be overrated, frustrating, nerve wracking and not even necessarily work)...\n\n1) How and at what points during the day (meaning premarket, regular market or AHs) would you begin loading up on Tesla. \n\n2) Some people believe the dip selling will only last at most until Tues or Wednesday while others think we are at the brink of a 3 to 6 month correction where Tesla could dip as low as 840s or more (in other words 30% correction).  Personally I highly doubt this as I see no more than a 15 - 20% correction at most (with 10 to 15 being the more likely).  So how far do you guys think this Tesla price will drop and at what prices do you guys suggest a relatively new Tesla investor to be loading up on... In order to avoid shorter term regrets and downfall?\n\n3) My own initial plan was to wait until the stock fills the Gap at $910 (meaning I was planning to go all in with $100k at those levels).  But I don't know if you think that would be insane, and maybe I should only do 50% or 30% to dollar cost average and avoid any further missed opportunities if it were to drop. \n\nPlease bear in mind I fully understand that trying to \"guess\"  (time) the Markets is an exercise in futility.  But having some kind of a plan always makes it emotionally easier and more confidently executed than otherwise. \n\nAll ideas and suggestions are greatly appreciated. I don't want to miss potentially the last opportunity of the year to get these lowest 2021 prices before we head to a stellar new year of growth and two new Gigas cranking Tesla's like pancakes.   I'm trying to make the most of my life savings before the next bull run starts. \n\nSo Do you guys think this sell off on the Elon Tweet about selling shares will only last a couple days or it could easily run until December (Christmas rally) before we pickup again? \n\nIf you guys think this correction can last throughout much of November, then perhaps I need to enter my position very slowly in 10% increments.  But then again if you think a sweep of institutional buyers (PMs and Hedge Funds) may come in and start a rally again soon...

How much of a correction we can expect the Stock to experience? In other words, with Elon and his brother dumping shares at all time highs, is this just coincidence or is this a lead way into other short term surprising news that we will hear at the Tuesday conference call?  A lot of people think the Tuesday conference call will be nothing but positive catalysts.  But I'm not so sure?  What if they announce delays in the opening of Berlin?\n\nJust imagine the backslash from that on investor sentiment?  I really think right now for the short term (maybe some weeks)... Tesla may be announcing some controversial (possibly negative) things.  I'm not saying the Twitter announcement of selling 10% of his shares is necessarily negative. But this combined with his brother's exit seem ominously strange because I get the hunch (especially from what I hear from some Germans)... That the opening (operating) of the Berlin Giga is likely going to be delayed until January.\n\nSorry if this all sounds bearish...

But the thing I am wrestling with in this Casino called the markets is...  What prices will we settle down to now that the brothers are exiting at all time highs?\n\nAnd if you were in my position wanting to bulk up (add shares) what would your strategy be this week?  What prices should we expect.  I personally will start buying once we dip below the high 900s and increase on the way down.  I may start with 10 shares, then another and so on from there... Trying to \"catch\" some sort of bottom or get a good deal. \n\nBut who knows how low we go in the coming days, weeks and months. All I know is that when two big whales like Elon and his brother are exiting.... This doesn't smell right at all from my experience.\n\nWhat do you guys think based on your own experiences?

Then later when it dropped into the high 700s, I bought another $25k to bring my average to $816.

The big shiny triangle truck is impossible to ignore. In American culture, especially in the Midwest, it's socially acceptable to strike up conversations with strangers in some situations.

{"title": "Why Elon Musk Will Definitely Sell 10% of his stock", "selftext": "[https://medium.com/@jericho.k.roman/why-elon-musk-will-sell-10-of-his-tesla-shares-849e697ef3d6](https://medium.com/@jericho.k.roman/why-elon-musk-will-sell-10-of-his-tesla-shares-849e697ef3d6)\n\nTL;DR. Elon has 14.8 billion dollars of tax due when he exercises his options (which he has to do before August 20th, 2022), he can significantly reduce the tax bill by billions of dollars by dropping the Tesla stock price. Selling 10% of his shares covers all of his taxes and leaves him roughly a billion dollars in cash to play with.  Basically, he's using Twitter to lower his taxes.\n\nPositions: straddles.\n\nEdit: In regards to the question by u/SaladTossgaming on getting puts: I'm thinking about it as well but concerned about IV. Also, the gamma position on Nasdaq is insane, we may be in for a parabolic run. I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla goes to 2k. Would love other's opinions on this.\n\nEdit 2: not bullish or bearish on tesla price. Simply commenting on the selling.\n\nEdit 3: Slightly out of context but pertaining to a question in one of the comments.  There was $450 million of ITM call buying (January 2024 $1000 strikes) in a single day last week.  That's not only a significant dollar amount but also, similar positioning had occurred prior to the SPX inclusion and share split.  Sorry if this causes confusion about what action(s) to take but it's part of the reason why I'm neither bullish nor bearish (see Edit 2). Note - option flow isn't the clearest indicator; for example, a large holder of Tesla may have had to sell their shares due to Tesla becoming too large of a % in their portfolio (required to sell per portfolio risk management), however - since they still want to participate in the upside they may have purchased ITM options to compensate for the sale.", "id": "qorwlq", "created_utc": 1636302254.0, "score": 3900, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 678, "comments": [{"body": "One more thing.

Only a quarter of recent IPOs involved companies currently making a profit.\n\nThe reason investors tolerate this is that there are plenty of examples of companies (Amazon, Facebook) which reinvested all revenues for years in pursuit of increasing market share, and were wildly successful as a result.\n\nThere is another type of company, however. These companies basically operate as a stock scam or, in the case of private companies, attracting larger and larger funding rounds.\n\nPart of the reason companies like Theranos, WeWork and Nikola got as far as they did is because they were free from the need to demonstrate profitability.\n\nZombie companies like Uber and DoorDash are not fraudulent, and actually provide real value to consumers, but only because they are subsidized by shareholders. If their prices rose sufficiently to be profitable, many consumers would stop using their service. Some analysts are convinced that Uber's only hope of consistent profitability is self-driving cars. This technology may or may not become available in time to bail them out. Similarly, DoorDash must eventually move away from human delivery drivers to become profitable.\n\nObviously, some percentage of unprofitable companies will eventually turn a profit.

MVIS has absolutely nothing that could bridge the gap and put them forward. Micromirrors (more often referred to as MEMS mirrors)? Please, there are dozens of companies doing micromirrors and another dozens building lidars with them.

The bank valued it differently but still a high value. Then that billionaire made a lot of enemies and many people didn't like his brand anymore.
