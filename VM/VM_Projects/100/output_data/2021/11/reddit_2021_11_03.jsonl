There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec\u201920.\n\nThe summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/olsk3rzidbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c47c6be534d65f806fab70470f13713b59a34fd)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAhh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it\u2019s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.\n\nSo what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \\[2\\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.\n\nConsidering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next\n\na. One Week\n\nb. One Month\n\nc. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)\n\nThe benchmark for comparison is SPY\\[3\\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9cp7di0jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef05f68121dccb6283f09ac092aba516553baacc)\n\n**Results**\n\nBefore we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/qlsbb9/video/n6jlnnvldbx71/player\n\n *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/) \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/w1jcf78ndbx71.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d8eee4682395fc617c7e3eda74fd410fced8b9)\n\nWe would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \\[4\\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)\n\nBut, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \\[5\\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it\u2019s definitely not for safe plays).\n\nSo, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bfkgenaodbx71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14db831e6397c79913bfe18e9d4db5958b65347)\n\nWould you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.\n\nBut keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ye4hbj8pdbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=90e5171c0279ba9428d889dd46d8a0bbab33da15)\n\nGME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \\[6\\].\n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faw73z8qdbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e01686c9740202b0a86f0c7e7bbd0a9d4d193d8\n\nUnsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3tu6gfqrdbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3923e9917d26c772af234ce7c31a32882a2ca5)\n\nFor every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.\n\nBut what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n95yi6lsdbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f795b4404f8277bad99a57624f158a6a0594d7b0\n\nUnsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \\[7\\]. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/03em191jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=257e458829fb1f4b661e3b5e2a6672816359e01f)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of\n\n* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it\u2019s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.\n* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks\n* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.\n* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works \u2014 stay tuned! \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pufwh52jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd8c84adf4cc75b03e0893e50aee2072beb18b9)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBefore starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with\n\n>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!\n\nI was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***\n\nEither it\u2019s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).\n\nWhatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!\n\nIf you liked reading this one, you will love\n\n* How to [consistently make returns](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/crypto-dca) from the Crypto market!\n* [Should you follow insider transactions](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/insider-purchase) while investing?\n\nUntil next week\u2026\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rkizc03jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b96fef618966a52c54718763ea7207382feb159)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.\n\n\\[2\\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.\n\n\\[3\\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.\n\n\\[4\\] It\u2019s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.\n\n\\[5\\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).\n\n\\[6\\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it\u2019s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns is [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).\n\n\\[7\\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*", "id": "qlsbb9", "created_utc": 1635938561.0, "score": 1142, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "> Either it\u2019s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter \n\nNo, it's not either.

I'll pasted the details that I deemed most important for everyone if they haven't seen it. \n\nAs follows\n\n \nIn July 2021, the Company issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior convertible promissory notes due July 23, 2026 (\u201c2021 Convertible Notes\u201d) in a private offering. The 2021 Convertible Notes mature on July 23, 2026 and accrue interest quarterly at a rate of (i) zero percent (0%) from the date of issuance to, and including, June 30, 2022 and (ii) five percent (5%) after June 30, 2022. The 2021 Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company\u2019s equity under various circumstances, including upon an Initial Public Offering and a Change of Control of the Company (as such terms are defined in the 2021 Convertible Notes Purchase Agreement). Upon an Initial Public Offering, the 2021 Convertible Notes automatically convert into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) $71.03, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, recapitalization or any other similar transaction, and (ii) the product of (x) the Initial Public Offering price per share multiplied by (y) the applicable discount rate determined by reference to the time of conversion (0.85 until December 31, 2021).\n\nOn October 8, 2021, the Company issued $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d) to certain investors of the Company. Proceeds received net of a $25 million original issue discount may be used for general corporate purposes. The 2026 Notes mature five years from the date of issuance, or earlier at 90 days before the maturity of the 2021 Convertible Notes if they remain outstanding (refer to Note 6 \u201cDebt\u201d). The 2026 Notes bear interest at (x) LIBOR, subject to a 1.00% floor, plus (y) 6.00% per annum, subject to downward adjustment upon certain events. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid in cash semi-annually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year. The Company has the option to redeem the notes at any time at 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes, plus any applicable premium. The 2026 Notes contain a number of customary covenants similar to the covenants under the ABL Facility (refer to Note 6 \u201cDebt\u201d) and a minimum liquidity covenant. The 2026 Notes are secured by a second priority security interest in the same assets in which the ABL Facility has a first priority security interest and are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company.\n\nFrom July 2021 through October 31, 2021, the Company granted less than 1 million stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of $39.58 per share and 12 million RSUs. The stock options require a service period to vest and require a Change in Control to become exercisable. The RSUs require a service period and an Initial Public Offering (as defined in the Plan) to vest. Similar to the Company\u2019s existing options and RSUs, the performance based vesting conditions are not deemed to be probable until such events occur. The issuance of these options and RSUs has resulted in an incremental $496 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation.\n\nDuring October 2021, the Company modified the service-based vesting terms of approximately 6 million options. As the modified options contain a performance condition that is satisfied upon a Change of Control, the fair value of the options was remeasured on the date of modification which resulted in an increase in unrecognized compensation cost of approximately $265 million.\n\nIn October 2021, the Company approved the funding of Forever by Rivian, Inc. (the Company\u2019s social welfare organization) with shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, subject to the completion of its initial public offering. The approved amount is equal to 1% of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis immediately before the completion of the initial public offering. As a result of this donation, the Company will recognize a one-time, non-cash expense, the amount of which is dependent upon the ultimate price per share recognized at the time of the offering (e.g., the expense would be approximately $495 million if the initial public offering price were $59.50 per share, which is currently the midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Are you still going to buy even though they changed the price to $72?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So I already committed to 100 shares.

Just off the top of my head:\n\n* Rivian doesn't have a working assembly line to mass produce their vehicles. Just last week multiple articles came out that said they were producing only 1 vehicle a day.\n\n* If history has shown us anything, Rivian is going to go through production hell getting an assembly line working to up that number to something reasonable. Take a look back at all the complaints and criticism levied at Tesla back then, most of it is probably going to be said about Rivian in the coming months.\n\n* Rivian's order from Amazon actually puts them in a not so good position right now due to their customer concentration. Rivian wants to attract regular consumers to their brand, but Rivian has to take time away from that to focus on producing Amazon vans to keep Amazon happy. And Jeff Bezos has made clear he's not willing to wait around for those vans given how he's tweeted \"Now RJ, where are our vans?!\". If you read what's in the contract with Amazon you'll see that there's farther time pressures on Rivian to get the Amazon vans made, because Amazon has the option to buy from someone else if Rivian can't do it in a timely manner.\n\nBesides those immediate issues, I see other potential red flags with Rivian that don't sit right with me.\n\n* Rivian hyped up their tank turn a while ago, only to quietly remove it as a feature because of issues with it (issues that essentially come down to the laws of physics making a safe and controlled tank turn very difficult to pull off, especially on certain types of surfaces). Based on insider reports Rivian did very little work on this before abandoning it, making it clear the whole point of it was just to counter the Cybertruck excitement at the time. If you take a closer look at the Rivian tank turn footage you'll notice a LOT of tire treads, implying they tried it A LOT to get just the right footage where it worked correctly. Hyping up a feature as a PR stunt only to abandon it after getting the footage they want makes me wary of trusting Rivian.\n\n* In my opinion Rivian moves way too slow to be successful long term. Rivian is 12 years old, and only just brought a vehicle to the market. Maybe that would have been ok in the past, but things are moving quickly in the EV space now that most automakers are taking it seriously.

{"title": "$BGFV - A fundamentally undervalued, technically bullish GME-like dark horse primed for a huge ramp up by 11/17", "selftext": "*^(To the mods of r/)* ^(Stocks)*^(, $BGFV meets the definition to not be a penny stock as defined by)* [*^(Rule 7)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/pennystocks) *^(despite being small cap. To users reading this, do not interpret this as advice to trade, do your own individual research and due diligence as with any stock mentioned on the internet.)*\n\nIf your time is short, below are my talking points on why I believe $BGFV is about to explode upwards, explained later in this DD.\n\n1. Strong Balance Sheet\n2. Stock Buybacks\n3. Special Dividends\n4. Positive EPS\n5. Low PE ratio\n6. Undervalued at face value\n7. All fundamental metrics favorable\n8. Operational strategic advantage regarding supply chain and political conditions\n9. Potential acquisition target if market cap continues to be low\n10. Massive short interest presenting GME like technicals\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Strong balance sheet:** Their recent quarterly earning reports that their balance sheet had $114m in cash / cash equivalents on hand with zero debt. This presents a $36m improvement on cash since the start of the year despite their stellar record of stock buybacks and issuance of dividends.\n2. **Stock buybacks:** BGFV has repurchased 100,498 shares over the course of the 3rd quarter.\n3. **Special dividend on top of regular dividend:** Announcement of a $1.00 special dividend payable on 12/01/2021, to shareholders of record as of 11/17/2021; $0.25 regular dividend payable on 12/15/2021 to shareholders of record as of 12/01/2021\n4. **Positive EPS:** Diluted EPS for the 39 weeks ending in 10/03 is $3.81/share. 4th quarter guidance for the final quarter of 2021 is $0.55 - $0.70, so the forward EPS for the 2021 year is approx $4.36 - $4.51 EPS.\n5. **Low forward PE ratio:** With a stock price of $31 / share and a forward EPS guidance of $4.44 / share, forward PE ratio is approx 6.9. Compare this to the the industry average at 21.15, and SP500 at 29.36, this presents nearly a 310% discount compared to peers. (to put in perspective, for BGFV to be trading fairly among peers would price it at $93 / share. Another perspective, Walmart's PE ratio is 23.72)\n6. **Undervalued at face value**: For a company with over 430 stores spread across over 11 states (3 planned to open within the coming quarter), positive operating cash flow, and free shareholder equity of 280m; with the stock trading at 31/share, it is valued at merely $620.8M.\n7. **Valuation involving profitability, dividend, growth rates, operating effectiveness, and financial strength/ stability metrics are all favorable:** As mentioned earlier, PE ratio is low, presenting a 310% discount compared to peers. It also pays dividends, which is impressive since most companies in the sector don't even pay a dividend. The dividend is also sustainable and don't impact the company's bottom line despite being a massive 3.6% yield. BGFV's returns on asset, return on equity, revenue per employee are 15.18%, 47.94%, and $142,187 respectively, which is among the leaders of the sector. As mentioned earlier, BGFV uses little to no debt and have very little financial risk. In regards with profitability, BGFV's net profit margin is 9.02%, when the industry is -10.76%\n8. **Strategically advantageous supply chain management and operating environment**: During a time when supply chain management mattered most, BGFV's supply chain is strategically placing stores within range of their distribution centers, the west coast, with California being the state with the largest sum of stores. This focus on California another strategic advantage, especially for ammo purchases, since California requires brick and mortar stores to complete ammo sales; [at a time when new gun ownership have rocketed to unseen heights.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view) To bring another catalyst to this, BGFV has retained it's firearm and ammunition business when other big box retailers such as Walmart and Dicks Sporting goods have begin to wind down their firearms segment. Further exacerbating the catalyst is the democratic president elected (which historically always increase ammo/firearm purchases compared to republican presidents in power).\n9. **Potential target for acquisition with the appointment of Lily Chang to the board**: Lily Chang is the Chief portfolio officer of LGP which is coincidentally the same company that took BGFV public back in 2002. This is entirely speculation, but with the market cap as low as 600m, this is potentially foreboding a takeover in the near future.\n10. **And finally, despite everything said and done, the stock is the 3rd most shorted stock on US exchanges, and like GME, presents a huge opportunity for a short-squeze like event:** Short squeezes are events where certain catalysts need to be present. The stock must have high percentage of public shares shorted; the cost to borrow must be high; the shares available to short must be low; a dividend, share buyback, or other catalyst must be present; and it must have high trading volume. A couple weeks ago, not all of these were present. The stock is over 43% of float shorted as of the date of this post (8,480,000 shares), the shares avail to short is 150k (which is moderately low), cost to borrow was around 2% (which is very low), and no dividend was announced.. until now. The upcoming 11/17 ex-dividend is the catalyst we've been looking for. The last time the stock did a dividend, it drained shares avail to borrow, spiked cost to borrow, and spiked the stock price from $23 to $32 over a couple days. [That time, the % of shares sold short was less than 38%](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bgfv/comments/pq9gsi/1y_chart_cross_referencing_stock_price_shares/). It has never been as high as it has been now, and I am predicting that the price movement on or before 11/17 when the dividend is 2.8% yield will violently margin call anyone who is short BGFV. If this occurs when the stock price is trading at $35 (now), it presents a 41% upside. This only gets worst for people with bear positions as the stock trades higher.

Then you depreciate 100k/354mths = $282 less of taxes a month (-$3,389/year) for every $100k in building value.  You can work numbers to give you a tax break too but this is basically what I was referring too.\n\nFurthermore, if you have rental income this is taken directly against that.  So I might have a rental with $2100 in rent, -$1100 a month in mortgage, and -$500 in expenses, so +$600 \\* 12 = $7200 a year in gains.\n\nBut that's for like $200k of building value so I could deduct 282\\*24 = $6768 each year against its income.  This shows income of $7,200 - $6,768 = $432 a year.  Which is basically nothing.\n\nAt the same time the mortgage principle is being paid down like $400 a month, so that adds $4800 a year to my net worth (increasing over time as pay down increases).\n\nThen you have appreciation.  In a good market you can see 8% pretty regular (west coast city areas for example).  So another 16K in net worth gains a year.\n\nBest part is this is leveraged.  So return on your downpayment is 5x-10x the rate you see in here.\n\nSo yeah for the above example, Taxable income is $432 a year, but net worth grows by $28,000 a year.  And the down playment at 20% is only $40k.  Not including closing cost, miantance, and vacancies, that's 70% return on investment during that year.  140% if you only put 10% down.

You close the put or let it expire for a profit or loss: Regardless of how long you held it, it will be a short term capital gain or loss. The gain or loss is recognized on the date you close it or let it expire.\n2. If the put is ITM, and it is exercised, then you subtract the cost basis of the shares by the premium you received. E.g., if you sold TSLA 1200P for 50 dollar premium, and you are assigned because the share price fell below 1200, then your cost basis will be 1200 - 50 = 1150. The assignment is not a taxable event, only the cost basis changes.\n\nThe only way to convert a put into long term cap gain is to let it get assigned and then holding the lot of shares for more than a year.

It\u2019s unfortunate, so you\u2019d need an additional hardware to do that. But yeah, in the future, all versions of our vehicles will be able to at least do bi-directional power flow for the purposes of energy market participation.

That means every quarter your parents will receive $1000, or $4000 a year.\n\nI think dividends are much more lucrative in the long term because you\u2019re essentially earning \u201cfree shares\u201d over time. Dividend yield takes the amount of shares you own, and gives you a percentage for free. So say yield is 2% and I own 200 shares. In one year, I will be given an additional 4 shares. This can compound over time obviously as the longer I hold, the more stock I hold, the more dividend payout I receive.\n\nBut as many people here will testify to: this doesn\u2019t really matter unless you have a) a lot of time or b) a lot of money.

There's lots of companies with difficult problems to solve (how do we  make this phone $1 cheaper to build, or how do we design this engine to pass emissions standards when it gets tested) and there's companies with interesting problems to solve, but they typically don't actually let their engineers solve them. Most modern companies are strangled by layers and layers of middle management and everything either has to be designed by committee or signed off on by one \"visionary\" at the top. Anything you design and build will take years to see production and will get watered down and destroyed by cost cutting along the way.\n\nI had a friend who went to work for a \"big 3\" automaker out of college, and he designed a seat rail for a car. Which is actually interesting because it's a really important safety part, but he spent almost all his time in meetings or waiting for approvals from management or having to redesign stuff because some other group made a change that screwed something up. He said that's what it was like for all the new hirers in his department, just toiling away on something that had seemed completely pointless. He actually got a job at Tesla after 2 years and loved it even though he ended up working 60 hours weeks a lot of times because he was spending all that time doing interesting stuff. When he left for Tesla, that one part he'd spent 100% of his time working on, still hadn't made it in to a single production car.\n\nAnd it's the same story at SpaceX. Both companies are attracting lots of very talented engineers, to work on interesting and complex problems. And then when they figure out the problem, they get to see it in production immediately. Often times you'll see very junior people, even interns, get to be responsible for actually making real changes and taking charge of projects if they're the ones that have the most hands on experience with it. Or if you're working on something and a supplier is dragging their heels or overcharging or just jerking you around, then they bring it in house and do it better themselves.\n\nYou get to avoid like 95% of the soul crushing bullshit that makes most engineers hate their jobs. So Tesla and SpaceX attract talented people, who are willing to work hard and they let them work hard to solve important problems. And what's the result?

And maybe my friend was exaggerating in the stories, but it's not like traditional automakers are known for being nimble.\n\nAnd yeah, if we take just one model (the S) and we ignore the most recent redesign (when they launch the Plaid option) and we focus on just the structural aspects (since nearly everything else has gone through many obvious changes) and we limit ourselves to known changes, then we can say \"the last version of the Model S had no obvious structural changes during its life\". But that might not even be useful because it absolutely could have had important structural changes and we just don't know about it. It's not like Tesla refuses to do structural improvements and it's not like they publish every change they make in some obvious way.\n\nBut if we don't put those kind of ridiculous constraints on ourselves, then we're free to look at examples like the most recent new Model (the Y) where they've made lots of structural changes in a very short amount of time.\n\nTesla is continually making changes and updates to their cars that include structural improvements, design changes, interior change, software changes, safety improvements, electrical changes, etc.\n\nIf you're going to argue that Tesla isn't more agile and doesn't make more improvements and upgrades, I think you're going to have to have a more compelling case than \"this is what's typical in the industry\" or \"if we limit ourselves by only looking at X, Y and Z, then there haven't been any significant changes in a few years\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My point is that Tesla is not updating its cars with any more frequency than other automakers.

It was definitely still an excellent choice before the new version came out. Things like safety, software, range, seats and interior, all improved steadily and there really wasn't any competitor from the large automakers that made significant progress in either catching up to it (if they were behind) or exceeding it (if they were roughly competitive). So, by that measure Tesla's iterative approach was at least as good as a traditional method of doing a major refresh or new model every 4-7 years (and I think there'd be lots of people that argue that it was better in a lot of ways). And then Tesla came out with the new Model S and Plaid that jumped way ahead of where they were with the prior model and made significant upgrades in every category. Obviously no other automaker has had a model that's been keeping up with the Model S's iterative improvements and also matched the improvements made in the Plaid. It seems like Tesla is willing to do both kinds of redesigns - continual improvements, and then major redesigns as well.\n\nAnd again, we can see the same thing in the Model Y. It's made lots of small improvements in its relatively short life, and has also had a couple of major redesigns of structural elements within a couple years. Those are the kinds of changes other automakers make every 5+ years at best.\n\n> These might be different approaches but it leads to roughly the same amount of new engineering.\n\nIf that's the claim, then I think you should show some evidence for it? For example, if Teslas were roughly competitive with similar models when they launched, and then got better with iterative improvements, and then when other automakers launched major redesigns they were roughly competitive (or at least equally far ahead/behind). Then I think there'd be a case to be made that the pace of innovation is roughly similar.\n\nBut instead what we seem to be seeing is that Teslas are very popular at their price point when launched. And then demand has been increasing as they increase production and make iterative changes, even while they're also increasing pricing. It seems like Teslas are becoming more desirable, compared to the competition, over time.

They won't be able to put batteries in the cars.  There's plenty of other stuff there, but that's a killer right there.

I think, being the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins should make you seriously question the incentive of folks who are making the recommendations!  \n\nWhether it\u2019s for the insane YOLOs posted every day, or breaking Robinghood with infinite leverage plays, or the legendary short-squeeze involving GME, here is where the action goes down!\n\nBut what I am interested in is to see if **we can beat the** **market** **by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets!** After all,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0cedr2igbx71.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=3080567a78e82b0344ec4a65788d2b4f794159e9\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/1qtf5iajgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd15b08ff9426c655ac161995f22ea16865cc90e)\n\n**Data**\n\nReddit\u2019s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec\u201920.\n\nThe summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gpp85mcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a9916acb77466874f188e0061692d05129a058a)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAhh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it\u2019s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.\n\nSo what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \\[2\\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.\n\nConsidering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next\n\na. One Week\n\nb. One Month\n\nc. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)\n\nThe benchmark for comparison is SPY\\[3\\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pu8irxajgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=441bf1657bd1109e57189f76e35b3115af4ba627)\n\n**Results**\n\nBefore we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/qlscp1/video/t2ii3hjlgbx71/player\n\n *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/) \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/abx4tcqmgbx71.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d7aec4f26c6f7714a343ff7dd4670c679ae238)\n\nWe would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \\[4\\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)\n\nBut, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \\[5\\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it\u2019s definitely not for safe plays).\n\nSo, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/d4hwo3kngbx71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a3ef5cbe1cf152ae89981ea81c82ad035daf66)\n\nWould you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.\n\nBut keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9k19tq9ogbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e3401b02342b1880922e094911dcdf1c75d00c3)\n\nGME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \\[6\\].\n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1zt22jpgbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c2fd19ce44a58f79c92473a5cab4a1908c1d0f8\n\nUnsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/szf7uirqgbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf59305c3719d840617a4fc81fc94938313497b3)\n\nFor every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.\n\nBut what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1qn01irgbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=02933cb4b8f3039b4088c98da4923ef049099aab\n\nUnsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \\[7\\].  \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n2mtnnbjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e4f09865adc8c40f285c7eec6e24243ff2954b)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of\n\n* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it\u2019s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.\n* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks\n* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.\n* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works \u2014 stay tuned!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6kh47fcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ed5f0169321aba78fbc8f48d247e1cb98a373d)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBefore starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with\n\n>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!\n\nI was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***\n\nEither it\u2019s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).\n\nWhatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zieahxcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe14d84efb06c5c3397f588064eade2e1aa9bb7)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.\n\n\\[2\\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.\n\n\\[3\\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.\n\n\\[4\\] It\u2019s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.\n\n\\[5\\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).\n\n\\[6\\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it\u2019s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns are [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).\n\n\\[7\\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*", "id": "qlscp1", "created_utc": 1635938713.0, "score": 963, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 145, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR:\n\nYes.

Usually DeSpac warrants will trade in a certain range based on share price when compared to other DeSpacs, and you kind of use that as a guide but .... If it's seen as meme or WSB DeSpac like Clover was the warrant gains can end up far outpacing the shares.  It's because warrant owners are always looking to the future like option players.  So if MILE moves up organically without memeing the warrants will move up with it of course.  But if MILE ends up a legit meme stock then warrants will get way over priced in relation to the share price just based off of momentum and anticipation.  Right now it's very possible that if share price dP    oubles or triples you may make the same amount with shares or even a little more or less.  But if share price gets to 10 and 11 and people think it still has room to run, the warrants will almost definitely promise exponential gains in contrast to the shares themselves.

{"title": "80k Fastly ($FSLY) earnings bet (bear spread)", "selftext": " Now that Fastly is skyrocketing following Akamai's earnings, it seemed like a good time for me to enter with a bearish play. Be careful: this is not a full DD, expectations for Fastly are quite low and it has been beaten down a lot already, so going bearish can be very risky. Doubly so if you simply buy puts, which have very high IV for Fastly. I'm only using house money on this play. Enter at your own risk and limit your exposure.\n\n**Reasons for play**\n\n1. Trends in their employee base I [posted about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjw4pq/fastly_fsly_seems_to_be_losing_lots_of_employees/)\n2. Almost all of their large customers seem to be losing significant traffic in Q3 compared to last quarter: Kickstarter, Guardian, Yelp, Github, WikiHow, Wayfair, Lonely Planet, Imgur. Amazon and Shopify also reported tepid earnings. However, some like Ticketmaster or Foursquare are doing well. As Fastly works with a usage-based business model, this could immediately affect their numbers\n3. Following on point 2, all covid stock have been getting clobbered this week in earnings, while plays on \"real life\" like Lyft, Marriott, AMC are doing quite well.\n\nGood luck to anyone playing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr7to8t0iex71.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=d32115fb4b618bc93382be307bec1211e752ace4", "id": "qlx7tx", "created_utc": 1635954171.0, "score": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 212, "comments": [{"body": "Shoutout to the other guy who posted about the Pager app in the Zillow thread", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Glad it can help!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Im hoping i set it up correctly lol", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11082866042852402}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18526172637939453}, {"body": "just got this.

I've looked at recent comps, I see what they pay for houses and what they sold for.  They are clubbing people left and right, this earnings beat is going to be massive. Only concern is current inventory, they have way too much still sitting on the market for 150+ days, which is literally impossible in this market. They price homes 100k over market value and then it just sits, also their marketing is very low effort \"3 bed house with 1 car garage\".  I asked for a quote on my home from open door, it was 75k less than I know I could list it for tomorrow with multiple offers. I feel bad for anyone dumb enough to sell their house to open door, and I think the public will eventually realize it's a bad deal to sell to an ibuyer since they would net substantially more with a broker.

Also, a lot of brokers, myself included will only charge a seller 1.0+2.8=3.8% if they are wanting to buy another house in the same market, so it really could be cheaper to work with a broker.  \n\nHowever it is a huge hassle to sell your house, getting it show ready, people come through non stop without notice, also sometimes deals fall through. They also make great money on the repairs they charge the home owner for, this might actually be the big money maker for them, like it is for property management companies. There is value in what OPEN does, quick guaranteed close, so people will still want it, but it won't ever take more than a 4-5% market share.  A person's home is typically their largest investment and to think the majority of home owners would leave an extra 10-15% on the table isn't realistic.  Also, I'm starting to do marketing next month where I guarantee I'll sell your house for 5k more than your opendoor offer or I'll pay you 5k.  Other brokers probably will too, but this won't hurt OPEN numbers anytime soon, but might long term.\n\nFor OPEN to succeed they need their customers to fail.
