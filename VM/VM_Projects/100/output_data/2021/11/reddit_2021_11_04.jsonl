It is WAY easier to produce electric vehicles than ICE. Everything from supply chain, assembly, and maintenance is DRASTICALLY simplified. There is nothing in EV production that a major legacy automaker cannot pivot to, especially as it will be a gradual changeover rather than an instant transition. \n\n> extremely expensive transition that will bankrupt most of them.\n\nWild claim. Lots of big automakers are already producing full EV's. The self-driving and driver aide tech is already being developed on ICE vehicles. Cadillac's, for instance, is very good, and will continue to improve and proliferate about the GM product range. TSLA has overextended itself with \"FSD\" and is putting themselves at risk of great scrutiny and government interference. It's good tech, for sure, but not nearly as far ahead of the major automakers as they would have you believe.\n\n> the only way to compete with vertical integration is to vertically integrate\n\nMaybe early on. That certainly does not hold true in a mature market. There will be plenty of vendors for EV components. You think Bosch and friends aren't going to get in on making motors for OEM's? There are multiple companies working on battery tech right now. Body paneling, hardware and software, transmissions (yes lots of EV's will have transmissions), interior materials, displays, suspension components, all that stuff exists as widely used vendor or subcontractor products in the ICE world and will follow on in the EV process.\n\nVAG, Ford, GM, BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai/Kia, Stellantis, Honda, Toyota/Lexus, Mazda, are all producing EV's right now. Not hybrids, EV's.\n\nYou are confusing the significance of being first to market with being the only one that can master the process.\n\nTSLA has a great head start, and a lot of their value is in IP, other revenue streams, early capture, and brand value. I have no idea if the stock is overvalued, it seems laughably inflated to me and I'm actually very high on the company. But the big automakers woke up a couple years ago and are bringing their century of experience and manufacturing capacity to bear. Will some fail? Probably. Not many though. We're talking about companies that retooled and completely upset their entire process in the span of a year or two around the beginning of WWII. This is a different time with different incentives, but what's required comes nowhere close to that kind of timescale, ambition, or difficulty.

S, X and Cybertruck will contribute heavily by 2023 with better margins than 3&Y\n\n4) Tesla has two vehicle factories today. Global logistics is chaotic right now, and they pay EU import tariff. Simply building more factories around different regions will raise gross margin by at least $1k per car simply from shipping and tariff cost savings.\n\n5) Tesla has yet to implement at scale 4680 production, LFP batteries, front and rear castings, and a host of other major cost saving improvements.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "1.

Other automakers are not employing a thousand data labelers for autonomy. They're not developing a custom supercomputer. They're not developing their own distributed electric utility infrastructure, battery cell production lines, mining processes, etc etc\n\n2) Right, none of which are growing 50-100% per year except Tesla. So R&D as a proportion of Tesla's cost structure will shrink greatly when production is 10x today's rate. Therefore assuming that the delta between the Tesla reported margin and the adjusted one will remain constant is unreasonable.\n\n3) VW has publicly stated they are far behind Tesla and hoping to maybe catch up. But their actual plan is for 240 GWh of battery supply by 2030. (https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/volkswagen-will-bring-240-gigawatt-hours-of-battery-production-capacity-to-europe-by-2030/) Tesla will surpass this by 2023, or 2024 at the latest.\n\n4) Exactly, so a company like VW does not have to ship cars as far, on average, as Tesla does. You missed the point. This is a relative disadvantage dragging down Tesla's margin currently that will improve substantially with more factories opening in more locations.\n\n5) First of all, no one and I mean no one has an answer for the 4680. $60/kWh at the pack level, better performance on every metrics, scalable mass production starting in 2022.

Let's assume Tesla has or will have double the profit margins of any other car manufacturer because of their incredible innovations that no one else is doing or will ever do. Fuck it, let's go triple the profit margin for good measure! (Higher than Apple's)\n\nSo instead of 10M cars they would need to sell 3.3M cars a year in order to match the VW Group. Great, now they matched VWs market cap of 140B. However, Tesla's market cap is 1.2 TRILLION. Meaning, they would need to sell 28 MILLION CARS A YEAR with 3x higher margin than the industry standard to match their current stock price. \n\nDo you get how that seems very improbable even if everything goes perfectly?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Your analysis neglects several key factors.\n\n1) VAG's sales are declining. So their P/E ratio at 10 million cars per year is lower than Tesla's would be where they hit 10 million and are still growing. Tesla's valuation should be derived solely from the net present value of expected cashflows, not from arbitrary comparison with another company with a very different outlook.\n\n\n2) VAG is not a significant player in the global energy market. Tesla bulls who are driving the TSLA price up are accounting for enormous future energy profits that eventually surpass automotive profits by the mid 2030s. For what it's worth, my model projects Tesla Energy to hit $100 billion annual gross profit by 2033 off of 1.5 TWh of annual battery installations at about $60/kWh total gross profit including software revenue and some decent profit from Solar Roofs. Feel free to disagree with that projection but if you're willing to accept the premise then it matters a lot to today's valuation.\n\n\n3) Tesla has vastly greater operating efficiency. They have a flat, lean corporate structure. They literally don't even use PowerPoint or really have much of any regularly occurring meetings, for example. So much typical corporate management bullshit does not happen at Tesla. Volkswagen's CEO has explicitly admitted this and recently held a crisis conference with the top 200 VAG executives *in which he invited Elon Musk to speak for a full hour* to give them advice on how to suck less. So, at scale of 10 million vehicles per year I'm conservatively projecting Opex of $15 billion for Tesla (using their version of accounting where R&D is all in Opex). VAG's annual SG&A alone was about $24 billion back when they actually produced 10 million cars.\n\n\n4) Tesla bulls believe FSD is likely to work some day for widespread Level 4/5 autonomy and that no one else has a scalable approach. If this works then profits get ridiculous. A million-mile robotaxi would have a net present value of at least $100k. So at 10 million per year production that's $1T annual value add. Even assigning a 1% probability to this scenario with a 20 P/E on those earnings has a present value in the ballpark of 0.01*$1T*20 = $200B. Again if you don't like those parameters you can set your own but this is what bulls are looking at.\n\n\n5) VAG has nearly $200 billion in debt. Much of this is debt from ICE factories or financing debt collateralized by the expected resale value of their ICE fleet. Tesla has less than $10 billion in debt, their debt is rapidly being paid off, and their vehicle resale values are holding better than anyone else in the industry, with no existential threat from a faster than anticipated shift after from ICE.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You might be right if you look at Tesla as something more than a car company.

There's A LOT of assumption going on in your post. I'm looking at it as a car manufacturing company and on that basis alone it isn't worth anywhere near a trillion dollars. \n\nAlso VAG sales are not declining, they are increasing along with record profits and the ID3/ID4 is outselling the Model 3 in Germany by quite a margin.\n\nVolkswagen's CEO's admission that they could run much leaner and more efficient is a very positive thing, meaning the advantages that Tesla has in their corporate structure are not permanent and the competition isn't static.

China's car companies are whole different topic in itself.

A few years back full self driving cars were all the rage but now everyone including Tesla suddenly got very quiet because they realized having a functioning car without a steering wheel is much more difficult than they thought.  \n\nThe simple reason why Tesla will never seriously compete with the likes of Toyota, Mercedes, and VW is that for every Tesla fanboy I can find at least 2 people who absolutely despise that company.

I know various traditional auto manufacturer's have made monetary commitments, and even launched a few models, but outside Chinese manufacturers, none of them have scaled up. None of the have battery factories in place and producing. They're buying batteries off the shelf and competing with one another. Imagine if Toyota, Volkswagen, and GM were all buying off the shelf crate engines from a few producers that couldn't possibly meet their demand. This is what's happening with EV batteries. On top of that most haven't retooled enough factories to mass produce cars. So they're buying off the shelf batteries which will kill their margins. They haven't scaled up manufacturing, which will again kill their margins until they do. You don't think their bean counters are giving these numbers to the executives, and they're all confused about how to transition? They need to go through a multiyear retooling while building battery factories, and that's just to have a semi competitive product. In the meantime their expenditures balloon, they can't produce the usual volume of ICE cars, sales tank because demand for ICE cars is waning, most of them have massive debts their already maintaining, and all this to produce EVs which don't match up to Teslas now. On top of this there's the Osborne effect, where consumers are waiting to buy EVs, so that'll eat even more into sales. In countries with a dealership model, they already ignore or hate EVs because they're going to kill their service revenue.

They're not just pumping out the same product, they're improving it regularly. They're not just using the same factory technology, they keep improving on costs and speed. They're even improving on their battery tech, and the production tech for the battery factories. It's layer upon layer of improvements and growth. Volkswagen just admitted that it takes them 3 x the time to manufacture an ID4 vs a model 3.  And that's with Tesla's current manufacturing tech. What's going to happen in their next factory? The only real competition for Tesla is in China. That's it. Everyone else has a monumental task of retooling, finding batteries, and living through 5 plus years of hell while they transition.

To understand why Tesla has a $1.2 Trillion market cap, you need to understand how Tesla is positioning themselves as a company. In much the same way that McDonald's is a real estate company, or Starbucks is arguably a bank, Tesla is much more than just a car company. Yes Tesla produces cars and is working to position themselves as the GM of the 21st century. [By 2028 the electric car market is expected to be worth around $1.3 Trillion](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/06/2291730/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-Market-Size-Is-Anticipated-to-Grow-USD-1-318-22-Billion-in-2028-at-a-CAGR-of-24-3.html). So a good portion of their value comes from the fact that they are one of the few electric vehicle manufacturers who have proven production capability and scalability. Tesla is also a utility. Tesla is already [building supercharging stations nationwide](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-open-its-chargers-to-other-electric-vehicles.html). They are positioning themselves to be the largest utility charging station for EVs in the Western Hemisphere with the capability to charge all electric vehicles, not just their own. This presents multiple profit opportunities itself. Not only do they make money selling electricity, but they will also serve as a hospitality and retail company for consumers who have to wait around 15+ minutes while their vehicles charge. Tesla is also working to [decentralize electric utility grids](https://insideevs.com/features/537228/tesla-threaten-worlds-top-utilities/) through their developments in solar and battery tech. This allows both residential and commercial consumers the ability to generate, store, and sell their own electrical energy reserves. Outside of the US they are partnering with big energy players such as Australia's Neoen and Germany's Octopus Energy to enter the public utility market. Inside the US Tesla is undergoing the process to be [licensed as a public utility company](https://chargedevs.com/newswire/tesla-could-become-a-major-power-retailer-in-texas/). \n\n\n   \n\n\n\nDid you know that [Tesla is becoming an insurance company](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/tesla-insurance/)? Or how about that Tesla is also operating as a bank [that does consumer lending](https://www.tesla.com/support/lending) as well as [investing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/tesla-holds-fast-to-its-pioneering-investment-in-bitcoin). Tesla is also a software company. Think about how valuable the ridesharing market is. Tesla is one of the company's at the forefront of developing the autonomous driving software necessary to make ridesharing truly profitable long term. They are developing software for each arm of everything they dabble in. For example they are developing the smart software for electric utilities that will automatically buy and sell electricity around the grid in the most efficient manner possible in real time. They are building one the largest IOT networks in the world all connected through proprietary software. Under the Musk's larger umbrella of companies, this will conveniently pair well with Space X's internet service. Tesla is also a major subscription service company. Everything associated with their name has the potential to be thrown under some kind of subscription plan. You want faster tier charging at their stations? Just upgrade your plan. Want access to Wifi / entertainment while you wait at a charging station? Sure just upgrade to this membership plan. You want to utilize the new stage 4 / stage 5 autonomous driving capabilities? Just buy this subscription plan. Want priority transportation when using their ridesharing service? Sure thing, just upgrade your membership first. As if that's not enough, Tesla like any other technology company is surely collecting every bit of data they possibly can from anyone and everything that in any way interacts with their IOT network. That data is another product that can be packaged and sold. So I'm not going to argue that they are worth $1.2 Trillion. However I will say that when you take into account the financial reserves they have, the economic shifts predicted for the near future, and the way in which Tesla is setting themselves up to be the first large player to take advantage of this changes, then that valuation is probably not too far off from where it should be.

Who takes the biggest cut of any product chain? Retail. \n\n\nThe other carmakers are producers and wholesalers. Products are subsidized at both wholesale and retail transaction points then the independent retail network  gets the vehicle transaction gross profit, any wholesale incentives, oftentimes pocketing the retail incentive as well through the \u201cbargaining\u201d process, and they take finance & insurance income. Following this, dealers earn on retail and wholesale parts distribution in their areas and on after sales service in their shops. \n\n\nALL of that income belongs to Tesla, and that is just the pure automotive division. \n\n\nMost automotive retail is still privately held, so industry volumes are understated. [NADA](https://www.nada.org/nadadata/), the National Automotive Dealers Association, reports that in 2020 total dealership sales dipped back below $1T USD after three years above the trillion mark. They employ $1.1 million people and nearly all have independent contracts for advertising, computer systems and many other expenses, without economy of scale to bargain with. The average dealership nets 3.6% of sales before income tax. Imagine what they could do with fixed retail pricing, national buying power and without the concern of competing against other dealers of the same brand\u2026\n\n\nSo Tesla has insourced retail and at 1% of volume that portion of the business is worth ~$360M net per year conservatively - not considering the better margins and lack of inside competition. \n\n\nFurther icing on the cake is that Tesla has also insourced design and manufacturing of most components, compared with anywhere from 30-100% being outsourced by other brands. (Yes, some vehicles are built 100% by a company other than the brand whose badge they bear - and not just the internal badge engineering we see from the big three) The fact that Panasonic builds Tesla batteries in dedicated plants in the US is notable, but still small potatoes compared to nearly every other brand. \n\n\nTraditional carmakers are really no comparison for this company, or any other new manufacturers that take on the insourcing model. Especially as some have begin to open-source some of the IP, the key benefits of sub-manufacturing diminish. Meanwhile, the outgoing heavy-hitters are locked in a death-struggle between unions, suppliers and dealers all refusing to give up their piece, which results in much slower progress and innovation in almost every facet of the business.\n\nThese are just a few of the reasons speculation is more justified than first meets the eye. A trillion? Maybe not, but Tesla has just crossed over the break even point in 2019 and is ready to pass Ford in net income with a mere fraction of the volume.

He can't get the chip shortage under control - and would rather show himself with Elon Musk than with his own employees.\n\nThe setting is perfect for the big showdown. Hall 11 of the Wolfsburg main plant is reminiscent of a cathedral with its high ceiling and concrete pillars. In normal times there is room for around 20,000 employees, on Thursday there are only a few thousand due to corona. A total of 50,000 people followed the spectacle via live stream.\n\nYou could lean back and relax like in the cinema and watch the continuation of the entertaining exchange of blows at Netflix level that VW boss Herbert Diess and works council boss Daniela Cavallo have been offering you for weeks . If only the situation wasn't so serious.\n\nCorona pandemic and computer chip shortages have plummeted auto production to its lowest level since the late 1950s. Employee leader Cavallo complains about more than 50 closing days and dozens of canceled shifts. Instead of the originally targeted one million vehicles, Volkswagen will probably produce a maximum of 400,000 cars in its world's largest factory this year. The competition is already mocking that Wolfsburg is running dry.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "##An expulsion of Diess is no longer excluded\n\nFirst of all, Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) takes the floor. The country, which holds 20 percent of the VW group, is firmly on the side of the employees. According to the participants, there will be no shaking at the Wolfsburg site, says the father of the country. Weil's clear message is also a slap for corporate boss Diess. A few weeks ago he let it be known internally that up to 30,000 jobs were at risk at VW.\n\nA conflict between corporate management, the country and employees has been smoldering for weeks. In the meantime, a mediation committee of the supervisory board has been brought in to find a compromise. A kicking out of the CEO, who has already been debated several times, appears unlikely. But it is no longer excluded.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "How tense the mood is is shown by the reaction of the employees when Cavallo, head of the works council, comes to the microphone. Many of them jump up and are reported to applaud about a minute before she even says the first word. Your subsequent speech then turns into a general settlement with VW boss Diess. \"As you have appeared publicly in recent months, I really wonder whether you yourself are actually aware of this situation here at our location and how it is received by the workforce,\" says Cavallo according to the speech manuscript sent in advance. Her colleagues, says Cavallo, are \"afraid for their work, for their families, for their existence.\" This, on the other hand, \"keeps sprinkling salt into the wound, and that without need.\"\n\nA lot is at stake for the head of the works council. It is her first open test of strength with the corporate management since she took over the position in April from her powerful predecessor Bernd Osterloh. For Cavallo, it's about the future of the Wolfsburg parent plant, but also about one's own position: Works council elections are due next year. She cannot afford to give in to the bustling corporate boss.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "But Diess is also under great pressure. His contract was extended early in July until autumn 2025. He is receiving industry-wide recognition for his electric offensive. But the acute shortage of computer chips, which is now hampering production, caught his team off guard. Rivals like BMW or Tesla are getting through the crisis much better.\n\nThe shortage of semiconductors, says Cavallo, is \"an indictment of a global corporation, and it is your responsibility, dear corporate executives.\" Without the acute shortage of parts, according to the head of the works council, VW could actually \"produce for months\", enough orders would be available. \"So the truth is: it is not the plant or the employees that are inefficient,\" says Cavallo, \"we simply lack the parts with which we can build the cars.\" Diess' numbers games about a possible downsizing are \"completely absurd\". There is not one person on board too much in Wolfsburg, \"you cannot negotiate one position with us\".\n\nIn addition to operational problems, she also accuses Diess of deficiencies in dealing with the workforce. He does not miss an opportunity to show himself to one of the biggest VW competitions - Tesla boss Elon Musk . \"The fascination that you apparently feel towards Mr. Musk and the enthusiasm that you put into maintaining contact with him, that is what we employees would like to see for our current major challenges in the Group.\"", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "##Diess promises \"Vision 2030\" for Wolfsburg\n\nThe audience eagerly awaited the reaction of the VW boss.

These are unusual words for the otherwise provocative corporate leader. The reactions of the audience are correspondingly cautious, apart from a few boos, according to the participants, there is hardly any protest. When Diess declared that he had canceled his originally planned trip to the USA in order to attend the company meeting, he even received applause.\n\nThe VW boss also points out problems in the group. \u201cThe lack of chips will be with us next year, too,\u201d he says, \u201cthe supply will be better, but we won't be able to build every car.\u201d On Tuesday, the group's board of directors decided to want to achieve the best possible utilization of the plants.\n\n**At the same time, he justifies his constant focus on Tesla. The Californian rival will only need ten hours per car in its new large factory in Gr\u00fcnheide, while Volkswagen's Zwickau e-car location currently needs 30 hours for production. \"You can only win if you understand the competition and keep an eye on it,\" says Diess. \"Tesla is the benchmark today, and other strong start-ups from China are also pushing into the market.\" Volkswagen should not let its location, its corporate headquarters, \"be destroyed by Tesla in Gr\u00fcnheide.\"**", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for the translation Germbro", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21909594535827637}], "tickers": ["tsla", "ups"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43754133582115173}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5855032205581665}], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|ffoUuIn1qRz7G)", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20873409509658813}, {"body": "So local goverment/state is a 20% owner and is on the side of the workers.

He had grown up in the male-dominated culture of South Africa, and the will to compete and dominate that made him so successful in business did not magically shut off when he came home. This, and the vast economic imbalance between us, meant that in the months following our wedding, a certain dynamic began to take hold.

{"title": "How much does Tesla need to earn in order to justify its current valuation?", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/gallery/keCnGJU\n\nTL;DR: Tesla should probably be earning about 33x-100x as much as their most recent year-to-date earnings in order to justify the current valuation.\n\n\nI've been hearing about how overvalued Tesla is for over a year now, and I'm getting tired of it. So I decided to look into the financial data myself, and determine just how reasonable or ridiculous Tesla's current valuation is. \n\nTo get a baseline for what an auto manufacturer's legitmate value should be, I decided to look at historical data for the 5 largest automotive companies today. I chose to examine data from 2010-2015, as that is the most recent time period in which the overall market was within one standard deviation above or below \"fair value\" on the Buffett Indicator. I then recorded each company's Market Capitalization and Earnings at the end of each year. \n\nI'm an idiot, so I decided I'd divide Earnings by Market Cap to find a ratio to determine what Tesla's earnings *should* be given their current valuation. I came to realize later that this is essentially the P/E ratio, but inversed. If any fellow smoothies didn't know (like me), P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current share price of a stock by its EPS (earnings per share), however you can also calculate it by dividing the company's total Market cap by their total earnings, which I did the inverse of. Anyways, the math still functions the same for my intended purpose. \n\nI calculated that the largest auto manufacturers earned an average of 8%-28% of their valuations back when the market was most fairly valued, according to the Buffett Indicator. So, in order for Tesla to be fairly valued at $1.2 Trillion, they should be earning about $107 Billion to $343 Billion each year. In the past 5 years, Tesla earned an average of -0.83% of their market cap with their most recent earnings around $3 Billion.\n\nFor reference, the highest recorded earnings of any company in history was $114 Billion by the oil company Saudi Aramco in 2018. As another reference, Apple's highest ever yearly earnings was $61 Billion, also in 2018.  \n\nIf Tesla was a literal money printer that costs $1,200 and prints $3/year, it'd take 400 years to be profitable. Even if it ramps up the printing, it would still take ages. But hey, putting a car in space was kinda cool.\n\nSource: https://companiesmarketcap.com", "id": "qmjfa8", "created_utc": 1636028775.0, "score": 656, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 510, "comments": [{"body": "Imagine trading on fundamentals in 2021.", "score": 1002, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly stocks today are not based on fundamentals they are a popularity and liquidity contest.", "score": 289, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 208, "replies": [{"body": "That's why Amazon is 3k vs 20 cents in 90s", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao dude amazon is the world\u2019s federal reserve", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "> was supposed to be based on eyeballs, not that old, stodgy, boring thing called \"revenue.\" \n\nfunnily enough we're there now with targeted advertising, clicks per view, user retention, video view length time etc... i guess the dotcom bubble was just ahead of its time", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "It is valuable, as long as you can use that popularity to get people to give you money.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0890050157904625}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02904427796602249}], "tickers": ["bubble"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Any idea what triggered the bomb to go off?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Japan announced it was in recession, triggering a global sell off of stocks in unprofitable companies as the rest of the world went looking for mattresses to put their money in.

{"title": "Pinterest ($PINS) 40k earnings put YOLO", "selftext": "Believe it or not I still have some money left to lose, so let\u2019s go. This one is straightforward. Pinterest reports earnings today. The stock has already been beaten down a lot after last earnings and the failed PayPal acquisition rumor. However, I think their data looks really weak and there\u2019s some space for a further drop. It\u2019s a dangerous play however, since Pinterest already dropped something like 25% during their last earnings call. Proceed with caution.\n\nAnalysts will be watching Pinterest\u2019s user number very closely. If they don\u2019t manage to reverse the MAU drop they experienced during the last earnings call, things could still get uglier.\n\n**Weak website hits**\n\nIn every single one of the countries it\u2019s active in, Pinterest has suffered a drop in website views since April. The biggest drops came from European countries, but US suffered as well. In October, views were basically steady from September, and the biggest drops came during the month of June, with Q3 being slightly more stable m-o-m.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n53wgzh6llx71.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=7168ee3ae26d0a6b80057c05cfa980a3c0e0a8bb\n\n**Weak app downloads**\n\nApp downloads also have decreased a lot, with steady decreases across 2021, and also a pretty sudden recent drop. The pattern kind of reminds me of Wish, which had a similar sudden drop in app downloads, right before they announced during earnings that they were halting marketing aimed at new customers. Not saying Pinterest will suffer a similar fate, but it\u2019s notable how its rankings are at an extremely low level compared even to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fdr3547llx71.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=584ae048cd6709b3eed454ebabf3c7981798d564\n\n**Positions**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4nuktko0mlx71.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=fda9d84994d60bd2cf83a9de54334fb2a957f741\n\nAgain, it's a risky play since expectations will be very muted for Pinterest.

Do this with solid companies and look at their performance, price targets, etc. AMDs price target has, mostly, been pushed some where between $130-150. So I bought $130 calls when the price was around $125 (they\u2019ve crushed earnings all year and had big runs the last two ERs). I\u2019ve been in and out of calls with this stock for the past year+. There\u2019s a macro play with merger coming. This is not about gambling. It\u2019s knowing the stock, fundamentals, and preparing accordingly. Fully expect this to run more post-merger with Xilinx. Then will take it from there.
