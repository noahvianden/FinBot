Do you agree with that statement?\n\nI ask because I've got $50k at the moment and was going to do sell puts/covered calls on a few stocks (AMD, Nvidia, Micron, Microsoft, etc.), so one line of thinking was:  Instead of doing that on one or two stocks, why not do PMCC on all of them?\n\nOr is that getting way too advanced way too quickly?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I do it on multiple stocks with many multiples of 10k so I don\u2019t think the amount has anything to do with it once you\u2019ve had some experience. \n\nFor me I think what\u2019s most important is to buy the leaps at around .7-.8 delta (deep itm) \n\nI buy these leaps in stocks Ive researched and believe will go up a lot over the next year or two. \n\nThen for extra income I short a call on the stock only after it\u2019s already had a major run up. Doing this after a run up is important so I don\u2019t get caught with the price going above the call strike when it does run up. I also make sure to leave A LOT of room for a run up. \n\nThe difference you have to be careful of between a PMCC and a regular covered call, (and the reason you have to give more room between the current price and your short call strike) is that if you just owned 100 shares of the underlying stock, and the price went above your short call strike, you could let it exercise, or close both. \nBUT with a PMCC, you ideally don\u2019t want to close the LEAP or have it reach your call strike as you\u2019ll lose money on the leap spread and leaps tend to have large spreads. \n\nMy advise would be not to rush the strategy, and this goes for any new strategy, try with one stock first, see how your short calls perform for a couple of months, (when the stock is up/down) then slowly add others\n\nMain thing most people learn the hard way is not to be too greedy with the short call premium. Leave enough space between the current price and the short calls for the LEAP to rise even if you get a lower premium, especially with stocks that move with high volatility and so pay good premium \n\nAlso make a sheet comparing what happens with your first try buying the leap and selling calls with what would have happened if you bought 100 shares of the underlying and sold covered calls. This will show you the risk/reward difference of both and help you see more. \n\nGoodluck!\n\nOne more thing: another risk with this, same as a normal covered call, is if the stock tanks by a lot, you might not be able to get a good premium selling the calls at a strike above the price where you could close the leap at a profit.

You WANT the option premium value to go down. You've already sold it and collected your $100. At some point you want to buy it back to close the position so having the premium decay (from theta and hopefully from the underlying share price staying below your strike)  is where you make the profit when you buy it back for less than you sold it for. The difference between the 2 is your profit. If the underlying price never goes above $14 at expiration then yes, the $100 is now $0 and you get to keep all $100 you initially collected. \n\nMost people do not let sold calls expire just as a risk management strategy. You never know if a company will release news that makes the share price sky rocket in a matter of minutes right before close on the date of expiration. Then you have to sell your shares or sell short if you dont have any or however your broker deals with that. Either way you're fucked. So even if, on the expiry day the share price is only $9 and you're *sure it's not going to $14, don't let it expire. Just buy it back for that $1 or 25 cents or whatever it is to secure your profits and close out the position. \n\nIf the price of the underlying drops and you have a decent profit with a long time til expiration that could also be a good time to buy to close and take what profit you have right then because there is a chance the share price could move back up before expiration and you'll lose some or all of those profits if it does. Of course you can continue to wait it out and hope that it stays below your strike for the rest of your contract but you run the risk of not only losing all your premium but getting caught if it exceeds your strike. \n\nExample: I sold a covered  $38 call with 30 dte on Lucid for $600 when it shot up to the 50s. Sure enough in a week it had dropped down the the 30s. My short call was now worth $200. Instead of closing it for $400 profit I held it thinking I still had $200 profit on the table and I wanted to wait it out to collect all my money. Well, the price started climbing fast and with a week still left I was DOWN $200. Luckily before expiration it settled down and I bought to close the second it was at break even. I made like $2 I think. And I was lucky to do that. By the actual expiration date the share price was back in the 40s and I would have had to sell my shares for $10 below market value if I had stayed in the short position.\n\nDo I wish I had just btc for my $400 profit and not gambled thinking I still had 3 weeks left to make it a 100% gain?

The NH-NL indicator generally reaches its extreme lows slightly before a major market bottom. As the market then turns up from the major bottom, the indicator jumps up rapidly. During this period, many new stocks are making new highs because it's easy to make a new high when prices have been depressed for a long time. The NH-NL indicator oscillates around zero. If the indicator is positive, the bulls are in control. If it is negative, the bears are in control. As the cycle matures, a divergence often occurs as fewer and fewer stocks are making new highs (the indicator falls), yet the market indices continue to reach new highs. This is a classic bearish divergence that indicates that the current upward trend is weak and may reverse.\"\n\nAs for recommendations: completely clobbered RSKD is worth a look.

Tesla wasn\u2019t included.\u00a0The snub\u00a0was noticeable, but I get it \u2014 Biden is a big union ally; organized labor is absent from Tesla\u2019s U.S. factories;\u00a0Michigan is a critical swing state that Biden won in 2020 and will need to win again if he seeks reelection. \n\nLast week, Biden visited GM\u2019s \u201cFactory Zero\u201d in Detroit along with Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, United Auto Workers\u00a0leadership, members of the Michigan congressional delegation and GM Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Mary Barra. Biden\u00a0took a spin\u00a0in a prototype of the all-electric Hummer and talked again about being a \u201ccar guy.\u201d \n\nThen the rhetoric went off the rails. \n\n\u201cIn the auto industry, Detroit\u2019s leading the world in electric vehicles,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMary, I can remember talking to you way back in January about the need for America to lead in electric vehicles. I can remember your dramatic announcement that by 2035, GM would be 100% electric. You changed the whole story, Mary. You electrified the entire automobile industry. I\u2019m serious. You led, and it matters.\u201d \n\nIn reality, the only fully electric models GM has had on the U.S. market lately\u00a0are the Chevy Bolt hatchback and utility vehicles,\u00a0both of which have been\u00a0recalled due to battery fire risk. The company has halted production of those models while it works\u00a0on\u00a0replacing defective batteries\u00a0in cars already sold, and last week\u00a0confirmed\u00a0it would\u00a0keep the plant that makes these models idle\u00a0for the rest of the year. \n\nTesla has four EVs on the market, one of which it started delivering to customers almost a decade ago.\u00a0Through August, Tesla\u2019s Model Y SUV was the best-selling electric model, with 104,555 registered in the U.S., according to\u00a0IHS Markit.\u00a0The Model 3 sedan was second, with 79,620. The Bolt was a very distant third at 24,997. \n\nGM had a rightful claim to EV leadership in the late 1990s, but squandered this when it pulled the plug on its pioneering\u00a0EV1 model.\u00a0Tesla was founded in 2003 and set out to prove there was consumer interest in fully electric vehicles. In January 2010 \u2014 when Barack Obama was president and Biden was vice president \u2014 the Energy Department issued a $465 million loan to Tesla as the company was working on the Model S. Tesla\u00a0paid back the loan early, and in full, in 2013. \n\nAlong the way, auto dealership associations and GM\u00a0fought Tesla\u2019s efforts to sell cars directly to consumers\u00a0in several states. There\u2019s a long, acrimonious history between the two companies, and anyone who watched the documentary films \u201cWho Killed the Electric Car?\u201d and the sequel \u201cRevenge\u00a0of the Electric Car\u201d will understand why. \n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder why Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is from Tesla\u2019s home state of California, so studiously avoid any mention of the company, which employs more than\u00a0100,000 people\u00a0worldwide. Does\u00a0the Biden administration desperately want\u00a0to distance itself from the world's biggest billionaire? \n\nThere is plenty to criticize Musk for, from his\u00a0crude and juvenile tweets\u00a0at members of Congress to his\u00a0refusal to abide by local public-health mandates\u00a0in the early days of the pandemic. But Biden would do best to stick to the facts and acknowledge \u2014 as the market has \u2014 Tesla\u2019s role as the leader in the EV revolution.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Good read", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2463996857404709}, {"body": "well whatdyaknow, who knew she hated the Biden administration more than she hates Elon.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">  than she hates Elon.\n\nNah, she's been pretty fair for the last 2 years or so.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "She was being justifiably criticized - glad she got her act straight, now do the LA Times.\n\nEDIT: Just looked up the owner of the LATimes, what a coincidence - in a good way - [Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong - South African American transplant surgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Soon-Shiong)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "LA Times is virulently anti Tesla: Russ \"TSLAQ\" Mitchell...\n\nSoon-Shiong has a zinc-air battery startup - direct competitor to Tesla...", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Ah ha! - thanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08480015397071838}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11176280677318573}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6070336103439331}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4807151257991791}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Bought 30 more shares, which I can pretend were once Elon\u2019s. \nA little higher than I\u2019d have liked, given this little downturn, but oh well.

Could lead to buying it higher than expected as it rockets up to where it would be before his sale, as this had nothing to do with the company itself.

Whale investors trying to find the sale dip buy here may freeze the dip closer to 60-79 percent, and actually begin to raise the price past 79-90 Perhaps... Even sooner. \n\nThat knowledge creates Layer 4... Reality, something noone can predict... But amateur investors focusing on layer 2 instead of 3 is how people who have been in the market a long time take money from people new to the market who believe they are making a great move because they are \"one step ahead\" by putting their money on the the level 2 \"market hypothesis\" move.

Since most people are new investors, musks sale of the next 30 percent could lower the price and create FOLM \"fear of losing more\" and the price could actually end up being lowest at the end of musk sale, like people assumed in layer 2, and sit on that floor or even go lower until buyer confidence overcomes FOLM. The stock market is a tricky, fluid thing. The information is.. is the company worth the price of the stock AND also how does supply/demand equate AND what moves are people making AND what moves does that mean I should make AND are whales anticipating I'll make that move based on their move....

Are you doing short term trading? I view splitting as neutral or bearish for long term investors. If Tesla is confident that true FSD is coming, they should buy back shares instead of splitting.

Many mediocre companies buy back shares to drive up stock price, later their stocks and companies crash and never recover. \n\nOn the other hand, share repurchase can be great if done right by the right type of companies. \n\nTo give you an extreme example, in 2019, Tesla board could have spent $500m and bought back 90% of the shares through out of money Leap calls. Now re-issuing those shares they would have gained $500B free cash in 2 years. Or they could cancel those shares the stock price would be $10,000 today. I did strongly advocate share buyback in 2019.\n\nI'm concerned that many Tesla investors don't understand that Tesla could do both growth and share repurchase, there is no conflict. Tesla doesn't need it's own cash to build new gigafactories. Giga Shanghai was built using local loans and those loans have been paid off with one year's of profit. It's a free factory. All future factories could be built following this model. Elon hinted about this but many people didn't notice.\n\nAmong all the largest companies, Microsoft did the best with share buyback. In 1990's they borrowed billions and repurchase their shares just before they released Windows operating system. In the past 13 years they continued to buy back large quantity of shares at attractive price which helped the company and the shareholders tremendously. \n\nIn the early years, Warren Buffett suggested to Steve Jobs to buy back Apple shares with all the excessive cash. He never acted. If he did, today's Apple's share price would have doubled with very little cost. It would have had little impact to the company's growth, if anything it would have grown more because they could attract more talent. A few years after Jobs died, Carl Icahn wrote a letter to Tim Cook said Apple should immediately borrow $100B and repurchase as many shares as possible. Only after that point Apple started to buy aggressively and so far they reduced shares by more than 40%.  If you are going to buy 50% sooner or later, why not buy it at $10 instead of $200. \n\nGoogle is also on track to buy back 50% of shares. \n\nIt seems to me some Tesla investors don't know enough in this area.

Last months numbers came in at a 31 year high ( [https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-october-2021-11636491959](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-october-2021-11636491959) \u00abvery instructive video). I believe inflation will probably eventually rise beyond that of the late 60\u2019s but nowhere near what we had in the 70\u2019s, unless some catastrophic event happens. The Federal Reserve will likely push up interest rates sooner, rather than later, than forecasted today by both the Fed & the markets. However now I\u2019m forecasting, & will likely to some degree be wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, the big test of the Feds nerve is directly tied to the inflation numbers to be released on December 10th & subsequent months thereafter. Should the numbers continue to rise beyond what the market has priced in, expect choppy waters. But a correction? I believe a serious correction may be due after the holidays when everyone is coming off their holiday spending binge, & attempts to repay credit card debt. From there on I see serious issues with the capacity of workers to continue spending to the effect of maintaining this very heated market. In essence, people will economize on their necessities & slash spending on wants, as a result of previous months personal spending combined with the increased cost of goods and services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf perhaps you are a few levels beyond my tax bracket you may be rolling your eyes right now. But if you\u2019re in my tax bracket or slightly higher, you\u2019re likely shaking your head in agreement. Us Walmart shoppers are paying a lot more for food right now. Indeed, my household has switched to the great value brands to cut back on grocery costs, which even though I buy roughly the same thing each store visit to feed my family, I have realized roughly a 30% increase in the cost of food. So as far as that is an indicator for ya, I see a crunch coming, and the holiday season will likely help spark it. Expect the post holiday season to be interesting indeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that right now everyone is watching prices rise & freaking out about it. Its like watching a stock fall & living in the moment, as many traders do, when they can concentrate on nothing beyond the immediate price action. In fact, retail prices may come down as businesses see the mom & pop belt tightening, flipping the retail space to perhaps more of a buyers market for heavily competitive industries (at least more than what it is now). But this remains to be seen given that the Fed simply refuses to take any significant action on adjusting interest rates & tapering. Either way the important thing for us is to simply keep looking for the indicators and plan accordingly. We don\u2019t need to be correct, we just need contingencies for every scenario.

(Papa Chen about to close BlackBerry's billion dollar patent sale and launch Amazon IVY connected car)", "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nBlackBerry is set to have a parabolic run over the next few weeks/months with many upcoming catalysts! Below is my analysis of why I think the stock is going higher.\n\nBuying BlackBerry now is similar to buying $AMD at $2.00 in 2014 when SU BAE stepped in as CEO and took the stock to the moon! I believe this is a very similar opportunity right now! \ud83e\udd2b\n\n**My fellow APES** \ud83d\udc35 **just remember that DIAMONDS** \ud83d\udc8e **are made under PRESSURE** \ud83d\udd90\n\nGood Luck and let's hope that PAPA CHEN makes it rain TENDIES!  \ud83d\udc14 \ud83d\udca6\n\n\\-------------------------\n\n**Background - The turn around story of the SLEEPING GIANT**  \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUnder the leadership of CEO John Chen, BlackBerry has spent the past 8 years pivoting from hardware smartphones to the future: (1) IoT Internet of Things (2) Automotive/EV and (3) Cyber Security.\n\nAll three of these areas are growth opportunities and BlackBerry has strategically partnered with many large tech companies including: Amazon, Microsoft and Qualcomm.\n\nThe market value of **BlackBerry is CRIMINALLY UNDERVALUED** **at \\~$6 Billion** compared to their competitors such as $CRWD at $53 Billion, $PANW at $54 Billion and $ZS at $48 Billion to name a few.\n\nThe transformation of the business can be summarized in the slide below. Mickensy Consulting has estimated that the pool of reoccurring revenue from the IoT and connected car will grow exponentially over the next 10 years, which is VERY GOOD for BlackBerry's new business model!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nz8x76naet181.png?width=1791&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2fed12d7a96a69d5287f1d39701793698b4985\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0ietxa1bm181.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=01c9ae993ec8935af6e04c22163b46fd9dae1aae\n\n**Patent Sale/Settlement/Partnership Announcement**  \ud83d\udcb0\n\nThere is been lots of speculation and rumors over the past few month from various sources, ranging from Facebook $FB being the sole purchaser for cash up front and/or a partnership deal, to a group of parties. The range of the deal is said to be worth $1 Billion to $2 Billion.\n\nOn the last conference call, CEO John Chen said that there is about an \"80% probability that the deal closes by Q4\". This date is November 2021, which is next week. However, they could also be waiting to release it during their next earnings call on December 21st, 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xyowycxdm181.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=40ff564570e406d24aba3aa07c6e2ab7fc688ede\n\n**QNX, IoT (Internet of Things), Amazon IVY and the connected car ecosystem**  \ud83d\udc4d\n\nQNX real-time OS is installed in 195M cars today, out of 1.4B cars in total on the road worldwide. QNX enables many different software pieces to run in a car, so acts as a kind of central control unit. QNX is becoming the predominant OS for connected cars, since it\u00b4s installed in so many cars. Whilst today $BB licenses QNX to OEMs on a per-unit royalty basis, QNX is effectively set up (through Blackberry Ivy, in partnership with $AMZN) to be the foundation of the data value chain for the auto industry, which McKinsey estimates will be quite big, specially for a company ($BB) with a market cap of $6 Billion today. I think this will extend to other verticals over the next decade.\n\nIn addition to the North American and Japanese automakers, BlackBerry QNX also have partnerships with Chinese EV's such as $XPEV and $BIDU (who plans to make EV's in the future).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbofc4ylcm181.png?width=1802&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c9e30b3355c64189e13e571d22b97ca3e491ac\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uylt6j3r9m181.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5604ecbd04b4dc0238c70d159b79db12dc1cba)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zg0wqrep9m181.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce09018f2ca2e5ef565636a78b4e7d65ab5224dc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/451j7o02am181.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=4826ae27694734e9984d64fbdbed2559d2ab4c0a\n\n**CES 2022 BB will be demonstrating both cyber and IoT with key partners**  \ud83d\udc4f\n\nBlackBerry has started testing their BETA version of IVY with Amazon this fall and are looking to showcase more features and capabilities with key partners at the CES in early 2022.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mou8wkvvem181.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=19e8d506ece446890b7c2d1cc4c71ceb2eb9116d\n\n**On the last conference call, BlackBerry announced that they hired John Giamatteo from McAfee to lead BlackBerry's cyber security business unit**  \ud83d\udc4c\n\nJohn's executive experience and connections should be BlackBerry generate sales in their current verticals and new market opportunities down the road, for both enterprise and consumer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bc6p1ukyrm181.png?width=1809&format=png&auto=webp&s=4086560904724b639c23d7e31c62ed2637ea0c88\n\n**BlackBerry continues to win Awards and is issued/granted new patents every month**  \ud83d\ude0e\n\nMost recently, SE Labs  independently-owned and run testing company that assesses security products and services ranked BlackBerry as #1 in New Endpoint system security.\n\nQuote: \u201d2021 has been the first year we have tested this product with BlackBerry publicly.

I could see BB as ripe for an acquisition, assuming it can continue to penetrate IOT and cyber security and reduce its operating expense by a shit ton, likely would need major downsizing in order to do so as they have like 3500 employees. Looking, I would say kinda,undervalued at $6B when compared to its competitors.\n\nEDIT 1: This company has cash flow issues and needs to downsize in all likeliness in order to reduce its operating expense. All of its revenue is getting raped by its operating expense and it\u2019s revenue is not exactly pouring in either. It\u2019s also disturbing that it won\u2019t have enough cash to cover its short term liabilities for next quarter. I would almost expect them to issue shares to try and raise some capital for its current liabilities this would drop share price however. \n\nEDIT 2: Earnings don\u2019t look much better. Projected average 177M revenue, which if hit, will be raped by -87% net profit margin sooooo not gonna help much with cash. \n\nEDIT 3: Yes, I know, COVID has crushed hopes and pillaged cash from companies,honestly shoved BB made it. \n\nLong term Chen is going to need to stop the bleeding before he can really be aggressive in the software transition strategy\u2026..which is a wise move.
