{"title": "Some Basic but very useful Options help from a full-time trader", "selftext": "I posted this as a reply to a thread in WallStreetBets.  I thought someone might find it useful.\n\nThe stocks you pick to trade options also matter a great deal.  For example; I prefer NVDA & TSLA lately because they often recover very well from selloffs and will give you clearer direction.  Both obviously are popular and their profitability will continue to bring in more buyers.  Also, they are volatile and move well in both directions with NVDA being the easier of the two to trade.  \n\nIf you have been losing money trading options because of volatility, getting shaken out, stress, etc then the following strategy may help.  Determine the latest hot sector of the market i.e. energy, financials, retail, etc and trade options in the corresponding ETF.  For example XLE - Energy, XLF - Financials, etc.  These ETFs can still make you good money and won't move dramatically in either position.  They can help you learn the mechanics and make money at the same time without exhausting your mental energy.\n\nMy personal basic strategy is to find the ITM call or put that has the highest open interest and volume.  These usually have the tightest spreads and make it easy for me to move in and out.\n\nTry not to focus on the P/L, as you will get shaken out easily, but rather trade the chart. Sell half of your position at predetermined resistance levels that lose momentum without hesitation.  This will ensure profitable trades. \n\nAlso, if you are newer to options trading then I recommend only trading 1 contract at a time as this will keep your stress level down and allow you understand how the particular stock/option you are in behaves.  (Yes, they have their own behavior lol). \n\nIf you are more of an intermediate trader then slowly add to your position.  If i intend to buy 10 contracts I will add 1-2 at the point when I get to my target entry.  Often times what we believe is a great entry will temporarily break down and offer us a better entry.  This is when I will add more.  If I don't get the small capitulation move down then i add on the way up.  All of this is fine and never beat yourself up for not getting it \"perfect\".\n\nThese are the lessons I've learned and allow me to consistently make money and trade for a living.", "id": "r2rp22", "created_utc": 1637945844.0, "score": 610, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "If you\u2019re new to options, trading Tesla is an absolutely horrendous idea", "score": 235, "replies": [{"body": "I can't stop trading Tesla options, picking otm calls four weeks away and usually selling the same day or at least the same week.\nIts like a drug, spend 5-6 thousand to make 5-6 hundred a day.....I guess it works until it doesn't.\nI bought an 1150 call right before close today after selling my call from the morning, I'll let everyone know how it goes because I still can't understand why slight moves are more profitable for OTM calls than ATM, seems like it should be opposite.\n\n\n\nEdit:.

For some reason I like NVDA more, but I'm trying to be disciplined and pick the one that, at least recently, has been better to trade (for my style). Maybe just go back the last 5 days and compare the two and see how they are similar and different,  it's very interesting!

The 2 minute helps me see what's happening now while the 5 & 15 help me understand the trend.  In my right monitor I have the 1 hour and the daily chart split.  These give me the satellite view.

The fact is, we don't know.  I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XtJQzkeAaY) to be very helpful.  He summarizes the potential issues with this new 'nu' variant:\n\n1. It may be more transmissible than other variants, including delta.  That would be shocking because delta is already highly transmissible.\n2. It may be able to get around the vaccines we already have.\n3. It may result in more serious illnesses in those who are infected.  This one is not a serious concern at the moment.\n\nDo note that in this new variant there's 30 mutations to the spike protein, which is why we're concerned that there may implications for vaccine efficacy ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html)).\n\nIn terms of investing, I don't encourage anyone to sell off right now.

I've got a trip back to the USA to visit my parents for Christmas.  I haven't seen them in 2 years.  I'm worried about what this means for my travel plans.  It's normal.  It's human.  Pretending like there isn't a problem when there is one doesn't solve anything.  There's a reason governments are taking this seriously.\n\nAnyway, it may all blow over, I fully acknowledge that and I hope it's the case!  But just pretending like everything is fine isn't the reality of what we're seeing right now.

I am relatively new and I imagine margin is a fundamental component of investing. When I say investing on margin I don\u2019t mean leveraged etf\u2019s I mean buying stocks/etfs on margin. \n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but from my basic understanding, investing using margins to buy shares should not be too influenced by volatility drag because it is based on the underlying asset and not on the gains/losses of the day.\n\nTo clarify, spending 100 on a 2x leveraged ETF would mean that a loss of 10% on the underlying index would given day would result in a loss of 20, bringing your total asset value to 80. You would need a 12.5% increase on the index for you to recoup your losses. \n\nIt would take 11.1% increase to recoup losses had you only bought the index and not the leveraged etf.\n\nBuying shares on margin fundamentally is different. You own 2x shares; you aren\u2019t just increasing your risk/reward by 2x. This greatly reduces the amount of time required to recoup losses if there are major ones.  You spend 100 of your own money to buy 1 share and 100 of the brokerages money to buy another share. You now own $200 of assets and owe $100 to the brokerage. You have a net value of $100. \n\nIf the stock loses 10%, each stock would be worth 90 and you now own 180 in asset and owe 100. Networth is 80. So just like the leveraged etf when it comes to the losses, but recouping from the losses is much more in line with the non-leveraged approach. \n\nSince an 11.1% gain on the stock brings both shares back to A value of 100, it means you now own $200 of shares and owe $100.

But starting next year I want to pick 3 stocks and just focus on those. 1 risky the other two should be less risky good growth. I\u2019m open to a lot of advice and any things to read but for my risky stock I want to chose fubo. It seems possible fubo could be a very large company one day. For the other two I\u2019m not sure and want some advice. Or good YouTube channels I could watch which can help me. I\u2019m leaning towards intel being one of the two as it seems like things should go good for them with opening chip producing plants in the usa. I\u2019ve seen some talk about their poor leadership and how it could hurt the company\u2026.\n\nMaybe nvidia for my third company? Or Starbucks ive been leaning towards. Snapchat too. I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been watching a lot of Charlie Munger and Peter Lynch and their advice is good but I\u2019m still lost in choosing companies. And don\u2019t really think I should chose Coca Cola yet as munger advises a lot.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking for some discussion and help. Stocks are still pretty intimidating to me.

{"title": "Tesla decides against state aid for German battery plant as Musk opposes subsidies", "selftext": "* Tesla withdraws application for state funding\n* All subsidies should be eliminated, Musk tweets\n* Car plant construction progressing well - economy ministry\n* Regional funding application still underway\n\nBERLIN, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) said on Friday it has withdrawn its application for state aid for its planned battery factory near Berlin as CEO Elon Musk declared the electric vehicle maker opposed all subsidies.\n\nThe European Union in January approved a plan that included giving state aid to Tesla, BMW (BMWG.DE) and others to support production of electric vehicle batteries and help the bloc to reduce imports from industry leader China.\n\nTesla was expected to receive 1.14 billion euros ($1.28 billion) in EU funding for its battery plant in Gruenheide, Brandenburg under the plan, with a final decision likely by the end of the year.\n\n\"Tesla has informed the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics... it is withdrawing its IPCEI application for state funding for the battery factory in Gr\u00fcnheide,\" a Tesla spokesperson said, referring to European subsidies allocated to so-called 'Important Projects of Common European Interest'.\n\nConstruction plans for the plant would not be affected by the decision, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"It has always been Tesla\u2019s view that all subsidies should be eliminated,\" Musk posted on Twitter in response to a tweet by another user after Tesla said it had withdrawn its funding application.\n\n\"But that must include the massive subsidies for oil & gas. For some reason, governments don\u2019t want to do that...,\" Musk added, deviating from the subject of the factory grant.\n\nTesla itself is investing 5 billion euros in the battery plant, according to German economy ministry estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, construction of a car production site alongside the battery plant, which Tesla has begun building under pre-approval permits while it awaits final approval from the regional government, has made good progress in the last few weeks, a spokesperson for the federal economy ministry said.\n\nThe electric vehicle maker also applied in November 2020 for regional funding from Brandenburg, according to the regional government's website.\n\nA Brandenburg economy ministry spokesperson said this application had not been withdrawn.\n\nThe amount Tesla applied for is undisclosed, but investments worth over 100 million euros are generally given 6.8% of their value, the website says.\n\nThe latest round of online consultations for the public to express environmental and other concerns about the car factory and battery plant closed last week and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes to formally begin production by the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.\n\nMusk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change. \n\nSource: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-withdrew-state-funding-application-german-battery-plant-economy-ministry-2021-11-26/", "id": "r2xgg0", "created_utc": 1637962728.0, "score": 527, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 248, "comments": [{"body": "Uh whut?

The subsidies were offered because Germany wanted to rely less on imports and turn Germany into the EV-central of Europe. If you've been paying attention to the development of their factory, the Berlin factory has been taking longer than they would like because of government approval. They are STILL waiting to be approved before they can start production. Meanwhile, their Texas factory is also capable and further along the process to produce these batteries. My guess? Tesla had planned to start their 4680 battery production in Berlin, it took longer than expected, and so Tesla is moving on with it in their Tesla factory. \n3.

But surprisingly, the US automaker does not want to accept government money.\n\nThe federal government would have been ready, but Tesla waived: For the planned battery cell factory in the almost finished electric car gigafactory, the funding decision for 1.135 billion euros from the second European battery cell program (IPCEI) was largely prepared. After it was said on Friday that the federal government had given the green light, the surprise came: The US company does not want to accept the state money.\n\nAccording to Tagesspiegel information, the funding decision in the Federal Ministry of Economics under the Executive Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) was practically already signed. The government decided a few weeks ago that Brandenburg wanted to contribute 120 million euros to the funding. Then the Federal Ministry of Economics and Tesla announced that the group waived.\n\nTesla has informed the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics that it does not want to pursue participation in the second major European project for battery cell production (EuBatIn), the car manufacturer said. That is why the company withdrew the application for state funding for an IPCEI (transnational project of common European interest) for the battery factory in Gr\u00fcnheide.\n\n\n\"Tesla is still sticking to its plans for the battery and recycling factory in the Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg,\" the group continued. In the battery cell factory, in which battery cells of a new generation are produced, at least 2000 jobs are to be created, in addition to the 12,000 jobs of the electric car factory in the first expansion stage.\n\nMinistry of Economic Affairs: Funds now available for other projects\nAccording to the Federal Ministry of Economics, this shows \u201cthat Germany is an attractive investment location and that foreign investors are investing in Germany and Brandenburg\u201d. And: \"The government funds not used by Tesla are now available for other projects.\" The aid for the project in Gr\u00fcnheide was approved by the EU Commission.\n\nThe Brandenburg Ministry of Economic Affairs said that Tesla's decision to build a state-of-the-art battery cell factory in Brandenburg would lead to additional added value with jobs and structural developments and would be a gain for the state.\n\nThe investment in the factory and development is estimated at around five billion euros.

The ADAS system for cruise control and lane keeping only works on the highway?? Where's it's supposed to be used and in that situation it works nearly flawlessly all the time, and also takes exits and changes lanes?\n\nI really don't see how Autopilot being unreliable on secondary roads is a deal breaker. Like I never use autopilot anywhere but the highway. It's not a useful feature on secondary roads. It's like complaining that cruise control doesn't work on secondary roads because the speeds change so often. Like, just don't use it then.\n\nAnd it's not like there's any other cars that have anything close to autopilot, and certainly none that have anything remotely useful on secondary roads. I can't understand the logic knots the author had to tie themselves up in, to declare \"autopilot has phantom breaking on secondary roads\" as a \"critically flawed.\"\n\nThere's hundreds of thousands of people with autopilot, and tens of thousands more buying new Teslas all the time, and anyone of them would be left scratching their heads about this review.

The gimmicks are there to draw people in but aren't truly what generates ROI. Toyota is the largest and most profitable automaker because they are the best at making cars, not coming up with bullshit like a flashlight in your glovebox made from the same battery as in the car. Or the Nikola water dispenser thing. Those things are not features. They are poor engineering decisions. Last time I checked you always have your phone with you and you have a massive rolling 100kWh charging brick for it. It's unlikely you're going to need that flashlight ever.\n\nIf anything the existence of these 'gimmick' features demonstrates a lack of clear and strong engineering leadership from the top. Who is making the decision to spend engineering dollars on a flashlight? If anything shows that Gali's point about Rivian having too much money is right it's this.\n\nThe thing which will most determine Rivian's success over the next 10 years will be their ability to ramp production and do it profitably. Rivian is literally being valued at $100B for their prototype. They have no evidence of large-scale profitable vehicle production whatsoever. This is the exact opposite of what Elon said. Prototypes are easy, production is hard. So Rivian hasn't even done the hard part yet but is being valued as if they are the same as Tesla, who has already done the hard part? I'm not sure this bet makes any sense.\n\nMaybe at $30 it would be a worthy bet, but at $100 the risk to return is poor imo.\n\nAlso, by the time that Rivian is producing 2-300k of their Model Y replicant in 2025/6, GM/Ford/Daimler/BMW/VW will all have their real EV competitors out. The ones built fully ground up. They will be what Rivian is competing with, and there's going to be one hell of a margin battle.

Risk/return for Rivian is a lot worse than Tesla. \n\nRegarding your pre-order, blame all the people buying 3/Y's! Too much demand for those really means Tesla will just keep delaying the CT until they have excess 4680's. Unless they feel the CT will increase their margin profile for some new reason.
