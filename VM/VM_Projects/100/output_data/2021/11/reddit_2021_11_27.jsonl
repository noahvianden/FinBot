If you are buying QQQ, buy a share any time you have saved up enough cash to buy one share and just keep buying one or two shares at a time as you increase your saving rate.

Since you are young you have a lot of time on your side and can afford to be patient. don't close a position just because everybody else is, make your own decisions and be patient. Also look at what you are buying and learn what you can about it so you have confidence in your decisions when everybody else is selling.\n\n3) Diversify: Unless you are the next Warren Buffet (Hint you are not, I am not, the next rando here is not.) you want no fewer than 20 stocks in your portfolio. This is where index ETFs come into play as you can let the ETF do the diversification work for you and you get to reap the rewards. QQQ is 100 stocks that are heavily tech focused.

Look at your income too. How much are you saving every month? How much are your expenses?\n\nLeave like a quarter as emergency cash. Invest like a quarter wide, into VOO or VTI. Long-term Growth. If you want to tilt more or less conservative, mutual funds get a bad rap, but some of those are solid too.\n\nTake the other quarter and pick some stocks with it. You don't need to invest every dime, but PYPL is a great one. You wanna start with $300, that's cool. Get comfortable holding cash though, that is the #1 mistake people make. You can't jump on an opportunity if all your funds are tied up.\n\nThe other thing is that you wanna avoid looking at this -every- day. You don't want to fear sell or fomo buy. That's for chumps and bagholders. Buy stocks you believe in, then see if you are right or wrong. That's why it is smart to start small. If PYPL drops, you can buy more shares.\n\nThe last quarter, go for income. You don't need to go 100% boomer and own bond funds like I do, but if you go stocks, understand the risk and get something that pays a dividend you can reinvest. Even a humble 2% dividend from a company that's growing can lead to long term $$.\n\nLast step: Keep Saving!\n\nRemember the first part? You want 6 months of expenses saved up in case of emergency, so put half your savings into cash and the other half into one of your other three buckets. Your \"cash\" doesn't need to be dead weight either. I put my emergency funds into a short duration income fund and earn about 3% on the money. Low risk vs no risk, but that's an option.\n\nEventually that 6 months of emergency funds are going to go towards the downpayment on your first house, after which you can open a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and if anything crazy comes up you can use the HELOC to pay it at much lower rates than a credit card.\n\nNow, that's a lot.

But just because the data shows that indexing beats active investing over the long term doesn't mean you can't beat the index by picking stocks. The reason why indexing wins is because humans make mistakes: they take profits instead of holding, they panic-sell when the markets sell off, they get impatient and sell to put their money in something else, and so on. Indexing works because the most effective investing strategy is simply to buy and hold. The other point is that picking stocks is more fun and rewarding - there's nothing better than finding a potential gem at $10 and watching it hit $100 in a few years.\n\nEvery financial advisor (which I'm not, by the way) will tell you that the right approach for you depends on your level of risk tolerance, and the younger you are the more risk you can tolerate.

Funds (ETFs for example)\n3. Company Stocks\n\nThere are far riskier than these 3, but these 3 I'd say are quite safe.\n\nWhen it comes to picking stocks, you should DEFINITELY look at the past financial reports, and see their revenues and profits, and how they evolve over time, and how is that relative to market capitalization. Basically how much dollars it costs to own 1 dollar of revenue. This is called the P/E ratio (price to earnings ratio) and should be out there in your trading app in the company profile.\n\nBallpark figures:\n* 10 is low, which means that it's super under-priced, which means that investors are expecting the company to go down in the close future.\n* ~20 is OK for an established company with no growth.

Basically growth is priced in.\n* more than 50 is going into \"hype\" driven stocks, and is high speculation. It may make sense for startups that are actually really really good and have tremendous potential and growth, but this is dangerous territory. Right now however most tech stocks are priced at that ratio, which makes me worry about how stable those stocks are, as it looks more and more like an industry-wide bubble.\n\nNow, if you buy stocks, you actually spend your money. You cease to have that money, and instead you have productive assets. You don't lose or make money until you sell.\n\nThat being said, if you buy a stock with high P/E ratio, don't be surprised if the price falls down afterwards and you lose money.
