That will raise the bar for worthy projects, while creating costs for climate mitigation. As one sign of the regulatory gantlet, two different proposed pipelines in the past two years have won a case at the Supreme Court and then been canceled anyway.\n\nAll of these actions on the part of Biden have done nothing but fuel the rise in oil and gas prices or otherwise stymied expansion and growth in production all while alternative sources are lagging too far behind to fill the gap.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "The keystone pipeline hasn\u2019t been worked on in nearly a decade because it\u2019s been tied up in courts.

You\u2019ve simply changed my argument in an attempt to make your points valid.\n\nIt\u2019s really straight forward.  The pipeline would add petroleum production that is sorely needed to ease current demand pressures.  It\u2019s objectively verifiable how much relief the pipeline would bring in the form of added oil to the refining circulation.  You can look it up.  Biden stopped the expansion of the pipeline feigning concern over climate change, which is utterly ridiculous when you consider that Biden just finished begging OPEC to increase production in other parts of the world where refining is done with half the efficiency and twice the adverse environmental impact as it is in the US.  His arguments about spills and environmental hazards are also ridiculous when compared with the risk of transporting it by truck, train or ship, which is how the oil is now going to be transported instead.\n\nFact:  The pipeline was intended to transport American crude oil.  And when finished would add 830,000 barrels per day to production. But that wouldn\u2019t help things at all, right?\n\nFact:  The pipeline would contribute substantively to thousands of peoples livelihoods and jobs.  You want to speak in terms of full time, direct employment which, apart from being inaccurate, doesn\u2019t account for reality and is entirely disingenuous. Even Politfact, which is pure trash estimated actual job losses from the shutdown at 2,000, which is itself a conservative number when you actually contemplate ancillary jobs and the interrelatedness of the supply chain to the functioning/construction of the pipeline.  Saying the pipeline only creates 109 theoretical jobs just denies reality and is a bs talking point you\u2019re regurgitating.\n\nFact:  The pipeline would distribute oil as far south as Port Arthur, Texas for the refining of petroleum products thereby adding significantly to the overall petroleum product production, which would ease demand issue and thereby contribute to the reduction of prices across the board.\n\nThe Biden administration supports pipelines in other countries like Russia, but not in America.  Just like Biden supports border continuity in other countries in Europe, but not in America.  Why do you think that is?  Wake up man.

It's a bit surprising. Just my anecdotal experience. \n\nWouldn't have D+ if not for the $100 three year promo I locked in two years ago with D23. I strongly suspect many are only keeping their subscription because of promos. Highly doubt they increase prices anytime soon either.\n\nEDIT: I should add the kids *love* the idea of going back to Disneyland though so the house of mouse in the tangible sense is sought after. I'm sure there's a flywheel with parks and D+, but the question is with ever increasing park/vacation costs it's likely hurting D+ too so I'm not convinced the growth will justify as much upside as many believe isn't being accounted for. \n\nThere will always be people who can afford going to the park but you need significantly higher D+ adoption and without the ability for the average person to experience parks it'll lose its stickiness.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3386605679988861}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19636088609695435}, {"body": "So, it\u2019s about technology.\n\nNetflix is A FAANG for a reason :)\n\nDisney is still in trial and error stages much like Hulu to get the right product. \n\nI\u2019ll be more bullish on discovery once AT&T spins off", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "True but Netflix is only at $300B market cap and Disney streams too\u2026 Netflix probably doesn\u2019t even belong in FANG anymore.

My apologies ...\n\nOptions update:\n\nWeekly options open interest changes from yesterday open to yesterday close:\n\n      Nov 22: 2021/11/26:  PUTs:   317,478 ; CALLs:   199,863\n      Nov 23: 2021/11/26:  PUTs:   399,620 ; CALLs:   252,143\n\n- As you can see, bears bought 82k puts and bulls bought 52k calls. The ratio is somewhat unusual (The typical pattern is steady & similar accumulation of open interest until the end of the week - not dominance of one side.)\n- I'd say this flow was likely the reason for yesterday's whiplash price action: a big inflow of put buying.\n- MM delta hedging thus saw an outflow of 10m TSLA shares from the ~$1,200 intraday top - which dominated much of the remaining bearish price action for the day.\n- The biggest put cluster is at $1,000 (70k contracts), but the $1,050 and $1,100 ones are significant too with 20k-20k contracts.\n- On the upside it's all much more thinly populated: $1,200 only has 13k calls, $1,250k 9k calls, $1,300 15k calls. Clearly bear shenanigans.\n- I.e. while bulls bought 52k calls, most of them are 'useless' and too far away from the money to have significant gamma effects. The puts on the other hand are in price areas that TSLA visited recently.\n- As usual, the suspicion arises whether it's actually just certain MMs that buy these puts, to reduce the delta hedging losses they incur. For example Susquehanna has two arms: the market maker and the quant fund - they are separate reporting entities that supposedly trade independently. The quant fund is often holding hundreds of thousands of TSLA options contracts ... And at the end of the day, any \"loss\" at the quant fund is a win for the MM and vice versa.\n- Just in case you are wondering: while for example AAPL saw a bearish inflow of puts as well, and call profit taking, it was during a big ATH run yesterday where it's kind of expected & justified, and was not nearly as marked as TSLA's.\n- Other names like NVDA saw the usual steady inflow of both puts and calls, around ~30k & ~30k each. This suggests that the TSLA options flow is ***not*** a market-wide shift towards some big correction, but TSLA specific - at least so far.\n- As usual, HODLers will be fine, these details only matter to the weekly gamblers and maybe to those who want to time their dry powder entry points.\n\nYesterday's TSLA options shenanigans were riding on the coattails of macro movements - greatly amplifying & exaggerating them. I believe going forward TSLA will be coupled with macro, with the usual added volatility on top - all other things equal.\n\nAlso keep in mind that Thursday will be closed for trading (Thanksgiving), and Friday will be a 'short' day.

That\u2019s what 2025 earnings of $40 x 50x =P/E discounted back to 2021 suggest TSLA fair value should be.  A split doesn\u2019t change that.\" \n\n\nSo my own situation right now is that I own\n160 shares at an average of $861 or so.\n\nI was thinking of holding on until at least January of early February because that's when we might reach the PT of $1400 dollars. I can likely hold on longer but kindly follow my reasoning to give me your thoughts on what you would do if you were in such a dilemma. \n\nHere is my dilemma:  If we reach $1400 and I keep holding (HODLing) then the stock might drop back down to 800 or less and I'm screwed because I will spend the rest of the year again waiting for some kind of recovery which may never come (and meanwhile not having taken some profits while I was up some)\n\nOn the other hand, if I trim say 50% of my shares say at $1350 (that would be 80 shares I would sell)... Then I have made a profit of\n80 x (1350 - 861) = $67, 530\n\nBut at least half of that is taxed (I'm in California) so I end up with like\n\n$33,765\n\nThat $33,765 is not a terrible profit...  But then again it's definitely not much in today's expensive economy.   Plus if the stock never drops much below $1000  (assuming we tank from a price target of $1400 down to $1000 during Q1 and Q2 of next year)... Then if I wanted to get back into Tesla by Second half, I would only be able to buy at best about 30 shares with that $30k profit (assuming my cash was kept liquid in my account).   So 80 (my remaining shares that had not been sold) + 30 =110 shares instead of 160\n\nI would likely lose 50 shares in the process.\n\nSo am I not correct in assuming that in all likelihood, Tesla will not drop from $1400 way down to $1000 after January 2022 Q4 earnings for 2021?  And furthermore, that in all likelihood I would be much better off holding longer term to those 80 shares I am considering selling at the PT of $1400 dollars?\n\nUnless an investor is desperate for liquid cash, it seems insane to sell Tesla shares (even if in this example, my profit margin per share would be close to $500 dollars (since my average is $861 and the price \"target\" would be $1400)\n\nI honestly don't understand why Fund Managers stick to their price targets so firmly and trim as the stock price reaches their targets? I realize they are used to practicing safety and conservative precautions etc...  But my mathematics as explained, shows that for small time retail investors like myself who don't own thousands of shares, such conservative approaches may not make any sense? \n\nWhat do you guys think?  Would you even sell a single share of Tesla once the $1400  PT of analysts is reached? \n\nThanks so much!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Arbitrary numbers and arbitrary dates.

At $925.  As the price goes up, it always looks like the high point, and it was far from it.  In my opinion, TSLA is an outlier in the same way Apple and Amazon were (are).  I have had to limit my purchases and investment amounts because it's **our** money, not **my** money (ie my wife and I).

Especially since $1400 is the \"fair\" price of Tesla going out to 2025 and discounted back using some fancy EPS (earnings per share) formula by these fund managers and analysts.\n\nBut as many have pointed out, Price Targets will likely start increasing by January - February of 2022.

I think he might be able to tough it out a few more years.\n\nPersonally, I'm truly hoping that by end of 2022, Tesla shares will be worth at least 2k.  If that goal is met, then although my father would not have made a lot, but at least it would make him feel quite good and motivate him to stay positive and patient.\n\nBut the only thing I kinda worry about is what will happen during Q1 and Q2 of next year (2022).\nIn other words... Will we likely dip way down from say $1400, all the way down to $800 and lower?  Or will we at most dip down to about $1000 but not much less?  You see, for his 160 shares which I managed myself throughout this year, his average cost (price) is $861 per share.  Which is not that great... Quite high.\n\nSo as long as the stock is above $1000 or so... He will be able to likely tough it out regardless of what the price does.  But if we dip down to like $500 or something crazy....

Or another possibility (as unlikely as many of us would say this is)... Is, what happens if Institutions all started profit taking (dumping) Tesla shares after Q4 earnings in January, and this triggers a major backlash with retail investors and they all start to profit take as well?

I'm \ud83d\udcaf for taking all allegations seriously, and shutting down any environment that would prevent or discourage women who have been victim to sexual and/or physical harassment or assault from coming forward... But I also cannot blindly get behind believing everyone who makes any claim to the degree of taking action without at least trying to look into it. \n\nWhen I was 22 and in college I was jumped by a group of 4 guys who beat me half to death. The reason? My current gf at the time was cheating on me, with a guy that went to the same college as us. She told him she had left me, stopped talking to me, and to block me on social media, which he did, and had him promise to \"just let it go so they could move on together.\" Well he didn't do that last part. He believed her blind and jumped me with his friends. I still have scars to this day. The only reason I'm still alive today is that when he said \"This is for Rebekka\" I said wtf and showed him my phone, that had us dating on Facebook and her in my DMs saying she loved me and long conversations that very day. We compared notes, and not only did we figure out that she had played us both, but also... I realized that she had possibly done the same thing to me, because she told me her last bf was abusive, had me block him, and told me to never contact him and just let it go. When we confronted her she just fessed up with a \"you're just such a nice guy I didn't know how to break up with you\" line... And then tried to tell him a different story, but he asked me what happened, and I forwarded him her voice messages. After that, he was still not completely convinced, so me and him met up, and I called her on speakerphone... And after a Convo with me and her where she confirmed again she had made it all up and \"why\" he got on the phone pissed, she hung up, and we both moved forward without her. To this day I still don't know if I helped her cheat on her previous BF or if it was legit... Because at the time it was just too painful to look into. I still wanted to believe her.\n\nThe point is, had that guy just messaged me and asked me my side, we would have figured that out... And I would have never gotten stitches (I still have a pretty bad scar on my nose 13 years later.) I'm not even saying that if there is no evidence that someone harassed or assaulted someone that we should dismiss a claim. At that point it's vastly more likely it happened then not, and let's believe them and even take action. But to say \"I refuse to even attempt to look at the evidence, if she (or he) said it happened, it happened, and we should take action with no investigation\" when there could be overwhelming evidence that it did not, is not the right way to move forward. We should believe them, but not take action until we look into it.

Let's assume that the premium is roughly the same for both puts and calls.  Let's assume that a stock is at $40 right now.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenario 1:  You sell a CSP at around 37 (30 delta) consuming $3700 of BP and earning probably $1.50 premium.  You close at 50% profit in an average of 10 days and then open a new position.  If the stock trades flat then this is fine.  But if the stock goes up to 40, then to 41, then to 45 over 6 weeks or so now you're needing more BP each time and in that number of days you'll have sold 4 CSPs and if all were profitable, you'll have made $3 in premium total.  This assumes that you initially had $3700 in BP available and with the increase in portfolio size from the premium you now have $4000 in BP, but what if the stock spikes up to $50 and you don't have $5000 in BP to keep selling a CSP?  You're done, find a new stock.  This is precisely how \"the wheel\" is supposed to work and you've made a profit so good job.  \n\n\nScenario 2:  You buy the fucking shares at $37, consuming $3700 of BP and then you sell a CC at 40 (again 30 delta) for about $1.50 in premium.  You repeat after the stock rises as per Scenario 1, so it goes to 40 (assume you can close at 50% profit so your call isn't going ITM), then 41, then 45 over the same 6 weeks and you consistently are able to make the same 4 CCs for the same $3 in premium, however your BP was always $3700 (I'd expect the increase in the underlying to actually raise your available margin) and now if the stock jumps to $50 and you're assigned at $48, then you've made an extra $1100 on the shares and an extra .75 in premium with the CC that you were assigned on.  Now you have plenty of money to afford to either buy back in (buy the fucking dip maybe?) or you're done and you find a new stock.  Same result as Scenario 1 except you made an extra $1175.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenario 3:  You have enough money to afford 200 shares at 37 but instead you buy 100 and sell a covered strangle.  This is Scenario $2 but you make $6.75 in premium and $1100 from the long stock, which is a better outcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorst case scenario:  your puts go ITM and you get assigned, so now you're bag-holding 100 or 200 shares and you can no longer sell CCs at a high enough strike for it to be worth it.  This is the same risk as Scenario 1 except your basis will be slightly lower due to the strangle, and this is how a delta-positive strategy behaves in a long-term drawdown or a crash so know your risks and manage them accordingly by not over-trading and picking a quality underlying.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo technically you are correct, an OTM CC is the same \"position\" as a CSP at the same strike.

Now $86B MC.\n\nLike you, SoFi didn\u2019t fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the $LCID  $15 dip. And sadly, I wasn\u2019t able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years  ago.\n\nBut here\u2019s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV \u201cpure plays\u201d in the market:\n\nPolestar \u2014 Volvo\u2019s EV spinoff brand \u2014 estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.\n\nIt\u2019s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.\n\nPolestar is the only global EV \u2018pure play,\u2019 other than Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8\n\n**History**\n\nA little background\u2026\n\n* \u201cPolestar\u201d takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris \u2014 not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That\u2019s *Polstj\u00e4rnan* (literal translation, \u201cPole Star\u201d) if you\u2019re Swedish.\n* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo\u2019s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.\n* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk & Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.\n* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being \u201cindependent since 2017.\u201d\n* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.\n\n**Comps**\n\n**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**\n\n* Applying Tesla\u2019s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.\n* Applying Lucid\u2019s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d\n\n**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**\n\n* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.\n* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:\n\n1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).\n2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.\n\n* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.\n* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.\n* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec\n\n**Gores' Deals**\n\nGores\u2019 track record speaks for itself\u2026\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae\n\n**The EV Graveyard**\n\nThe EV battlefield is littered with bodies.\n\nBut Polestar?\n\nThey've   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How  many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when  they IPO\u2019d? Answer: 1,400.\n\nPolestar just makes cars, baby.\n\nCEO Thomas Ingenlath: \u201cWe have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars.

Polestar 2\u2026 What is it?\n\nThink Subaru Outback meets the Model 3 \u2014 with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic.
