Inside, we found a cardboard cutout of the Elmer Fudd rabbit that was depicted above the entrance. On the walls there were posters of famous people in famous situations, such as:  \nThe first poster was a drawing of Jesus Christ, which appeared to be a loli or an oversized Jesus doll. She was pointing at the sky and saying \"HEY U R!\".  \nThe second poster was of a man, who appeared to be speaking to a child. This was depicted by the man raising his arm and the child ducking underneath it. The man then raised his other arm and said \"Ooooh, don't make me angry you little bastard\".  \nThe third poster was a drawing of the three stooges, and the three stooges were speaking. The fourth poster was of a person who was angry at a child.  \nThe fifth poster was a picture of a smiling girl with cat ears, and a boy with a deerstalker hat and a Sherlock Holmes pipe. They were pointing at the viewer and saying \"It's not what you think!\"  \nThe sixth poster was a drawing of a man in a wheelchair, and a dog was peering into the wheelchair. The man appeared to be very angry.  \nThe seventh poster was of a cartoon character, and it appeared that he was urinating over the cartoon character.  \n\\#AIGeneratedProtestMessage #Save3rdPartyApps", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.041345834732055664}, {"body": "Can't print those at least", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.016171878203749657}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13824276626110077}, {"body": "I can't wait to return to monke", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07301812618970871}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Holy shit these people are morons.
