I learned from GME and AMC (which I made some good money on).  But, weed is risky, lots of players, \u201cWhy would you do such a thing?\u201c you might ask? Well, I expected with the political divisions in this country and the need for all incumbents to bring back a win in 2022, that there would be strong movement on legislative action this year. And it\u2019s come true. Weed stocks are not only showing improving balance sheets, but real progress is being made toward legalizing weed in the US.  Now is the time. I\u2019ve bought into many unnamed weed stonks. And even thought the last few weeks have been great, and I could show some gain porn, I\u2019m waiting for the big payoff.  I\u2019ve initially bought mostly Canadian weed, but now I\u2019m buying more and more US.  As of now, I\u2019m 12k in, but I plan to increase that to 50k by the EOM.  Don\u2019t miss out on this great green rocket to untold highs! BUY NOW!\n\nPlus, weed is like booze. It\u2019s recession proof. About 90 proof. But that\u2019s besides the point. Buy High!

My cost basis is $11.90. I was initially in at $29 in February. The price is down after hours despite their Q3 earnings beat because their projected Q4 adjusted EBITDA is $5mln vs the $10mln Q4 guidance. If you look at their financials, Adjusted EBITDA is primarily impacted by changes in the FMV warrant liabilities, which is driven by stock price. So it\u2019s really not a big issue in my opinion. The company still seems solid to me. They just made $50mln in earnings 3rd quarter (adjusted EBITDA of $10mln after accounting for warrant liabilities), and are posed for some solid growth. I could care less about adjusted EBITDA guidance unless it was something material.\n\nWhen you look at the valuations on the 1-yr price targets from all the analysts ($16-$21 range), the price targets and analysis assume no legalization of new states until 2023 and onwards and they apply 20% discounts because of industry risk. This is their base case discussion, and I believe it completely undervalued the stock. MAPS doesn\u2019t touch cannabis so there\u2019s no risk and the DOJ dropped their subpoenas a while back after MAPS dumped its illicit dispensary clients; so there\u2019s literally no issues at the moment.\n\nLiterally 100% of what I have is in MAPS. I think it\u2019s completely undervalued due to lack of understanding. It\u2019s a long position hold, but once any sort of federal regulation hits this thing will take off. 14 years of consecutive positive cash flow with 90%+ profit margins, you can\u2019t find that in other cannabis stocks. \n\nEverything else is positive. They\u2019re solvent, highly liquid from going public. Users are growing, MOU\u2019s growing, and they\u2019re spending a lot on mergers and acquisitions and marketing to prepare for new states that are legalized. Only a matter of time for this one.
