{"title": "Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 12 - Monetizing the Level of Implied Volatility (Big Brain Trading Strategy)", "selftext": "# I've found huge edges by trading how the level of implied volatility changes. This post explains how. \n\n# Example: I sold some of the January straddles on RIVN when they released options this week at around 150% IV. It's now at 129%. \n\n[Bloomberg Terminal Screenshot for RIVN volatility yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/osvt3tdme6081.png?width=2118&format=png&auto=webp&s=5134b4a0be47b031421957363281f3b2b2a71516)\n\n*I was able to capture* *21 Vegas in 1 day!*\n\nThis could have gone the other way, but a lot of work went into pricing the fair value of IV here (actually have it much lower than where it is now), and in this lesson I will go into how to think about trading implied volatility levels and price it out for yourself.\n\n# Most traders only think about trading implied volatility VS realized volatility.\n\nOr what we might refer to as \"theta gang\" strategies. But there is a whole world of opportunity out there to be explored by trading *how the actual implied volatility number* changes for options.\n\n# This post will go in depth on how to trade the level of implied volatility and how the PnL for it works.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is that I have spent some time looking into mispriced options in longer dated options and I think there is lots of edge to be found there. But in order to take advantage of this, we need to understand how to price and trade the level of implied volatility.\n\n**Note: these are advanced trades. There's good returns to be made. But it can be absolutely brutal if you are on the wrong side. Having a strong thesis and good position management are a must.**\n\n# Its all about that vega, baby!\n\nTrading is all about finding where you disagree with the market and then expressing your view on that disagreement correctly.\n\nIf we are going to be trading the level of implied volatility, we need to make sure we are *exposed* to change in the level of implied volatility.\n\nOptions off the bat are sensitive to this, through one of the greeks called vega. Vega is the change in the option price for a 1 point change in implied volatility.\n\nFor example, if *implied volatility went from 40% to 41%, vega tells us how that would impact the price of the option we are looking at*. If our vega was \"1000\" the position would change in value by $1,000.\n\n# What options are most sensitive to vega?\n\nThe primary way to get a lot of vega exposure, is to go further out in time.\n\nWhen go very far out in time, you have very little gamma, and therefore very little theta. the primary exposure is vega, which creates a somewhat linear trade.\n\n# For example: here is the greeks for a Jan 2024 straddle on SPY:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short JAN 2024 straddle. Look at our greeks!](https://preview.redd.it/61v0b3gpc6081.png?width=1684&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2cd40e74f46407bf73c843c944cb095f2baf8ec)\n\nAs you can see, we have *very little sensitivity*  to delta, gamma, theta. But an unbelievably bigger sensitivity to vega! This is why we consider these to be \"linear\" trades for the most part: The PnL really moves up or down with changes in implied volatility. \n\nWhat about nearer dated options?  Let's take a look at a straddle on SPY that expires this week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short SPY November 17 2021 Straddle. Looks different huh?](https://preview.redd.it/2lqybubad6081.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a3881978c9cdf335428bb38a542ce52f133f85)\n\nWhen we reduce the time to expiration, vega is much less impactful. As you can see, when we are expiring soon, gamma and theta run the show primarily!\n\nIn either situation, if implied volatility goes up, you are going to make your vega , if implied volatility goes down, you are going to lose your vega . So when trying to monetize implied volatility dislocations, looking further out in time is a good idea.\n\n# A slightly gruesome analogy to understand vega vs theta trading\n\nImagine a person who finds out that they have 1 day to live. They are going to expire in one day. What happens in that one day before expiry means a lot to them. If they have a bad day, it would be devastating, and good day would be euphoric.\n\nIt makes sense, they need to maximize on today. The outcome of this day is definitive of the quality of their life.\n\nNow imagine another person who has 80 years left to live.\n\nAll of a sudden what happens today isn't such a big deal. There's lots of days left, so if today was mediocre.. it's not the end of the world. So what does this person focus on? Whats really important to how they feel and the trajectory of their life? *It's their outlook on their future and what they see for down the road.*\n\n# Just like the person with 1 day to live, shorter dated options are really sensitive to things that happen today. A lot of theta, a lot of gamma.\n\nOn further dated options, just like the person with 80 years left to live, it's more so the outlook on the future that matters. If your option expires in 2 years, it's ok for the most part if the stock moves above it's average daily move today.  But if all of a sudden the future of the business goes from stable to uncertain, the value of your options will change drastically. The reason it will change drastically is because there's lots of vega, or exposure to a change implied volatility.\n\nThere is money to be made where the level of implied volatility is different than what we think it should be.\n\n# Is there money to be made trading the longer dated options?\n\nA lot of people think you cant make a lot of money trading longer dated options. So people will maybe buy leaps, and sell covered calls against them since the leap is not very sensitive to volatility. But as I hope you are starting to see, this can not be further from the truth!\n\n**For example, let's take a look at a trade that was shared with me on ARKX.**\n\nWhen it became option-able this year, a friend of mine shared some research on the longer dated options that was really interesting. The 1 year options were trading at 40% implied volatility, and our conclusion was that they were worth 25% implied volatility.  over the next couple months, it came all the way down. a 15 point drop in implied volatility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[IV literally got crushed.](https://preview.redd.it/09cwwd87i6081.png?width=2446&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb33e6c735acf2ad1cdfa7a255de69c76c116c6)\n\nSo the question is, how profitable was the trade?\n\nHere is what the position looked like at inception. Take a look at our greeks. **As you can see..**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sold for $4.825 \\/ lot](https://preview.redd.it/4baz43woi6081.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b4e7534fa4c4f7cd05f61f727e22aa4ab9328c)\n\nHere's what it looked like at the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bought back for $2.99 \\/ lot!](https://preview.redd.it/gz84yltti6081.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=57f26bfd75e2638941a600d8c635d8e9330d6b05)\n\n# The options basically got cut in half!\n\nBecause of the nature of this trade and the confidence in the research, myself and the others I know in this position were able to scale up pretty big. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[this was in late June](https://preview.redd.it/i77akldbj6081.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ff5b27cd0f36ef74dba1ab2615f6ad7492108f9)\n\n# What was really interesting is how wrong the market's pricing was.\n\nAs we go further out in time, there tends to be less liquidity on some of these names when you go further out. There's just less eyes on it. That means opportunity.\n\nFor example, on RIVN, myself and the others I was looking at this trade with basically made up all of the longer dated volume early on Tuesday. \n\nBecause of how poorly it was being priced, and the thoroughness of the research we did, I was able to scale up on this position significantly. I've found that there's actually a lot of opportunity like ARKX that comes around. So now let's discuss a couple of basic ways to price these out and find these opportunities.\n\n# Idea generation\n\nSomething that I've noticed is when realized volatility spikes in the near term, sometimes the whole term structure will elevate and the back can get really out of line.\n\nSo i typically look for these types of trades when bad news has come out around a stock, industry or sector.\n\n**Examples of times that I have traded this way:**\n\n* When Archegos blew up. Longer dated vols on the companies that were held by the fund stayed elevated post event.\n* ARKX release. Options were pretty illiquid and very poorly priced. Anticipating a lot more volatility than it should have given the underlying stocks\n* TSLA longer dated options were being priced at extremely high levels given the size of the company and relative to correlated assets\n* KWEB pricing in extremely high volatility (higher than covid) because of Chinese market issues.\n* RIVN starting to release options and pricing them at insane levels of implied volatility.\n\n# How to price the level of implied volatility: DISCA example\n\nIn order to explain how to go about pricing the level of implied volatility, I am going to go through a trade that I took earlier this year on DISCA.\n\nKeep in mind that this is the sentence we are trying to complete: ***The market is showing me that the stock is trading at an implied volatility of X, I think the level of implied Vol should be Y.***\n\n# The Situation\n\nEarlier this year when the Archegos fund blew up, the stocks that it was holding took a massive hit. Simply put, they got crushed! This lead to a massive opportunity, that was missed by much of the retail community. The options market went berserk. \n\nBefore the fund blew up, the fair value for options were around 55-58% IV. \n\nBut when everything exploded, the crazy movement in the short term caused the whole option chain to lift up!! All of a sudden, the 90 day and 120 day options were trading at 75%-80% IV!\n\nFor perspective, IV was at 68% during covid for the same DTE...\n\nBasically, things look really crazy. So I set out to price the options and try to uncover a trade.\n\n# There are two ways to price the options here. Absolute value and relative value. Let's go over each way for DISCA;\n\n# 1) Example of absolute value pricing:\n\nAbsolute value pricing involves comparing what we are seeing today for a stock against what we have seen in the past. \n\nDISCA July options were trading at 55% IV before the Archegos liquidation. As the event happened, Implied volatility shot up to 75%. A couple days later, when the event was over, it was still at 70% IV. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[IV stayed elevated even when the event was over. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0alx7m5l6081.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=a356b0eab97e9f3de96f7ce3421bfc421c4d439d)\n\nThinking about how options are priced, it would make sense that the level of implied volatility came down here since the impact from the event had happened already (assuming there were no further \"chain reactions\") and therefore the level of implied Vol should come back down to what it was Pre-event, or 55%.\n\nThe reason I did't think there would be chain reactions is that the realized volatility basically stopped after the event. Check this out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RV went right back to normal after the news!!](https://preview.redd.it/bmp8w036o6081.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=09a7d4c47e449b0eabace186348a14f398f1abf0)\n\n# With a normal implied volatility of 55%, the event over, and RV returning to normal, it seemed reasonable to expect the IV to come back down to the 55% range.\n\n# 2) Example of relative value pricing:\n\nRelative value pricing is an extremely powerful way to price options. It involves comparing the options for a stock we are interested in against other stocks that are correlated. \n\nFor example, KO and PEP are strongly correlated. They have similar levels of implied volatility. Take a look at this pic:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7c35gfcm6081.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b4f5b7a06d5a768201585756a8aaf07ac3b8c0\n\nThe above picture is showing : Blue - PEP 90 day IV. Green - KO 90 day IV. Bottom green - Ratio between KO and PEP 90 Day IV.\n\nAs you can see, they move together. when KO Vol goes up, so does PEP.\n\nLooking at the ratio, you can see they have an average ratio between them that they mean revert around. This is because they have correlated movements and implied volatilities. When the spread between them gets too large, we see it close. \n\nNow imagine we saw this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uiu5teom6081.png?width=2364&format=png&auto=webp&s=95ee9a4c2c05438f7e9691b8097ec0fd7add88bc\n\nThe red line is a hypothetical situation where the ratio between them shot up.\n\nIn this situation, we could also say that there is an opportunity to trade the level of implied volatility for these companies.\n\nWe could buy Vol on the lower iv one, sell Vol on the higher one. OR we could look for which leg is \"inefficient\" and likely to change the most, and just trade that one.\n\n# So how did I use relative value pricing to trade DISCA? \n\nFirst, I went out to find a correlated stock. The one I settled on was FOXA. Then I plotted the IVs for each of them and looked at the ratio. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DISCA iv30 \\/ FOXA iv30](https://preview.redd.it/p55msy86n6081.png?width=2178&format=png&auto=webp&s=b12d46b411a0ae33660cc93d632b3c60eb846d58)\n\nAs you can see, at the time of the disaster, the IV went through the roof. Since FOXA was not a part of the disaster, It was clear that it wasn't really an industry impacting event, and that when the disaster is over, the volatility should return to something back in line with this correlation. \n\n# With an average ratio of about 1.1-1.2, and FOXA trading at around 45-50% IV. it seemed reasonable that we should see DISCA volatility come back to around 55% - 60% IV.\n\nMy analysis on DISCA painted a very clear picture of what should happen to the options after the event. Because I had done enough leg work to develop a good thesis, I was able to pack on some size and make a fantastic return. \n\n# Both my absolute value and relative value narrowed down on a similar fair value for implied volatility on DISCA, between 55% and 60%!\n\nFrom here, I went and sold July straddles on DISCA and sure enough, the IV came down to my expected fair value and I was able to pay for a nice vacation :) \n\nI closed out this position when it was pretty much at my fair value. \n\nOn the flip side, if this trade had gone against me, I would have to go back to the drawing board and really dig into my thesis. Holding these types of positions through IV spikes can be catastrophic if you are wrong, so a lot of work would have to go into *why* it's moving against me. \n\nOn a couple other positions, it has moved against me in the short term but then I have been right in the end of the day. Weathering those storms is no joke though especially if you have a meaningful amount of money on the line. This is why I always stress the importance of knowing your stuff before scaling up your trades.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nBy knowing how to price the level of implied volatility, you can develop really strong ideas that can yield great returns. This has been one of my primary strategies this year, especially with the meme stock craze, tensions in China, etc. \n\n# IMPORTANT POINT:\n\nThis is NOT about just selling high IV. A lot of the times, IV is high for a reason. ***This is about pricing IV, and selling when it is expensive.***\n\nA lot of traders make the mistake of selling because it's high, but I hope this post helps you think different about volatility and gives you some ideas about where you can find a real edge in the market. \n\nRemember, once you have an idea of where IV *should* be, you can make a trade if it's different than what the market is pricing.\n\n# If you have ay questions, leave a comment and I'll try my best to help. \n\nHappy trading,\n\n\\~ A.G", "id": "qw3pzt", "created_utc": 1637168475.0, "score": 577, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 181, "comments": [{"body": "Best series on this website", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Hah I wish.

Or put it in another way, for DISCA, are the two methods in the post essentially all what you do, or do you have a secret sauce ?\n2. Some may describe selling straddles as picking up pennies in front of a steam roller, one home run can take all the profits away (especially selling before earnings). Have you encountered such circumstances?\n3. Contiune on 2, I guess you typically wouldn't sell straddle before an event (e.g. earnings), as the high iv is justified. Rather, most opportunities are after events, because the event is over, and iv hasn't come down yet. Is it right?\n4. is predicting alpha your main research tool?

Market go up when investor thinks company does good, company grows and becomes more valuable and investor is happy because it\u2019s worth more because others buy more because the companies value went up because it grew. Companies haven\u2019t been growing and the market and economy as a whole has not been producing but the prices have been continuing to go dramatically because companies are have gotten a lot more money from the fed and are able to invest more constantly and their bonds are being bought so the have more free cash to which makes it look like companies are growing but they are not, but instead of people holding money away from the market during the pandemic they threw it all back in knowing the fed would ensure that the market and companies would not collapse during the economic shut down giving investors confidence. Now investors are basing all strategies on speculation that the market and share price will continue to go up without any added value to companies because the economy as a whole is not producing as much, but since financial institutions and companies have a lot more money they can continue to raise the prices in the markets. \n\nUnfortunately more money in circulation doesn\u2019t mean just more spending because stagnant wages and higher prices mean less spending by consumers which means less growth in companies but higher operating costs because they have less buying power. Now add in supply chain issues, and labor shortages driving prices and the demand for wages higher you continue to raise operating costs. So investors will soon realize that the market is headed for a down turn in growth and there will be a sell off as we head into a recession.

They jumped the gun by at least 5 years. I'm guessing they did this because of all the drama that was swirling around, and they felt that doing this would get people talking about something totally different, and it's actually worked pretty well for them.\n\nHow many metaverse related posts have we seen since early November? A lot.\n\nBut yeah, they jumped the gun, no question about it.\n\nThat's probably the biggest problem with this whole thing, is that it's going to setup these unrealistic expectations. First off, AR is 5 years behind VR. So if you think VR is bad, AR is way worse. Zuck was basically talking about these Raybans that people would wear that are 5mm thick and have all this unbelievable hardware miniaturized and stuffed inside it. The problem is, miniaturizing all that hardware isn't going to be trivial at all. Another problem too, is the fact that even if all this worked like they planned it to, I think 5mm thick Raybans are going to look pretty dorky. It's easy to say 5mm thickness, and people don't really think that's too bad, but wait till they see and feel what 5mm thick looks like in real life. I think regular glasses are like 3mm thick. I seriously doubt they were using 5mm thick glasses on the people in their promo videos.\n\nAll this stuff I've been saying might sound negative, but at the same time, this shit is going to be the ultimate game changer. VR is going to kill all other forms of entertainment eventually. We already have the technology to completely take over your visuals and audio, and have perfect representations of the real world, at least from a seeing and hearing standpoint.\n\nThink about that for just a second. Imagine every unbelievable experience that you've had, that had nothing to do with touching anything, it was just your eyes and ears witnessing something incredible. At concerts and sporting events, we're mostly just using our eyes and ears. That's the stimulus. We're not touching anything.\n\nOk, so we can't replicate touch.... yet.

It is not like flat gaming at all.\n\nWill Meta make the metaverse?: I doubt it. They will try, but many people take issue with Facebook and how they treat their product, oops I mean customers.\n\nThe metaverse is already happening and it will come to be organically: I know it is not a lot, but there are now typically 20k to 30k users online at any time in VRChat. If you look into what that program is, you'll see that it is mostly user uploaded content based on the Unity engine. As you can imagine, there is a vast variety of places to go and things to do. There are meditative spaces, night clubs, horror maps, game rooms, movie worlds (to watch movies, youtube, or anime or whatever), recreations of real-world places, and so on. The social aspect of the game is what draws me back there, but on its own is lacking basic features. Discord became a necessary companion app. Now I am on quite a few servers there now to stay connected to people I know in VRChat. You can also use both programs simultaneously with an overlay program in VR. The organic part is that no one decided to merge these programs, people started doing it out of necessity. So on any Saturday night, I am in a club (I am an old guy, but still likes to dance) hanging out with 20 somethings with a lot of energy, we can be speaking to each other through VRChat or Discord. I'm in my avatar which I bought from someone I connected with through the game and Discord, then customized to look the way I want with Unity. I bought shaders from someone else to use in Unity to make those custom tweaks. With a flip of my wrist, I can pull up my desktop, and pick a song in Soundpad to play for everyone in the room to dance to.\n\nWhere is this all going?: hard to say, but there is enough potential and momentum that it will not die like 3d tv. BTW, the last 3d movie I watched was within VRChat, so have we come full circle?\nNFT and virtual real-estate: I don't see it happening. I don't see NFT as needed or even useful. No one cares about your virtual plot of land except other speculators. But a small amount of money can be made selling assets for Unity to use later in virtual space.  \n\nAnswering your question: I am a single guy, with money to spend on the hardware, and space to take advantage of full body tracking, who wants to feel younger.

Take human distance interaction for example: in my eyes, using even better technology to interact with people from a distance in an increasingly \"realistic\" way is very natural. At first we use only our voices at home or our offices (landlines), then we use our voices from anywhere (mobile), then we can see faces (Facetime/video chat), and now we can participate in big meetings with people from all around the world. It is only a natural technology development that people in future want to feel distance interaction as \"real\" as possible. Back then when facetime was out, parents were excited to see how they can see their kids by video chat; imagine the excitement of people when they can enjoy activities in VR with their SO/kids/friends living far away.\n\nI both agree and disagree that the metaverse is overhyped. I agree with that because a lot of people are chasing the idea that metaverse is something which will change our life in a few years, and everyone will live with goggles strapped to their head soon. Such hype is equivalent to how we perceived that in 2010 we would have hoverboards and so. The hardware and infrastructure is still very expensive for mass adoption.\n\nI disagree though that metaverse will be a flop; if anything, it will slowly but surely, and most importantly, naturally becomes integrated into our lives. If putting on giant goggles are weird, then miniaturization shall solve that; brick phones were super eyecatching in the past, but today's you have way, way more functions in tiny electronics as small as a watch. \n\nI still remember when I brought out my iPad in a subway to read stuff in China; people were looking at me like some crazy dude using a big screen like that. Also when people think that using a watch or an earpiece to talk is weird. By today, nobody cares about such appearances anymore.\n\nedit: also I should state that I don't buy into investing (I almost forgot this is /r/stocks) into \"metaverse\".

Strapping an iPhone on your right eye to see AR is stupid, but putting on a Google Glass X in probably 2030 however isn't that out of place.\n\nAlso replacing TV/movies with VR when used in your house (as you originally mentioned) is not something completely crazy. Currently, watching movies on your VR set is a complete downgrade of enjoyment due to a sever lack of good VR content, and VR display technology still hasn't reached the point that it eliminate issues such as screen door effects.

If you knew everything, you'd be able to perfectly weigh the risks vs the rewards, but in reality there are often many things about a company you don't know.

Visa\u2019s interchange fees for transactions between the UK and the European Union (where Amazon UK processes payments) were previously capped at 0.3 percent by EU law. But since the UK left the EU, Visa has been able to hike that fee to 1.5 percent.\n\nHowever, Visa isn\u2019t the only company to make such a change. MasterCard made an identical increase to its interchange fees before Visa, but it hasn\u2019t been blocked by Amazon. It\u2019s not entirely clear why Visa has been singled out. It may simply be a strategic decision on Amazon\u2019s part \u2014 to hurt one company instead of taking on an entire industry. Or there may be specific complications in Visa\u2019s payment policies. For example, Bloomberg notes that the company has increased interchange fees for e-commerce sites, while reducing fees in other areas, like education and real estate purchases. It\u2019s not clear if policies from MasterCard or other card issuers make similar distinctions.\"\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786966/amazon-visa-credit-card-ban-alternatives-fees", "score": 166, "replies": [{"body": "Different card brands have deals with suppliers to have different rates.

I am guessing we will hit that target by end of January or so.\n\n   My question is regarding the Trimming of positions.  Last time Gary Black did that was in January (at $900 dollars) and we sank to the $540s by March - just three months later.  And it took all year to recover to where we are now.\n\n   If Gary Black trims his position by say 50% come his $1400 PT... Would it be wise for me to do the same?  I do realize that if I sell my shares (which bought this year)... I sell them Jan 2022, I would be hit with Short term capital gains tax (which in California is quite high).  But I would not have to pay those until April of 2023. \n\n    So can someone explain to me why it would be an awful mistake for me to trim my position of 160 by say 60 sharers (reducing exposure and having money on hand to buy at a later point in that same year 2022) thereby being able to potentially increase my overall position longer term?   Ot am I not seeing something and this would actually reduce my shares because of the taxes?\n\n   4) I have a feeling mr. Gary Black believes once we reach $1400, Tsla (at least shorter term) will be so overvalued and risky, that it's not worth holding so many concentrated shares.   I can't necessarily fault his reasoning.  But I am really torn about what to do once tsla hits that point?\n\n   Also, who is to say that Tsla (after reaching a January 2022 high of around $1400) could not just keep going higher in price over time?  I mean I know historically Q1 and Q2 are weak quarters and the stock goes flat or drops (only to pickup later half of the year).  But with two new Gigas and so much going now for Tesla... Is it conceivable we could have quarter after quarter of record breaking street earnings and we just keep rallying?   If that were to happen I would have hated losing (trimming) 60 shares.  But if things turn out as Gary Black predicts and the stock tanks for half a year... Then I will likely have hated myself for not trimming.\n\nWhat should be my approach based on your wisdom on taxes, and historical Tesla price action?\n\nThank you so much \ud83d\udc4d", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24119533598423004}, {"body": "Most people I talk to have no clue about what's going on with Tesla.

Then, some of those items you mention are, and I'm being generous, far from assured in a 12 month window.  Arguably, some of it is already priced in.  The stock split is popular talk here, however the last word from Elon was to pour cold water on that idea in the near term - I'm not convinced its coming soon (even if it does, i doubt were going to double the price in 12 months).  4680 is still a waaaaaays away (progressing, sure, but we're talking later next year for mass production......\\*maybe\\*, I expect 2023 at the earliest). EV tax credits are unlikely to really affect the stock price in significant ways (hasn't really, not much, before - I see no evidence as to why that would change?).  Cybertruck is....a tough one.  I'm of the opinion that CT scaled production is 2023 at the earliest so not sure how much impact that will have before end of 2022.  Factories coming online, margins improving all should contribute to getting to that $1500 reliable floor.\n\nThings I haven't factored in include hard announcements about a lower cost model, significant rollout of the Semi, some major moves in energy deployment.... but all these are likely affected by supply constraints for maybe another 12 months.  Elon's been making a point of reiterating ongoing supply constraints in various business segments - so I can imagine new products are far down the list compared to satisfying demand for Model Y & Model 3 - but I'm happy to be wrong.   Also, the rest of the EV sector (SPACs and what have you) could do odd things to TSLA share price for a bit in either direction just by being lumped together in public/less informed investor's perceptions....a minor bit of a wildcard if you will.

I am guessing we will hit that target by end of January or so.\n\n   My question is regarding the Trimming of positions.  Last time Gary Black did that was in January (at $900 dollars) and we sank to the $540s by March - just three months later.  And it took all year to recover to where we are now.\n\n   If Gary Black trims his position by say 50% come his $1400 PT... Would it be wise for me to do the same?  I do realize that if I sell my shares (which bought this year)... I sell them Jan 2022, I would be hit with Short term capital gains tax (which in California is quite high).  But I would not have to pay those until April of 2023. \n\n    So can someone explain to me why it would be an awful mistake for me to trim my position of 160 by say 60 sharers (reducing exposure and having money on hand to buy at a later point in that same year 2022) thereby being able to potentially increase my overall position longer term?   Ot am I not seeing something and this would actually reduce my shares because of the taxes?\n\n   4) I have a feeling mr. Gary Black believes once we reach $1400, Tsla (at least shorter term) will be so overvalued and risky, that it's not worth holding so many concentrated shares.   I can't necessarily fault his reasoning.  But I am really torn about what to do once tsla hits that point?\n\n   Also, who is to say that Tsla (after reaching a January 2022 high of around $1400) could not just keep going higher in price over time?  I mean I know historically Q1 and Q2 are weak quarters and the stock goes flat or drops (only to pickup later half of the year).  But with two new Gigas and so much going now for Tesla... Is it conceivable we could have quarter after quarter of record breaking street earnings and we just keep rallying?   If that were to happen I would have hated losing (trimming) 60 shares.  But if things turn out as Gary Black predicts and the stock tanks for half a year... Then I will likely have hated myself for not trimming.\n\nWhat should be my approach based on your wisdom on taxes, and historical Tesla price action?\n\nThank you guys so much \ud83d\udc4d", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Don\u2019t look at what others do, your personal situation is different, the choices are yours.\n\nIf you believe, and you are not money constrained, I recommend you to hold and buy when dips happen", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks but buying is the easy part. \n\nWaiting for the stock to recover from major dips takes guts.

Especially if I don't trim while it reaches a peak.\n\nBy trimming... Sure I would be paying taxes.  But that entire year (2022) I would not be responsible for the taxes and could accumulate more shares in preparation for those taxes... And meanwhile make more money right?  \n\nMy point is this.  If I had 160 shares by January of 2022 and we hit $1400 and I trim by 60 shares of tsla.  Then it drops even only if down to $1000 for some months.

He certainly can be a huge asshole and immature and lash out and say just absolutely stupid shit sometimes. But I think it's also worth remember that having a couple hundred billion dollars isn't magic, it doesn't make you \"normal\" or \"cool\" and it doesn't just fix trauma.\n\nI also don't want to play armchair psychologist, but it seems pretty clear that Musk probably isn't \"neurotypical\", and I don't want to put labels on it because that can be problematic too.  But I don't think a lot of people attacking Musk for acting weird would be OK attacking anyone else who's not neurotypical for acting unusual or unexpected sometimes. And if you've read anything about Musk's history growing up, it's obvious his family had money, but it's also obvious that he was severely bullied and stayed with his dad when his mom left out of pity or duty and now seems to not like his dad very much at all.

Some car companies may go broke and be replaced with new EV based companies, however the big dogs like Toyota and GM will eventually catch up to Tesla.

The stock market is forward looking. Companies are valued based on future cash flows, not present day.\n\n2. Tesla\u2019s long term growth rate is ~50% for a target of 20M EVs sold in 2030, whereas all other automakers have drastically smaller EV targets for 2030.\n\n3. Global EV adoption is expected to climb exponentially in the next 3-5 years. What happens when you know if you buy an ICE vehicle it won\u2019t be worth anything in 5 years because no one wants an ICE vehicle? The value prop of EVs goes through the roof. Look to the Scandinavian countries as an example of how fast EV adoption takes place.\n\n4. Tesla\u2019s GM is already industry leading with many catalysts to push it higher in the future. Localization of production, economics of scale, manufacturing efficiencies such as front and rear body casting, and maybe most importantly manufacturing of their own batteries starting first half of next year. Tesla is on track to be the largest automaker we\u2019ve ever seen in terms of profits. And even though they aren\u2019t right now, remember #1 above, that markets value companies based on future cash flows.\n\nNotice that no where did I mention robotaxis.

Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.\n\n* Companies  with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a  sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies  missing one or more of those attributes.\n* For most people it is impossible to time the market\n* Stock prices have all available information priced into them.\n* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.\n* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)\n* [Index  fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)\n* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).\n* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 (yes, simplified)\n* During times of volatility, companies that had poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.\n* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.\n* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:\n   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)  even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had  losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in  that same set of stocks in the same proportions.\n   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don\u2019t want to support.\n   * Due  to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the  index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla  was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,  forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,  which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it  was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the  stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that\u2019s because it is.\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nUsing  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500.\n\n# Experiment 2020\n\n750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies\u2019 average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:\n\n* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1\n* ROE > Index ROE = Moderate = 2\n* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3\n\nFor  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating.\n\nThis was done for all of the metrics below:\n\n* ROE\n* Revenue Growth %\n* EBITDA %\n* FCF %\n\nThe  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution.\n\nAny stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.\n\n[ROE Example](https://preview.redd.it/t7l27u9tu6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f904309edb170cc8679189ea62f7bbe057646a3d)\n\nROE Example\n\nThat left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.\n\nThis  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them?\n\nThat left 26 across 7 sectors.\n\n[Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/3gurx91wu6081.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e37aa1afdb655721fc83dff4e75867923e48cc1)\n\n**2020 Industry Breakdown**\n\nThese  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.\n\n2020 Experiment Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\nCan we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.\n\n# Experiment 2021\n\n2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:\n\n* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company\n* Profit Margin \u2013 shows how effective the business is at making money\n* Operating Margin \u2013 shows how much money the company earns on its revenue\n* FCF Margin \u2013 shows how efficient a company is with their cash\n* EBITDA Margin \u2013 shows a companies\u2019 operating profitability\n* ROE \u2013 shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money\n* ROA \u2013 shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits\n* ROIC \u2013 shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns\n* Debt/Equity Ratio \u2013 shows the financial stability of a company\n\nMore  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:\n\n\u00b7  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.\n\nEach  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution.\n\nI  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn\u2019t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.\n\nHere is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring:\n\n[Aerospace & Defense scoring](https://preview.redd.it/5r8i1qb0v6081.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=947be14d943204b8211c0933e9c1f1a41d4a1986)\n\nHere is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company\u2019s most recent year):\n\n[Growth Scoring](https://preview.redd.it/a2nq8c1av6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f79a62b587bf6f1530f5beefda1b174b5d7d43)\n\nHere is an example of the visualizations for the data:\n\n[Data Visualization Example](https://preview.redd.it/5d41vcvdv6081.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=26567d730e1d668ccef856a18497fab38345577b)\n\nI  applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.\n\nNext,  I read the description of \\~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn\u2019t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it\u2019s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated \\~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I\u2019d  need to build a separate model.\n\nI  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated \\~75.\n\nWe were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84. My hourly wage at McDonald was going  to be better than my returns from the analysis if I took too long. I  only eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83  companies across 31 industries. Breakdown below:\n\n[Industry Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/0bmcwyuiv6081.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df395664265ef942ff736c889108711216e76ed)\n\nI then purchased all of these in equal proportion in April, May, and July of 2021.\n\n2021 Experiment Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Industry Classification\n\n* For Experiment 2020, the Sector was used to determine how companies should be compared.\n   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.\n   * This  seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other  that aren\u2019t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.\n* For Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.\n   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.\n   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).\n   * I  ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further. Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less than 10  stocks. I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they could be combined such  as biotech and pharmaceutical.\n\n# 2020 Stocks\n\nABMD\n\nADBE\n\nANET\n\nBWXT\n\nCRL\n\nDG\n\nENR\n\nETSY\n\nEXEL\n\nICLR\n\nISRG\n\nKLAC\n\nLKQ\n\nLRCX\n\nMNST\n\nMPWR\n\nMTCH\n\nOLED\n\nPAYC\n\nPHM\n\nTER\n\nTTD\n\nUI\n\nVEEV\n\nVMW\n\nVRTX\n\n# 2021 Stocks\n\nAAON\n\nAAPL\n\nACN\n\nADBE\n\nAEIS\n\nALGN\n\nAMAT\n\nANET\n\nAPH\n\nATR\n\nATVI\n\nAX\n\nBLD\n\nCDNS\n\nCGNX\n\nCHD\n\nCHE\n\nCORT\n\nCPRT\n\nDLB\n\nDORM\n\nEPAM\n\nESNT\n\nETSY\n\nEW\n\nEXPD\n\nEXPO\n\nFAST\n\nFB\n\nFIX\n\nFOXF\n\nFTNT\n\nGGG\n\nGOOG\n\nGRMN\n\nHEI.A\n\nHELE\n\nIDA\n\nINS\n\nINTC\n\nINTU\n\nIRBT\n\nISRG\n\nCCSI\n\nZD\n\nKLAC\n\nLRCX\n\nLULU\n\nMASI\n\nMED\n\nMKSI\n\nMKTX\n\nMNST\n\nMORN\n\nMPWR\n\nMSFT\n\nNMIH\n\nNRC\n\nNVDA\n\nODFL\n\nOLED\n\nOLLI\n\nPAYC\n\nPAYX\n\nPRLB\n\nQLYS\n\nREGN\n\nRMR\n\nROAD\n\nSCCO\n\nSFBS\n\nSLP\n\nSTMP\n\nTDY\n\nTER\n\nTREX\n\nTROW\n\nTTD\n\nTYL\n\nUI\n\nV\n\nVEEV\n\nVRTX\n\nWAL\n\nYETI\n\n \n\n# Experiment Results\n\n**2020 Experiment** Results July, August, and September 2020 purchases to 11/16/2021\n\n* **S&P 500** total return reinvested dividends: **49.09%**\n* **My 26 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **61.53%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2021 Experiment** Results April, May, and July 2021 purchases to 11/16/2021:\n\n* **S&P 500** total return including reinvested dividends: **11.93%**\n* **My 2021 Stock Index** including reinvested dividends: **14.26%**\n\n# Notes\n\nI  partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments.

{"title": "\ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6 = \ud83d\udc30\ud83d\ude80 -- $PLBY hitting an inflection point, and will challenge OnlyFans and Instagram in early December.", "selftext": "tldr: You probably have no idea what PLBY is going to do, and the market probably doesn't either. Take advantage of that. Long term potential, and big catalyst early December. Make money with the bunny. Beware: Lots of execution risk.\n\n\\---\n\nThere's an ancient saying, probably: Can't go tits up investing in tits out. Since the dawn of humankind, men have been willing to shell out their hard earned money in order to suspend all disbelief that, despite the reality that they are disgusting and utterly replaceable blobs of flesh engineered strictly to carry and disperse sperm, they are sexually desirable and relevant.\n\nPlayboy made its name exploiting this innate male desire and also made it culturally acceptable -- they somehow convinced people that this practice of shooting swimmers all over the planet is not morally bankrupt, not entirely meaningless and pointless, but rather: it is an *aspiration* for both men and women to be a part of.\n\nTo the dismay of the sock industry Playboy also invented a second, rather high margin, use for glossy paper. By printing images of naked women (likely also seeking the feeling of sexual desirability and relevance) on those pages, Playboy was able to sell those glossy sheets of paper for an incredible mark up... every month. They were also able to build one of the world's most recognizable brands. (It's estimated that the brand has 97% recall. Try to name any other brand with that kind of branding valued below $2b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[From the interview within: \\\\\"I think any man enjoys flirtations, and if he said he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d be lying or he\u2019d be a politician trying to get the extra four votes. I think everybody likes knowing he\u2019s well responded to.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/4yop9ww188081.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c89c24a3a378e34a53309c2f1342860b2e2de41)\n\nBut the times changed, and so did the time honored tradition of rubbing a quick one out between some pages and hastily disposing of the evidence. Though Viagra was able to extend and harden the founder's penis, it did not, unfortunately, have a similar effect on the business. First VHS, then the internet. Before too long, sock companies were once again rejoicing as hoards of mongers fixed their eyes to screens and their hands to computer peripherals and footwear. At least we're saving some trees.\n\nAs the popularity of Playboy faded, management tried a few retarded last ditch efforts to pep up their brand, including removing the cartoons, ending full frontal nudity, and ditching the slogan \"Entertainment for Men\". It was, unsurprisingly, to no avail.\n\nPlayboy's last physical print was February 2016, and by Hugh Hefner's death in late 2017, Playboy was basically a limp dick -- left to decay as dying publishing business with no vision behind it, leaving behind only an iconic logo, brand, and story.\n\n\\---\n\n# 1. The new Playboy\n\nPlayboy was taken private in 2010, only to resurface publicly as a SPAC earlier this year. At the helm, CEO Ben Kohn has put a significant amount of work and thought into reviving and positioning the business to fit into today's world.\n\nI won't get into the details of the acquisitions and pivots PLBY has made since Ben took the helm and PLBY went public. Basically, it's been a year-long revamp. The main theme of the new PLBY is to focus on high-margin direct-to-consumer ecommerce, with the recent reveal of Centerfold tying it all together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Pieces set in place... and beast Centerfold on the way.](https://preview.redd.it/t0jb1z2388081.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=b57916204f31e0b9666548515be80c0b0d396e39)\n\nA summary of the pieces they've collected:\n\n* Licensing: leveraging the brand to collect easy tendies. Improving licensing deals is basically free money, and they're making progress.\n* Playboy.com: High margin DTC ecommerce. It's clear from sales data it's not boomer-centered.\n* Yandy & Lovers: Sexual Wellness products. Ideally, Centerfold will drive even more revenue.\n* Honey Birdette: High quality, high margin lingerie and swimwear. Also important: talent and logistics. Think designers and supply chain capabilities. Rather than outsourcing design and manufacturing of clothes, PLBY can keep the margin to themselves. Ideally, they'll be selling a lot of this stuff as they drive customers to it from Centerfold.\n* NFTs: A team that's proven the ability to launch NFTs and print money. Several successful projects under their belt at this point. NFT transfers provide recurring revenue via OpenSea's \"royalty\" system. Eg, each time an NFT is traded, PLBY gets 10%.\n* Centerfold: They acquired \"Dream.me\" in Oct, which provides the technology and talent of which Centerfold will be built on. The team was acquired in nearly all stock, so their interests are aligned: build a kick ass platform and profit.\n\nPLBY has its fingers in a lot of pies, but what stands out to me is how everything will fit together with Centerfold. **Centerfold will be Playboy's creator platform.** Think Patreon, or OnlyFans... **except not only is there massive revenue potential in and of itself, there is the potential to drive revenue through all the other channels set in place.** Centerfold was announced September, with a launch date of Q2 2022... but on Oct 21 was advanced to Q4 2021, and in Q3 earnings call to \"early December\". More on the Centerfold story later.\n\n## The Q3 Inflection Point\n\nIt's not an easy task to take a dying publishing company with a fading image and come up with a cohesive strategy to revive it, and it's even harder to communicate that strategy to the market... especially in such a murky industry. If you read through the various statements of what PLBY is and its direction, you'll find a lot of major (and minor) pivots along the way in the past year or two. **However, for me, Q3 marks the point at which all the pieces are set and the real execution begins in earnest.**\n\nWhat I mean by \"inflection point\" here is that the strategy is solidifying, and is showing early signs of working. The Q3 call has provided the following:\n\n* the direction PLBY has settled on: high-margin goods, DTC, Licensing, NFTs, and Centerfold tying it all together.\n* how the company plans to leverage their brand\n* revenues are growing, even without Centerfold\n* Centerfold is indeed going to happen, and the launch of it seems promising\n\nBasically, the strategy has been set, is showing signs of working. **PLBY is clearly transitioning from a shell of a brand into a business that will print.** Centerfold will kick this all into high gear:\n\n>\"And then when you couple that with CENTERFOLD, and how this flywheel all works together. CENTERFOLD is not only an unbelievably lucrative financial opportunity for the company. It also provides an ongoing relationship with the talent that we have worked with for 70 plus years. We also have access now to all of those subscribers on the CENTERFOLD platform that will benefit not only the Playboy membership, but also our commerce efforts as well. And so, all of this sort of comes together in this cohesive ecosystem or flywheel. I'm really excited by the potential for what we can deliver moving forward on a recurring revenue basis.\" - Ben Kohn, CEO, Q3 earnings.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, I also think that the messaging and marketing to investors has reached an inflection point as well. Starting now, when investors ask \"what the fuck is PLBY and why should I care\", a clear picture can be messaged. It's shifting from \"a once-dying publishing business that is now a sexual wellness lifestyle brand, brough public via SPAC\" -- it's more like a real business with clear strategy that can print.\n\nFrom the picture above, it's clear that Centerfold is the meat of the sandwich, so let's get into it.\n\n\\---\n\n# 2. CENTERFOLD vs OnlyFans\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OnlyFans felt like destroying their reputation. They've since reversed this, but the damage has been done.](https://preview.redd.it/fn9vs5b488081.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=443883caa4eba6904ea439895730ee94575ae247)\n\nIt's incredible to me that I hadn't heard about Centerfold until a few weeks ago. In fact, that's what got me started down this rabbit hole: A publicly listed company is going to create an OnlyFans competitor? How the fuck have I not heard of this? **I think the potential of Centerfold is barely priced in to PLBY**.\n\n**You probably heard about OnlyFans' ban on sexual content... but did you hear about Centerfold? That's about how priced in this is.**\n\nThe potential here:\n\n* Publicity for the stock.\n* Ability for market to gain exposure to a thriving industry.\n* Massive amount of recurring tendies, which the market loves.\n* Revenue that could easily eclipse the rest of PLBY's portfolio.\n* Putting Playboy back into the zeitgeist and ushering in the next generation of cultural relevance.\n* Memeability.\n\nDig a little deeper, and you'll find the timing could not possibly be better:\n\n* OnlyFans fucked up in August by announcing a ban on sexual content (they reverted this days later). Massive reputational damage, and fears payment processing might be rug pulled.\n* The revelation that the OnlyFans owner is a piece of shit\n* Stories about how OnlyFans does not vet creators properly, allowing a 14yo on the platform.\n* **Content creators want to ditch OnlyFans**\n* Cultural push towards female empowerment and entrepreneurship\n* Can you think of a better company to do this than Playboy?\n* Retarded market offering crazy valuations for anything remotely technology or WFH based\n* Launch date pushed up to early December\n\n## Understanding the content creation business\n\nI know the first thing you retards are going to think is \"durr... Mixer couldn't get market share from Twitch... so Centerfold gonna fail too!!\" Ok, fuckheads, try to wrap your head around this: **There are major differences between the Twitch/Mixer business and the OnlyFans/Centerfold business**. Yes, they both involve content creators and viewers. Yes, they both take a cut of subscriptions. But use your fucking wrinkles and you'll see some key differences.\n\n**There's a reason that \"hey whats your OF\" is a meme, and \"hey whats your twitch\" isn't.**\n\nTwitch/Mixer:\n\n* What creators want: exposure to as wide an audience as possible. More viewers = more ad revenue, subscriptions, etc.\n* What viewers want: a wide array of content. Discoverability. Time wasting.\n* Network effect: **MASSIVE**. More creators = more audience. More audience = more creators.\n* Structure: basically like a TV with various channels\n* Summary: audience draws in creators, creators draw in more viewers, a virtuous cycle.\n\nOnlyFans/Centerfold:\n\n* What creators want: a platform to handle the hosting and monetization of their content.\n* What viewers want: a place to \"consume content\" of very particular creator(s)\n* Network effect: **LOW**.  Subscriptions are driven by creators hustling their OF link. Discoverability is not required.\n* Structure: basically separate \"blogs\" for each content creator\n* Summary: creators draw in their own audience, eg: \"What's your OF link?\"\n\nIn short: Twitch/Mixer business relies on both viewers and content creators joining their platform -- the more of each, the better. Massive network effect, massive moat for Twitch. **OnlyFans/Centerfold relies, almost soley, on content creators joining their platform.** This is all made evident by how the sites are structured (channels vs blogs), and how they are used (think of how you'd find a twitch streamer vs how you'd find an OF creator).\n\n## How PLBY steals market share from OnlyFans\n\nThe key question is: **if you were a content creator trying to sell your feet pics, how do you choose which platform to use?**\n\n## Reputation\n\nYou'd probably want to choose a platform that will pay you, that will allow your content, and that is not owned by a scumbag. Let's compare.\n\nOnlyFans:\n\n* In August, said they were having trouble raising money and with payment processing. As a result, **said they would no longer allow sexual content, effective within weeks**. (They reversed this decision days later.) Imagine having all of your revenue suddenly pulled out from under you. Well, first imagine you made money to begin with. **Massive, irrecoverable reputation damage.**\n* Founder is a shithead. He made his money creating websites that would claim to have links to pedophilia and bestiality. Thankfully, it was a scam: those links went to legit porn sites and produced affiliate revenue. Imagine a person that the world is thankful is a scammer. That's this guy.\n* Allowed under-18s on the platform. Google it. Not a good look, not investable, either.\n* Overall, for better or worse, a somewhat trashy reputation to say you're on OnlyFans.\n\nPlayboy:\n\n* Decades long reputation of free speech, sex positivity, and sophistication.\n* Publicly traded revenue generating company; high confidence they will keep paying your bills.\n* Not much shame in saying you were a playmate. Lots of bunny tattoos.\n\nIn short... would you rather tattoo your ankle with an OnlyFans logo, or a Playboy bunny logo? And which company would you trust to pay you?\n\n## Economics and the 80/20 rule\n\nWhile there are countless creators on OnlyFans, the vast majority of revenue comes from a tiny minority of creators. PLBY just needs to win those creators over. It's not as monstrous of a task as you might think.\n\n>\"More than 300 OnlyFans creators reportedly earn at least $1 million annually, while 16,000 creators make at least $50,000 a year.\" -CNBC article\n\nPLBY can offer creators more revenue, and more revenue streams:\n\n* Offer a higher rev share\n* Allow creators to sell merchandise\n* Allow creators to sell NFTs\n\n\\---\n\n# 3. CENTERFOLD vs Instagram\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Instagram is not a fan of tits and will slam the banhammer.](https://preview.redd.it/t7ya5hz588081.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c7c3392c43b7d2ca4a3ddd6be784c0f18b5d6de)\n\nWith regards to Centerfold, less talked about is how it can function as a nudity friendly version of Instagram, and the potential there.\n\nInstagram has a pretty strict content policy, and models are finding their accounts randomly get deleted due to TOS violations. Tens to hundreds of thousands of followers can vanish in an instant. Tumblr is gone, too -- so where's a girl to go to post her new fake tits?\n\n**There is huge potential in a nudity friendly Instagram clone.** Playboy's motto? \"nudity is normal\".\n\nPlayboy won't have to rely on ads to generate revenue from Centerfold -- they can simply drive traffic to their existing assets. Lingerie. Sex toys. Centerfold subscriptions.\n\nEasy win, here, and if you go around reading DDs about PLBY and Centerfold, you'll find it overlooked.\n\n\\---\n\n# 4. Centerfold Launch Progress\n\nCenterfold was initially announced in September, shortly after OnlyFans made their retarded announcement that they would not allow sexual content. The initial launch date was planned for Q2 2022. Google \"playboy centerfold medium\".\n\nOn Oct 21, Centerfold announced the acquisition of Dream.me, a creator-driven/social media platform. Basically, a clone of Instagram. This acquisition was in all stock, and provided a skeleton for the platform, but more importantly a strongly incentivized team willing to bust their ass to get this thing out there. Launch date was move up to Q4 2021.\n\nSince then, the stock has been marching upwards.\n\nQ3 earnings, as hoped, provided some guidance on how things are going with Centerfold.\n\n>\"In general, the platform is in place and we think what we have assembled today is truly a competitive differentiator moving forward as we think about membership and CENTERFOLD. What we can offer the creative community is something that no one else can offer. And I think that's referenced by the founding creators that we have signed up to launch with that represent in excess of 300 million social media followers.\" - Q3 earnings call\n\nAlso, there's this:\n\n>\"Founding creators on CENTERFOLD will bring in \\~300 million social media followers, and hundreds of millions in existing GMV\" -whossayn on theideafund\n\nAnd this, in response to \"And one super quick follow up for these early CENTERFOLD launch partners, what kinds of creators are in there?\":\n\n>\"So they are huge music stars, to former playmates, to adult stars, to artists, to other influencers, actors, celebrities. It's really -- we've really been overwhelmed by the response from the creator community, and also by the diversity of the creators that we brought in. And I think it's going to truly be something that's unique\" -Ben Kohn\n\n\\---\n\n# 5. NFTs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ \\\\\"Rabbitar\\\\\" NFTs will grant special membership and perks to various things. What, exactly, is TBA.](https://preview.redd.it/ni0dz7l788081.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e06ef1abd961abf6630b7621443b13ea27d0dcd)\n\nI don't personally give a shit about NFTs, but PLBY is interesting in this regard. I'll keep this brief:\n\n* Their run up to $60 was due to an NFT they launched.\n* They've since launched a much larger, and more interesting NFT series: Rabbitars. Sold out quickly, produced $9M in revenue, and will produce recurring revenue (10% on each transfer). No run up this time, though\n* Rabbitar NFT will have an IRL use: it's planned to serve as \"membership\" to various Playboy/Centerfold things. Perks, discounts, live events... a lot of possibilities here, especially if each Rabbitar has different perks. AFAIK, no other public company has tied NFTs to real life.\n\n\\---\n\n# 6. Additional considerations\n\nI don't think PLBY has reach anywhere near its peak in terms of potential market interest, both retail and institutional. It has a lot of solid followers and believers of the stock, though:\n\n* GME O.G. and banana aficionado /u/uberkikz11 is quite vocally bullish\n* Google \"hedgeye PLBY\"\n* Just google the damn ticker and do some DD for yourself\n* PLBY might represent the best ticker in the market to invest in men jerking off and women whoring themselves.\n\n\\---\n\n# 7. \u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f THE BEAR CASES \u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nIt's important to understand Centerfold is not a sure fire thing. There is **considerable execution risk**. I'll lay out what I think are the big \"ifs\".\n\n## The Product\n\n* **Flaccid launch**: It's possible Centerfold, when launched, just sucks. It can come off as a shitty clone of Instagram or OnlyFans, and the market's confidence can be shaken.\n* **Delayed launch**: It's a tech product, and subject to feature creep, bugs, etc. The deadline is extremely aggressive, and it's possible it gets pushed back. However, guidance on release was given days ago, so it's likely. But, still possible.\n* **Exposure concerns**: investability / payment processor / etc. Despite what you might think, PLBY has a strong E.S.G. vibe to it, so I think it should be OK. They are >50% female employees (I think), and for better or worse, they're very vocally woke. I think Ben Kohn does a great job walking the line between investable and \"proper\".\n\n## The Policies\n\nThe biggest risks, in my opinion.\n\n* **Shitty creators**: Though the pool of initial creators has been talked up by management, but not defined.  It's possible they actually suck. Imagine a line-up of \"unconventional beauty\". Eg, \"body positive\" woke bullshit that is attempted to be marketed as the new wave of sexual wellness. While this is possible, I think it's unlikely. Ben Kohn knows what's up.\n* **Content policy**. On a recent interview on FOX, where the host was an asshole, Ben Kohn stated there will be no \"porn\".. or orgies on their airplane. However, the term \"porn\" was never defined... and he was talking with FOX, so he had to be careful what he said. In my opinion, if they allow nudity but no masturbation, that could be bad. If there's no scat, probably less of a concern.\n\nI'm somewhat worried about these given the amount of woke-speak of this company, but I'm confident management knows where the dollars are:  \n\n\n[Content policy is up in the air. Requires faith.](https://preview.redd.it/skj0dm4988081.png?width=1353&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd4cabddc5d8399212e098288ab8e8399a68e93c)\n\nEach notch up on the \"debauchery\" scale of porn likely captures less and less revenue. For fun, that scale might look like this:\n\n1. See through clothes, costumes, etc\n2. Frontal Nudity\n3. Pussy close-ups\n4. Light bondage\n5. Sucking on dildos\n6. Insertion of dildos\n7. Butthole stuff\n8. Penises\n9. Penises inside of things\n10. Aggressive BDSM\n11. Cum\n12. A lot of cum all over and inside of various things\n13. Pee-pee and poo-poo\n14. I don't even know. Feel free to comment!\n\nThe risk is they land somewhere too low on the scale to capture significant revenue and interest from OnlyFans-esque creators. Again, I trust their judgement... but I'd feel much more comfortable knowing the exact policy before launch.\n\nOn the plus side, there's likely an 80/20 rule here. Going up the the scale will uncapture less and less revenue. So, even if they go pretty light, there's plenty of opportunity. And, it should be noted that even if they go very light, the Centerfold vs. Instagram thesis would still hold quite strong. Creators need a home to post nudes.\n\n## Insider Selling\n\nThis last one you might have heard about if you follow the stock.\n\nSome people made a big deal about a recent filing where the CEO and other insiders were granted a bunch of shares to sell. Rumors went flying that a ton of shares were about to get sold.\n\nIt's my understanding this is a nothingburger and par for the course. Yes, they got their shares... per their employment agreements or whatever. No, there is nothing there that is saying they will sell.  They *can* sell, but management has been clear they are in this for the long run.\n\n\\---\n\n# 8. Technicals\n\n## Historical IV\n\n[IV far lower than it was due to NFTs, despite PLBY having more catalysts right now.](https://preview.redd.it/rl85o1ca88081.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=95310a4d17798ac12f268f3947529968bace9ff3)\n\nGiven an advertised massive catalyst coming in early December, the IV30 sits at around 95%. I believe this is a massive mispricing.\n\n## Price Action\n\n[Annotated events of interest](https://preview.redd.it/csr85xqb88081.png?width=1817&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3099ef24563c813f6405421dbf46fca09104990)\n\nHere's summary of price action this year. Notice the creep up after Centerfold was announced. I personally think this is bullish and the start of an upwards channel as we approach early December, but what the fuck do I know.\n\n## Gamma\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Modest gamma](https://preview.redd.it/76uf800d88081.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=b661e18dac8583348a92644e0a3e0c0aaf084f9b)\n\nGamma on this one is nothing too crazy, though as a percentage of daily volume it is significant. A rush into options would likely push the price up somewhat, but I doubt a squeeze is in play.\n\n\\---\n\n# 9. Positions and Price Target\n\n## Positions\n\n[Shares and calls. This is the way.](https://preview.redd.it/36zeksle88081.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad0d3855d682b58c9a264248afbcdc888fb3b296)\n\n* 2000 x Shares: Safest bet. I'm happy locking these away and looking at them a year from now.\n* 60 x Jan $35 calls: Anticipating a run up towards Centerfold launch (early December), giving a little extra time for bumps.\n* 80 x Jan $40 calls: More aggressive, and hoping to capture some IV gain here.\n\n## Targets\n\nI'm selling if IV30 runs above 200. Not worth that much risk. I'm trimming at $50, much more aggressively at $60, and out if hits $70. This is my personal preference, based on my personal risk tolerance and what I hope to gain, and is not investment advice.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nRead the bear case, please. And do your own DD.\n\n\\---\n\n# 10. TLDR: \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6 = \ud83d\udc30\ud83d\ude80\n\nPLBY has loaded a lot of fuel into a rocket. OnlyFans, by being fuck-ups, also contributed some fuel to the rocket. So has Instagram. When Centerfold launches, PLBY will be igniting that rocket. If you are unaware of the company turnaround, and that Centerfold is launching soon, then it is likely not yet priced in. Despite all this... IV30 sits at 94%. I like the stock, and I'm jacked to the tits with shares and Jan $35 and $40.

A Netflix clone full of hits like Co-Ed Confidential would certainly play. HBO and Showtime have come close, GoT had the magic for a while. So did  Californication. Kaloopy tv on Pluto pulled for a minute before they went corporate and cleaned up the place to try to make investors happy - despite having a Baywatch channel. Full Moon was promising for a minute, but they started cutting all the nudity out of their softcore and leaving only the goofy plots. And as much as I love the goofy plots, the shows weren't intended to be viewed this way so it feels off. You can do it, Deep in the Valley absolutely captured the zaniness of these softcore films without any nudity, but you have to plan for it and be true to the spirit.\n\nThere's a market for people who want some story, some goofy comedy, so gratuitous nudity, and general camp. Not everyone wants to see incest porn or dv/da. True, you can't complete with pornhub, but that's not your market. Hershey's doesn't compete with cheesecake factory, but people still like getting a candy bar sometimes.\n\nI think if pbtv were to go all in on high quality shows with some sex, like GoT or Californication, and low budget but awesome films like \"cheerleaders ninjas from outer space\", they'd have a winner.\n\nSometimes I just want to see spaceships and titties, or knights and dongs, or dragons and ass cheeks.\n\nAnd that's not to mention the r-rated/x-rated music video market.

They put the ass in class. I'm a bit old and cheap, so I prefer my porn generic and free, but I ASSUME the main drive to sites like OF isn't just getting to focus on a specific model, but more on focusing on a specific model willing to cater to your kink(s). If Playboy sticks to the \"tasteful\" nudity then the gain nothing and lose the only things the used to have going for them: good writing and professional grade photography of model worthy women.\n\nTo be blunt, a site that mainly has tasteful nudes isn't going to bring in money.\n\n2) The number one concern with hosting sites of any form is moderation. Pornography doubles down on difficulty, especially if concern #1 is in play. Monitoring hosting sites is expensive work.\n\nLet's just say that while I know nothing about the OF offense of allowing a 14 year old to post, but it wouldn't surprise me if she legitimately fell through the cracks. People love pushing the boundaries and mods always have their hands full.\n\n3) If Playboy doesn't succumb to deadly #1, and they learn from what appears to be a (mostly) successful OF monitoring system and dodge #2, then what makes them stand out from the crowd? The won't be going back to home turf and being classy, they won't be a place to find only professionally picked, groomed and photographed models, and since this isn't a magazine you have tucked away in the bathroom that guests might accidentally see, there's really no purpose for high quality articles/comics/etc to be on the site, and high quality writing would clash with the \"any model is ok\" mentality.\n\nBasically, if they can't fall back on that 50's \"Playboy\" image that Hugh banked off of, then what is their niche? What edge to they have to make people switch from OF?\n\nMy best bullish outlook: if creators really do hate OF, and their isn't anyone else out with the recognition behind them already, then Playboy at least has that. It's still a brand people know.\n\n\nTl;dr: Playboy was known for trying to be classy and sophisticated. OF, and any other amateur uploaded content seems best suited to be hyper focused on kinks. Weird specific kinks and sophistication are on opposite ends of the spectrum. The only way I see this being huge is if Playboy drops the act and allows creators the freedom to make full blown kinky porn AND creators want away from OF bad enough to where the brand recognition of Playboy is good enough reason to make the switch.\n\nDon't get me wrong, sex sells and this is probably a decent investment, but I wonder if they can drop the Playboy image long enough to realize that the Playboy image only needed to exist because magazines are physical objects and people were bound to find them. You could display a Playboy in the bathroom and most people wouldn't bat an eye. Through a Hustler out there and you looked kinda trashy.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "1)\n\n> If Playboy sticks to the \"tasteful\" nudity then the gain nothing and lose the only things the used to have going for them: good writing and professional grade photography of model worthy women. To be blunt, a site that mainly has tasteful nudes isn't going to bring in money.\n\nThey've largely already weened off of this model anyway. They would not be losing anything.\n\nAs far as \"tasteful nudes\" goes -- Centerfold will be creator driven. They'll create their own content to suit their subscribers however they see fit -- as long as it's within bounds of the TOS. If, like you fear, the TOS is something like \"frontal nudity only\" -- there's still a decent amount creators can do with that. But, yeah, it's a risk.\n\nI also think that IG's strict TOS and deletion of accounts, and how Tumblr is now gone, will make Centerfold a safe haven for this \"middle ground\" type of content.  It could even work alongside OF. Eg, models need a place to \"tease\" their potential fans, and CF might be the place for it.  Even if the model charges $0 to \"subscribe\" to her feed of frontal nudity, it's a net win for everyone. CF gets eyeballs (ad revenue, and driving traffic to their other assets), the model gets leads to her paid subscription feed of choice (OF, or other).\n\n2)\n\n> The number one concern with hosting sites of any form is moderation.\n\nAgreed. [OnlyFans got criticized for this recently.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57255983).  It's an exposure risk for investors as well. This hasn't killed OF, but it's made them a risky thing to invest in... and investors aren't exactly lining up at the door.\n\nIt's a very real risk, but I have faith PLBY is aware of this and will have the tools in place.  I also think it's only a problem once they are successful, as early on there's not much of an incentive for malintent if the site is relatively unknown or low traffic.\n\n3)\n\n> Basically, if they can't fall back on that 50's \"Playboy\" image that Hugh banked off of, then what is their niche? What edge to they have to make people switch from OF?\n\nI covered this in depth in the DD -- there's a whole section mr. boomer-that-actually-read-Playboy.\n\nI don't think content creators rely on the platform, or the brand of the platform, being highly recognizable in order to get revenue.  They just need the platform to host and do payment processing, and they need to trust the platform works and will pay them. In OF, the platform doesn't bring the audience -- the creators do.\n\nThe \"image\" of Playboy doesn't hurt in this regard. They have a reputation for free-speech, sex positivity, and presumably will be able to pay out. Models can feel better being on that type of platform -- again, not because of their presumptions about the \"taste\" of the audience -- but because they can trust it.\n\nAnd about what Centerfold's \"niche\" will be. That's entirely up to all the creators that sign up. Remember: It's creator driven. The idea is to empower the models to have a \"business\" and earn recurring revenue. Centerfold will not approve/deny based on if they fit the classic \"playboy image\" or not -- they just need to abide by the TOS. So, ideally, there will be a growing crowd of creators that serve different niches. How varied and crazy those niches end up being will depend on the TOS.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m still not understanding what will make creators choose Plby over OF.
