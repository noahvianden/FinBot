{"title": "CASH SECURED PUTS, is this anyone's cup of tea?", "selftext": "I haven't seen a lot posted about a strategy I have started using with my IRAs and basically it's an offshoot of a wheel play.\n\nI have reserved a portion of cash in our largest IRA and have dedicated it to doing nothing but writing Cash Secured Puts.  I try to head off having stock put to me but if it does, I'll just sell calls until it's gone.\n\nBy writing the puts, I'm not gambling on direction so much as if I was just buying puts & calls and hope I've read the chart right and they make money.  As much as I'd like to hit a 10,000% home run, I am happy with my 1-2% gain on investment each week.  I only choose weekly expirations and generally trade fairly large value per share stocks like AFRM, NET, AMD, CAT, NVAX & so on.  I'm doing a lot of chart reading and do my best to pick stocks that are on the rise or flat so that on Friday I close out the positions for pennies and rinse & repeat.\n\nAt a rule, I write OTM and occasionally Just out of ATM puts.  These large priced stocks are typically a little volatile and I prefer to give them some room to go against me, but not so much that my returns are really small.  Other than looking at lots of charts, this method still allows me to goof around and not be tied to my computer all day.  Friday is typically spent closing positions, rolling into new positions which is what I did today.\n\nNot counting any early closes to manage a dog, the premium I gained today is little more than $6,900 on about $240K of cash tied up in the puts which is about a 2.87% return for the week on the gross value of the stocks.   As a rule for myself, I always close positions on Friday and then open new positions expiring the following Friday.  We've all seen weird stuff happen after the markets close on a Friday, news gets released, and your Call/Put that closed worthless suddenly slaps you in the face.\n\nDoes this sound like something that folks would be interested in discussing further and perhaps sharing ideas about methodology?  I'm always open to turning up new possible stocks to look at but obviously, not looking for anyone to tell me/you/us that a specific stock is the new hot thing.

Asking them, number one, to do the 4680. Giving them all what they need for them to do and committing to buy all volumes without any restriction at the right price. So they are building the larger scale in house, they are dragging competitors into a similar form factor so that Tesla becomes the industry standard and within that standard they are going to capture all the largest volumes because at the same time the largest manufacturer and the largest buyer. So anyone competing with Tesla needing a battery will have to buy a 4680 at a significant premium on what Tesla pays internally for it because they will have the largest contract with manufacturers and they will have the largest manufacturing capability in-house. So that's a very very beautiful integrated dominant model and so the least thing I'm concerned about is the gross margin of Tesla on battery systems, on battery packs, on powerwalls, and things like that because they will have ... this industrial advantage that ... is like 10 - 15 years in the making and that will be like indestructible in the future so that's the part of the story I find very exciting. It's not something you're going to see. You're going to see like impacting the new slow our numbers in the short term but in 2025 the reason why you'll see us claiming that Tesla will maintain a significant margin gap against other car manufacturers.

The company trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of more than 150 times, according to FactSet estimates, compared to an average of 22 times for Wall Street\u2019s blue-chip S&P 500 index as a whole.\n\n\nAs a result, only 9 per cent of growth-orientated US mutual funds managed to outstrip their benchmark in October, the lowest monthly beat rate since July 2002, according to Bank of America. That, in turn, depressed the beat rate for the year so far. Only 17 per cent of growth funds are ahead of their benchmark, putting 2021 on track for its worst annual \u2018hit rate\u2019 since 2016.\n\n\u201cIdiosyncratic stories that \u2018make or break\u2019 fund performance seem to have occurred more frequently in 2021 than in previous years,\u201d Christopher Harvey, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said in a note. \u201cThis speaks to index concentration and mega caps as well as meme stocks. The meme stock craze highlights the growing influence of non-institutional trade flows and new portfolio risks for both long and short investors.\u201d\n\nActive managers struggled in October\nThe trading frenzy that enveloped companies like video games retailer GameStop and cinema chain AMC earlier this year captivated Wall Street, as millions of retail traders loosely organised on social media pumped up their shares to stratospheric heights and exacted multibillion-dollar losses on hedge funds that had bet against them.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s review into the event showed that the number of individual accounts trading GameStop rocketed from about 10,000 a day at the start of 2021 to almost 900,000 at the peak on January 27.\n\n\nHowever some fund managers see Tesla as the \u201coriginal\u201d meme stock, thanks to the fervent belief of its investors in Musk\u2019s plans to revolutionise several industries beyond carmaking and even pioneer commercial space travel.\n\nTesla accounts for one of the biggest chunks of the S&P 500 index, meaning that the combination of its October rally and hefty weighting in several benchmarks also hurt fund managers who are not focused purely on growth or tech stocks.\n\nMost active managers underperforming benchmarks in 2021\nOnly 32 per cent of traditional large US equity funds beat the market in October, the worst rate in four months. That depressed the year-to-date beat rate to 38 per cent, according to Bank of America analyst Savita Subramanian. Harvey at Wells Fargo estimates that Tesla\u2019s rally alone damped performance for US mutual fund managers by about 0.46 percentage point.\n\nNick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, warned that Tesla, like the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, was likely to continue to \u201cmarch to their own frenetic drummer\u201d for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\u201cThe only reason they are trillion-dollar assets is because they have a 10 per cent chance of being a $10tn asset one day,\u201d he wrote in a note. \u201cEvery tweak to that probability calculation still means outsized value creation or destruction\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Volatility is the natural result, and it will not fade quickly.\u201d", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like they\u2019re not ready for TSLA to be 33-50% of NASDAQ", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This is crazy to me that growth oriented funds must be underweight Tesla to underperform like this.

Made some gains in the past two weeks.  \n\n\nIt all started when I heard about the Gamestop fiasco. I pretty much started investing after the larger squeeze, so as you can imagine, I ended up bagholding and lost money. Now, after discovering options, I became slightly addicted and lost around 30k over the course of the year, transferring little by little from my bank account to RH. Pic related.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0c5d1ytnox71.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4a6f43a71df2d9ae0a3fd513487d2598bb963e6\n\nNow, I am down to my last 4.4k, what do I do with it? I gamble it on options of course! Little did I know, Hertz made an announcement to purchase Tesla vehicles. I just woke up to go to work and seen Tesla was rising. Here's the purchase and sells for that.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sydwpsu5qox71.png?width=2166&format=png&auto=webp&s=6978d7dbef473cf6bff7c69067c43d41e291276d\n\nShit man! I had some fucking money! I made all my losses back plus an extra 10k or so. I finally accomplished something in my life! Why would I want it to end there though? I want more.

I'm high on a rush of gambling so I needed to continue. This put me at about 60k or so total. I took profit where I could and thats the way you should always play it.\n\nIt's not enough though.

{"title": "Easy way to understand options.", "selftext": "Edit: this is for people who don\u2019t understand how options work or the concept. It\u2019s a simple version, with many other factors to consider. But this is the general concept of how it works. There are a lot of good experts on here that can help better with strategy and technical analysis. Do not take any examples as ways to strategize. It\u2019s just made up examples. \n\nBackground: I\u2019ve been trading options for over a decade and I have no financial or business background. I learned before it was popular online and I am self taught. So I\u2019ll be explaining it the way I was able to understand it. There are better ways, but this is what helped me. I turned $1700 into $500,000 back in 2014. \n\n\nOptions are basically lay aways for shares. So let\u2019s use a house as an example. \n\nIf you bought a house for $1M and I come and offer you $1.2M (the strike price). The catch is I have a certain amount of time to decide if I want the house. You cannot back out but I\u2019m not obligated to buy it. So what\u2019s in it for you? I offer you a $10,000 deposit that you get to keep no matter what happens. Now what? \n\n\nI hold a CONTRACT between us that costed $10,000 and I give myself 6 month expiration date to decide if I want it. So now I am hoping the housing market goes up above $1.2M so let\u2019s go over a few scenarios. \n\nBenefit? I profit on a $1M house as if I own it even though I only paid $10,000. \n\nMARKET RISES\n1. The housing market goes up and it\u2019s now worth $1.4M within 3 months giving me 3 more months on the contract. So the contract is worth at least $200,000 because if I forced you to sell it (exercise). So I can go around and sell the contract to someone else and say \u201clook I can force them to sell for $200,000 today, so give me $200,000 + $20,000 for the 3 months because it could continue to rise. So they pay $200,000 to receive $200,000 in equity and $20,000 premium because the contract still has more time. Meaning if the housing market goes up to 1.5M The new owner of the contract can now exercise the contract (option) and profit $80,000 or 4X their investment. \n\n MARKET DIPS\n2. The housing market dips and the house is now worth $800,000. I would owe you $1.2M so I just wait the 6 months and hope it rises or I sell my contract $10,000 at a loss maybe like $3,000 to someone else hoping it jumps back up. Worse case if the time comes to an end i lose $10,000. \n\nMARKET RISES BUT NOT MUCH. \n1. You do not have to hit the price you bet to earn money. So if the market hits $1.1M within 1 month since there is 5 months left. I can sell the contract to someone else for more now thst it\u2019s more likely to happen. So I can get $20,000 even though it didn\u2019t go over $1.2M. I\u2019m selling the contract to someone else and letting them hope it goes up. \n\nNow translating to stocks. \n\n1 option or contract is 100 shares per contract. \n\nSo if you buy 6 contracts for apple to hit $300 you have 600 shares on hold for you. Every dollar above $300 you earn $600. Because you only owe the owner $300 so everything above is yours. \n\n\nSo your call is you betting it goes up, and if you do a put, you are betting it goes down. Either way you will only ever lose the initial deposit or purchase price of the contract. \n\nStock example I bet Nvidia will hit $360 by feb22 so I needed to pay the owner $15 per share as a down payment. So it was $1500 for the 1 option. Now the closer it gets to the price I said it would hit the price of the contract goes up because it\u2019s now more likely to happen. \n\nSo for example if I said your house will hit $2M by 3 months you wouldn\u2019t believe it would happen so you would accept a lower deposit say $1000 now imagine something happens and 1 week later your house jumps to $1.4M. Since it\u2019s more likely to happen I could sell the contract to someone else for $2500 because it\u2019s not as crazy and I\u2019ve made 150% in 2 weeks. \n\nYou don\u2019t hold a contract till the date, you flip the contract to someone else when you make money on the deposit. \n\nHow are they priced? The crazier your bet the cheaper it is. Tesla at $2000 within 2 months is probably impossible so it would be cheap. Tesla at $2000 by 2024 is more likely so it would cost more. \n\nI turned $1700 into $500,000 from options at 19 back in 2014. But I\u2019ve also lost $100,000 in a day when fedex dipped when gas was low because they buy gas in 6 month intervals. So their earnings were low and the stock dipped. With not that much time left I lost it all. So if it\u2019s your first time, give your self some time in the expiration date .

Maybe a penny to keep things simple. So everyday your option decays in value by a penny and as expiration approaches, theta will increase. Theta really increases if stock moves closer to your option (this whole example assumes you bot deep otm options for Leaps, because ITM leaps are usually outside of your price range).\n\nTLDR, leaps don\u2019t increase in value as much as you think even if the stock moves in the way you projected.

{"title": "$COIN is a Sleeping Titan with a Trajectory for the Moon", "selftext": "Alright, Coinbase announces Q3 earnings this Monday, and I couldn\u2019t be more bullish.\n\nTo start out, the company has been absolutely printing money, with a current P/E ratio of 33.50.  If you take just their most recent Q2 earnings, their P/E ratio is 13.56.  Compare that to any other rapidly growing tech stock, I\u2019m talking Square, Snapchat, AirBnB and other \u201cpopular among youths\u201d stocks with P/E ratios of 100+.  Yes, this is largely in part to Coinbase absolutely crushing Q2 earnings, but at the rate things are going, I don\u2019t think that earnings report was an anomaly.\n\nAccording to multiple websites I found with a quick google search, Coinbase is now the most downloaded app on the App Store and second on the Play Store.  I\u2019ve seen the new ad campaigns all over the place, which is always a good indicator of a company becoming more established.  With customer acquisitions skyrocketing and the cryp\\*o market as a whole reaching all time highs, I see no reason Coinbase can\u2019t demolish earnings the same way it did last quarter, perhaps even harder.  But this brings me to the one critique many have of $COIN: it follows the cryp\\*o market too closely.  For example, if bi\\*coin goes on a run, you can expect $COIN to follow it, and vice versa.  But this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, nor does it have to be permanent.\n\nThe cryp\\*o market as a whole has been on a tremendous bull run since its inception (for the most part of course), and with serious attempts at integrating cryp\\*o into day to day life, I don\u2019t see this changing anytime soon.  Bi\\*coin has dominated the cryp\\*o space, and much like $COIN, other cryp\\*os have a habit of following the price of bi\\*coin.  However, other cryp\\*os are starting to emerge with rocketing market caps, each one making bi\\*coin a smaller piece of the overall pie.  With alternative coins like  diverging from bi\\*coin, the cryp\\*o space is likely to become more diverse as time continues, much like the stock market is today.  This will hopefully make for a healthier, less dominated market that will be less volatile as a whole.  So if bi\\*coin has a rough day, other futuristic magic internet money can cushion the blow if they\u2019ve diversified the market enough at that point.  Besides, bi\\*coin, despite having harsh swings, does majorly trend upward, so even if bi\\*coin stays at the top,  $COIN following the cryp\\*o market might not be so bad.\n\nSo, to sum up what\u2019s been stated, Coinbase has been growing rapidly, is extremely profitable, and has been majorly underestimated by investors across the board with a track record of demolishing expectations on earnings and customer acquisition expectations.  The only caveat for some being that it follows the price of a volatile market too closely, which is hardly a bad thing given that market\u2019s history in the long term is very green, and hopefully won\u2019t be the trend for the stock forever anyways.\n\nBut do you want to know why I REALLY believe in Coinbase? Well, put on your tinfoil hats, because things are about to get fringe.\n\nTo start, why has Tesla recently become a trillion plus dollar company?  Is it because of their profitability?  No, their P/E ratio is over 350.  Clearly it\u2019s because of the prospect of what\u2019s to come.  The eventual decline of oil as the most environmentally conscious generation grows up and the world\u2019s energy becomes renewable.  Everyone drives a Tesla, and lives on a clean, smog free planet.  When you buy into Tesla, you\u2019re not just buying into a car manufacturer, you\u2019re investing in the prospect of what\u2019s to come, and what Tesla represents as a whole: a bright optimistic future, and a revolutionary macroeconomic change.  So, if this is the case, what does that mean for Coinbase?\n\nWell, I can see $COIN becoming a similar thing; a stock that not only is tied to a growing, healthy company, but as a way to buy into the overall long term trend of cryp\\*o becoming mainstream.  Since Coinbase is the premier means of dipping your toes in the cryp\\*o seas, buying the stock means you see the value in the cryp\\*o market in the long term.  $COIN could grow to represent the anticipation of the cryp\\*o market growing, just the same way I believe $TSLA represents the anticipation of an eco-friendly renewable future.  In the same way, it paints a bright optimistic future: the death of banks as cryp\\*o rises and everyone races Teslas to compete in the annual Do\\*ecoin Cup.  And investors eat up investments that emulate a bright future like candy.  Take weed stocks, the companies aren\u2019t too great in their fundamentals, but, again, they represent a bright, utopian future for pot enthusiasts: weed being mainstream.\n\nBut Coinbase still diverts from these companies paving the way for a utopian future in one major way:  IT PRINTS MONEY.  So even if you don\u2019t believe my philosophy that investors buy into companies because of what the perceived success of the company means as a whole (bright, utopian future on the horizon), the company is still phenomenal in its fundamentals.\n\nI\u2019ll be watching Monday\u2019s earnings with my whole 6 shares (shallow pockets boohoo) and a bag of popcorn in hand, as I watch the next trillion dollar company climb to the moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPost earnings damage control edit:  Well guess I'll hold that.  The gay bears win this round, but I'm here for the long game.  With Q4 already setting records for cryp\\*o, I have no problem holding the shares for another 3 months at least.  \n\nNot every rocket flies straight.\n\nCarry on fellow $COIN believers.

The crash was so bad that it wiped \\~90% in market cap from the stock market ( 6,030 to 864 DJIA).  On just one day known as Black Tuesday, 12% was wiped out.\n\n[9 Year Bull Market \\(record at that time\\) - Up 500&#37; from nominal valuations](https://preview.redd.it/emd8289wwrx71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d613b0de1c2436887244c1d7f553415ced53025)\n\n[Bank Failures - By the end of the decade, more than 9,000 banks failed](https://preview.redd.it/jbd5uh59yrx71.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=23185e4217a60f1f7ec36f6736e0cf872c9ad0bd)\n\nThe failure of banks led to the reduction in spending as well as the reduction in lending.  This exacerbated the situation, leading to an prolonged economic depression.\n\nWorkers were then laid off in droves.  Repossessions and evictions were taking place, forcing people out of their property.  Families had to travel in what was known as the great migration at the time, to seek new opportunities.\n\nTariffs were increased to help grow revenue sources via international imports.  Yet, these tariffs turned out to restrict economic activity due to the economic waste caused by the tax wedge.\n\nFurthermore, environmental conditions, in the form of a drought, contributed to the worsening of the crisis.  Supply chains were rattled by dought and lack of soil-preservation led to the 'Dust Bowl'.  It would take a decade for the supply chain to fully recover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The Greatest Depression***\n\nSimilar in trend, duration, rate of growth, and percentage change, the current market resembles the peak-point of 1929, just prior to the epic crash.\n\n[Today's Stock Market - NASDAQ Chart - Up 500&#37; from nominal valuations](https://preview.redd.it/hex19u7xwrx71.jpg?width=498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42e1880e3fbb03cd4ab6338e28c7b28756b53e52)\n\nToday, we see similar conditions as we saw in 1929.  Environmental crisis (climate change and CO2, leading to global spending on these policy agendas) is leading to lost corporate profits.  The COVID-19 pandemic led to record spending via the fed balance sheet and record corporate bond purchasing.  Inflation has not been this high \"in a very long time\" as Treasurer Janet Yellen phrased it.  Unemployment is slated as being around 5% (down from 20%), yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics still uses an '\\*' (asterisk) symbol to define the change (it still assumes that the layoffs from COVID-19 were temporary).  This faulty unemployment percentage is a systemic fabrication of the current crisis.\n\nLabor force participation is at an all time low - meaning that most people that would be classified as unemployed, cannot be, because they are out of the workforce:\n\n[https://www.cnsnews.com/index.php/article/national/susan-jones/100450000-more-100-million-not-labor-force-14th-straight-month-no-job](https://www.cnsnews.com/index.php/article/national/susan-jones/100450000-more-100-million-not-labor-force-14th-straight-month-no-job)\n\nEstimates are that real unemployment is actually around 20%, and actual productivity from raw employment is still stifled by the unique switch to remote-only work at most companies.  Few companies are turning profits, and those who are are expected to contribute to taxes and now environmental spending on climate change.\n\nFurthermore, we have not seen the market cap to GDP ratio as being this high.  This implies that valuations are out of ordinary.\n\n[Market Cap to GDP Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/g0d3zrpcurx71.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57d5a8ad72c55f41804aabbf54d28e8d82ae8c74)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Gallery of Pictures from the Great Depression***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Newpaper reel 1](https://preview.redd.it/4lk2maxeurx71.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7972f92d25344ef4eb34a633da203799cd673608)\n\n[Newspaper reel 2](https://preview.redd.it/bk20ix3iurx71.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=243f18bc701e1cc56ef1053c15addda8ffef3fe8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Frenzy to Document Trading Volume](https://preview.redd.it/s2bv7u3kurx71.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a87aed2b452dcc735e0251c77809cc91bdee23fb)\n\n[Run for the Banks](https://preview.redd.it/9bpst8rkurx71.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddb45e237e83ae18c1e1fe919fa884fa0f13fd96)\n\n[Acute portfolio losses](https://preview.redd.it/h99rl7flurx71.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69ea100a178e578c6e125d73269e7820f8087f0f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***TLDR; Conclusions***\n\nToday's stock market is shown to have similar numerical features to that of 1929, just prior to the crash that contributed to the Great Depression.  The economy faces similar headwinds, such as unemployment, lack of labor force participation, poor output due to supply chains, environmental crises, yet this time we also have record money printed, record valuations, and egregious inflation.

{"title": "$COIN will crash after earnings", "selftext": "TLDR: Earnings are not going to be good.\n\nCoinbase *seems* like it would be a good play. Earnings last quarter were huge, coin trading is hyped right now, coins are at all time highs, $COIN advertised P/E ratio is very low, etc are all contributing factors to the bull run that $COIN is currently experiencing. Coinbase earnings are releasing the 12th, and it is my opinion that COINBASE earnings will be far lower than expected leading to a large dump.\n\n**Reason 1: Coin prices don't make Coinbase money, but volume does.**\n\nTo put things into perspective, I calculated Coinbase's quarterly trading volume in USD. The numbers speak for themselves. (Source: [https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange](https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-exchange)):\n\nQ1: $337,726,593,729\n\nQ2: $456,237,466,410\n\nQ3: $324,071,319,552\n\n**Reason 2: Q2 Earnings were great! Or were they?**\n\nCoinbase's Q1 income before taxes was $996,666,000. After taxes was $771,463,000 (-$225,203,000)\n\nCoinbase's Q2 income before taxes was $868,881,000. After taxes was $1,606,349,000 (+$737,468,000)\n\nUsing the ratio of Q1 volume/Q1 income = Q3 volume/Q3 income, Q3 income before tax will likely be around 736,403,266 after tax (956,367,877 before).\n\nUsing the ratio of Q2 volume/Q2 income = Q3 volume/Q3 income, Q3 income before tax will likely be around 475,226,528 after tax (617,177,309 before).\n\nHow did this happen? Coinbase received a one time tax credit relating to their IPO. Notice the 12% drop in income even though volume was up 35%. Following this trend, Coinbase will need a substantial increase in trade volume to see any growth.\n\n**Reason 3: Dilution**\n\nQ1's earning report shows that there were 126,996,000 diluted shares (79,373,000 basic) used to calculate their EPS. Q2's earning report shows that there were 248,147,000 diluted shares (204,728,000 basic) used to calculate EPS. If this trend continues into Q3, the earnings per share data could be disastrous.\n\n**Reason 4: Insider selling**\n\nOn November 2nd, the director at Coinbase sold 77,562 shares of $COIN at prices ranging from $326.28-$344.33. The total sold amount was $25,855,002. ~~Insider selling 10 days prior to an earnings report is probably not a good sign.~~  As u[/MilesPower/](https://www.reddit.com/user/MilesPower/) pointed out, this was automatic so it may be completely normal.\n\nThanks for reading.
