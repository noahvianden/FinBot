The agency granted approval on the condition that Biogen conducts another clinical trial.\n\nThe agency\u2019s decision was a departure from the advice of its independent panel of outside experts,\u00a0[who unexpectedly declined to endorse](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/biogen-suffers-setback-after-alzheimers-drug-fails-to-win-support-from-fda-panel-.html)\u00a0the drug last fall, citing unconvincing data.\u00a0At the time, the panel also criticized agency staff for what it called an overly positive review of the data.\n\nAt least two other FDA panel members have resigned as a result of the agency\u2019s decision on the drug. Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman and Washington University neurologist Dr. Joel Perlmutter have also submitted resignation letters.\n\n\u201cI was very disappointed at how the advisory committee input was treated by the FDA,\u201d Knopman told Reuters. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to be put in a position like this again.\u201d\n\nFederal regulators have faced intense pressure from friends and family members of Alzheimer\u2019s patients asking to fast-track the drug, scientifically known as aducanumab, but the road to regulatory approval has been a controversial one since it showed promise in 2016.\n\nIn March 2019, Biogen pulled development of the drug after an analysis from an independent group revealed it was unlikely to work. The company then shocked investors several months later by announcing it would seek regulatory approval for the drug after all.\n\nWhen Biogen sought approval for the drug in late 2019, its scientists said a new analysis of a larger dataset showed aducanumab \u201creduced clinical decline in patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s experts and Wall Street analysts were immediately skeptical, with some wondering whether the clinical trial data was enough to prove the drug works and whether approval could make it harder for other companies to enroll patients in their own drug trials.\n\nSome doctors\u00a0[have said they won\u2019t prescribe](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/06/02/alzheimers-community-awaits-fda-vote-on-biogens-aducanumab.html)\u00a0aducanumab because of the mixed data package supporting the company\u2019s application.\n\n*\u2013 Reuters contributed to this report.*", "id": "nxgxtn", "created_utc": 1623420778.0, "score": 967, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m glad to see Drs holding to their oath.

This lead to classification of pain as the \"fifth vital sign\", which was widely panned by physicians, the American Pain Association being the notable exception. Over the years, various metrics and scoring systems were put in place holding physicians accountable for controlling pain. This obvious issue with this is that the only feedback is the patient's subjective pain score, making it exceedingly simple for a patient wishing to divert narcotics to endorse any of the many non verifiable pain complaints, and submit a complaint or poor survey score if the opiates are not given. These patients will list every non narcotic med as an allergy, forcing you to either deny them pain meds and miss the metric, or give narcotics. As more physicians caved to the pressure, it became the expectation among patients to receive narcotics for most complaints. Personally, I was \"called into the office\" many times early in my career for not prescribing enough. For example, one year it was a CMS core measure to give IV opiates within an hour of patient arrival when a long bone fracture was suspected. This needed to be met even if the patient's pain was already well controlled, and ran contrary to prevailing evidence and CDC guidelines at the time. Missing core measures can result in withholding of enough payment to bankrupt an entire hospital system in some cases so it is taken very seriously by administrators. \n\nIt goes way deeper than this. For example in around 07-08 CMS mandated reformulations of certain drugs that resulted in increased overdoses and deaths.

{"title": "Inflation is actually in the norm for the decade", "selftext": "There is a lot of talk about inflation and how it is supposedly spiking and very high. The May 2021 CPI reported yesterday shows a 5% jump YoY in all categories with an apparently HUGE jump of 28.5 % YoY when looking at energy.\n\nHowever it seems that most people, and the media, are forgetting that 1 year ago, May 2020 was when the whole economy was depressed due to the lockdowns.  For energy in particular, in May 2020 the oil futures unprecedently went negative! \n\nThe apparent YoY spike is actually due to a base effect, or that the denominator of your calculation is smaller than usual.  You can take a look at the 20-year monthly CPI increase here: [https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm)\n\nFor all categories, in May 2020 the CPI YoY increase was 0.1% . To smooth over the Covid crash, we can look at the CPI increase between May 2021 and May 2019. Mathematically this is the geometric average and it comes out to what you'd expect: 2.5%  . As you can see on the graph, the 2.5% YoY is actually quite average for the period of 2016-2019. This means that the current value of the CPI is roughly what we would have got had there been no covid and the usual inflation growth.\n\nFor energy, which apparently had the huge spike, the case is even stronger that this is simply a base effect, indicating the economy is returning to normal. The YoY increase on May 2020 was -18.9%. If you take the geometric average: square root( 0.811 \\* 1.285) you get an average increase of ONLY 2% . I say only, because the average CPI increase over the last year has been as high as 8-9%. So 2% increase is actually close to nothing.\n\nSo what is the take away? Inflation fears are overblown and the Fed is right to say that this is a temporary effect. We are returning to normal, it just seems much more because we've been locked down for a year and prices were depressed due to the lockdown. In particular, I would load up on tech/growth stocks which took a hit due to rising inflation.

I don't personally tend to put too much weight into the Beta, P/B (I prefer earnings), specific cash flows (like investing and financing).  I like to look at the overall balance sheet to see if a company has cash to 1. cover their debts 2. make acquisitions and/or 3. invest in R/D and marketing to grow their market share.  Nvidia has a very strong balance sheet and their cash + cash equivalents far outpace their current liabilities.  This means they do have freedom to use their cash to either expand their business or pay a dividend.  \n\nVolume can be a good technical indicator as it gives you a feel for the overall short-term sentiment of the market, but I don't find it useful for fundamental analysis where I'm looking to hold a company for more than 3 years.\n\nThe P/E ratio being big is not necessarily a good thing - it is currently 85 for Nvidia.  This means for every 85 dollars you invest, the company will earn 1 dollar per year.  Obviously it's a moving statistic that changes with the price of the company and also with earnings increases/decreases, but it's a good snapshot in time.  Negative P/E means the company isn't profitable at all.  A low positive number, like 20, means the company is earning more money per dollar you invest in them.\n\nCompanies that expect to grow their earnings aggressively in the future will usually trade at a less favorable P/E ratio, because people are anticipating those higher future earnings.  The market is 'pricing in' the future growth of the company.  If the company continues to grow, you can see the stock price growth maintained, but if their growth stagnates then you can very quickly see the stock price collapse back towards a smaller P/E ratio (see what happened with Netflix this last quarter).\n\nSo, from what you've done so far I can decipher that Nvidia is profitable and their profit is growing pretty rapidly.  They have a strong amount of cash which I like.  Their current valuation is very aggressive, with a lot of future growth priced in (you see that in the P/B and P/E ratios).\n\nThe question to be asked, then, is will Nvidia continue to grow at a rate where their current valuation continues to expand.  To answer that, you would need to look at their business and the industry.  What sectors are Nvidia currently leading in?  Will those sectors grow?  Will Nvidia be able to expand market share in those sectors, or do they have any sort of competitive advantage in them that allow them to dominate?  Will Nvidia be able to maintain their profit margins, or do you see competitors rising and undercutting prices?  \n\nThese are all complex questions, which is why investing can be tricky.  You can see by the recent price increase in the stock that the market in general really likes the future prospects of the company.  Be careful with using market sentiment as your guiding principle, though - things can turn very quickly and you won't be out of a bad trade before the professionals will be.

People will put up with a lot of stuff being more expensive, but I think food is a different beast. We all need to eat - we can't put it off like a new car or a new deck. If food gets too expensive either the fed takes action or there are riots. \n\nSo, when/will food prices inflate in a meaningful way for the American consumer?\n\nThe way that we keep our supermarkets stocked year round - especially for many fruits, berries, and vegetables - is by using a precisely calibrated global network of food growers, shippers, and distributors. Just when one season ends in one part of the world, another season begins elsewhere and fills the gap. \n\nRight now we're seeing some food shortages and price increases. This is in part domestic yield loss, but predominantly because we're in the global growers phase of production and distribution for many products - and as with most things, global goods are delayed in shipment along several bottlenecks.\n\nStarting in July, the food cycle switches from international to predominantly domestic sources for many fruits berries and veggies, a large percentage of which are grown in California. \n\nhttps://www.pickyourown.org/CAharvestcalendar.htm\n\nOn the one hand, domestic crops solve the issue of international shipping. However, they still run into the enormous bottlenecks of not having farm workers and not having truck drivers. \n\nBut most worryingly, they also run squarely into the worst drought in a thousand years - a drought that is already wreaking havoc and, barring a miraculous storm, has no end in sight. \n\nAnd the drought isn't limited to CA - much of the south and Midwest and in drought conditions, to the detriment of crops of all kinds. \n\nSeems to me the stage is set for a food dilemma come, say, August/September 2021? Alternatively, if the drought doesn't utterly decimate crops this year, but continues unabated into next year, then, I guess, raincheck to August/September 2022? \n\nIn either event, who wins and who loses, stock wise, if there is a major spike in food prices? Presumably interest rate increases will cause everything to correct - but some companies will be hit harder due to food costs and some presumably will profit. \n\nThoughts?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent point!

Commercial EV represents a vast untapped market \u2014 estimated $260b right now \u2014 and Proterra currently serves HALF of the market (front runner status). \n\nThe Biden admin has already made it very clear that investing in this sector is one of their central priorities \u2014 Biden had a virtual tour of Proterra HQ to promote the infrastructure bill not too long ago. Commercial EV has been largely overlooked in favor of flashier companies like Lucid or Tesla, but it has the potential to be really big.

Anti-trust turned out to be a massive nothing-burger. ANT IPO shouldn't matter, even if it's worth nothing their stake was maybe only worth $77B at it's peak. It shouldn't have lost $250B in market cap because of that.\n\n TCEHY is just a cash compounding machine that is currently cheap vs historical valuation.\n\nTME got caught up in the Archegos blow up, it was overvalued during that big spike but now it's about 10-15% undervalued IMO. They own 20% of UMG which is now valued much more than when they bought that stake (using PSTH as benchmark). They have also fixed their anti-trust problems by having Universal and Sony license music to their competitors - which sounds but isn't, they have a very dominant market position all the same.\n\nI'm also loading QQQ but that is pretty boring and only thesis is interest rates are going to trend down.\n\nRecently I bought financials because rates were going up and they were mispriced vs a higher interest rate environment. I sold most of my financials last week except for WFC as I think that stock is still undervalued because of sentiment related to their fuckups over the last ~18 months.\n\nMy reason for selling is that I think in the short term the 10Y which is the main benchmark rate for banks financial products is going to trend down, atleast until about 1.25%. This has a significant impact on their valuations.\n\nI bought energy when the oil prices started to come back in November and sold out my of my positions when oil hit my PT of $70.\nThese commodity super-cycles are anything new and the last time they came around a lost an awful lot of money betting around these levels so once burnt twice shy.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5742540955543518}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34604403376579285}, {"body": "I know that \u201cthe best time to invest in ETFs is now\u201d and all, but for a new investor such as myself, given how overvalued the stock market is right now, is it best to hold off for a while or does the saying still apply?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": " No. Time in the market beats timing the market.

You think it\u2019s normal to pay $15 an hour with 22 billion in profit. In what world are you living in that you rationalize this stuff? Why because you have 1k invested in their stock you defend a company who exploits. And you somehow justify that it\u2019s not a big deal that pay that little in taxes. These are facts bro.

Things are interconnected in that way... only when you educate yourself and learn about economics, finance, technology will you see how important it is that companies act responsibly and laws/regulations are in place to protect us. You have to learn to look at things on a boarder scale. If you are really so bright you\u2019d be able to do that and if you still had a good argument it would be a lot different than it is here.

Since then Buffett has made $8.5B in total dividends. They will pay out $672M in dividends to Berkshire this year on an investment of $1.3B.

{"title": "Why RKT is My #1 Investment (and it should be yours too)!", "selftext": "TLDR:  I have found no other company in the world where the risk vs. reward is better to invest in, and I've been investing for almost 14 years now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, I want to show my position as of today.  71,000 shares in RKT.  While everyone has been selling for the past month, I've been buying.  My average price is somewhere around $21.  The price shown in the picture below is where the price ended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfq404cnik471.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d84568cbf375e7d163e44346bb34eeb4bd874cb\n\nNow, I don't yolo like other crazy people trying to get rich quick.  I'm an investor, and I typically have 3-5 stocks at a time.  Currently my second largest position is a combination of BRK.b and BRK.a.  I also have other positions like XOM and KO currently for inflation reasons.  Just so you believe me when I say I know what I'm doing, below are my returns for the past 3 and 5 years, and you can see I'm fairly consistent.  In fact for the past 10 years you would see the same average returns, but Schwab doesn't show a 10 year performance number, so 3 and 5 is all I can show you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gqdsqegf4m471.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc27429bed44f37e2156c2551e791e8d04041757\n\n**COMPANY BACKGROUND:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRKT is probably the most grossly under valued mid cap stock I have seen in years.  The last time I felt so strongly about a stock was 2010 when TSLA became public.  I told my wife that Tesla would be worth 10 times the IPO value in 10 years if they didn't go bankrupt, and I figured there was about a 10% chance they'd go bankrupt in the first couple years.  I bought Tesla around $19, and sold a year and a half later for about $24 to pay off my house.  There wasn't a lot of movement, but it was a gain, and I wanted to do the responsible thing creating a life where I was debt free.  I planned to replenish the position over the next 6 months.  Unfortunately my timing couldn't be worse.  A month after I sold, the stock skyrocketed to $85.  Later, it then rose to $135 a month or two later.  It was no longer the deal it has once been, and I never felt that it was worth chasing.  Biggest mistake of my investing career.  I point this out because you just never know when things will explode, but if you know the company well enough you can determine that it's an inevitability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) used to be known as Quicken Loans, which was established in 1985.  When the company decided to go digital, they changed their name to Rocket Companies.  Rocket Companies has only been around since 2016.  Quicken Loans grew at a 25% compound annualized growth rate (CAGR), and before the company went public, Rocket Companies had a 16% CAGR between 2016 and 2020.  With a 16% CAGR, the company doubles in size every 5 years just for reference.  Below is the S-1 document showing their CAGR before they became public in 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince Becoming public, RKT has had some impressive growth indeed.   Income grew 526%, and revenue grew 187%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2k8f3xhrik471.png?width=2248&format=png&auto=webp&s=62d09fbb033af6fde28719273cc9ea2da7580c35\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntvln76sik471.png?width=2252&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c99d8deea18a00861a434042ec3f0bb06e09188\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter reporting the 2020 year results, the stock skyrocketed of course.  This only lasted a few days before it came back down settling right back to where the stock came from.  The stock was roughly $20 or so before the results, and after it rose somewhere near $45 from a pump and dump situation.  The price then fell for about 2-3 straight months back down to where it came from.  The primary reason for the price dropping from something that was closer to a realistic price target back down to the low 20s was the belief that interest rates were going to rise in 2021-2023 due to inflation.  That was going to kill home buying, and this was \"as good as it gets\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE WAR WITH UWMC:**\n\nTo add to the industry problems, UWMC started a war with RKT.  This war was started because RKT was taking market share in every direction.  UWMC is a great company, but it's a distant second in overall lending origination as you can see in this list below of the top lending companies for 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iukjdhnvik471.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=de37da1ec33a9f1f36d59507836c47e99139ab87\n\nBy the end of 2020, Rocket Companies had 8.9% of the entire housing loan origination market in the US.  They continued to grow that market share in the latest reported quarter to somewhere in the mid 9% range.   In the beginning of March, UWMC issued an ultimatum that all realtors who use UWMC are not allowed to use RKT anymore.  That means one month (March) in Q1 would be affected by this new ultimatum.  Both UWMC and RKT declared victory within the first week of March.  We would have to wait for Q1 earning to come out to see who was really winning the war.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ1 earnings came out, and here are the results:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3bsmsvzik471.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d53584a6f687dc76ef89ccc1d9263f0657c9ba84\n\nFor a direct comparison, here is Q4-2021 which was not affected by the ultimatum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzxh7mjjrl471.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ea5ea1ef7adf4988ac1bee1527db90d4526f8c7\n\nThe loan volume for RKT increased nearly $3B from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021.  Below is a chart showing you the loan volume for UWMC in that same time period.  As you can see, the loan volume DECREASED by over $5.6B.  A winner has been declared, and it means that RKT is taking market share even quicker due to the ultimatum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8c3rm1rlrl471.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5d0f2d391afd2f9ffc0d61a5da03538c1aca379\n\nNow, this entire war was started to try to stop RKT from taking market share from UWMC.  All UWMC had to do was read a little bit of recent history, and know that competitors tried to do the same thing when Amazon was starting out.  Many vendors refused to use Amazon because they took a fee, and felt they could make more money per sale if they were independent.  Unfortunately those vendors eventually learned that volume can make profits go up faster than premiums with less sales.  Amazon of course won that war, and RKT will do the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe primary focus for Rocket Companies is very clear when it comes to growth--gain market share.  They are not the least bit worried about profits because their Direct to Consumer lending is the largest in the US by a long shot.  This plays a key roll in the war with UWMC.  UWMC dropped their interest rates (effectively buying down the interest rate for the customer) to try to keep agents with them when they issued the ultimatum.  Of course, RKT followed suit to match them, and the war is causing the entire industry to see their margins tighten.    Margins for wholesale are roughly 2% for both RKT and UWMC, after dropping the interest rates 50bps.  Direct to Consumer margins are over 5%.   Well, UWMC doesn't do direct to consumer lending, so they are fighting a battle they can't win.  They can continue to buy down interest rates until they go negative and have no profits if they wanted to.  Rocket Companies will continue to always be profitable because a larger part of their business is Direct to Consumer with higher margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3klqg3xajk471.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=79191aae6c0fd945540479c518d2dd173bcf9fad\n\nIn light of this war, Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner have come forward stating their new goal is to be the largest wholesale lender by 2023 (2 years).  They are already the largest overall lender, and the largest direct to consumer lender.  They are winning the market share battle, and numbers don't lie.  It comes at a cost of lower margins which reduce profit.  Keep in mind that Amazon wasn't profitable for 20 years.  The fact that RKT is hugely profitable is amazing as they continue to acquire market share in the industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MORE THAN JUST MORTGAGES:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket Companies is a FinTech play.  RKT has been testing their technologies in other businesses, and have determined that many of them translate to other loan industries.  The one with the largest prospects is automobiles.  Rocket Auto has been testing their products for the past year or so, and are happy with the ability for the technologies to transition into the auto retail marketplace.  Rocket Auto recently formed a strategic partnership with AutoFi, a leading software provider in the automotive retail industry with a network of more than 2,000 dealership partners.  This is not live yet to my knowledge, but during the first quarter, they sold over $360M in volume, and are on track to do over $1B this year.  Rocket owns their own titling company called Amrock.  They make up the bulk of the \"Other income\" line in their quarterly/yearly reports.  At this point, the auto sales only generated $13M in profit for Q1 2021.  There is no website launched for Rocket Auto yet, and it'll take awhile to integrate the technologies in with AutoFi, but this is a huge market which will grow at an exponential rate in the next couple years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g42p4awgjk471.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee95ca12421e164975651eed63e82e7f7b3d4c0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6u5n7wqkjk471.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=e138940c684d71aa219005ba55336ca51d2d6b4c\n\nAlso, Rocket Mortgage is going international.  They are beginning their expansion in Canada, so this is a very big market which will show lots of growth for years to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**INFLATION FEARS:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas inflation increased?  Absolutely.  But it has had very little effect on interest rates.  Interest rates increased at the beginning of the year and were expected to increase for the next 2 years at a very fast rate.  The fact is that analysts guessed wrong.  Fed Chairman has stuck to his word and has not increased rates, and doesn't expect to until after 2023.  Interest rates did increase very dramatically at the start of the year, and then it stopped increasing at the end of March.  In fact, interest rates have decreased nearly 0.3% in the past 3 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41c46f2ojk471.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1a7b2dd29fcc14e632ba789d1348be642a25be3\n\nThis is going to cause refinances to pick up again slightly, and investors know it.  RKT has been a notoriously shorted stock since it IPOed because hedge funds believed that it was as good as it gets in the middle of 2020 when they IPOed.  For 2 quarters in a row, RKT proved every naysayer wrong growing more than anyone expected, and becoming more profitable than anyone expected.  EBITDA in 2020 was roughly $11B, and the company's market cap sits around $41bln currently.  They are making more money than they can possibly use, so they issued a special dividend last year of $1.11 which was about 5% of the value of the stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow, you can see the short interest dropped to roughly 8% in March when they reported blow out earnings.  It then increased in May, to roughly 17% after earnings showed the gain on sales decreased do to the war with UWMC dropping interest rates half a percent, and slightly less refinancing occurring due to interest rates rising at the beginning of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznsz1brjk471.png?width=2154&format=png&auto=webp&s=679e86c24f24c924e9eac3ea68fc30a5b8b5cde7\n\nAs interest rates have started dropping again, you can see the shorts are leaving the stock.  Roughly 7.5 million shares have come back available in the past two weeks, and interest to borrow has dropped due to lack of demand to short the stock.  Interest rates dropping will have all lending companies out performing expectations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzj988ptjk471.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13f6ef5e156d0a2e2e6286a09468f2ec0aca563\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, it doesn't matter if the housing market does incredibly well over the next 5 years or not.  RKT has made it clear that their goal is to have 25% market share of the mortgage industry by 2030, which is 3 times their market share compared to last year.   They will gain market share even faster in years the housing market is bad, and their retention for customers can't be matched.  The industry average return customer is 20%, and RKTs return rate is over 90%.  Their process is simple, digital, can all be done through an app or their website, and has made the lending process infinitely easier than traditional loans.  They make billions of dollars a years, have $1B set aside for share buybacks if they decide that's in the shareholders interest, and has a better balance sheet than anyone else in the business.  You pay a slightly higher multiple than you would if you purchased another company like UWMC, but their growth is nearly double UWMC, and they are taking market share away from UWMC, so it's worth far more than any other lending company.  In general, all lending companies are undervalued currently, RKT just happens to be the next \"Amazon\" of lending, and it's hard to put a price on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe the company is worth around $40 a share currently which is about 100% above where it is trading now.  By 2030, the company should be worth worth around $200B-300B which is roughly  5-7 times current evaluation.  It's not the 10 times in 10 years that I felt Tesla was worth in 2010, but there is zero chance RKT goes bankrupt, and there was always a chance Tesla could in the first few years.  Read Elon Musk's biography and you'll see just how close he was to bankruptcy twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't tell you when the stock will go up.  The stock price isn't reflective of the company currently.  Sometimes they can stay disconnected for awhile.  But I learned my lesson when I sold TSLA to pay off my house.  You never know when a stock is going to explode, you just know that it's an inevitability.  While everyone else is running for the next pump and dump on Reddit to hopefully gain 100% in a week (I admit I do this as well although I never put too much in), I'd rather invest with the majority of my money.

BUT I also am seeing, and the news is reporting, that the housing  market is cooling not only due to lack of availability but due to lack of AFFORDABILITY. The housing market is inflated, there's no denying that point. Outside of stocks, real estate and housing is absolutely the most inflated asset. The only reason it has been able to inflate this quickly is due to historically low interest rate levels.\n\nYou're taking a very limited view by only considering what is happening right now and only considering what is happening in the real estate market. The economy is clearly entering a cooling off period and it's much needed. Though I am of the mindset that not only will this be a cooling period, it will be a large correction. Debt is at an all time high for individuals, businesses and governments. Interest rates cannot go lower and we're extending ourselves to razor thin margins. As inflation takes hold, interest rates will increase, spending will decrease and those unlucky enough to not have fixed rate debt will likely default.\n\nBuying new homes in an economic downturn is not a reality for the majority of individuals. Because Rocket Mortgage focuses primarily on individuals, this is where we enter into a problem. Investors will see just that fact and ignore the reality that mortgages are typically 30 years and RKT will at least maintain their revenue, though they may not grow as quickly. Once the market recognizes the stability of RKT and it's currently depressed share price, they will invest, but that isn't going to happen tomorrow.\n\nWhat may happen within the next few months is a stable price appreciation partially fueled by short coverings and partially fueled by a pent up demand for homes that was put on hold during COVID.

Wholesale has better rates than retail. There's something to be said for why. In truth it's a combination of 1) wholesale lenders having a slimmed down model and less fixed cost, and 2) the ability of mortgage brokers to shop around rather than having a captive customer. Usually, retail companies like Rocket who know they have the customer trapped, know they can charge higher rates... So they do. After all, why not?\n2. When there are higher interest rates, people become more and more price sensitive, and so they go to wholesale mortgage lenders. The market also becomes much more purchase heavy, which favors wholesale mortgage brokers.\n3. Wholesale generally, and especially UWMC has a speed advantage in time to close. UWMC's is 14 days to close. The industry average is 52 days, and RKT's is 30 to 45 days. UWMC's investment in its technology, due to being a pure play mortgage originator with a forward looking ceo, has allowed it to reduce its cost to originate to be the lowest of any company, and it's not even close. He can price out other mortgage companies while still being profitable, and you can look at HMPT's earnings call if you think i exaggerate. They are saying that they will be break even this upcoming quarter.\n4. The cost to originate for UWMC is estimated to be 50 BPS across fixed and variable cost, and UWMC is using that to leverage a price war (It's a naturally occurring cycle of highs to lows, as people want to keep volume, before gain on sale margins even out to 110-180BPS which is the normal times gain on sale margin). Their currently price matching any lender up to 35 basis points from June 8 to June 20. You can also see the impact this is having on RKT as they are estimating a 100 BPS margin for the growth channel in their mortgage originations which is TPO and not retail.\n5. You say RKT won, but they didn't. They just didn't win the broker war, and it's simple to see why. But i'll break it down. They gained 7% market share sequentially, Q-o-Q. That's not what I want to see after the last 3 years of growth and Q-o-Q growth. Add to that, that the ultimatum took effect on March 15th and the reporting period ends March 30th, and the period it took effect is only 15 days out of 3 months. Tack on the fact that UWMC let people close out their loans AFTER the ultimatum if they had any in the pipeline, and Q2 was not any measure of anything. You also forget that ROCKET TPO is not JUST brokers, but rockets correspondent channel (Think builders, credit unions, and community banks), and just yeah. No contest, look to Q3 guidance which you're glossing over.\n6. They guided down, and significantly so this upcoming quarter. I wonder why? To the tune of roughly 17-20% if I recall correctly, and that's why they tanked so hard. Because markets are forward looking. UWMC is guiding UP, with a BPS of 75-110.\n7. The reason UWMC missed by 2B is because interest rates mooned in the period (And if you look at RKT's earnings call or UWMC's they say they hadn't expected that), and UWMC's time to close is 2x-3x faster than anyone else, so they finished up their loans but demand had softened a decent amount. On the other hand, other mortgage originators could coast because they were still doing loans from 1-2 months back. They won't have that ability now. You can look at WSJ's interest rate tables if you don't believe me about the interest rates.\n8. UWMC is constantly innovating and trying to do better, including recently bettering their partner points, increasing the types of loans they give (Like manufactured homes, ARMs, More Jumbo). They also had turned off JUMBO and FHA loans in March 2020 out of a need to be conservative, whereas others didn't. They have had those back on partway through the first quarter now. I guess my point is that the CEO has stated they will be the number one mortgage originator by 2024 in a  recent article posted. This is 1 year forward than he initially estimated (2025).\n9. RKT is mostly refinance focused. I'm sorry, it just is. UWMC is more purchase focused. With refinance volume from years in the future pulled forward, that's important to note. It's a cyclical business. There's a counter point here, and it hedges against higher interest rates, and generates consistent income, but I'm not going to say it and let you tell me what that is. It doesn't make up for the loss of GOS volume but it cushions it.\n\nThat's from the bread and butter mortgage business.\n\nRocket Auto: Car companies who finance usually give the best rates, especially to the much wanted high credit borrowers that RKT will covet. Furthermore RKT doesn't want to go the very high interest rate loans that very low credit people can only get. This somewhat limits their volume here, and therefore their profit, from the negligible volume it does compared to its bread and butter. Don't get me wrong, it'll expand and it will be strong growth, but everything is relative.\n\n/u/OneofOneViper", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "First, I can tell you are a UWMC fanboy just by what you've written without you stating you are such.  You're going to need more months to learn how to really study companies it appears.  Almost everything you have written is speculation, not facts.  I base all information on numbers, not what the CEO tells me or hypotheticals I conjure in a euphoric state.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  In general, wholesale does tend to have better rates historically, that is across all companies.  But margins are better on direct to consumer.\n2. This isn't true in the least.  There is more room to negotiate rates on the direct to consumer side than there is wholesale.\n3. 100% correct about time for wholesale.  RKT's time is actually 21 days last quarter whereas UWMCs is 17 days.  RKT sets expectations at 30-45 days because every state is different and direct to consumer loans often can be slowed down by the consumer not submitting information quickly when requested.  Either way, on the wholesale side, there is roughly 4 days different.  This is the only metric I have ever found which UWMC prevails at when compared to RKT.  RKT has stated on conference calls several times they are working on lowering the time frame and making it easier for agents since their partner division (wholesale) has just recently been focused on for growth whereas before they were focusing on direct to consumer.\n4. Absolutely incorrect. Look at the forecast for UWMC for Q2.  They are expecting between 0.75 and 1.10% gain on margins when they made 2.19% in Q1.  RKT doesn't give out a division between gain on sales for wholesale and direct to consumer as an outlook, but you will see them divided out when they report earnings in Q2.  Their gain on sales is expected to be 2.65% to 2.95% which is 3 times the expectation for UWMC.   This is roughly 1% lower than last quarter, the same as UWMC.  Both companies are taking a hit due the war that UWMC started.  This is more of a problem for the entire industry since the top two dogs are fighting for market share.  But the numbers prove UWMC is losing market share to RKT, and RKT is gaining market share when compared to all other competitors.  The smaller lenders are really the ones that are suffering .\n5. It's a pipe dream to believe that UWMC has won.  You're holding onto desperation.  Your CEO stated in an interview that Q1 earnings would prove they won.  They didn't.  now UWMC share owners are hoping it will show up in Q2 because the CEO came out and stated they will do better this quarter than last quarter.  RKT never once said they won't do more wholesale business this quarter than they did last quarter.  They said they would do slightly less business overall. That is because the direct to consumer originations are dropping off as refinancing slows down.  Go look at the numbers, last quarter they actually increased sales when UWMC dropped significantly on the wholesale side only.  Also if you think that realtors didn't leave UWMC long before the deadline, you're sadly mistaken.  Many left as soon as the ultimatum was announced so it definitely played a part into Q1 earnings\n6. RKT did guide down, you know who else did?  UWMC.  Not only did they guide down, but they didn't even hit their estimates on revenue or profits last quarter.  RKT outperforms every earnings report.  Technically last quarter they matched the \"profits\" bottom line number, but UWMC threw a wrench into projections when they issued the ultimatum.   That caused interest rates to drop for the consumer to gain market share.\n7. UWMC CEO has an excuse for everything.  The mooning of interest rates didn't affect RKT nearly as much as UWMC, and the 4 days difference in time to close on the wholesale side is no excuse to explain the miss.\n8. UWMC isn't a bad company, there just happens to be a better one.  There is no one innovating more than RKT in the lending business.  While UWMC is working hard on the front side of their technologies to make them more user friendly and easier to use, RKT has mastered and finished the front end.  They are now working on the backside to speed things up which is great across all business models including autos.\n9. RKT \\*was\\* refinance focused.  You have to keep up with the times.  This was when they were so focused on growing the really profitable side of the business direct to consumer.  It's only in recent years that they've entered the wholesale business and they are growing incredibly fast and that has become their primary focus.  Arguing that RKT is refinanced focused moreso than UWMC is an opinion you can't win.  The numbers say 75% of UWMC originations last quarter were from refinancing.\n\nI'm not trying to harp on UWMC, I think it's a good company.  I wish RKT's CEO would step up and explain some of these things so I didn't have to look so hard into the numbers to figure out what happened each quarter.  Without a doubt UWMC's CEO are concerned about share holder value in the short term. RKT's CEO doesn't give a rats ass about what investors think in the next week, month, or possibly even year.  He knows that in 8 years from now, his mortgage business will be 3 times the market share it is now.  The auto business is peanuts right now, but It won't be forever, and it will help to make profits when the housing industry isn't selling houses.  That's about the time when UWMC will cut their dividend like every other lender does when there is a recession or slow down in the housing market.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Well done \ud83d\udc4f", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06081871688365936}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "5) Yeah, sure dude.

UWMC met their expectations for who would sign the addendum, and their the best in the business on closing times and ability to price competitors out. They also have a fortress of a balance sheet. Not to forget ROCKET counts Auto in their origination amount, even if it's negligible. \n\n  \n6) You're just lying about UWMC guiding down on originations, their guiding up. It's literally in their 2nd quarter outlook  in earnings... And i keep telling you the ultimatum took effect on March 15th, but reporting for first quarter ended March 30th. I'll say it again. \n\n  \n7) It's not 21 days, I've already told you that. And i've already told you cost to originate is much less for UWMC so interest rates affect them less. They also have more experience dealing with purchases which take longer, and are more complicated than refinances.\n\n  \n8) I disagree on the innovation side, sorry. At least on the pure play mortgage origination side.\n\n  \n9) They still are, refinance focused. Sorry. And these numbers were before UWMC made their ultimatum, which we'll see coming to effect this quarter. I don't need to win your opinion regarding the refinance focus, I just need to point to your own numbers (you know, the ones you cite).   \n\n\nRKT did 36.96/313.41=11.79%. That means 11.79% of their volume was purchase for 2020.\n\nUWMC did 42.99/182.82=23.5% of their business as purchases. This is with Jumbo and FHA turned off, or it would have been higher. \n\n  \nThis is from your graph! \n\n  \nAlso, you're pointing to TPO as the purchase savior, but you forget that margins are much lower there. But, wait then.... GASP. If Refinances shrivel up, their going to have to focus on purchases which TPO does the majority of for them, but GASP not only is it much lower margin, but they have lost access to a significant amount of brokers to work with. \n\n  \n9) The dividend is safe, only 6% of the shares are class A shares with an economic interest. Meaning a dividend. That equates to 41.5M without the buyback reducing that. The other 94% are voting shares held by the owner, and his brother. The payout ratio is tiny, and they have a fortress of a balance sheet. Their forbearance rates are also half the average/other lenders because they focus on high quality loans. \n\nWhy would I invest in a company with a forward P/E ratio of 12.44 where the consensus EPS forecast is 1.64: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rkt/earnings), and then expect explosive growth.

April metric shows 4% inflation, if this increases more or stays at this level, we will likely see important hikes in the reference rate.

In fact, there is a scenario where the repo market collapses due to lack of treasury bonds because congress gets stuck in gridlock and can\u2019t pass any meaningful bills to issue new debt.  The fed is buying $120B in treasury bonds a month which is $1.44T a year.  We\u2019re running out of treasuries to buy as a country.  If hedge funds take too much risk and go bankrupt, it could actually cause a reverse scenario where everyone wants their cash back and cash becomes incredibly valuable, and interest rates drop negative.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting this is going to happen, but we live in a time where everything is being artificially moved.

In fact, many of the gas upgrade technologies still discharge NOx and SOx to the atmosphere, along with a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide.  The most (profitable) RNG sources are intercepting methane emissions that would have previously been discharged to the atmosphere (that's where the \"cow farts\" comes into play, it's actually the methane from their manure as it breaks down), cleaning them up, and then using them to offset fossil-derived natural gas.  So you get multiple things coming into the mix at once, first you have the reduced emissions of burning natural gas vs. diesel.  Then you layer on top of that the offset from the impact of renewable vs. fossil-derived fuel, on top of the utilization of something that was previously emitted to the atmosphere. If you get really industrious, you can capture the Carbon Dioxide and find a way to sequester it and further enhance the impact. This all gives you an actual net emission rate that is below zero and is one of the few renewable techs that can boast such a thing.

As with many start-ups, RIDE announced they would run out of money by end of year (very common for start-ups to raise 6 months out from end of cash burn) but they'd still be beginning production in September.\n\nAs per Forbes, the short interest is over 31%, with plenty of people betting this company is over.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/06/09/with-31-short-interest-beware-of-short-selling-lordstown-motors/?sh=1704adae6c47](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/06/09/with-31-short-interest-beware-of-short-selling-lordstown-motors/?sh=1704adae6c47)\n\nI don't think it's over. The company is backed by GM, announced they're raising a new equity round, and they're going to be part of the future of EV's in the United States along with Tesla. Just like CLOV / GME they're targeted by short sellers, with Hindenburg writing a short memo just like they did on CLOV (and we all remember Citron on GME lol).\n\nAlso, thanks to u/kazaii21 :\n\n* \"21-25 June: Lordstown week. Lordstown motors is inviting institutional investors and analysts to their factory in Ohio to drive the truck. It shows transparency. I don\u2019t see why you would held such event if you have nothing good to show. Retail investors can participate online.\n* 25 - 28 june: Russell 2000/3000 inclusion. LMC has been included in the Russell 3000 and could be included in the Russell 2000 as it was a $1.4 B company on May 8th. Steve Burns, CEO and founder of LMC was the previous founder and CEO of WKHS. When WKHS was included to the Russell 2000 last year, the stock went to $3 to $21 between beginning of June and beginning of July 2020. So i guess Steve Burns knows about it. Steve Burns own 25% of the shares and didn\u2019t sell any yet.\"\n\nOnce this company announces their new equity backer, this thing could really pop. It's the future of EV's in America.\n\nTo the moon. And to everyone saying they're going to run out of money....that's what WSB said about AMC and GME until everyone's mind changed.\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE - I was dropped as a child. I also can't read or write.\n\nUpdate #1 - Y'all can keep hating, but the stock up 5% since I posted, and going to continue going up\n\nUpdat2 #2 - We're up over 7% today!!!! To the moon.

{"title": "$CRSR DD or why you should park all your cash in this crazy undervalued tech company", "selftext": "Sup apes. Your favourite fruit is back for some sweet DD ($CRSR) that will catapult your shitty portfolio into the stratosphere. \n  \n\n\n  Ever heard of Corsair?\n-\nThey are the boys that fill your neat gaming PC full of dope parts. Not only are they a giant in this industry since their inception in 1994, they also got publicly listed last October for a measly **$15.**\n\n-\n\nNow, why should you care?\n-\n\nCorsair has all the properties that can make it THE stock of the decade for WSB - think AMD before they went from $4 to $80, now this time it's from $30 to $300.\n\n-\n\n**1.DeepF#ckingValue**\n-\n\nTheir current market cap stands at **3.12B** on **1.92B sales** and **148m profit.** That\u2019s insane in itself, their current market cap is minuscule and should be at least 5x their revenue. They are making cash hand over fist every quarter and are already a crazy growth rocket. \n\n\n \n\n-\nAs per recent earnings article: *\u201cMajor industry tailwinds seem to be helping Corsair achieve strong growth rates. In the first quarter, its overall revenue grew 72% year over year to $529 million. The company also continues to see improved profitability, as gross margin jumped from 25.5% a year ago to 30.3%.\u201d*\n\n\n-\n**2.Tiny float**\n-\n\nThey IPO\u2019d with only 91.95 million shares outstanding and a float of 88.4 million. This entire sub could outright buy the company out. Jokes aside, this isn't moving a 500m share giant like NOKIA, but rather like your beer filled kiddiepool.\n**3.Cheap Options**\n-\nFlat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.\n\n**4.Low Risk** \n-\nAlways arguable, but This company just IPOed, is healthy and makes tons of cash. No risk of bankruptcy looming around the corner, or shares being diluted if it his 50$ or 100$. YOU CAN SAFELY PARK YOUR YOLO'd CASH without the company blowing up any second.\n\n**What else?**\n\nAnalysts on SA have a big raging one for CRSR. (link in comments) and there is a very possible breakout about to happen + earnings coming up in August.\n\n\n\nNow what company fits better for millions of Gamestop apes? A Gaming company that will fill every GameStop with little ram sticks and gaming gear. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n** TL:DR ** $CRSR is a good bet that could safely triple your money... Or blow your brains out with 3-6 months calls.\n\nObligatory: I LIKE THE STOCK. In for 5k and adding more this month.\n  \n[More notable DD from last week.]\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsc45n/crsr_huge_volume_breakout_buy_wall_stalemate/", "id": "nxhh7d", "created_utc": 1623422259.0, "score": 1751, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 535, "comments": [{"body": "Good DD, but your numbers are a little off.

DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\nThe Company generates revenue from marketplace and logistics services provided to merchants. Revenue is recognized as the Company transfers control of promised goods or services to its users in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company considers both the merchant and the user to be customers. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services by considering if it is primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, has inventory risk, has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. Based on these factors, marketplace revenue is generally recognized on a net basis and logistics revenue is generally recognized on a gross basis.
