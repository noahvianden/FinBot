{"title": "I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!", "selftext": "We have all heard it! -- \u201cTime in the market beats timing the market\u201d\n\nAt the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It\u2019s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was\n\n**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**\n\n**Analysis**\n\nFor this, let\u2019s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you\n\na.\u00a0Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year\n\nb.\u00a0Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year\n\nc.\u00a0Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year\n\nd.\u00a0Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \\[1\\] \u00a0\n\nFor analysis simplicity, let\u2019s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \\[2\\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years. \u00a0\n\n**Results**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ng4vmop1g5771.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec5b766b99d8ad4fdca8f55d229f087bf4c2d8b)\n\nThe analysis did throw up some interesting results. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here and let\u2019s break it down by each segment.\n\nThe most important insight is that **it\u2019s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \\[3\\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let\u2019s consider some more realistic scenarios. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.\n\nOut of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.\n\nWhile this seems like a good idea, in theory, it\u2019s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are\n\na. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It\u2019s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.\n\nb.\u00a0Identifying a crash itself is very hard\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6itqq273g5771.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec154f4892c6522d84357d7358fbeaa99c835b2)\n\nAs we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it\u2019s going into a deeper crash or whether it\u2019s going to bounce back up.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it\u2019s very difficult to execute it.\n\nFor e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \\[4\\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.\n\nIf you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.\n\n*Data used in the analysis:* [*here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LT3qazGZXHT3qnnBS7oWAZU8n8DH1gv-JsCixN2mdPM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I have considered the [following crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets) for the analysis: Dotcom crash (2000), Sep 11 (2001), market downturn 2002, Housing market crash (2008), 2011 stock market fall, 2015\u201316 stock market selloff, 2018 crypto crash, Corona Virus crash (2020) \n\n\\[2\\] The data for the adjusted close for S&P 500 from 1993 to 2021 was obtained from [Yahoo Finance API](https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-use-the-yahoo-finance-api/).

Is it global war between two major powers or pandemic?\n\nDepending on scenario, review historical analysis. For the case of 2020 COVID19, there was similar case in 1919 when market crashed about 20% for DOW composite. So, your movement would be around 10-15% with 25% as absolute bottom price. Of course, every pandemic is different as 1919 spanish flu was unique in a way that this occurred after WWI when economy was still fragile unlike 2020. \n\nThat's where partial investment comes into play. Determine your expectation of max crash points. If it's 20% as absolute max crash, then start to put money at 10% for 5% of your portfolio (or cash in hands).  If it reaches 15%, then put money 15% of your available funds. If it reaches 20%, then put another 45% of your available funds. \n\nThis will help to recover fund balance quickly as market is upward. If market crash stops around 10%, (meaning that bottom is confirmed with 4-5 consecutive business days), then it's time to buy call options to recover the lost opportunity cost with your available balance. \n\nOf course, every crash conforms to some gravity, meaning that it can go below your max end points, which is why you would need to still have 35% cash in hands in case market is total crash enough that it's going to crash 90%! (which is theoretically possible, but pratically impossible). Even during Great Depression, market crashed 30%, so I would move with an assumption that the max crash points would be 30-40%.  \n\nIf your calculation is wrong (you expected 20-25% crash, but it actually crashed 30%), then you are probably suffering huge loss, but that's when you start to put 35% of your available funds at 35% crash points, or use every available funds including margin. \n\nDon't play option at this points as volatility will only serve for those who have been trained to maintain temperament and you can play options when bottom is confirmed, anyway. \n\nAt least, that's my retrospect on once-a-decade opportunity for March 2020.

In recent weeks, these stocks have staged a second rally, with a rise in stocks including cinema chain AMC inflicting yet more pain.\n\nHedge fund losses since the start of the year from betting against just GameStop, AMC and Bed Bath & Beyond total more than $12bn, according to data group S3, while bets against a number of others have each run up additional losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. More than half short sellers\u2019 $5.1bn of losses betting against AMC this year have come in June.\n\nThe heavy toll shows how moves by individual investors, which are regularly co-ordinated on forums such as r/WallStreetBets, has heightened the risks for professional investors in the Wall Street equities market.\n\n\u201cIn two waves, a few hedge funds have seen modestly sized short positions turn into extinction-level events,\u201d said Andrew Beer, managing member at investment firm Dynamic Beta Investments. Funds that suffer multiple rounds of losses on short bets \u201cwill face difficult questions from investors as to whether their risk management failed to adapt to a changed market environment\u201d.\n\nThe highest-profile hedge fund casualty has been Melvin Capital, which lost 53 per cent in January and is still down 44.7 per cent this year to May. Light Street Capital, the fund led by \u2018Tiger cub\u2019 alumnus Glen Kacher, was also hit early this year and again in May, with losses in the first quarter predominantly driven by soured short bets. London-based White Square Capital, which lost money shorting GameStop, is also shutting its main fund.\n\nAn index compiled by Goldman Sachs of stocks favoured by retail investors has almost doubled since June 2020, while another that tracks companies that are targeted by short sellers has gained 28 per cent.\n\nTraders across the industry, both those caught directly in abrupt rallies in heavily shorted stocks as well as those hit by the ensuing market volatility, have now been forced to start tracking potential retail investor maneuvers or risk huge losses and backlash from their investors.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe danger is you don\u2019t really know what stock the retail community is going to go after next,\u201d said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. \u201cThere is not a stock that is \u2018safe\u2019.\u201d\n\nWu Silverman had typically concentrated on advising institutional clients about their hedging strategies. Now hedge funds seek her help to identify the early warning signs of a retail-driven meme stock surge.\n\n\u201cIt has completely upended our markets, and we have had to make really dramatic changes to how we model things and how we manage risk,\u201d she said. Retail investors chasing volatility \u201chas gotten to the point where you can\u2019t ignore it\u201d.\n\nLosses inflicted by retail investors have proved a rude awakening to hedge funds, which had just enjoyed a banner year in 2020 making their biggest gains since the aftermath of the financial crisis, according to HFR.\n\nSome funds are considering taking a greater number of smaller short positions to cut down on the potential losses a single stock can cause, say industry insiders. D1 Capital, whose founder Daniel Sundheim previously worked at Viking, is one fund that has been considering reducing the size of short bets this year, say people familiar with the strategy. Others are looking at betting against indices, rather than individual stocks.\n\nManagers in the US and UK have begun using algorithms to scour forums such as r/WallStreetBets or other data sources to try to spot co-ordinated buying. While the practice is new to most western funds, this kind of surveillance is already common for many Asian managers, according to Patrick Ghali, managing partner at advisory firm Sussex Partners.\n\nTiger cub Lee Ainslie\u2019s Maverick Capital wrote to investors in April that its quant team \u201cnow systematically monitors Wall Street Bets and other similar forums that cater to less experienced, retail investors\u201d. Moez Kassam, chief investment officer at Anson Funds in Toronto, said his firm has been building algorithms to follow commentary and sentiment on Reddit, as well as using some bought from external companies.\n\nFintech company S3 now provides a company\u2019s \u201cshort squeeze risk\u201d score to Bloomberg terminal users, while alternative research provider Quiver Quantitative scrapes Reddit investment threads for ticker mentions and sentiment.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want your book to be exposed to the whims of r/WallStreetBets,\u201d said Quiver founder James Kardatzke.\n\nData group Sentifi, which buys data from the likes of Reddit and Twitter and uses it to score sentiment around stocks, said it detected a nearly 1,200 per cent rise in chatter around AMC between May 20 and June 1. The cinema chain\u2019s shares had already started to rise by then, but then doubled on June 2. Sentifi said the number of customers using its platform had doubled over the past year.\n\nSwiss investment firm Unigestion has also started looking at how it can deploy its machine reading and data techniques \u2014 which it already uses to spot changing sentiment \u2014 around meme stocks.\n\n\u201cIt is an important, though short-term, risk factor\u201d in markets, said Unigestion portfolio manager Salman Baig. \u201cFor us, any factor that can disrupt markets is of primary concern.\u201d\n\n*Additional reporting by Miles Kruppa*\n\n*laurence.fletcher@ft.com, madison.darbyshire@ft.com*", "id": "o7lf67", "created_utc": 1624618850.0, "score": 558, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "If this is not crocodile tears, I don\u2019t know what is.\nThey\u2019re whining about potential risk of loss when they coordinate their funds and resources to drive a company and it\u2019s stockholders out of business?

I think traders and investors are responding to really good consumer spending data that we're seeing.\n\nAEO (American Eagle) up 15% in one week, on really good indicators that people are going to spending for work, summer and back to school.\n\nTheir Aerie line is firing on all cylinders. 80% yoy growth. 150% plus e-commerce growth. I've said this before, but I really think they can **overtake Victoria's Secret for number one in the women's underwear, swim and lingerie category in 5-7 years.** In addition, their OFFL/NE athleisure spin-off is a legitimate value alternative to Lululemon and Athleta, and I expect it to grow at the same pace as Target's All in Motion line. I know for a fact from girlfriends that their bike shorts are selling really well. I love the branding, sounds a little like OFF-WHITE, but I'm cool with that. Also love their tag line \"Built for real motion\" which is a direct bullseye shot at Target's line.\n\nWe are entering the first jeans supercycle we've seen in 20 years, as skinnies have dominated the landscape since we bought that first Strokes CD in 2001, and yoga pants have dominated the last 5-7 years. Time to clear out your old wardrobes, and replace those skinnies with the relaxed styles we saw from the late 1970s through the late 90s. I seel AEO as really well positioned here, as we are in the beginning stages of this cycle, and we still don't really know what type of style will dominate. Flares? High waisted \"mom\" styles? Mid 90s wide legs? Late 90s boot cuts? Relaxed Levis 501 styles? Fortunately, AEO has styles in all of these categories.\n\nValuation wise, retail as a whole is good, with the category lagging the entire S&P in forward P/E and FCF yield, as they have really really been hit hard over the past five years due to the pandemic and the closing of malls. Only Oil and Gas as a broad-based category has been hit harder. Those who transition the fastest to e-commerce in this beaten down category will win. Fortunately, Shopify now makes it really really easy for most retailers to pivot quickly.\n\nValuation wise, among the sector, AEO has a lower forward P/E than peers Abercrombie and Fitch, Levis, L Brands, Lulu, GAP. They also have had better e-commerce execution than all of them with exception of Lulu.\n\n850M cash on hand, a 100% increase from 2020, with 330M in long term debt, a 50% decline from 2020. 282M ttm free cash flow against a 5.8B enterprise value (EV/fcf of 20, which I think is low for a company with a growth machine like Aerie). Pretty good financials.\n\nStores, which are still mainly located in enclosed malls, will be a drag, but continued closing of underperforming/low foot traffic stores, opening of new leases in multi-use urban or urban-adjacent outdoor \"malls\" or high streets (you know, the places that have an Apple store), and shifting to a asset-light e-commerce model servicing suburb/exurb/rural areas will help them overcome this.\n\nLeadership wise, CEO/Chairman Schottenstein is a good financial guardian and head, but the real secret sauce comes from Chief Creative Officer Jennifer Foyle, who's a real superstar. Expect her to be considered for the CEO role if Aerie can execute to the highest levels and become the largest intimates brand in the US.\n\nI have a significant position in American Eagle started early Jun and this is my back of envelope 10 minute to type rationale.

I assume you knew the risks going in, but now they are real... losing money sucks. YOLO'ing into options is extremely dangerous... you're making a very specific bet with a time constraint and the market (in its infinite wisdom) is supposedly pricing in the risk of them losing and you winning. Despite all the gain porn you'll see around here, it's hard to win, and in the long \"the house always wins\" particularly applies to options. They make for good bets, but YOLO'ing is quite intense.\n\nI'm really sorry to hear it's setting you back 6 months!\n\nBuilders are getting punished because the *growth* in demand is seemingly starting to slow. In the past, this has meant \"uh-oh, we peaked.. now the bubble will burst\" and so investors are reacting accordingly.\n\nMy take on this is: It will take *a lot* for the market to change its mind on this: either the housing growth/sentiment increases (we are already approaching historic levels), or it becomes apparent that it is *not going to decrease* as quickly as anticipated. I believe pretty strongly in the latter, but it looks like the market is going to move their money elsewhere for the time being, and it could take some time for them to react to \"housing is not tanking as hard as we thought it would\". It's a shame the party seemingly stopped just after we entered this position, but that's the reality of it -- at least that's what the market is saying.\n\nIn regards to rolling out the options -- there's not a good answer for this.  If you roll them out now, you're facing a longer uphill battle to get whole, but you'll be lowering your risk (some). Theta will still tick away the value of your options if we go sideways while the market sorts things out. And they can still go to zero.\n\nIf they are liquid, maybe going out until after next earnings could be a better risk/reward. Eg, Nov calls. This gives some time for the market to reverse it's stance. But, it's still a gamble. You can also go straight to commons or just quit to live another day.\n\nNo matter which way you go from here, it's going to be an uphill battle. If you see a better opportunity elsewhere, don't fear cutting your loses and moving your remaining stack there.\n\nAgain, sorry it's not working out well for you.

In fact their sales are up 41% as of 6/15, yet people freaked out about increased supply chain prices. Seems like papi Powell is taming that beast with his massive beater anyways.

{"title": "Massive DD Thread on $BODY. Deep Value for Investors.", "selftext": "Hello fellow Redditors! Here i will present you Due Diligence on a company i searched a lot and believe in it short and long term. Not only me but millions of people and huge names like **Shaquille o'Neal, Lebron James, and Arnold Schwarzenegger** since they are all shareholders in the company. The triple threat!!!\n\nI will try in this DD to mention with few words the most important things you need to know and ill try to do it in a way that wont get you tired to read all the post till the end! Clean and simple for you. I share this DD only to show new investors the Deep Value and potential this play brings to the market and nothing else... *After all everyone should search and add his own DD on top*. Who wouldnt like to find $NFLIX early as an investor? Life changing stocks should be found early. Have fun and invest with your own risk to lose or earn! Also **important, not bagholding!**\n\nLets start the story with an\n\n**Amazing All Star Management Team**:\n\nThe BeachBody team includes three former Disney senior executives \u2014 **Staggs, Mayer, and Salil Mehta**, its chief financial officer. Other directors, officers, and strategic advisors include Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Peter Schlessel, Keith Horn, Sheila Stamps, Teresa Miles Walsh, and Martin Luther King III.Dont forget also Sue Collyns. No need to just mention that Staggs ([former Disney COO](https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/tom-staggs-disney-out-steps-down-bob-iger-1201745196/)) and Mayer (previously chairman of Disney\u2019s Direct-to-Consumer and International and [briefly CEO of TikTok](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/tiktok-kevin-mayer-resigns-1234750556/)) who both serve as co-CEOs and co-chairs of the board are higly valued and insightfull people along with all the others. Also worth mentioning that in the board also joined a member of **GME** board. Lastly CEO of the company is **Carl Daikeler** who managed to raise a company from VHS tapes to a behemoth that has 22 years of presence without debt and clears above 1+ billion in revenues. All star team with all star celebrities along their side each one valuable for their guidance. I will put some links from Shaqs and Arnold twitter along with Ross Gerber twitter who is bullish from Day 1 like he was in Tesla with their support in the company and the well respected Meet Kevin who is well known in Investing community.\n\n[https://twitter.com/SHAQ/status/1407759264978931716](https://twitter.com/SHAQ/status/1407759264978931716)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1405573349896429570](https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1405573349896429570)\n\n[https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1407373786530271241](https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1407373786530271241)\n\n**Lets continue with what exactly $BODY brings to the market**:\n\nWell $BODY was a 3 way merger means you have BeachBody, Openfit and Myx Fitness all together.\n\n**BeachBody on Demand Interactive (BODi)**\n\nBeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD\u2019s and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article [here.](https://tbc-cms-prod-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tbc-cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19060123/BODi-Press-Release.pdf)\n\n**OpenFit PartnerShips**\n\nOpenFit (backed by Lebron & Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article [here.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005208/en/Openfit-and-Concierge-Health-Announce-At-Home-Exercise-Incentives)\n\nOpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness over 700 physical locations , giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link [here.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)\n\n**Myx Fitness**\n\nA simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer.But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition. I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one. Interestingly, Myx has sold over 27,000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month. The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at $1,299 is $600 cheaper than peloton\u2019s basic bike.\n\n**Nutrition (thats a big one) Shakeology**\n\nShakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life. They\u2019ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020, \u201cthe sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport\u00ae, a third-party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270+ substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label\u201d\n\nYou can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info.\n\nLets continue with\n\n**Quick Financial Overview:** 1.1B (est) revenue for 2021, 68% gross margins on that rev (which is better than NFLX, DIS, PTON, etc). Digital subscriptions have 89% margins. 43% YoY revenue increase for Q1. Added literally a million subscribers YoY. 400M free cash on the books upon merger w/ no debt. Also expanding to 10+ countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now. Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post. Beach body already has more than 3.3 + **MILLION** paid digital subscribers. We will talk about subscribers, coaches and followers below. All in all, this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion (in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33% by 2027, $59B) which happens to have a few meme-like qualities and dont forget **NO DEBT.**\n\n**2021 Q1 Financials**\n\nTotal Revenue: $243M - 43% increase YoY\n\nTotal Subscriptions: 3.2M - 39% increase (record high)\n\n(Not an actual earnings report, assumed to be released after merger)\n\n**Q2** mentioned on interview will be even better.\n\n**Future Plans & News**\n\nHere\u2019s where they\u2019re really making moves. Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they\u2019ll have what they referred to as a \u201cwar chest\u201d of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&A, marketing, and expansion.\n\n**International Expansion**\n\nThe team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10+ countries in the near future.\n\n**THATS IMPORTANT**. Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers.\n\nIf you check company's website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers, almost 3.4 million paid subs, thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people. Celebrities backing this one Lebron, Shaq, and Arnold together have 70 !!!! million followers only on Twitter, on Instagram they have over 100 million!!!!. Insiders have also thousands of followers, so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people. **A cult that loves Beachbody.**\n\nImportant also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order to connect with each other, in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people, subs and coaches to connect each other.\n\nLets talk about\n\n**Tech in Fitness**\n\nAnytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in.\n\nWhat about???\n\n**Future of At-Home Connected Fitness**\n\nWhy would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005351/en/The-Future-of-Fitness-Americans-Embrace-a-Hybrid-of-Home-Exercise-and-Gym-Workouts) and [here](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/home-workouts-future-of-fitness). A survey of 3500 American by *The New Consumer* and Coefficient Capital found that 76% of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic\u2014and crucially, 66% prefer it. Among millennials, the number is even higher: 82% made the switch and 81% like it more. Link to article [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90587575/gyms-arent-coming-back-heres-how-youll-work-out-in-the-future).\n\nSay the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes.\n\nLets see if there is any\n\n**Bear Case**\n\nNone. Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews *(Kevin Mayer and Carl Daikeler last interview on Fireside Chat : This is social commerce not MLM company , with influencers and no inventory on them. None intermediators , not MLM model at all.)* plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50-100 pps because bears are getting nervous. *(HLF, NUS, PRI)*\n\nFinally most important\n\n**PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze (summer lemonade) POTENTIAL**\n\n**Check this image**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[8.8&#37; only public shares!](https://preview.redd.it/unkrgq17gh771.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=6849de07ad327d6a808d1f44d4fc55147312d165)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonday $BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available (around 22-25) for shareholders that makes it a very low float stock. Already buying pressure from retail is obvious. Already many tutes have positions with big names among them **74 total tutes, 65 long only**, 1 short only, 8 long/short with a total of 9 million shares already. As of 15/6 Short float was **20% !!!! in an already low floater**. Check this tweet for proof\n\n[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112)\n\nAdd all of the above to the equation and lets see...\n\nThe stock already hit 18+ back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20% short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50% of its value. Now shares remaining are very low because **most float is locked**. Shorts need aprox. 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure. If everyone wants a little piece of this pie as it seems public float will be all locked fast and then ...\n\nDont forget Monday $BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above. This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering.\n\n**IMPORTANT-->** Retail shareholders have high conviction and not selling shares, Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41%, same applies for the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown **Silicon Valley** investors. If they not selling, I\u2019m not selling.\n\n**More MEMEish features**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $BODY ticker (hard to ignore) [This](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html) article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without. Its summer anyways right?\n* Comparison to PTON\n* Arnold, Lebron, and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders. Collectively, they have 128.7M followers on IG alone. You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company. Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to **gold**, no need to mention other tickers we all know. Who goes against these guys? Everyone loves them.\n* Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both former Disney execs, will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth, post-merge. Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney+, also former TikTok CEO\n* 1+ billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that **without DEBT** at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion.\n\nI dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search. All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer. **The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders, insiders and celebrities is the Biggest leading subscription Health and Wellness company offering Tech and Nutrition for the masses in the market. Its the PTON for 99% and the Netflix of digital fitness , all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with.**\n\nSome people say $BODY to 0, 5, 20, 30, 50, 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float **everything is doable with volume**. Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine , and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1. Somewhere my eye caught a quote i liked - its better to be in a Meme before it becomes one (unknown - 2021)! First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them thats the fact. Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes. **DEEP VALUE** my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like. Everyone likes the stock it seems in social and you know the power of social media from Kitty.\n\n**Tip---> No pumpers (yet) on $BODY its a pure fundamental - growth - behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages. They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team.**\n\n**Small Update : $BODY rang the bell this Monday 28/6.** But received many messages from people they couldnt find it to buy , thats because most brokers had issues since late at closing bell. From today 29/6 all will work fine. Despite all these issues on first day (that screwed some of the retail) $BODY opened strong and remained strong all day although more shorts piled in and raised SI more! (volume before price) As of today many brokers like IB have no shares available to short!!! Lastly i want to thank you for the feedback on the DD i really appreciate it, and the messages i got especially from people that know $BODY from inside!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBuAxovV\\_jM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBuAxovV_jM)\n\nBig thanks for taking some parts from the DD of Traditional-Studio-5 and some other BB followers.
