The majority of the population got fed up with the ruling party and replaced them with a new Prime Minister who's very much pro-market. That's why you may have occasionally heard about the new telco licenses for the Ethiopian market, one of which was granted, as well as the ongoing partial (40%) privatization of Ethio Telecom, the state-run telecommunications monopoly.\n\nAnyways, to go back to those links, ordinarily, it makes no sense for Ethiopian Airlines (and by extension, the carrier's owner, the Ethiopian Government) to let Boeing get away with a light settlement . . . until you read the FANA news report from Addis Ababa about a delegation of Boeing executives meeting with agents of the Ethiopian government to discuss \"investment opportunities in Ethiopia.\"\n\nBottom line: I think that the Ethiopian government has extracted something else from Boeing in the wake of the 2019 737 MAX crash, something that is worth far more than cash and that may be a win-win for both sides . . . especially with the country's opening up, the push for regional integration and harmonization of laws and processes with international standards, and Ethiopia's strategic position in the Horn of Africa with regards to logistics. (Part of the agreement with Eritrea is for the Ethiopians to regain access to the Red Sea at Massawa; in the last two years, the Ethiopians secured an agreement with the French government to begin re-establishing naval forces that were disbanded after Eritrea gained independence.)

They however have many short therm issues.\n\nBoeing has a massive and systematic management problem.\n\nThe 737 Max disaster was caused by management (not listening to test pilots). The resulting issues were also not handled very well. It was not a good idea to change from a CEO with an engineering background, to a CEO with a finance background.\n\nThere have been several reports of tools and other debris being found in new 787 Dreamliner fuel tanks. Some Air lines have even decided to not accept aircraft from one of the production sites. (this is also a management issue).\n\nBoeing failed to get a Gateway Logistics System Contact because their bid did not meet basic selection criteria. \n\nBoeing failed to get a Human landing system contract, because their bid was massively overpriced, and relied on an unrealistic launch and development schedule of the SLS rocket.\n\nThe SLS rocket has several Issues. Boeing is lucky that Congress wants SLS to continue to exist because if NASA would decide, the chance that it already would have been cancelled is relatively high. Boeing is building the core stage of the SLS Rocket. Due to massive schedule and cost overruns, the Exploration upper stage was delayed (also built by Boeing). With Several commercial super heavy-lift rockets coming operational, the need for SLS is shrinking. Especially if the Starship system manages to work, it will be difficult to justify keeping SLS online.\n\nThe Starliner Capsule is massively delayed for several reasons, including a failed test flight 1.5 years ago. The Test might finally be repeated this year. the Issues were caused by a massive lack of testing, which, again, is a management issue. A total of 84 issues were found AFAIK.\n\nI am not really up to date on the military contracts of Boeing.\n\nThere are several problems resulting from what I wrote above.\n\nFor a long time, Boeing got NASA contracts for \"Past mission performance\". With the Problems in the SLS Programm, as well as the Starliner programme, this is no longer the case. The Starliner contract was awarded to Boeing, mostly due to past performance. It is safe to say, that if the same competition to build a crew capsule would take place today, Boeing would not have gotten the contract at the wanted price. \n\nFixing the Problems in the 737 Max has cost a lot of money. Since they had to continue to pay many of the subcontractors to prevent them from going bankrupt. I am not 100% sure, but I think they also had to pay some airlines and the family members of the victims.\n\nWith the change of the CEO some time ago, they have also restarted the design of the NMA or 797 Airliner, for the 3rd time. This will no doubt have cost a lot of money.\n\nAirbus on the other hand didn't have these issues, which cost a lot of money and has instead used it to develop new technologies.\n\nIn my Opinion, Airbus also has a better small Aircraft lineup.\n\nstarting small, airbus has the a220 Series, which they got from bombardier, for a very low price, mainly because Boeing wanted to prevent delta from building the Plane. (relatively long story, can explain more if someone is interested). the a220 Series is very efficient, and its main drawback right now is that the production volume is too low. Airbus is however working on increasing the production speed. The a220-100 and a220-300 are more efficient than the 737 Max 7, and it is speculated that Airbus is working on a stretched a220, the a220-500. (the a220 series is so good, that most airlines are preferring it over the a319). This a220-500 would likely compete with the 737 Max 8. The 737 Max 7, 8, 9 and 10 are competing with the a319, a320 and a321. the Aircraft are pretty evenly matched, with the a321 being a bit larger than the Max 10, and with significantly more range, depending on the configuration. the a321 is also already certified, unlike the 737 Max 10, which just hat its maiden flight.\n\nAirbus is building and delivering large numbers of a320 Airliners and has gotten many orders for the a321LR and a321XLR. Boeing does not have anything to offer in that area of the market. \n\nIt is Rumoured that airbus might develop a new wing for the a320 family, which would increase the efficiency, as well as allowing the a321 to be stretched to an a322. Boeing would not be able to stretch the 737 Max 10 further, so would need to respond with a clean sheet design. depending on the financial situation of Boeing, they might not be able to respond quickly.\n\nWhat is keeping Boeing alive, is that the Airbus order book is even longer than Boeings.

But since that clearly didn't work, the now-multiple years that have elapsed could have allowed for a redesign to a more naturally stable airframe configuration.  It would require someone in Boeing to finally admit the unstable kludge machine is a bad idea, and isn't that forgiving.\n* Prior worries about having to train pilots can now be seen in proper perspective: it was always just a drop in the ocean compared to losing your whole sales for years and years, or killing people at an unacceptable rate of 2 plane loads full in the first few months.

{"title": "I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!", "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests.\n\nIt has been a tough week in the market with SPY dropping 2%, Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its worst weekly loss since October, and most popular stocks taking a beating. The main reason for the fall is the concern that Federal Reserve could start raising rates sooner than expected due to inflation concerns bringing a stop to the continuous rally we have seen in the last year. Now without further ado, let jump straight into the \u00a0\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzb0c64t9f671.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dbbeef62c2512726fbb09c816530267df349263\n\nAMC continues to be the most talked-about stock with a 20% WoW gain in stock price. Even though the overall number of discussions seems to be waning (last week AMC had 17K mentions), investors are becoming more and more bullish as reflected in the sentiment.\n\nTaking about the bullish view, WISH has the highest sentiment across all the stocks reflecting the investor confidence in the stock. Both WISH and CLNE overtook GME in the discussion volume across Reddit and Twitter. Other than these 3, all the other stocks had a rough week in the market with Clover health dropping a massive 20% last week.\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ct22xu8mbf671.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ca8052c95641669a2595e96d82ef34b036de2b3\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**Petco Health and Wellness($WOOF):** WOOF had a wild ride this week with the stock gaining more than 20% on Monday and still ending in red at the end of the week. Unlike many other meme stocks, analyst\u2019\u2019 consensus is a [strong buy](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/petco-health-vs-chewy-pet-131320193.html) for the stock with an upside of almost 30% from the current price levels. The company is expected to gain considerably from the increasing trends of pet adoption during Covid and people\u2019s willingness to spend more on their pets.\n\n**DraftKings($DKNG):** The company was trending as Hindenburg Research published a report calling DraftKings \"a $21 billion SPAC betting it can hide its black-market operations.\" The stock fell 4% on the news and the stock has shed almost 10% throughout the week. Wall Street analysts have [said](https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-allegations-short-seller-hindenburg-51623869779) that these allegations are nothing new and unregulated market exposure is a common theme for international sports betting companies.\n\n**Corsair Gaming($CRSR):** The prodigal son has finally returned! CRSR was the [first stock that I identified using the program and did a DD on](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmmn1g/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The stock had a wild week, soaring more than 30% with 20x the average trading volume. The fall also was just as steep with the stock losing all the gains within the next 3 days. The company had an exceptional year during Covid with net revenue of $1.7B (55% increase YoY) and a gross profit of 456MM (107% increase YoY).\n\n**Nio Inc($NIO):** After reaching highs of $64 in February, NIO had fallen to $31 in May. The stock seems to be picking up momentum and has shown consistent growth since then (risen over 40% over the last month). Adding to this, NIO has also become the best-selling EV brand for SUVs in China with its market share now up to 25%. Both these factors are driving the increasing chatter for the stock.\n\nHope you enjoyed this week\u2019s issue! \u00a0\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "id": "o45oso", "created_utc": 1624195776.0, "score": 534, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 181, "comments": [{"body": "I have a sub where I track the trending stocks and do a comprehensive deep-dive on one investment strategy/topic every week.

They are pretending that the analysis they wrote is somehow built from the progamming/sentiment analysis.  It's not.  It's just a common business trick to make it seem like you have some secret weapon informing your analysis when clearly you just end up talking about the exact same thing everyone else is talking about in an unoriginal and really pointless way.\n\nI am saying this because most of us have been using the internet for a while and are perfectly well aware of how every young person who googles \"how to learn python\" will end up running a script that does what the OP did.  It's getting old.  It's not clever.  It's not even useful. \n\nUp next:  sentiment analysis of twitter comments about baseball tell us who will win the world series this year.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I was just dumbing it down for you.

{"title": "Wall Street Bets Guide to Options: Insiders Only! Volume I", "selftext": "Options are the best way to make a lot of money with a minimal amount of risk.\n\nThis guide will help you get started on your path to financial freedom.\n\nSome definitions:\n\n**Calls:** Calls let you \u201ccall\u201d your broker and tell them how much you want to pay for a stock. Say Tesla is trading at $700. You can call your broker and tell them you want to buy it at $300. If it\u2019s a new broker that just passed his series 7 he might say something like, \u201cDo you mean 300 strike sir/mam?\u201d Calmly tell this noob that you know about options from WSB and want to talk to his manager. If they still wont let you participate in call options to purchase Tesla at $300, you will need to report this to FINRA. Here is their help line: Phone: (240) 386-HELP.\n\n**Puts:** Puts, much like Calls are insider trading tools used by many Wall Street firms. How a put option works is that you call your brokerage and tell them your want to \u201cput\u201d or give back your shares for their original purchase price. Puts are what you use to get a refund if things went a little awry. Lets say you smooth brain bought GME at $440 after looking at shitty memes all day, tell your broker you would like to use a put option to get a refund. You choose the price, however, one firm rule of puts is that you cannot put your shares back for more than you paid for them. So, in this case, you can put your shares back into the share pool for $440 apiece.\n\n**Covered Calls:** Covered calls are normally only for elite wall street veterans but I will help you trade just like they do. Selling calls should not be done over the phone with your brokerage. Don\u2019t worry Robinhood traders this isn\u2019t a problem for you. You are going to want to do this online after you sign your margin contract with your brokerage. Covered calls are a sale of the aforementioned call options where you essentially sell something you don\u2019t own and make money for just knowing about this trick! Its like being able to sell your neighbors car without him knowing. Its really important when selling calls to not have the underlying stocks in your account. For example, if you want to sell covered calls on Tesla, do not purchase the security first. You dont want to get them called away do you!? Another quick tip: to maximize profit always look for the most volatile stocks possible, meme stocks are great for this. Remember, keep it online, just click the sell button, go a little bit out of the money (more on this below) and you will get the biggest bang for your buck!\n\n**In the money:** ITM is how wall street traders congratulate each other on a successful call or put option. Lets say you used a put to return your shares for a refund, when the money hits your account, you can post it on WSB to let others know you are \u201cin the money!\u201d You will most likely be showered with awards from wall street bettors. Wall Street bettors are very nice folks who are there to support you. Its their way of saying welcome to the club! Here\u2019s some gold. \n\n**Out of the money:** OTM refers to trading noobs who don\u2019t know how to trade options. Us wall street insiders consider most of retail out of the money, but now that you have found this guide you will no longer be part of this lower class of human. Trading is easy when you have the power of insider knowledge on your side.\n\n**Strikes:** Your brokerage works on a 3 strike system. If you lose on three trades or try to buy boomer dividend stocks like JPM, you will be given one strike. Strikes fall off on a rolling 30 day basis. So, if you absolutely have to buy JP Morgan cause they were Epstein\u2019s bank / brokerage, and you like that they got caught with a cocaine boat ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ship-seized-in-1-3-billion-cocaine-bust-is-owned-by-jp-morgan-chase/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ship-seized-in-1-3-billion-cocaine-bust-is-owned-by-jp-morgan-chase/) ) you can only do this three times a month. Only trade options and meme stocks and you will be fine.\n\n**Expiration:** If you don\u2019t use your options after Ive given them to you here, they will rot. In order to keep your options fresh, its always wise to sell more covered calls described above or call your broker to buy new calls or puts.\n\n**Intrinsic Value:** refers to what you think your options are worth. If you have options that have gone to zero but you really, really like them, well then there is a lot of intrinsic value in them.\n\n**Extrinsic Value:** refers to the value of options that you used to own. You would say, \u201cI am an extrinsic holder of Amazon options and they would be worth millions of dollars right now.\u201d This is very useful information to share with others in the DD section. Extrinsic value can also refer to the value of your wife after she ran away with her latino pool boy boyfriend. For example, \u201cMy wife\u2019s extrinsic value at the moment is the price of a Costco hotdog while she is away on her extended vacation.\u201d\n\nHope this helps get you started!\n\nWelcome to the wall street insiders club!", "id": "o46lu2", "created_utc": 1624198485.0, "score": 864, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "\"Options are the best way to make a lot of money with a minimal amount of risk.\"\n\nWhat a way to instantly poison the well", "score": 167, "replies": [{"body": "You mean as a way to attract more gamblers", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Hehe suckers", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2240038514137268}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38138148188591003}, {"body": "Lmao.

{"title": "HEAR ME OUT: WE SHORT EVERYTHING", "selftext": "Let\u2019s start with the obvious that everyone needs to be talking about; oil. \n\n\nThe disconnect and overvaluation in oil futures is so fucking nonsensical that I would bet come Oct-Nov the average national US gas price will be in the 2.3-2.4 range, if not lower. The disconnect we\u2019re seeing is something I\u2019ve only found 2 other times in the last decade plus. The last time was in 2018. [In June the price average was 2.98, by Christmas and into early 2019 it sat 2.35-2.45.](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m) Prior to 2018 it was 2008. A year in which the price of gas topped 4.11 avg. and by the end of the year was sitting in the 1.7-1.9 range, obviously the Great Recession contributed to it. Now here is 2021, the national average in May was 3.07 and the overvaluation is greater than 2018 but not as bad as 2007-2008 appeared. Food for thought.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext, the stock market is more overvalued than it has ever been. Ever. The [Total Market to GDP is 198% overvalued](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/60/ratio-of-wilshire-5000-over-gnp). For reference \u2018Normal\u2019 would be in the 95-120 range. If we look at the Top Stocks by Index weight the sign is not pretty. Tesla has begun it\u2019s crack and it may just be a matter of weeks before its 50 Avg. falls below its 200 Avg. (for the dumb, that ain\u2019t good.) Amazon and Apple have somewhat plateaued in recent months and show signs that a regress is in store. Basically the big weights holding this shit together is looking not good. We can take a look at the Dow and SP500 individually and it tells roughly the same story with the both taking a dump in the last few days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n[The Fed has already begun to say the will not hike rates next year](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/feds-kashkari-opposed-to-rate-hikes-at-least-through-2023.html), we\u2019re walking on egg shells and nobody anywhere is doing anything worthwhile to prepare for the worst. We\u2019re using a condom we know has a hole in it we put there and know the partner isn\u2019t on birth control. We\u2019re playing with fire and about to get burnt, well poor people mostly because I\u2019m sure they will take the majority of the blame with [the BS stories they\u2019re pushing with UI benefits.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/07/truth-behind-unemployment-benefits-myth)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nBasically I am expecting over the course of the next year or so for the beginning of a recession on par with or worse than 2008. I believe 2020 will be looked at as the body ache before the actual flu sets in. The signs are all there and will just become solidified over the coming months.
