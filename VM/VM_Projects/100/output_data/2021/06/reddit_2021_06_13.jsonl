(THE MOON IS FOR AMATEURS!)", "selftext": "AMD's latest financial report blew all estimates out of the water... raising guidance to 50% sales growth Year-over-Year (up from 37%). And it is STILL conservative. Here's why:\n\n**FUNDAMENTALS: IT'S ALL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT**\n\nIn a post COVID-19 world, people will continue to flock towards entertainment.\n\nAs confirmed by TESLA & AMD last week, the NEW Model X and S have an AMD GPU & APU. This is HUGE, as the feature will trickle down as optional to the Model 3 and rest of the EV fleet.\n\nWhy is gaming important in the EV space? Just listen to Elon Musk drool over PS5 performance on road trips with autonomous driving & AMD. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl\\_-bFNRJaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl_-bFNRJaw)\n\nBut that IS NOT ALL: Valve will LAUNCH an AMD portable handheld soon! HL3 anyone???\n\n(source: Chris, The Good Old Gamer): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFn6LzUFTTA)\n\nIn essence not only the PS4, PS5, XBOX X & S, but also Valve is going FULL AMD.\n\nWho do you think Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen, Renault/Nissan will go with?\n\n[MERCEDES ALREADY MADE THEIR CHOICE.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dninScDsGno) You want a BENZ AMG??? You need AMD!!!\n\n[AMD & MERCEDES AMG: Be the Changemaker](https://preview.redd.it/1o27ml9jzy471.jpg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83cc982101a2836424ecabcfa053b1ed76353626)\n\n**ENTERTAINMENT IS KEY and AMD is all over it**\n\nSoftware will be tailored to AMD's processing pipeline. As an example, **Unreal Engine 5** ALREADY performs better on a 6800XT than it does on a RTX3080 (up to 12%  better, as per Digital Foundry's performance benchmark - see screenshot  and video link below).\n\n[AMD 6800XT on left with 61fps - Nvidia RTX3080 on right with 56fps](https://preview.redd.it/eruzko9mwy471.jpg?width=1289&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fcbb478a1bcc940bd8c564b5d6b6ace551aa401)\n\n(digital foundry's benchmarks) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C99VwDGyLg0)\n\nUnreal Engine 5 (with Lumen) will make Nvidia Ray Tracing obsolete. This software solution is much more efficient at managing illumination, allowing it to work with non-RTX hardware.\n\nEnthusiasts are pumped with AMD's Computex presentation, where Fidelity FX SuperResolution was shown. It aims  to provide up to 2x performance while super sampling images up to 4K. And the kicker is that this solution will be OPEN to ALL platforms, including NVIDIA GTX and Intel.\n\n**Intel's Raja Koduri** (Head of Intel GPU, formerly an AMD employee) has already confirmed they are looking into AMD's Fidelity FSR (as per his tweet a few days ago). They want in!\n\n[https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/Rajaontheedge\\/status\\/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc&#37;5Etfw](https://preview.redd.it/wx7f2kehxy471.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a8f175bc06e5c560b73411395c76497bcc319de)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/Rajaontheedge/status/1399964541291622407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n**So yeah, AMD is the future of GAMING**\n\nBut on the stock analysis front, AMD has also begun its climb towards previous highs.\n\nIt made a huge recovery since my latest post, when it was trading around $72.\n\nAMD is currently trading at a Price/Earnings multiple of 34, with a market cap of $98.7B\n\nNvidia is has a P/E of 84 (over twice as much), with a market cap of $444B (over 4 times more).\n\nBut when you look at AMD's latest financials, the differences shrink.\n\nOn Revenue, AMD has sales of $9.7B and net profits of $2.5B. Nvidia sold $16.6B for a net $4.3B.\n\nHow does that support Nvidia being over 4 times more expensive than AMD? **It just doesn't**.\n\nIf AMD were to trade at the same multiples: EPS of 2.38 \\* NVIDIA's P/E of 84.28 = $200 per share.\n\nAt $200 per share, AMD's market cap would be $243B... STILL HALF OF NVIDIA!!!! (WTF?!?!).\n\nThink about it, it is bound to close the distance towards $200 per share in the next 12 months.\n\nThe reasons are simple: Tesla, Valve, Unreal Engine 5, Ryzen 3D stacking and 50% growth for 2021.\n\nThe Xilinx deal WILL CLOSE in the next 6 months. THE BREAKOUT is IMMINENT!!!\n\nTo summarize, the product pipeline is AMAZING, not to mention the leaks on RDNA3 and Ryzen 4.\n\nThe new clientele is incredible: TESLA and Valve, added to Microsoft and Sony, with more coming!\n\nAdd the Xilinx FPGA accelerators integrated to AMD's Intellectual Property and fuel the rockets!!!\n\n**REMEMBER:** In a matter of months you will be kicking yourself for ignoring this post!\n\nThe MOON is for amateurs.... WE'RE GOING TO MARS BABY!!!... with TESLA AND AMD!!!\n\nMARS - THE RED PLANET... WITH LISA AND ELON. PRIMATES AND APES TO COLONIZE IT IN 2022!!!\n\n**..... ALL ABOARD!!!!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** I forgot to mention Samsung and AMD on their next flagship phone.\n\nThe phone is called \"Galaxy S22\"... FFS!!!! What other signals do we need????\n\nIt isn't MARS anymore APES!... We taking over the GALAXY! :D\n\nLoad the Falcon Heavy with all the BANANAS!!!

I'm expecting a beat here, as they raised their guidance during the Q1 results... and likely their execution is exceeding their own expectations.\n\n\\- 5700G and 5600G APUs to be released for sale in early August\n\n\\- Q3 results sometime in October 2021. Again, I expect a beat vs. their 50% sales increase guidance. Mostly as new products will begin ramping to deal with the Q4 holiday season (e.g. Valve handheld).\n\n\\- Before the end of the year, the Xilinx deal should be closing.\n\n\\- Sometime in early December, there should be news on the Samsung S22 (High-end Galaxy mobile line-up), which will bring AMD graphics and is expected to clean the floor on the mobile industry. This is VERY important... as if they have a great showing, many more mobile players may license AMD technology.\n\n\\- Mid-December, there should be more clarity on the release of Zen3 stacked Cache technology, which will provide an extra 15% performance average to FPS boost. Consumers are very excited with this technology, as the cache would go up drastically.\n\n\\- Before the X-mas holidays, Valve should be release their portable handheld device. It is expected to have AMD hardware (likely an APU) which should be more powerful than Nintendo's Switch and likely take the crown in the portable gaming arena.\n\n\\- Lastly, Zen4 and RDNA3 are planned for 2022. The leaks so far are just incredible, but there should be more info towards the end of 2021. Some leaks have already indicated that Zen4 will have 128 cores (256 threads). This is just ludicrous!!!... but AMD is used to increasing cores and leaving Intel in the dust. RDNA3 on the other hand is expected to have 2.8x performance vs. the 6900XT... which is a GIGANTIC LEAP in performance that is simply unheard of. Never has a new GPU architecture brought so much performance vs. a prior generation. This is mostly thanks to MCM design (multichip).\n\nKeep in mind that neither of these products will be cheap... they are enthusiast or workstation products, but the push the boundaries of technology quite radically.\n\nHope that provides some color on the upcoming events, product launches and financial reporting.

The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nThe market, in general, has continued to rally strongly and it has been a pretty good week for investors. The top growing stocks I [shared last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntlyqy/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) had made an average return of 6.6% with Workhorse Group making a whopping 19% return in one week! Now, let\u2019s jump right into this week\u2019s list!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9znai9z91571.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=064000d3d54a7e847dc1bec4905f9380db5e05c8\n\nAMC and BB are now the top 2 most discussed stock! Both generated almost the same amount of discussion, but investors, in general, were more bullish about Blackberry as reflected in the sentiment. The returns on both the stocks were muted with AMC and BB returning just 3% and 2% respectively. ECommerce platform ContextLogic(WISH) had a wild ride with the stock rising 90% and then dropping 46% over the next two days. Investor returns wise, Clover health is the front runner returning an insane 67% in one week. Also, Tesla dropped out of the top 10 list for the first time in 2021!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/s5j78yn0a1571.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=241763eda48057740436f648ba342b56a7999cd4)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**Wendys($WEN):**\u00a0This was definitely a long time coming. Wendys shares soared more than 19% on Tuesday after the company became a meme stock in Reddit. There was no new fundamental news from the company that changed the investment perspective other than an announcement that the company will bring back its popular Summer Strawberry Chicken Salad.\n\n**Clover Health($CLOV):**\u00a0had its best week yet since inception with the stock returning 67% in just one week. Reddit investors sparked another rally with the stock price soaring more than 200% and then fell sharply! The stock was trading at 6 times the normal volume. Even though the company has an optimistic business model, the current rally was predominantly driven by CLOV\u2019s high short interest (43%)!\n\n**Senseonics Holdings($SENS):**\u00a0$SENS exploded in mentions and the stock jumped 22% during intraday trading without any new news from the company. Its a small Maryland-based pharma company, which specializes in the development of products made to ease the burden of diabetes monitoring. The company had announced news of a promising trial but that was long back. The current rally was majorly based on its short interest (25%) and increasing chatter!\n\n**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):**\u00a0$CLNE had a wild week with the stock shooting up 31% on Wednesday due to the retail crowd but then promptly tumbled 17% in Thursday afternoon trading. The drop was due to the information that its largest shareholder reduced their stake in the company by 1.25 Million shares. The retail crowd is still extremely bullish on the stock as seen by the sentiment.\n\n**Invesco Mortgage($IVR):** The company had a spectacular crash at the beginning of the pandemic with the shares losing almost 90% of its value. It has been growing slowly over the past few months. The stock was trending in relation to the current uncertainty regarding inflation rates and how Fed is going to adjust its rates.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\u00a0ContextLogic($WISH) chatter grew by 487% and UWM Holdings($UWMC) by 373% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list. Another interesting finding from my program is that mentions of CPI (Consumer Price Index) grew by more than 900% last week showcasing the rising discussion about inflation and its impact among investors.\n\nHope you enjoyed this week\u2019s top stocks issue! \u00a0\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "id": "nyw691", "created_utc": 1623590399.0, "score": 3951, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 906, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty sure WEN is a prime example of bots and algos infiltration into WSB.\n\n\u201cSir this is a Wendy\u2019s \u201c triggered the algos to think we all want to invest in Wendy\u2019s now. \n\nPretty pathetic really.", "score": 1078, "replies": [{"body": "Also wen moon is said a lot.

All of those will be sold over the next week.  \n\nThat's just 1 strike.  There are many, many strikes far OTM that will expire OTM.

Those are definitely getting sold.\n\nLooking up and down the options chain it looks like there's more OTM than ITM (if we strip out ITM options with deltas already at .99).  And the selling may create a negative Gamma ramp.  If it goes below 40 (I don't think it will), Holy fucking shit, look out below.\n\nEdit: I'm pretending covered calls and spreads don't exist because they make a back-of-the-napkin calculation harder.

So a Delta of .8000 means it's 80% likely that the stock price will close above that strike on the expiration date.\n\nAlso when a market maker (citadel) sells an option they usually need to stay \"Delta neutral\" which means they'd buy shares equal to the Delta.  Each option is a contract for 100 shares, so a Delta of .8000 means they'd typically have 80 shares to secure the contract.\n\nSO, all that to say, when people get excited about options being in the money, it's because they think market makers need to buy all those shares, when in actuality they're probably already secured by tons of shares and likely can unload shares that secure higher strikes as they get less likely to go ITM.

{"title": "Anyone Can Clearly See Workhorse Would Be a Great Addition to Tesla or GM", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[UPS Testing Workhorse Surefly Drone. FAA Approval due in 6-12 months after 45\\/45 succesful test flights](https://preview.redd.it/wqhoa8zkn3571.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea18cec433c1e6df28354cf013052b6ee5141811)\n\nI have been long and extremly bullish on Workhorse Group since late last March. I have come to know the company well and stayed long (I did lose some shares playing margin like an idiot) even after its dramatic fall post USPS crash. This company is one of those the where the technlogy and holdings they have is worth far more than the paltry market cap of $2 Billion. Rivian, for example, is coming to market at an IPO of $70 Billion and when you compare the two companies head to head there really isn't that much difference besides a valuation of 35x more.\n\nWith Workhorse getting so much attention from retail investors now, I believe a merger may be in play before retail investors \"run up the score\" on a company that was wrongly targeted for bankruptcy by Wall Street hedge funds.General Motors in recent months announced a new commercial targeted EV company called Brightdrop. They are starting with a 600 cubic feet van and their first customer to sign on is Fed Ex. Workhorse Group has a 450 cf van, 650 cf van, and a 1000 cf van in their lineup. Adding to that is their patent for truck launched drone which is said to be possibily worth billions once cleared by the FAA which is roughly 6-12 months away according to company guidance. Both companies also own a stake in Lordstown Motors. Lordstown Motors (RIDE) is a spinoff of Workhorse Group and they kept a 10% stake along with commisions on the first 200,000 Endurances that sell. GM owns roughly 5% of the company after being a PIPE investor and basically giving them a fully equiped plant for pennies on the dollar. GM co-owns a new battery plant - along with LG - that will feed their EV supply line located right across the street from the old GM Plant (the third largest auto plant in the United States). You don't invest billions of dollars in the same area as an old plant if you don't have plans to make money on that property down the line going forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GM's Brightdrop Division FedEx EV Truck](https://preview.redd.it/1gv14kzrn3571.jpg?width=522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a23fb669d6477fcf709cc03cf4d75fc4db22ad9)\n\nIf Elon Musk is as much of a maverick as I think he is though he could put a monkey wrench in the entire thing. If he were to buy out Workhorse (I believe they would be willing to part with the company for about $10 Billion which is about $65 a share) he would then have direct competitor to Brightdrop right out of the gate and a larger stake in Lordstown Motors than GM had going forward. They could also give LMC a lifeline in cash infusion (as GM may possibily do as well) to ramp up as they are currently cash stressed.\n\nNow that Workhorse is again the center of the markets attention, and the cost of business will likely go up because of it, don't be suprised to start hearing some merger chatter like we did a few months back. It makes sense for both GM and Tesla to get them while they are cheap.
