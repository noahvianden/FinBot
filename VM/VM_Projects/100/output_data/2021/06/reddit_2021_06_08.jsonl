{"title": "Take Emotion Out of Trading", "selftext": "Across the many invest/stock subs there is a lot of meme stock posting going around.  I am not against this by itself, as there is money to be made, but be smart, especially those who are new to this.  \n\nWe have all been there, bought a stock at $10 it goes up to $20 and you're like, it will never fall, then it goes to $15 and you say, when it is back to $20, then I'll sell.  You end up selling at $7 for a loss.  \n\nWhen stocks have these crazy runs, just 'stop-loss limit sell orders.  For example, I'm currently in $CLOV, bought in at $11.65.  It's currently trading at $16.10 at the time of post.  I have a 'stop-loss limit' order at $15.  Meaning, if the stock drops to that level, it sells automatically.  \n\nOf course, it could drop to that level, I sell, and then it rockets to $25, but ignore those.  This will guarantee I can ONLY make a profit.  I HIGHLY recommend you use these automatic sell triggers to prevent yourself from believing STONKS can ONLY go up.  Guarantee you make a profit and while you may be sad when you sell a little early, you will love it when you don't take a loss which I guarantee most of these meme stocks will turn out to be in the long run.  \n\ntl:dr Use stop-loss limit orders to not get screwed over when the bubble burst.

I say this because Cloudflare is a DNS manager\n\nDNS is what converts domain names to IP addresses. \nLike: Amazon.com -> xxx.xxx.xx.xx\n\nAlthough it seems like a minor thing, Cloudflare is only growing and will only grow considering they are so much easier and better than alternatives like Namecheap DNS, or Google DNS. \n\nThis is a long post I wrote in about 4-5 minutes, so it probably doesn\u2019t make since.

Although it seems like a minor thing, Cloudflare is only growing and will only grow considering they are so much easier and better than alternatives like Namecheap DNS, or Google DNS.\n\nMost people caring that they offer DNS do not pay cloudflare and never will use cloudflare in a paid capacity. DNS is an easy thing, and cloudflares DNS management is frankly pretty mediocre for anything beyond basic website - and those use cases are the ones not paying cloudlare. They also are the price-sensitive customers that would immediately go back to their registrar for free DNS management if cloudflare started charging.\n\nFor the customers that make up 95% of their revenue, they could not give a shit about DNS. For Fastly, adding DNS management is a seriously trivial feature - the reason they don't is only because there is very little demand from it from the market segment they target. For most business customers, having to use cloudflares DNS management is actually a hurdle to adoption. While they also do support a CNAME setup on the highest tier paid plans - it is a manual process you have to contact support about.\n\ntl;dr: DNS management is not a distinguishing feature and does not make sense to consider from an investment perspective.\n\nSource: I am a software engineer, I use both fastly and cloudflare in a personal and professional capacity.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "hey what is your opinion on buying FSLY now ?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1390327662229538}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6547423601150513}, {"body": "For DNS Constellix FTW.

{"title": "$BB\ud83c\udf47\ud83c\udf47\ud83c\udf47\ud83c\udf47", "selftext": "Let's dig into the new BlackBerry IVY and it's possibilities and the system in general. But first let's touch base on the fact that BlackBerry and Amazon are no stranger to partnerships between the each other. In fact BlackBerry collaborated with Amazon all the way back in 2015 when Amazon integrated it's app store into BB10 devices which were run on QNX.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is BlackBerry IVY? It is a multi-year agreement with Amazon Web Services(AWS). We can look at it as cloud platform for automotive industry to have vehicles exchanging information with one another as well as the passenger, automotive manufacturers, operators and even the grid of a smart connected city. \ud83d\ude80\n\nLet's start with the advantages of being connected to the manufacturer. We have already seen this in other EV's and unsecured technologically advanced vehicle platforms. This ability can help the manufacturer identify problems over the air and rectify them with secure updates or even issuing a message to the driver about the need to have something brought in to be looked at. For example a vehicle recall, battery replacement/upgrade, tire monitoring systems and more. \ud83d\ude80\n\nNow being connected to the passenger allows the system to deliver unique interactive cockpit experiences designed by the automotive brand and developers all while your vehicle drives you to work or even taxis others around while you're at work. It does this using vehicle data sensors and analytics to customize the users experience. \ud83d\ude80\n\nEnabling fleet operators with BlackBerry IVY unlocks the potential for massive improvements in logistics and asset tracking, BlackBerry already sells asset tracking devices for fleet operators (BlackBerry Radar) and is currently collecting and improving efficiencies for any operators utilizing it's system with data analytics and sensors.\ud83d\ude80\n\nIf the system is connected to the grid, this unlocks a massive opportunity to increase city and traffic efficiencies. Ever get stuck at a red light with no traffic coming in any direction? Now imagine lights turning green for a single vehicle or monitoring traffic and allowing heavier traffic to be given precedence at a intersection.\ud83d\ude80\n\nV2V (vehicle to vehicle) communication will allow cars ahead of you to mark pot holes or warn other vehicles of the dangers ahead. Not only this but in autonomy V2V communication can allow possibilities like convoying with vehicles and drafting off each other bumper to bumper on a congested highway. What if the car in front of you stops? Each vehicle will know what will be happening with the vehicle in front of you, it will know anytime the other vehicles change speeds or engages the brakes. This could allow vehicles to travel safely and more fluently.\ud83d\ude80\n\nTL;DR Basically IVY will improve efficiencies in a smart city, for operators, manufacturers and also increase personal productivity. It will do this by allowing you to get things done in your car and spending less time on the road and in traffic. It will enable this while maintaining the freedom and ability to operate the vehicle yourself. If you work 9-5 or have a road trip you can sit back be entertained, relax and eventually even sleep while your vehicle takes you places. They already have a patent for autonomous refueling which highlights the ability to be able to go anywhere and not get distracted by your travels. \ud83d\ude80\n\n[YouTube | BlackBerry IVY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwDnUNENSoY)", "id": "nusexx", "created_utc": 1623113806.0, "score": 1387, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "#Anything under $140 is a dip\n\n#$40 this week", "score": 320, "replies": [{"body": "Say the line, incognitocumshot!", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "#I Repeat: Anything under $140 IS A DIP!", "score": 153, "replies": [{"body": "Didn\u2019t see that one coming", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I'm a lurker and I died laughing", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23184217512607574}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11605237424373627}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1476064771413803}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04834851995110512}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09905152767896652}, {"body": "If BlackBerry hits $100 tomorrow I\u2019ll shove a blackberry up my ass", "score": 315, "replies": [{"body": "Back in January, there was a guy who said if BB hit $30 EOW, he would drink his own piss.

{"title": "WISH is more than a short squeeze", "selftext": "Sure SI is high, possible gamma/short squeeze, etc etc. That's all documented in other posts. I want to talk about some other information on this stock. If the squeeze doesn't work out then it's good to hold an undervalued (at current prices) stock right?\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nEarning is negative as they are still heavily spending and growing\n\nP/S of 1.67 (as of 6/7 closing) is industry low, suggesting that they are undervalued (compared to AMZN 3.82, BABA 5.2, PDD 13.8, EBAY 3.92, ETSY 10.54, W 2.27)\n\n**numbers from the latest** [8-k](https://sec.report/Document/0001157523-21-000651/) **and** [10-q](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-027024/)**:**\n\nRevenue $772m, up 70% Q/Q. Wish is spending heavily on sales and marketing, $470m last quarter (61% of revenue). They have been consistently spending \\~60% to 70% of revenue on sales and marketing, and they anticipate reducing this to 40-45%, at which point they will likely be profitable. Comparing to ETSY for example, ETSY is only spending $151m out of $551m revenue (27%) last quarter. Of course ETSY is in the black - they are just not spending as much to grow. Meanwhile ETSY has a $21.6B valuation on $2B sales compared to WISH's $5B valuation on $2.87B sales.\n\nOne of the concerns cited by analysts is the drop in monthly active users (MAUs) from 109m to 101m Q/Q. The explanation given by WISH is that they decided to de-emphasize in emerging markets due to logistic issues during the pandemic. But I anticipate that they will ramp back up. For example [WISH recently partner with the south african postal services](https://www.businessinsider.co.za/global-online-store-wish-has-struck-a-deal-with-the-sa-post-office-to-deliver-products-faster-2021-4), indicating that they are going back to growth in emerging markets.\n\n**Balance book:**\n\nWISH has $1.6B cash. \\~$2B total assets, \\~$1.1B total liabilities, giving $930m equity.  For a growth company these numbers are excellent. Again comparing to ETSY, $1.16B cash, $2.5B total assets, $1.8B total liabilities, $684m equity. \n\n**Insider selling:**\n\nAnother concern that a lot of people have is the amount of insider selling. First of all, it's normal for insiders to cash out for a new IPO company like this. This is certainly done with scheduled sales - they wouldn't want to sell at like 30% of IPO prices either but they couldn't change the scheduled sales. This on top of short seller has driven the prices to <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. I think the insiders would certainly be reconsidering their next selling schedules, and we may see less selling pressure.\n\n**Technicals:**\n\nAgain, the stock is near all time low, and at <50% of IPO prices, <30% of ATH. The spike today poked out of a descending wedge and a breakout looks very promising.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nFrom a pure price point of view, it's an excellent entry point into WISH, even after today's spike. I think this is a low risk, high reward play at it's current price. In the bull case, WISH gets a valuation similar to ETSY, and that would make WISH have a market cap of $25B for a share price of $40. For the bear case, I don't see how WISH can drop much more. Let's say it goes to $5, that would make it have a market cap of $3B with a P/S of \\~1, and that would be absurd.", "id": "nvbws4", "created_utc": 1623179743.0, "score": 1294, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 406, "comments": [{"body": "If WISH hits 30 bucks I'll buy something off wish.com.", "score": 160, "replies": [{"body": "treat yourself to a nice dildo", "score": 120, "replies": [{"body": "No, don't, the dildo will be made in China and break off while in ass - will make for an awkward waddle and explanation come walking into work on Monday morning. \"Bob, is that a broken dick in your ass?\"", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "No don\u2019t buy also they won\u2019t make them as big because they are Chinese size", "score": -3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2299463450908661}, {"body": "This sounds like you're speaking from experience, ~~Bob~~ u/The_Folkhero?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30343863368034363}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48783496022224426}, {"body": "Yeah they love selling that stuff on there haha", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I like the ribbed sex gloves", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I have not seen that yet lol", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.wish.com/search/sex-gloves?hide_login_modal=true", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0481414869427681}, {"body": "Your welcome \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0007698561530560255}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09059150516986847}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08188265562057495}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15467701852321625}, {"body": "Why not a fine meth pipe to go with it?

Their COVID revenue was zero yes, but so was their production/travel budget. They're actually gearing up to lose money due to these live events.

It's just a press release they need to send for legal purposes, many start-ups run out of money. \n\nThey can get a cash infusion from GM. They've been targeted by short seller Hindenburg (i.e. similar to GME shorted by Citron). \n\nThis could be 40-50% short interest by tomorrow, then all we need is a press release and this could be back to the moon.

{"title": "WKHS DD", "selftext": "Highest shorted stock and a small cap stock what else can I say. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Workhorse develops electric trucks and delivery drones.\n2. We all know where the future is going with electric vehicles (EV). The people want it, the government wants it, and a lot of private and public money is being poured in to make this happen. Legislation is aiming to make and FORCE this to happen.\n3. The government wants zero emissions. Workhorse trucks are already zero-emission. Gas and diesel-powered trucks are not. These petroleum-based vehicles are going to have a tough time catching up.\n4. Workhorse has a proprietary system called Metron to help manage its fleet and increase its efficiency. This helps to save costs and increases revenue for companies.\n5. Workhorse has developed its integrated drone named Horsefly which works with their trucks (see pictures). The trucks have a control center and charging capabilities. No one can deny that this is the future of commerce and there's no going back. Zero-emissions electric delivery step trucks traveling to a center point and launching their drones to deliver products to customers. Delivery should occur within 30 minutes after being ordered and Workhorse is set up to do this. Is there any retail company that will not benefit from this delivery structure? Think about it, Walmart, Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS, Postal Services, Supermarkets for food delivery, etc?\n6. 350,000 delivery trucks are already sold per year according to the New York Times. This number is projected to increase.\n7. Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, who has been very popular lately (google her), had purchased a few million shares for her fund. She has since sold. This may be due to not wanting to hold on to something that is being heavily shorted (more on that below). Her funds have gotten beaten up a bit after hitting their 52-week highs a few weeks ago. Her funds may also be on the receiving end of a process called Organizational Shorting. It's a complex process where market makers unpack and manipulate the positions within her funds and essentially short them. I'm not sure if this adversely affected her funds as I couldn't find any literature on a correlation but something to consider nonetheless.\n8. In April, Workhorse more than doubled its production of trucks in comparison to the combined previous three quarters. The Pride Group placed an order for 6230 trucks. That's 6230 trucks equating to several hundreds of millions of dollars!!! That's an enormous number of trucks and that's only from one wholesaler.\n9. Workhorse's main problems are with manufacturing and delivery. The reasons why:\n10. They're limited in part due to supply chain constraints. There are bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components. This has impacted the entire industry, including Ford and GM. This is only TEMPORARY and will get worked out as it always does because every company wants to increase their sales. In addition, Workhorse now has a supply agreement with Coulomb Solutions, Inc. to supply their batteries. This company distributes for the largest EV battery manufacturer in the world.\n11. Electric trucks are a relatively new industry. Demand has skyrocketed so Workhorse's capacity to meet this demand has been limited. Recognizing that this will be something difficult for them to achieve, they teamed up with someone who can. They're now partnered with J.B. Poindexter & Co., a leading provider of commercial vehicle bodies. Poindexter has decades of experience with vehicle body engineering, construction, and assembly.\n12. There are several EV players. Most only have concepts and prototypes and we know from history that most will likely fail. Workhorse already has actual vehicles and these vehicles have driven millions of miles.\n13. Sales for the first quarter of 2021 were approximately $521,000 compared to approximately $84,000 in the first quarter of 2020. That is a significant increase and they are growing rapidly.\n14. Recent losses were mainly due to a decrease in the stock price of RIDE, which Workhorse was invested in.\n15. The Company had approximately $205.1 million in cash in March 2021. This helps limit the need to acquire debt.\n16. The stock has recently been beaten down due to having lost out on a $6 billion contract with the USPS last February. It's now June and the stock price reflects this as the market has already factored this in. This makes for a prime opportunity to invest in this company. This one-time contract will not be the only contract that the USPS offers nor does it mean Workhorse will lose out on other contracts from the USPS or other companies. Furthermore, Workhorse may still win this $6 billion contract as they are fighting it on the legal front. In addition, the USPS Postmaster, Louis DeJoy, who influences the direction of the contract, is being investigated by the FBI for possible fraudulent activity. There is concern that he may have made the decision based on political contributions. Several Ohio Congress members are also requesting a halt on the contract until it's assured that no political influence was asserted in Mr. DeJoy's decision of granting it to Workhorse's competitor. If this contract once again becomes up for grabs, there's a good chance Workhorse will win it. If that happens, watch out because the loss of this contract is what put downward pressure on its stock. Forget the moon, I'm talking about GN-z11, the furthest galaxy from us.\n17. Implied volatility has significantly increased resulting in the expensive option pricing you're seeing. This may indicate investors are expecting a big move and this risk is getting priced in.\n18. There are 8\\* analysts who have recently ranked WKHS. Five recommend a hold and three recommend a buy. NONE recommend a sell. It's unanimous, NONE recommend selling. Some of the analysts' recommend price targets are even $24, $20, $20, and $17. \\*Cowen & Co, Colliers Securities, Oppenheimer, Roth Capital, R.F. Lafferty, BTIG, B. Riley Financial, and Wolfe Research.\n19. You're helping the environment by investing in this company and you are becoming a part of the future.\n20. The stock price is about 30% of its 52-week high.\n21. This stock has an AMAZING SHORT SQUEEZE POTENTIAL. It's shorted about 40% of its float. It is one of the most, if not THE MOST, shorted stock out there.\n\nIt's very important to understand how a short squeeze works and you can't expect it to happen overnight. It takes discipline as no hedge fund manager is going to capitulate and hand money to you, especially now. The short sellers have borrowed shares to sell which drives the stock price down and they know you get fearful when this happens. They're accustomed to feeling fear because they deal with it every day. They've learned to process this emotion and not act upon it. However, they count on you not having the experience to deal with fear. They're counting on you selling out of fear (the bottom) and buying out of greed (the top). If you wait them out, they will eventually give in because every day you hold they lose money on the interest that they pay when borrowing their short shares. Also, the people lending them shares will not want to assume the risk indefinitely. The bottom line is that you have to hold and buy and not sell. Buying out of the money calls also helps because the market makers who sold you the naked calls need to cover by buying shares to protect themselves as the stock price rises.\n\nSo, how to deal with fear?\n\n1. Accept and expect fear to happen because it will. Anticipate it and do not act upon it.\n2. Do not invest money that you can't afford to lose. This way you can let it ride.\n3. Remember the ups and downs with GME and AMC. AMC was shorted about 20% on its float, it took a while and a lot of ups and downs but look what it eventually did. WKHS is shorted about double the amount of AMC!!!\n\nAlso, understand that hedge fund managers DO KNOW MORE about finance than you or I do but they are NO BETTER AT INVESTING than we are. They don't make their money from making good stock picks. They make their money from taking a cut of the money they're investing for other people. They make up fancy words, algorithms, and models to convince their customers to invest with them but overall they can't even beat the Dow. Numerous studies have shown this to be the case and a monkey throwing darts randomly at stock picks is able to beat them. The few that do outperform the market can be explained by the normal outliers of a bell curve distribution. The same distribution happens with us in WSB as it is the natural order of things. Look it up if you don't believe it.\n\nTLDR\n\n1. WKHS is prime for a short squeeze. It is one of the most, if not the most, shorted stock out there.\n2. WKHS fundamentals do not look as bad as it is priced. Out of 8 research analysts who follow it, all recommend either a buy or hold and NONE recommend a sell. Price targets for several were at or above $20.\n3. Most of the negative aspects of the company have been addressed.\n4. Demand for their products has skyrocketed.\n5.
