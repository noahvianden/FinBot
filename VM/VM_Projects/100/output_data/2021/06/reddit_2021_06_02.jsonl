{"title": "Fuck you Cramer, Fuck you Citadel, and Fuck you Blackstone. Why it\u2019s time to buy $CLNE", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/emyzg11alw271.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fd69708c23c3a45675d7143cea70cb7e2574802\n\nDo you think Cramer is a dipshit?\n\nDo you still want to bankrupt Shitadel?\n\nDo you want to stick it to a triple leveraged HF?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlstoa2w5x271.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=0597c8759da9ff21a66ef6ca68cb6345e8fafa21\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy name is \\_Wendig0\\_ and I\u2019m about to yell at you infomercial style about why $CLNE is the next rocket ship. Let\u2019s start with WSBs favorite buzzword: Squeeze\n\nGAMMA SQUEEZE POTENTIAL\n\nCurrently institutional ownership (read: ORIGINAL HODLERS) is 53% of the available float.\n\nShort interest 8% of the float (Blackstone and Citadel are both short on this stock) reported but likely much higher, closer to 18%\n\nMarket cap $1.5B\n\nCurrent share price: $8.12\n\ntHe NuMbErS mAsOn, WhAt Do ThEy mEaN?\n\nSo we have a small market cap with at least 8% of the float shorted and another 53% owned by institutional HODLERS. All at a current strike price HALF OF IT\u2019S FAIR VALUE. Price targets are currently avg in the $16-17 range. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the options chain:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fv35ravblw271.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcca214051af750d82272c50850e941987dbb5ee\n\nNotice anything here? Have you ever seen a launch pad? Because the 13c may as well have a fuggin NASA logo on it.\n\nWHY CLNE?\n\nSo, we know CLNE is ripe for a gamma squeeze, but should you buy it otherwise? The short answer is yes. This is a real company with a real product and real infrastructure with excellent forward guidance.\n\nWHO CLNE?\n\nThere have been a few DDs about CLNE on WSB recently that have provided more in depth information so I will keep this brief:\n\nCLNE takes Methane produced by landfills, dairy farms, and pig farms and converts it into RNG (Renewable Natural Gas). After converting it, they bottle it up and sell it in the long haul transport industry as fuel for said transport.\n\nWhy is this significant? Because RNG is a CARBON NEUTRAL FUEL. What we have here, then, is a tangible solution for green long haul transport. Everyone is blowing their load on EV and battery tech but EV is not currently feasible for long haul transport of goods and probably won\u2019t be feasible for at least another 10 years at best, both from an infrastructure standpoint (there is none) and tech standpoint (Why charge a transport truck for hours at a time when you can fill up at the RNG station and still have time to chase a couple lot lizards?). Essentially, RNG is THE green energy play in the transport sector.\n\nCATALYSTS\n\nWhoa boy have there been a lot recently. These are borrowed from Nrd\u2019s DD back in April:\n\n* Amazon recently created a pilot program by which they are buying 1,000 RNG powered vehicles for their fleet. $CLNE did something brilliant a few years ago to put themselves in the position to be the ones who fuel these machines by building their refilling stations right next to Amazon's warehouses\n* In February, they signed a contract with the Los Angeles Metro system to provide over 47 million gallons of RNG to their bus fleet\n* Their lobbyists successfully got congress to pass an alternative fuel tax credit\n* They've partnered with $BP to not only expand their development of RNG fuel, but to also commission BP to put RNG fillers at their existing gas station infrastructure, to be managed and operated by BP but with most of the revenue coming back to $CLNE. BP gave them something like 50 million dollars for the privilege (that number is close; I don't feel like looking it up)\n* They partnered with Total and got them to do the same thing with regards to creating RNG production facilities and help build out the refueling infrastructure. Total is going to give them 50 million dollars to assist in this, and will be providing fillers for RNG at their stations. These two companies have also created a \"Zero Now\" program by which the price of RNG is tethered to the cost of diesel, thus making it no more expensive to use RNG than it would be to use traditional diesel powered big rigs. This project is expected to be finished by 2025.\n* In December alone, they signed contracts to deliver 58 million gallons of RNG.\n* Not directly related to CLNE, but Cummins Westport recently came out with the ISX12 G RNG engine to go in its heavy trucks to further growth and demand in this segment. CLNE, as the only provider out there with a nationwide infrastructure to deliver this fuel, stands to receive the lion's share of the money that goes into fueling these vehicles.\n\nThe best catalyst? Actually buying the stock. Seriously, this thing has been trading on half of it\u2019s regular volume for the last several weeks. It would take relatively very little capital to push this thing around, which is what Blackstone and the rest of the shorts have been doing with just 8% of the float\u2026 The difference here is that they aren\u2019t shorting a dogshit company with no fundamentals to help prop it up (looking at you MVIS). They are actively fucking with a company that is the leader in infrastructure, product, and implementation in it\u2019s sector.\n\nAlso, Cramer took a shit on the stock during his lightning round on Friday, May 28th. As we all know, inversing Cramer is a great way to make some tendies and this is no exception.

{"title": "$BB \ud83c\udf47\ud83c\udf47", "selftext": "People underestimate Blackberry's QNX operating system as a secure RTOS (Real Time Operating System) based off of microkernel architecture. \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor those who don't know how a RTOS microkernel operates let's explain with minor detail. QNX is one of the most adopted embedded OS's in the world it's installed in defense systems, power plants, municipal grids, robotics, rockets, rail and 175 million vehicles and rising.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe reason for it's adoption is because of the way a QNX Neutrino RTOS operates compared to what we consider typical everyday operating systems. Most operating systems including IOS, Windows, Linux(Android) and MacOS to name the most apparent run on monolithic designs or hybrid kernels.\ud83d\ude80\n\nA true microkernel architecture like QNX Neutrino RTOS has full memory protection which is built in meaning that any component can fail and be restarted without corrupting the microkernel or other components in the system. If failure does occur, QNX has the ability to rectify the problem without affecting any other part of the system through process monitoring and recovery components. This feature and ability equals extreme reliability, security and being a microkernel the OS is also modular.\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo what is the big deal your probably asking, Apple, ABC, and Microsoft might enter the space? Not exactly, in fact there has been work in this space from all three companies. Apple opened a facility across from QNX in Kanata and hired the ex creator of the OS Dan Dodge in 2016 to work with Mansfield on the autonomous car project called project Titan. The need for a secure and stable software is where Dodge and his decades of experience from QNX come into play.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe need for a software system as reliable and secure as QNX should be a big flag to the sheer potential of QNX. It is clearly a threat and tough competition for even the biggest software companies. Not only this but project Titan continues to be illusive revealing possible setbacks and interference in trying to compete but also Apple lost several top managers from it's Apple Car project causing a potential setback to the launch revealing some attrition in the project.\ud83d\ude80\n\nQNX version (7.1) is years ahead and analysts predict the next competitor is still 5 years away from anything even remotely close.  QNX hypervisor 2.0 is 61508 SIL 3 certified and\u00a0has been recognized as ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant making it the world's first ASIL D safety-certified commercial hypervisor. \ud83d\ude80\n\nAs other's race to catch up, BlackBerry has been filing patents on it's system.\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe QNX Hypervisor utilizes patented and patent-pending technologies that simplifies how elements are shared on the system. Multiple OS's can use 1 display controller to render content onto multiple displays, aka digital instrument clusters and infotainment.\ud83d\ude80", "id": "nqsgln", "created_utc": 1622658002.0, "score": 5272, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 738, "comments": [{"body": "lots of big words, im in", "score": 2195, "replies": [{"body": "Big words and a lot of words.

This is for all apes, because if we can get a movie theater out of debt, and help revitalize a game store, we can bring clean energy to the world and SAVE it from destruction.\n\nPositions: 20x June 18 13C (0.05 per contract), 40 shares (Will add many more shares when market reopens)\n\nTHE SHORTING and LOW VOLUME: This stock has been outright manipulated very hard. You can see this start around April 19 when the Amazon deal settled and a Raymond James Wannabe-analyst changed his rating to underperform and subsequently sent the price down to further his own dying career. The deal involves a warrant, allowing AMZN to buy CLNE stock at $13.49/share which should have raised the price floor. Short interest is actually low now, around 7% (correct me if I'm wrong) , but the stock is worth at least TWICE what it currently is. Low volume has kept this stock down, just look at the daily chart and see how only a few thousand shares in under an hour can move the price of this stock.\n\n[The small spike notes a recent influx of newly purchased shares as a result of attention from a recent DD by u\\/BlackDiamondBear. Go check out his DD here.](https://preview.redd.it/eia69rqalx271.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6447ceb9d66e5bc959bf37566cf571abd0aab6a)\n\n\"Well Mr.Rook, why would this be a good investment long term?\"\n\nWell Sir Ape, I'm glad you asked. While this play could bring you THOUSANDS of tendies upon lift off, you're investing in a company that supplies clean fuel (Renewable natural gas, RNG) to companies like Amazon that require constant fueling for their trucks. Electric Vehicles just haven't reached the capacity to power long haul fleets, but RNG can. Amazon realizes this and has already signed a deal with CLNE to use 8% of its stations, validating their business. They expect CLNE to be worth much more than $13.49 in the future, otherwise they wouldn't have signed the deal. While calls are great and can make you money quick, you're hopping on a rocket that's trying to fuel for lift off. SHARES are the play.\n\nNow if we take into consideration the amount of shares that will come into play if the $13 threshold is passed, that's 1.862 Million shares, not including the calls at other strike prices above and below. See the below image to get the right idea:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Volume of Call Options at strike prices \\($9 to $15 on June 18\\)](https://preview.redd.it/azf6hz7dlx271.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=29496836b15d14f96f2b10ad025ec6412e2b1f43)\n\nThis is AMC 2.0, GME 3.0 apes, and you're right on time for lift-off. $100/share ain't a meme this time, it could reasonably happen. Also, imagine if DFV owned enough shares to own GME. Well our very own Papa Chad Dickens nearly owns 5% of the company. He could buy em out if he really felt like it. We're talking WSB buying out an energy sector company. Imagine the headlines on that. This stonk's already moved like 30 cents in the past couple hours with only a tad bit of support. If this gets real attention, we'll be swimming in the money, ape fam.\n\nGo see Dad's DD timeline here: [The true hero, NrdRage](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lye7st/nrdrages_friday_dd_ok_one_of_you_apes_needs_to/).
