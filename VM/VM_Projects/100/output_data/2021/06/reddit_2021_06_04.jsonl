Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "ns106d", "created_utc": 1622799015.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 702, "comments": [{"body": "Very slowly climbing out of the massive hole I dug myself into in early May.

To call it a bubble, or to simple point to the GFC and say \"same thing\" is certainly a sign of someone who has no idea what is actually happening and is using biases and short cuts in their thinking to form an opinion, just for the sake of having one.\n\nBasically after the GFC they just stopped building houses. Atleast affordable family houses. Most moved into building multi family apartments. It was a business move, because as you can imagine, not a lot of people could actually afford to buy new houses. \n\nThere was also a lot to tightening in Finacial regulations around mortgages and banks, obviously after a crisis of that size. So it became harder to get a loan, which further suppressed the demand. \n\nThen you add on restrictions placed by cities and municipalities about building, which has frankly gotten crazy. It's a pain in the ass for people to even build, let alone build what they want where they want. \n\nAlso the large number of houses left vacant or simple destroyed after the GFC.\n\nWell demand for houses finally started to pick up, but because of market dynamics, it takes years to bring back the workforce to meet market demand, it takes years to go through the regulatory cycle and get all these permits and legislation figured out in order to build new houses, and then you add on a demand shock like covid, which reduced the amount of houses on the market aswell (fewer people selling during a pandemic if you're wondering), and the natural result in all of this is rising prices as buyers compete over a shrinking supply of older homes. \n\nThis takes time as cities first need to allow people to actually build. Then companies need to attract people back to an industry that was not attractive to work for in over a decade. \n\nDon't expect the housing market to crash. A lot of people seem to think the market will return to some state of 09-15 for prices and it won't. That wasn't normal, that was an abnormally long bear market for housing. It's important people recognize that. \n\nReal-estate value has a natural trajectory upward.\n\nHowever, there will be an eventually catch up of supply to demand and a likely normalization of price appreciation. So the prices may stabilize and begin growing at a slower rate, which is a much more likely scenario, and one that could still take 5 years to play out. \n\n But the idea that real estate is just going to plummet again comes from a lot of recency bias. The GFC wasn't a normal event, crashing real estate wasn't a normal event.

Didn't know anything other than tech was hot, \"MAGA\" was starting out (I'm not a trumper nor republican, let's just get that clear), so as a joke I told my broker I was going all MAGA on my account - Make this Account Great Again. Bought even dollar values of Microsoft, Apple, Google, and AMD. Let it sit for 3 years, made ~30k from 45k seed money. Took out the 30k in February 2020 because I was buying a new-to-me truck and wanted a free truck, or at least a market-paid truck.\n\nWhen did I take the money out? When I wanted a large dollar item and didn't want a payment.\n\n2) Using the same 45k seed money I decided to try out writing options. Couldn't have picked a worse time to play around with a new strategy since the market after March 23, 2020 exploded upward and buy-and-hold strategies made a killing. Anyway, I digress. Got familiar enough with options trading that I could write calls and/or puts on held stocks or cash capital to make money without having to really worry about having to ever sell my initial stock holdings (meaning, the difference between \"1\" and \"2\" is if/when I take out money from \"2\" I'll still have the initial number of shares of stock to keep using as seed to make more money and only pull out gains made from options, where in \"1\" I had to sell some stock to cash out for my truck). I like this strategy better since once you know the ins and outs you can make fairly consistent weekly money.\n\nWhen will I take the money out? Same situation as in \"1\", but I'll still have all my original shares to keep using as \"seed money\". I've already made enough that my jet ski is now considered \"free\" as I made back in premiums what I took out to buy it initially. \n\n3) In one part of one of my 401k accounts I have the ability to write covered calls only, no puts and no exotic option strategies. This is nice because I can just hold stocks I want to hold long term for the next 20-30 years and write CCs on them to make extra money on the side of stocks going up, and use that option premium gained to buy more stock, and use that stock to write even more CCs to make even more money, rinse and repeat. Since this is a 401k account (also works for IRA and Roth accounts) I can't touch any gains for decades so I have no other option than to buy more stock to keep compounding monetary gains.\n\nWhen will I take money out? When the govt says I can - typically around age 65.\n\nHopefully this overly long post helps you in some way.

So if buying calls at 145 for .4 cents, it must go higher than 145.4 for you to make money overall on the transaction. If it hit 160 you would make 160  - 145 - .4 which is 14.6. But then if your contract is actually for 100 shares, you make 1460. If the stock finishes below 145 you will lose the amount you paid ( .4 ), and if it finishes between 145 and 145.4 then you lose (final price - 145.4).\n\nEdit 2: this is the case if you exercise the calls. HOWEVER you can also SELL the calls to someone else if your position is improving BEFORE they expire. For example if you bought the calls when it was 100, but now the price is up at 140 and there is still 2 weeks left to get to 145, your option contract is now worth more, and people will be willing to pay for it. As a replier said, the premium may NOW be .6, even though you bought at .4 . The option is now yours to sell if you choose (pun intended), so you can sell at .6 and collect the .2 per share (which will be 20).  Overall this is what most people do because others/the market will pay a premium on the chance that it keeps going up, while in reality it may just be 50/50 by the time you sell or maybe even lower in your opinion if it\u2019s hit its ceiling.

Gamma increases the Delta as the stock price moves meaning the Option value increases faster as the stock prices move more.

{"title": "Another Blackberry Love Story. Sweatpants guy.", "selftext": "It's true what they say - you never forget your first. \n\nIt's 2007 and I'm working at Future Shop as a retail sales associate in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada up by Conestoga Mall. I've been assigned to sell in the home theater department alongside some veteran TV-pushers and I'm in wayyyy over my head. I'm trying to learn about things like HDMI gold plating and 720p vs 1080p...or was it 1080i? Shit. I dunno. Read the tiny sticker at the bottom and act like you know some stuff. Gesture at the screen and crank that volume on the audio until their ears bleed. That's the ticket.\n\nI'm doing my very best just to keep up but it's obvious that I'm just maybe a little too nice to be in sales. I won't sell hundreds of dollars of add-ons that a family man doesn't really need. I'm not going to push the product service plan (PSP...that word still makes me shudder) if I know that it's pretty much useless. My manager, an Indian dude with a silver tongue and an impeccable sales record, is being kind but really...he's regretting putting me in the highest commission department so soon. \n\nBut then in walks sweatpants-guy. \n\nHe looks pretty much like every other dude that cruises the aisles and asks a tonne of questions that lead nowhere. He's got an old stained shirt and some grey stretched-out sweatpants on. I have zero reason to give this guy the time of day. Nobody else bothers. My slick sales colleagues look through him and past him.\n\nBut I grew up poor. I know clothes don't make the man. So I strike up a conversation. Why? Because let's be honest, my sales are non-existent today and I need to have a chat with a real goddamn human being without awkwardly trying to steer the conversation towards buying some techno trash he doesn't really need. \n\nI talk to sweatpants guy for like 20 minutes. About anything and everything that isn't TVs. About my aspirations to become an airline pilot, how tough an industry it is and how broke I am. About living with my parents again.\n\nMy colleagues walk by shaking their heads. Waste. Of. Time.\n\nThen we both realize the time and sweatpants guy tells me why he's really here. He's the a tech director for Research in Motion and he needs \"...just like twenty really good TVs for a few boardrooms...like bigger ones\". \n\nI try to contain my excitement and point him towards a Samsung 48in or something like that. I give him the speech, on some level subconsciously apologizing for being so awkward. He sizes it up and says \"Huh. Okay looks good. I'll go for it.'\n\nIt's all I can do not to cry. \n\nI ring in the sale and for the first time in a very long time, I start to feel the slightest bit like my life is starting to turn around. \n\nThe next month when I get my paycheck, I walk over to Rogers mobile and put all my cash down on a BB Curve 8320. And mannn is it sexy. Buttons that click juuuust right. Remember those? Mmm yep. Track ball?? Wtf is this magic?? I was in love. \n\nOh. And a few weeks later, I quit my job at Future Shop (because let's face it, I was terrible) and  started my new chapter as a BB factory worker. The rest you guys already know from my last post.\n\nThat guy was just one of many BB managers who exemplified why I loved that company. A down to earth guy in sweatpants wielding crazy amounts of money, and choosing to back the little guy. \n\nStill gets me choked up a bit. \n\nStill holding BB on a Friday morning. \n\nCheers buds.\n\nTLDR; BB manager gives broke shitty salesman a shot\n\n**Again guys. Still getting some PMs here about me not being a legit BB stockholder. Same dude. Still a BB holder. Only got two stocks in my Wealthsimple and I ain't f*in selling.

{"title": "Current Price Action of GME is shockingly similar to the past two major run-ups and 'micro squeezes'. Also T+35/T+21 elaboration.", "selftext": "I'll start with the usual: I am not a financial advisor.  I do not provide financial advice! Everything following this is opinion/observation.  Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others.\n\nOBLIGATORY - BuY & HoDl!\n\nNow that that is out of the way, I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point.  The below have DD's that are a must read if you have not already; please visit their profiles and read their posts.  I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below.\n\nu/Criand:\n\n[1)]**The flurry of rules before the storm. GME might be hitting T+35 and T+21 next week**\n\n[2)]**Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup**\n\nu/myplayprofile - I am highlighting just one of their posts, but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME & AMC prices.  AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis post is focused on u/Criand's DD, which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day / 31 day FTD cycles.\n\nBasically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles, and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days.\n\nKey Points:\n\n* He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T+21 day FTD cycles, which have been shown to cause price surges, do not act the same way as they did during the $480 run and the $350 run.\n* Explains how the Feb-March $350 run was caused by a dual event of T+35 & T+21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another (back to back trading days)\n* Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to $350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at $350\n* He references u/yelyah2 DD, which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the $480 and $350 price run ups, returns to normal for about a week, and then spikes up massively again, initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes\n\nBelow is my furtherment of u/Criand's work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now.  Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.\n\nPlease click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat... EVER.\n\n[Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T+35 \\/ T+21 day price movements + 6 days \\(because it has only been 6 trading days since ](https://preview.redd.it/v8tmo6hdi5371.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77)\n\nNotes:\n\n* I am not sure why I called the $480 and $350 price run ups in the visual \"Micro Squeezes\", but thats what came to mind.  Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u/yelyah2 recent DD?\n* Yellow is micro squeeze 1\n* Blue is micro squeeze 2\n* Pink is the past 6 days\n\nAlright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.\n\nKey observations:\n\n* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points\n* In the aftermath of the January \"micro squeeze\" the Dec-Jan price floor of \\~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.     In the aftermath of the Feb 24th - Mar 10th \"micro squeeze\" the price floor of \\~$40 **TRIPLED**, and the new price floor was set at \\~$120 between Feb 5-25.  Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)\n* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that \"We can\u2019t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20->+80->+140? Or what if +20->+80->+20->+80?\"  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **\"could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?\"** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.\n* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.\n   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)\n   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)\n   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)\n\nAdditionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.\n\n* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%\n* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.\n* 770 / 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.\n* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \\~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.\n* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.\n* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely \"coincidental\" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.\n* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.\n* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)\n\nOh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!\n\nAlright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.\n\n**This is not my original post**", "id": "ns3883", "created_utc": 1622807404.0, "score": 3638, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 412, "comments": [{"body": "6/9....it's only fitting", "score": 883, "replies": [{"body": "This is the TLDR; it's all the DD I need! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 294, "replies": [{"body": "Double Dose?", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Diamond Dick", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20403791964054108}, {"body": "Is that you UPGRAYEDD ?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24884039163589478}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0777740553021431}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07164992392063141}, {"body": "If that's not wsb's golden, wet dream come true, I don't know what is.", "score": 43, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2235681563615799}, {"body": "Nicee.", "score": 38, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21799789369106293}, {"body": "420 on 6/9.

The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don\u2019t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can\u2019t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can\u2019t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d. For example, if we buy WKHS at \u201cmarket price\u201d, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short\u2019s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at \u201cmarket price\u201d which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share.", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10337775945663452}, {"body": "No dates, but I like 69", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23886163532733917}, {"body": "Nice", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33782798051834106}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1546468287706375}, {"body": "Damn I love GME", "score": 194, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1293623149394989}, {"body": "This sleeping giant will awaken soon, tendies will be copious, wives will cower.", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "Wives boyfriends...

Here\u2019s some treats before I go on.  \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\n\n\nSo what is special about this stock and why the date?  \nWell, some rubes went and built a Goldberg machine out of options expiring on 6/18.  If this thing goes off, there will be so much gamma squeezed out that your new green dildo will make Bruce Banner feel inadequate.\n  \n\nCLNE has a float of 145 million and had been sitting, flatter than your wife\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s abs, at around $8 for the past month, consolidating and getting all pent up like you when the missus goes on her weeklong trips \u201cto the grocery store\u201d.  \nPrior to yesterday\u2019s open, it had an open interest of 47,000 in 6/18 calls with strikes between $9 and $15.  \nAs of typing, that range now has 69,000 OI (nice!), 65,000 OTM, which means the squeeze potential has only increased with yesterday\u2019s activity.\nThe most striking (HA!) of these numbers is the 29,000 calls aimed at a share price of $13.\n\n\nSure seems like someone knows or is planning something I don\u2019t know about...  Either way, it is set to go off, like you when the missus...\n\n\nEven before hitting that lucky number 13, calls representing 26 million shares, **18%** of the float and **500%** of the 10-day average volume prior to yesterday, should be hedged.  When it hits $13, 29 million more shares in calls become ITM and the volume beast will begin shitting out green dildos that it will consume to shit more in a shit ouroboros that will fuel the ape shit ship back to the moon.  \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude80  \nYesterday was just a preview of what will happen as more of those strikes are reached. The daily volume exceeded **600%** of the previous 10-day average and that resulted of a share price high of $9.74, **19%** higher than previous close. \n\n#THE PLAY  \nOkay, fair warning, this part pains me to write a bit because it almost doesn\u2019t seem like a bet, but the most safe method, and what will fuel the squeeze, is to buy and HODL shares.  You should know the drill by now. \n\n\nThe reason shares won\u2019t quite scratch the gambling itch is because CLNE\u2019s ATH of $19 happened just back in February, and it hasn\u2019t dipped far below its current level in five months. [It also has a price target of somewhere between $17 to $18, depending on the analyst.  ](https://finance.yahoo.com/research/stock-forecast/CLNE?symbols=CLNE&ncid=qsprelated_bl1fruji100)  \nThis means that even with its recent rise, there is not much downside, and the upside is huge even if the gamma squeeze does not play out.  The feeling of holding is not quite the same when there is no apparent risk of your bags being -50% for a quarter of a year before you can break even, I know, but hopefully you can find a way to adjust to all the green in your portfolio.\n\n\nShares also benefit from a possible raincheck of the scheduled event should 6/18 fail to deliver.  \nWhile not quite as ideal, 9/17 calls have a whopping 20,881 open interest at the $20 strike which could grow into a similar situation should lower strike interest grow.  There is currently an OI of about 29,000 in the run up range from $10-$19 but it is not so nice and evenly distributed as it is on our magic date.  Worth watching though.\n\nOverall, shares should securely keep your tits below you, if that is how you like them.\n\n\nOptions are where the biggest upside is going to be, and boy is there a lot of potential.  Thanks to CLNE\u2019s month long power nap, premiums ~~are~~ were stupidly low for calls 6/18 strikes $13 and above.  A light breeze is all it took to make some of those ten baggers yesterday.  They still have plenty of room to run and premiums are still somewhat modest, all things considered.  Triggering the squeeze would send these to high heaven.\n\n#TL;DR\nGamma squeeze.

Decades away from meeting scale. \n\nRNG is here now, and is the alternative to long haul transportation. especially when the only feasible alternative is diesel. Yes, more facilities need to be built out but the infrastructure and technology is already there on scale. \n\nThe energy reallocation cannot be a one trick pony. Electrification will not solve every problem our transportation has. It will solve some, and RNG will fill in the gaps where electrifying is unfeasible. You can\u2019t just slap thousands of lbs worth of batteries on long haulers and expect it to work, let alone be economical. \n\nThe \u201cEV everything\u201d is a great slogan and receives great marketing, but it\u2019s actually useless when you try applying it to the actual problems that need solutions.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Huh, I have seen hydrogen cars, Toyota Mirais, driving around my town.

In NYC to install a run-of-the-mill solar setup on a townhome ranged anywhere from 80k-145k depending on the contractor.

I\u2019m assuming strip mining battery components is a clean business now is it? Strip mining components for solar and turbines is clean as well, given how much more solar+wind would be needed to achieve hydrogen production that is truly \u201cgreen\u201d? \n\nIf batteries were made by squeezing papaya peels together I\u2019d say have at and I\u2019d agree with you.

I agree with you, solar farms in sunny desert areas are a good and efficient use of the technology. The biggest issue there tends to lie with the politics in actually using enough of the land and investing the capital needed to scale these from the small setups that currently exist into what is needed on a large scale to supply power to enough households/commercial/industrial buildings nationwide. I also tend to have the same issue with the lack of nuclear in this country. The solutions we have right now are inefficient and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any will to make the changes on the industrial scales needed to make this work. \n\nI was also merely giving an example, and it was more so maybe a misinterpretation on my end. Solar works great in the southwest, but not so great in the northeast. I\u2019m frustrated with this non-stop agenda that green energy futures must somehow incorporate solar roofs on every house in America, when the reality is if there were enough solar farms properly set up, not a single roof would need actual panels. (Let\u2019s ignore storage issues of excess energies, as that\u2019s a whole other discussion that I don\u2019t believe has a solution given current tech)\n\nAlternatives ie. RNG will need resources to continue expanding, but the base is already there.  The infrastructure is already there to go cross country long haul on the technology. Electric isn\u2019t. The alternative is doing nothing (continue with diesel) while waiting for electric to become feasible. \n\nIf we\u2019re talking about SS halide batteries, they\u2019re still quite a ways away (if they can iron out the kinks and make the economies of scale work better than what\u2019s on the market today.) there\u2019s batteries with higher power densities, but they\u2019re also heavier. The big issue with weight on long hauls is that unless federal regulations increase the weight limit (doubtful) you\u2019re taking away capacity no matter which battery set up you go with. Whether it\u2019s 10,000lbs, or 8,000lbs, that is still incredibly expensive per load in that industry. RNG requires no extra weight on the other hand, and the existing Diesel engines can be easily converted (often times for free by the same companies supplying RNG).

{"title": "CLNE goes beyond the 6/18 event - this is great hold at a 50% discount \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15", "selftext": "You'd have to be blind to have not seen the chatter on here and other subs about $CLNE and the potential \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15 gamma squeeze event on 6/18. While the event is a realistic possibility and I'm buying more shares constantly to push it forward, the stock is also a great hold too.\n\nThe setup has been explained many times, and is basically a liftoff ramp up to an absolute rocket launch at the $13 price level, where 2.5 million shares worth of calls will be exercisable. They two keys are (1) shares must be bought to drive the price up, and low daily volume makes this drive pretty easy and (2) the call wall is firmly situated on June 18th, the target date.\n\n# But, this post isn't about the squeeze opportunity:\n\nIf you want to learn about $CLNE, I would recommend reading  the original DD from several weeks ago. There have been a couple of other good ones on here this week too. Here are some basics about the company that doesn't include the cocaine laden rants that most DD's are filled with. I've been chipping away at buying shares for weeks during this $8 strangle hold.\n\nIN short, CLNE takes Methane from waste sources like the dairy industry and landfills, captures it and converts it into (RNG) renewable natural gas, stores it, and then sells it. Their market focus is on selling to heavy transport/trucking and they position their infrastructure accordingly. \n\n* **Majorly superior to EV for this application for a few reasons.... Namely because it's faster to fill with RNG than to charge (time is money), batteries for EV's are super heavy (weight is money), and maintenance is the same as a standard engine (money is money).**\n* CLNE already has huge partnership with the likes of Total, BP, Chevron, LA mass transit, and **Amazon.**\n* **Amazon, as a part of their deal with CLNE, has the right to purchase tons of shares at the $13 price level. The price being the same  as the squeeze is coincidence.**\n* CLNE has been building their infrastructure out (stations, etc) with this in mind, purposely constructing them near Amazon warehouse/shipping centers. \n* Other common carriers have already started purchasing/converting fleets to RNG\n* Recently, California ports have started offering programs/subsidies to trucks that run RNG - part of their efforts to reduce emissions at the ports, improve air quality, and help the environment.\n* &#x200B;\n\nProduct, infrastructure, sales, partnerships.... What is it missing? Volume. Various shorts have been beating it down for months and some restructuring by Total as well (they still own almost 50 million shares, don't worry). Buy shares, hold shares, rake tendies.\n\nThe June gamma play is still in play, and very possible. Tons of posts about it and most of them are on point with their potential. Some hype, some cocaine mixed in, but most good hearted. Cow farts and all else aside, I like the stock and believe it to be a solid hold with a 2x - 3x price potential and an obvious call options run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(I am a 895 share holder before today, bought 105 more to even out 1,000. I will hold through the year at a minimum, probably longer.)\n\n^(Disclaimer - this is not financial advice. My mom feeds me fruity pebbles with a plastic spoon each morning.

This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.\n\n2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.\n\nOption one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back.
