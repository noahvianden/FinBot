Lets say that I bought apple many years ago for $100 a share ($100 at the time, but $25/share in todays prices) with the goal of selling at $800 a share. (so $200/share in todays prices). \n\nI could sell 2 year long options at a strike of $200/share, and if apple does not reach $200 a share by that 2 year period, I get paid to keep my position open. If it hits exactly $200 a share, then technically speaking I can still keep my position open as there is no benefit to exercising an option at the exact current price (apart from very specific cases). The part where it hurts you is when the underlying moves significantly above the strike price. If apple by that time closes at the very end at $240/share, someone will exercise the contract and I will have to sell at $200/share. But that shouldn't matter to the person selling, because their planned exit was at $200 a share anyway.\n\nFor an approximation of how the numbers work out, take the above example but use something like $175 instead of $200. Looking at today's prices (apple at ~133), a 06/16/2023 175c costs about $1000. So effectively, a holder of apple that wants to sell in 2 years at $175 can get paid $1000 to stick to that plan.

If Amazon were to purchase the maximum available shares offered, it would represent an investment of nearly $200 million.\r  \n\r  \nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on Bloomberg's report beyond pointing Insider to the financial filing. A Plus spokesperson also declined to comment.\r  \n\r  \nPlus, based in California, is one of many companies that is working to create driverless systems. The Amazon partnership could eventually help Amazon remove the need for human drivers. This is just the latest example of the retail giant exploring what a future that does not rely on human delivery drivers could look like. This time last year, Amazon agreed to buy Zoox, self-driving taxi for over $1 billion. Amazon's autonomous robotaxi was unveiled later that year.\r  \n\r  \nBy using Plus' technology, Amazon could also eventually help overcome a national labor shortage that has heavily impacted the trucking industry, forcing delivery delays and rising transportation costs. For now, the system \u2014 PlusDrive \u2014 still requires a licensed driver.\r  \n\r  \nBut that could change in coming years. PlusDrive is Plus' first product and it operates similarly to Tesla's \"full self-driving\" software, which requires a licensed driver to keep their eyes on the road in case the system malfunctions or needs intervention. Plus CEO David Liu told Insider's Mark Matousek the company hopes to sell a product that does not require a driver by the end of 2024.\r  \n\r  \nRead more: This $3 billion autonomous-trucking startup is riding the SPAC boom by taking a page from Tesla's playbook\r  \n\r  \nPlus started delivering automated-driving systems for semi-trucks earlier this year to companies in US and China.

A lot of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal post:\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.\n\nLast October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger.\n\nTo summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.\n\nThere's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.\n\nSo why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.\n\nThat's right. A 1.67T company is tapping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.\n\nProof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\\_source=yahoo-host&utm\\_medium=feed&utm\\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)\n\nSo we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company.\n\nProof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)\n\nSo, let's list them out...\n\nCatalysts:\n\n1. $XLNX Merger\n2. $TSLA contract\n3. $GOOG partnership\n\nThis is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price.\n\nSo what am I suggesting?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share\n2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)\n\nIs there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$AMD 2D time Frame](https://preview.redd.it/ueoex1s30q671.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.\n\n[1 week time frame](https://preview.redd.it/9f80a7ur0q671.jpg?width=2440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c)\n\nSo. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...\n\nWe've got 3 approvals that have to happen.\n\n1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.\n2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems\n3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.\n\nWhere can you verify these dates? I encourage you to google it. There is a SA article with them written down, but due to WSB rules I cannot post the link here. I highly suggest googling that data before you enter the trade.\n\nWhat is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger.\n\n[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)\n\nHow is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)\n\nSo how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.\n\nSo what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert).\n\nBuying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.\n\nI am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.\n\nAs a disclaimer. I don't take responsibility for anyone's gains and losses. While I am in this and have put my own money on it, I do not promise 100% sure success. Only my own idea of what will happen.\n\nMy position screenshot is below. I do edit out my current value and cost basis. I hope you don't mind but I am a relatively private person. My positions are not for everyone. I change them dynamically depending on how the stock is moving between dates. Please do not use my own as a template for yours.\n\n[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/51me4r197q671.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2586486263ca15acef28f83f66a9796607d37f57)\n\nUpdate: the UK regulator issues approval on 6/29. I don't know how much farther the trade goes in the short term. This is my last update. Best of luck everyone.

In other words it is total bull shit.\n\nWhen a contract moves from OTM to ITM, a conversion takes place and that extrinsic value gets converted to intrinsic. For example. If a call closes at 90$ on the last day and the original strike was for 85. Then the value of that contract is 5. And wall street will always buy it for about 5. If you had to sell it to someone for 4.9 because you can't execute it wall street will always buy it because they instantly make the difference in price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf a contract becomes ITM well ahead of the expiration date, you start getting intrinsic value dumped into your extrinsic value. A lot of times that can be a lot more than the extrinsic. In the case of AMD, the historical IV was very low due to it being sold off for a year.  This caused it to not have many variations in price and the premiums call sellers were getting was very low. This means you can quickly outpace your premium costs for buying the contract. That's why I seek out low IV. Not high IV like $GME. That needs something like a 20% move to break even on contracts.

{"title": "ReconAfrica DD \u2013 Early stages of what is setting up to be the largest oil discovery in decades", "selftext": "This is a DD for a company, Reconnaissance Energy Africa (RECAF) I have been following since mid-January. I haven\u2019t seen it discussed on this sub because it\u2019s market cap is only 1.54 Billion USD.\n\nThere is A LOT of DD on this company out there that takes weeks to really go through. I\u2019m not going to even try to cover it all, but basically ReconAfrica is an oil exploration company that recently discovered and has 90% rights to the largest undeveloped onshore basin in the world right now, the Kavango Basin, with total petroleum generating potential that\u2019s north of 120 billion barrels of oil. Given it\u2019s current market cap, I believe ReconAfrica is one of the most undervalued stocks in the market, a potential future 10-100 bagger.\n\n**Some history on the ReconAfrica**: the company was taken public about two years ago. Back then, all it really had was an aeromagnetic survey showing what the company interpreted to be extremely deep sedimentary basin in the countries of Namibia and Botswana. On the basis of this survey, they had the foresight to purchase drilling rights to over 8 million acres of land for very cheap. Last year Recon purchased a drilling rig and shipped it to Namibia to get more detailed stratigraphic data. The company commended drilling the first well in January/February and are currently midway through the second well.\n\nThe preliminary results have been very bullish. I am not a geologist but as I understand it, an active petroleum system needs to have a source rock, a seal, and reservoir, and traps in order to be viable. With the data released in the past two months being even better than expected, it looks like all of those components are present and there is potential for huge amounts of extractable oil. A full suite of results from the core samples in the first two wells is expected to be released soon. In future wells, they plan to target an actual oil trap using the seismic data. By the end of 2021, they hope to be entering discussion with Joint Venture partners.\n\nGeologically speaking, the Kavango basin is similar to the Permian Basin in Texas (which has over 50 billion barrels of oil and is currently producing 5 million barrels of oil per day). However, the Permian acreage is Texas is divided among dozens of companies. The largest of them Diamondback (FANG), Pioneer (PXD), Concho (CXO), and EOG all have market caps in the tens of billions of dollars. In contrast, ReconAfrica has the rights to the entire basin all to themselves. That is what makes it an incredible opportunity in my opinion.\n\nI think the company (currently trading in the $9-$10 range) could be a $100-$200 stock by next year once the exploratory drilling and seismic program is completed and the company enters Joint Venture (JV discussions). Long term, I can see the company being a next oil supermajor. Again, for one company to own the drilling rights to an entire basin like is extremely unique.\n\nAnother bullish tailwind for Reconnaissance is that Western supermajors have been cutting oil exploration expenditure due to environmental pressure from environmentalists and the EIA. However, demand isn\u2019t going to significantly decline for decades and we could be in for a [major oil supply crunch](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Arabia-And-Russia-Warn-Of-Major-Oil-Supply-Crunch.html). The company is in the perfect position to capitalize on a good macroeconomic environment for oil and gas\n\n**The bear case:** Some of the biggest risks are\n\n* Extreme opposition from foreign activist groups who want to stop ReconAfrica and Namibia from developing in the Kavango. They\u2019ve spread rumors and misinformation on social media, published hit pieces in newspapers, organized marches, etc. If they are successful at slowing down or stopping ReconAfrica that would obviously be bad for the company. But I don\u2019t believe their criticism is justified. If ReconAfrica is successful, you can bet that it will hugely benefit Namibia and Botswana which in turn will be massively beneficial for the people and wildlife. There will be more money to raise people out of poverty, increase access to healthcare and education, support conservation areas, etc. So far, ReconAfrica and the governments have been committed to protecting wildlife, the livelihoods of local people, following international best standards, and promoting economic development.\n* ReconAfrica has no *proven* reserves yet. We are waiting on more data from additional stratigraphic wells and seismic activities before the company can formally declare it has oil and gas reserves, meaning we still aren\u2019t 100% derisked yet. However, given that we now have two exploration wells with thick marine source rock, carbonates, and a rift basin full of convention traps the play has been significantly derisked.\n* Governmental risk. Of course it is ultimately up to the government and people of Namibia and Botswana to decide how they want to develop their natural resources. However, [Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/03/africa/namibia-oil-exploration-intl-cmd/index.html) and [Kavango East Government Bonifasius Wakudumo](https://www.namibian.com.na/102332/read/Oil-driller-announces-petroleum-system-at-second-well) are both excited and supportive of ReconAfrica\u2019s activities in the Kavango Basin. And just last week, ReconAfrica and NAMCOR (Namibia\u2019s national oil company) [signed a partnership to work together on exploring and developing the Kavango basin](https://reconafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ReconAfrica-Press-Release-061421.pdf).\n\n**Disclosure:** I am long RECO with shares I bought in January.

It would be the potentially last gigantic onshore conventional oil find (no fracking!)  And their recent moves - digging water wells for the local villages and donating $1M to the Namibian COVID vaccine effort - is telling me that they are building relationships with the local people because they're in it for the long haul.\n\nConsider this - their original plan was to not release any information until all three test bores and the 2D seismic was complete (Q4 2021) - but that was blown up when their partners in the Namibian government got a \\*little\\* excited during an interview and let it slip that they found oil and gas shows in the first bore.\n\nSince then it has been a firehose of information, from the first borehole showing 50% more source rock thickness than originally estimated, to the second borehole showing oil and gas in the first third of the bore.\n\nThat first well was just supposed to be an exploration well, but it was just revealed that it was capped in a way that they could potentially come back and test for oil production.\n\nMore information is likely coming in the first week of July - including potentially lab results from the first borehole, and initial results from the second, as well as preliminary 2D seismic results.  This week may be the last time to get in sub $10 (if it ever goes back there... just checked, it's at $10.49).\n\nAnother potential investment opportunity would be RNSFF - which will be merging with RECAF likely Q3 2021.  Every share of RNSFF gets you 0.046 shares of RECAF, which means it's been trading at a 3-5% discount recently.\n\nGood luck to all!
