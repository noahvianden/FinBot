{"title": "I analyzed all the controversial trades made by Senators in the 2020 Congressional insider trading scandal. Here are the results!", "selftext": "**Preamble:**  The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. There have been multiple stories covering the 2020 congressional [insider trading scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) where Congress Members allegedly used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash. But none of the articles talked about the financial implications of those trades and whether the retail investors could have front-run the market using the disclosed data. \u00a0Basically, what I wanted to know was\n\n**How much did the Senators save by offloading their positions before the crash and could I have done the same?**\n\n**Where is the data from**: efdsearch.senate.gov\n\nFor my [previous analysis into congressional trading](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/copy-top-stocks-of-the-week-614493), I used data from senatestockwatcher.com. But not all the transactions are captured on the website and I wanted to match exactly with the trades reported by famous journals. efdsearch.senate.gov is the United States official website where Senator, former Senator, and candidate financial disclosure reports are available. Some of the data is available as a scanned file and some in normal HTML format. I had to manually transcribe most of the data used in this analysis.\n\nIn case you are wondering about the time delay between the actual transaction and reporting, Congress Members are expected to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/). The median delay in reporting that I observed for all the trades was 28 days.\n\nAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThere are multiple factors at play here.\n\nTimeline: On January 24, 2020, the Senate Committees on Health and Foreign Relations held a closed meeting with only Senators present to brief them about the COVID-19 outbreak and how it would affect the United States. I am considering this as the start time for my analysis. Any sale made by the senators after this point up to Feb 26 is considered. (I did not consider sales beyond that point as SPY dropped 8% during that week. My assumption here is it\u2019s realistic for any person be it a normal investor or a Senator to panic sell after seeing that drop). For reference, SPY dropped an additional 25% over the next 3 weeks! \u00a0\n\nSenators under consideration: I have considered trades done by 4 senators in my analysis. I have focused on these 4 as all of them were investigated by [Justice Department and the FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) following the trading scandal.\n\n1. Richard Burr\n2. Kelly Loeffler\n3. James M Inhofe\n4. David A Perdue\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2tks1zpv1371.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=7630f748040d062eb6cff81bde8c07de2497b2bb\n\nDavid Perdue sold 44 times ($3.49 MM) in the 33 days following the closed senate meeting. Interestingly James Inhofe only transacted 8 times but the combined value of shares he sold was a whopping $4.12MM. The most ironic part is that Richard Burr who was under investigation the longest and had to step down from the intelligence committee due to the scandal had the least dollar volume in the transaction ($1.1MM).\n\n**Results:**\n\nBefore we dive into the overall amount saved by the Senators and the retail investor side of the analysis, let\u2019s see what were the best trades made by the Senators during that time period. \u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5u292rqv1371.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a9f526cb3c4bc68ced13f07c1fd1eddd86021d9\n\nDavid Perdue absolutely killed it with his stock plays. He is present 7 times in the top 10 list and his best play, Caesars Entertainment reduced 83% after he sold his position. Fun Fact: if a stock reduces 83%, it has to go up 488% just to reach back to its initial price. Another interesting observation from the chart is that senators mainly sold stocks related to the entertainment and hospitality industries which were the most severely affected industries due to the pandemic.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/arf7c6bvv1371.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=d14f4082ae081911ce365331d82a6845278499d2\n\nThe above chart showcases the amount of money saved by the Senators due to front running the market crash. David Perdue saved an insane $2.2MM with his stock sales. I also kept a multiple of annual Senate salary to showcase the scale of impact they made to their portfolio because of the trades.\n\nFinally, we come to the million-dollar question. **Was it possible for the retail investors to follow these trades and front-run the crash?**\n\nThis is where the analysis gets a bit tricky. 88% of the transactions were reported by March 3rd but if you consider it in dollar values, only 52% of the transactions were reported (some of the high-value transactions were reported only after the crash). But if you were an astute investor, you could have observed a stark difference in what the Senators were saying and how they were trading. For Eg. [Richard Burr reassured the public that the US was well prepared](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/5/14/21258560/senator-richard-burr-coronavirus-insider-trading-scandal-explained) for the pandemic but then sold $1MM worth of stocks in the next two weeks. I know that hindsight is 20/20 but if you could have connected these two dots, then you could have saved up to **25% of your portfolio** before the crash.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** There are some limitations to the analysis.\n\na.\u00a0I have only used one black swan event for the analysis. A better method would be to analyze the stock trading pattern over 3-4 major crashes and see if any pattern emerges. But the current limitation is that efdsearch.senate.gov has only data since 2012.\n\nb.\u00a0There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k \u2013 $200k). So, for calculating the transaction amount, I have taken the average of the given range.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I did not want our political views clouding our financial judgment. I could not find a single example where a retail investor or an institutional investor or even a hedge fund leveraging this information to make their trades (it might just not be public!). Another possible explanation here is that Senators might just have superior stock trading capability as [none of them were indicted for this and all investigations are closed now](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/richard-burr-stock-trades-investigation.html).\n\nHowever you view it, this analysis in addition to my [last analysis (which proves that Congress Members have better returns than SP500)](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/copy-top-stocks-of-the-week-614493) showcases that there is significant money to be made by following their trades closely!\n\n**Google Sheet containing all the data**: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmIpEkMrEWix30whYWkHg_mGypVBMQxYnx_sQYXkwz4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*\u00a0", "id": "nrd9ys", "created_utc": 1622726203.0, "score": 1245, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 181, "comments": [{"body": "I have a sub r/market_sentiment where I do similar analyses and track trending stocks.

The sentiment is dominated by gamers and crypto miners and if you are either, you know how they can be total zealots. Thats the biggest warning I can give you. Right now they are high on NVDA but the knife cuts both ways and if the tide turns, price will fall below reason as well.\n\nSee CD Projekt Red to see what happens when Gamer sentiment turns. They seem to believe that CDR is dead and all future games they make will fail. The price has been shredded despite the best financial year in their history, low PE (albeit cyclical), massive dividend, and re-alignment to make twice as many games going forward... But the sentiment is apocalyptic. They may as well had help make COVID in the Wuhan lab at this point given how people are talking about them. Which is perfect if you are a buyer now but not so much if you were in prior.\n\nSo back to NVDA, that is what you are facing. Crazy investors. Not bad folks, but just nuts. Can be a good thing if you take advantage of it but can also cut the other way.\n\nFundamentally NVDA in a good place business wise. But its not rainbows and unicorns. For one thing, they are currently heavily influenced by crypto mining. Whether you think thats good or bad is a matter of opinion. Im of the opinion that this is not good for business because if cryto goes away, they may well lose 50% of their rev... the risk is high.\n\nThe other issue is PC sales really havent gone anywhere in a while and there is a good chance that the move to streaming gaming will eat a huge portion of the gaming market especially consoles, down the road. I would imagine they (Sony, MS, NIN) are all eager to switch to cloud based streaming if they can to eliminate the high cost of consoles and charge monthly fees (and such). So just like how we switched from hard copies to downloads the last 10 years, we may be switching again to streaming in the future. This would be horrible for video cards.\n\nNow I am not saying all the above will happen and maybe you dont plan to hold that long anyway. But that would be my bearish argument for a long hold.

Then I read this post which revalidates my group think. :)\n\nI got into MAXN after the split with SPWR. I was holding SPWR, and ended up with shares of MAXN because of the split. When it first split, it started trading at around $20. Then over the next month it slid all the way to $13. I think this slide was the market coming to terms with the polysilicon contract you stated.\n\nThen after that, MAXN went on a tear, climbing from $13 in September to a high of $50 in January during the clean energy hype. During this entire time, nothing about the fundamentals changed.\n\nThe big thing about MAXN is its origins. Back in the past, SPWR made its own solar panels and also installed them. SPWR split so that it could separate the margins from its two businesses. Now SPWR competes directly with companies like RUN and MAXN competes directly with companies like SEDG.\n\nThe reason I love MAXN right now, despite its headwinds, is the P/S ratio. MAXN has a high quality solar panel. According to this website, the SEDG and MAXN solar panels are very comparable in cost per watt: https://www.solarquotes.com.au/panels/comparison/compare-solar-panels/\n\nDespite all this, the P/S ratio of MAXN is  0.86 as I believe investors are scared of the inflationary margin pressures. SEDG operates at a P/S of 8. The bear case here is that CSIQ and JKS (both panel manufacturers) also operate at P/S levels comparable to MAXN. So what really makes MAXN different?\n\nLike said above, I think if you believe in the company leadership, a change in their contract at the end of 2022 will see a sharp increase in margin and profitability.

Lots of room to grow, and investing in agriculture can help bring diversification to your portfolio.\n\nTEX - Heavy equipment machinery company.

This is going to be super hot this summer, and with wide vaccinations we're seeing lots of travel and school reopening.

More volatile, but you can see that their revenues are sky rocketing as everyone is ready to break free of the burden of lockdown. DSG is similar in this vein, but BGFV could see more growth.\n\nCOF - Financial company that primarily draws revenue through credit cards and financial instruments.

Has put on a reliable 5% a month for almost 12 months straight. Only goes up, but has recently seen some pullback and consolidation.\n\nMTZ - Communications and infrastructure play. like PWR, solid steady growth over the past 12 months.\n\nGPI - Shortage of new cars will drive up the used car market. GPI stands to benefit from that as they own lots of dealerships throughout the US.\n\nAZO - Similar to GPI, but more of a \"pick and shovel\" play.

I have been reading and it seems that it is normal to have to change your trading approach every few years as the market changes. Specifically how you trade options, penny stocks, etc. Maybe value investing never changes, but if you are chasing high returns rapid, you are trying to capitalize on volatility. These are usually rapid plays, so your system is super important, FOMO only works if you watch a lot, AND if you get in early enough. The real question is why risk your money using a strategy (FOMO) that you aren't trained for- if you want to FOMO, train to be good at that strategy. For example, I am trying to learn how to fomo pumps, I check stock screeners, screen by volume, look for 130-200% Volume for 1-10day versus 365 day trading volume (average), and screen by \"biggest gains\" and \"biggest losers\". Question though, using AM-C as an example, this stock took off, when it hit 25 USD you had to ask, is it over, should i FOMO? If you FOMO'd you'd ride it to 50, then 70 right? The problem is, you are in uncharted territory- how the heck will you decide when to exit???? FOMOing inherently is really hard to \"maximize profits\". If you don't want to miss out on the 20-50% gains, develop a FOMO approach, pick stocks you think will breakout, or better yet read the meme stock lists and develop a strategy for each one. Then you have a system and the impulsiveness goes away...\n2. In the case of the G-ME, there has been months of information, DD, and discussion. The message appears to be buy and hold.

Lets assume Tesla makes $1 billion this year, $2 billion for the next three years, then $10 billion in the last year (just to give them a terminal value - that value represents all future profits).  If the discount rate is basically 0% like it is right now, TSLA would be worth $17 billion.  If the discount rate was 5%, the value of TSLA goes down to $14 billion since those future earnings get discounted by a compounded rate.  That would reduce the value of TSLA shares by about 17.5%.  The further out into the future you are projecting profits, the more the discount rate impacts them.

Taken together, the developments put in doubt Tesla\u2019s vaunted position and success in the world\u2019s biggest electric vehicle market.\n\nThe company\u2019s monthly net orders in China dropped to about 9,800 in May from more than 18,000 in April, according to a person with knowledge of the data. The sharp drop reflected a drastic shift in Chinese consumers\u2019 appetite for Tesla, whose founder Elon Musk has celebrity status there. Orders spiked in January after the release of the Model Y SUV, and then slowly eased off before cratering last month. In March, Tesla had 21,000 net orders.

{"title": "Rite Aid ( $RAD ) : One of the Next Meme Stocks to Soar is a Former WallStreetBets OG Favorite", "selftext": "As meme stocks continue to melt up higher, an old meme favorite from the past is ready to join in on the fun --- That stock is Rite Aid ( RAD ).\n\n**Some Basic Information**\n\n* Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders.\n* There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy.\n* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.\n* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.\n* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.\n* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.\n* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion\n* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.\n* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.\n* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.\n* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.\n* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share. (example - [https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor\\_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite\\_aid\\_no\\_matter\\_how\\_you\\_cut\\_it\\_it\\_is\\_the\\_right/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RiteAidInvestor_RAD/comments/m7haju/rite_aid_no_matter_how_you_cut_it_it_is_the_right/) )\n\n**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**\n\nOne significant contributor to Rite Aid\u2019s financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government\u2019s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.\n\nAt the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid\u2019s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.\n\nFinally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.\n\n**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**\n\nWhile Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.\n\nWalmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.\n\nA couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:\n\n* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability\n* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.\n\nBased on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.\n\nThe Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.\n\nIf you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.\n\n**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**\n\nRite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. The stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.\n\nAlso, as meme stocks continue to soar higher, Rite Aid is likely to benefit from such market activity as well. With only 55 million shares outstanding, RAD could easily see an exponential run higher should retail investors once again take an interest in this former WSB favorite.\n\n\\[OP's Position in RAD:  I own the followng long positions in RAD:\n\n* 400 July $28 strike calls\n* 50 LEAPS at various strike prices \\]", "id": "nr3jmz", "created_utc": 1622690020.0, "score": 261, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "And there are rumors about Amazon buying it to save their terrible online pharmacy project.", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Nice DD", "score": 28, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03562232851982117}, {"body": "CFRA Research group just stated today (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:\n\n# \"It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.\"", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I guess I can buy a little", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Rad", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.084375761449337}, {"body": "Buy a lot", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6011338233947754}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1754806637763977}, {"body": "Imagine Kramer having to turn an episode of Mad Money into $RAD Money", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Awesome!", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08671902120113373}, {"body": "I guarantee he goes to rite aid for his viagra", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07803285121917725}, {"body": "Cramer would shit a brick first.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30674561858177185}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1546839326620102}, {"body": "Please let this sub pull Rite Aid out of the fucking grave\n\n*edit: again", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Yes!

{"title": "Tilray (TLRY) and other weed stocks are exploding. This is the reason...", "selftext": "Cannabis stocks were strong yesterday and today. The reason for this is the company Amazon, which supports a bill in the USA to legalize cannabis across the country. \n\nThe Global X Cannabis ETF closed with a plus of over 5 percent, completely eliminating its losses from the previous day. The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF was up 3.04 percent. \n\nThe stocks listed in the USA Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY) (+11.90 percent), Cronos (+8.67 percent), OrganiGram (+8.33 percent) and Aurora Cannabis (+7.79 percent) stood out among the individual stocks out. \n\nCanopy Growth stocks were also in demand. They increased by 5.3 percent. \n\nThe cannabis sector received a boost from none other than Amazon. The online giant wrote in a blog post on Tuesday evening that it no longer wanted to test its employees for marijuana.\n\n\"And because we know the issue is bigger than Amazon, our Public Policy Team will actively support the Marijuana Opportunity and Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act) - a federal act that legalizes marijuana at the federal level, deleting entries in the Would enable criminal records and invest in affected communities, \"wrote Dave Clark, head of Amazon's Worldwide Consumer division, in a blog post. \"We hope that other employers will join us and that politics will get this bill passed swiftly,\" wrote Clark. \n\nOther cannabis stocks such as Hexo, WeedMD, Trulieve Cannabis, GrowGeneration, Curaleaf and Green Thumb also benefited from the Amazon announcement, but far less than the aforementioned papers. \n\nIn his April note, Jeff Bezos vowed to make Amazon the \"best place to work and the safest place to work in the world.\" You have to do more for your employees and you need \"a better vision\". Amazon hired a good 500,000 employees in 2020, as Bezos wrote in his letter.

{"title": "Once upon a time, I was a BB factory worker. BB saved my life. It might do so again.", "selftext": "Hey All,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm brand new to WSB but bear with me. Once upon a time, when I was very down on my luck, I walked into a temp agency and asked for any job they could give me. What they had was a factory assembly worker on the line at Blackberry in my hometown of Waterloo, Canada (yep...Canadian alert!). It was a 12hr job with day/night swapping shifts. It was a repetative, monotonous job putting screws into things and doing it all in style in a zero static white suit and blue boots. It was most definitely NOT what I had envisioned for myself for the rest of my life. However, that job would turn out to be one of the most rewarding short-term jobs I've ever had because I sat next to some truly wonderful people on the assembly line.\n\nWith nothing to do for 12hrs but shoot the sh\\*t, I soon discovered that I was sitting next to doctors from Iran, lawyers from Indonesia, CEOs from Pakistan. Each of them had come to this job out of desperation just like me. Each of them were deemed \"overqualified\" by most other jobs just like me. Each of them had worked hard, invested in company shares (BB had an amazing employee share program) and had made more money there than they could have dreamed. BB had given them the promise of a real future in Canada and you could see the passion they had for this company in their faces. Also, BB once a year rented out the Air Canada Centre (or Rogers or whatever the hell its called now...) and rented a rock band for their employees! Like...ALL of their employees...not just management. I saw ACDC, Steven Tyler, Van Halen and the Tragically Hip. All thanks to BB. They wanted to spread the love.\n\nSo I got over myself and how I wasn't where I wanted to be, and I used this job to give myself a crash-course on global politics from the amazing people I worked with. I learned about the so-called \"scary\" parts of the world and how beautiful they actually were. When the time came to leave that job and move on to other things, I left with a profound appreciation for hard-working immigrants and just how much dedication it takes to sit down at a factory bench with a $200k salary potential education, and screw things together for $14/hr. I'll never forget those people. And I'll never forget that company. Blackberry gave life, employment, education grants, city improvements and other amazing opportunities to my hometown of Waterloo. When the time came that Apple overtook them and Blackberry faltered, my hometown and the rest of Canada turned its back on them, and that disgusted me.\n\nTHAT is why I am investing in BB today. Not for a get-rich-quick scheme, but because I genuinely hold a special place in my heart for that company and can find way more emotional attachment to it than a TV channel I used to watch, and a place where I used to buy Ace Combat as a kid.\n\nTLDR; BB was once the bright future of Canadian tech industry, it carried me through tough times as an employee, and I respect it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*Update: Wow folks! What a day. I've never had a harder time trying to NOT look at my phone while looking after the baby as the wife was at the salon. You guys were so thoughtful and supportive today and I truly appreciate all the gifts, karma, props and personal stories. I was even stoked to find some fellow KW/RIM employees in the mix! So happy to see that this community is alive and well. I continue to value BB as a future major player and I'll hold my shares because I truly believe in what this company can do, and how we can help it succeed.\n\nTo the folks that thought I was a corporate plant or some sketchy conspiracy, I giggled a bit. I can assure you I'm a regular dude and this was a regular post. I hold a very MODEST amount of BB shares because that's all I can afford, but I know other folks invested heavily and I wish them the very best of success in the weeks and months to follow. As always, I can't give any financial advice. I'm not a pro. All I can say is invest in something you truly believe in - not just because it can make you rich. I'm a proud Canadian first and foremost, and I can't wait to see how this company can exceed all of our expectations no matter where we happen to live.\n\nAll the best friends!!! Thanks for making today one of the coolest and craziest days of my Reddit life! Much love to all of you :) BB to the moon!!!!\n\n\\*\\*UPDATE #2:  For all the posters who doubted that I actually held BB stock, here's a screenshot of the only three stocks I hold - BB, AMC (but I think I'll sell tomorrow for BB), and EMO.V (a really undervalued Canadian mining stock - I know \\*yawn\\*- but I've been holding for seven years and its finally moving!)\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/cF0Ht5v](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mykrr2E)", "id": "nrdbzc", "created_utc": 1622726363.0, "score": 7830, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 955, "comments": [{"body": "You son of a bitch, I\u2019m in", "score": 1570, "replies": [{"body": "Haha classic \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 293, "replies": [{"body": "SOAAAAAARRRRYYY BB GO BRRRTRR", "score": 135, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17509488761425018}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16079463064670563}, {"body": "From $140 we'll supply the whole fucking world with BlackBerry phones!

What a morning! Thank you all to those who wrote some very thoughtful responses and gave awards, it really made my morning and kinda made the dip in BB stocks hurt a bit less. \n\nI just want to clarify a few things here folks:\n\n1.) Nothing of what I wrote is financial advice of any kind. I just wanted to share a personal story and no WAY I thought it would move to the front page of WSB. I'm a late-comer to this, as a few have pointed out, this but I'm hoping for success just as much as all of you. Been at this for a short while and the biggest lesson I've learned is to invest responsibly and be willing to live with the consequences. That's all I can say. \n\n2.) I definitely have zero alterior or sketchy motives in commenting/posting. I hold a small amount of the shares and definitely am not set to make life-changing money from them. If you hold or buy lots more based on what I wrote, I wish you so much success and wealth and I'll be cheering you from the sidelines with my tiny amount... definitely not from some corporate office holding millions in my tightly clutched hands lol. But I won't ever encourage anyone to do one thing or another with their hard earned cash. Not my place. \n\n3.) I'm a proud Canadian first, and I also am proud of everything BB achieved. That is now and will forever be my only motivation. \n\nHopefully that clears things up because, to be honest, my wife and I were starting to get a bit sketched out by a few of the angry conspiracy comments in here.

You might've seen this weird little ticker called CLNE picking up some steam around here and wondered why. Back in March/April there was a very solid DD done about why this company is poised to grow. Will post link in comments \n\nHowever there's been a couple of things that have happened since then that turned this from a solid play into a potential gamma squeeze based off OI that won't send us to the moon...but to Saturn!!! \ud83e\ude90 \ud83e\ude90 \ud83e\ude90\n\nAmazon (yes that Amazon), made a deal with CLNE to fuel their trucks....and the best part? THEY ALSO AGREED TO HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY 50 MILLION SHARES (about 5%) AT $13.49 PER SHARE. EDIT: As /u/dazedstate pointed out I completely forgot to add that they ingeniously built their fuel stations next to Amazon warehouses. \n\nThe stock has low daily trading volume. This allowed certain institutions to hammer it down and keep it there (You know which ones they are). But it's also very easy to push around. How easy? Nrdrage was able to send the price up $1 by himself for under 250K as a demonstration.\n\nThe Median PT is $20!!!! that's literally double what it is right now!\n\n\nSO WHAT ABOUT THE GAMMA SQUEEZE?\n\nBased off that DD the OI for June 16C's @13 has reached 25.22K!! This stock has low volume so 2.5 Million shares reaching ITM would send it shooting up even further. Okay but the average volume is 6M...how does 2.5 million in the money drive it up? Because there would be so much demand at one strike price that there wouldn't be enough stock available at that price which would result in HF's and IB's having to do sweep orders to make up for all the calls they sold.....for those of you with more than one wrinkle... that means the price would keep going up and up until they had enough shares to cover their calls!! And once it hit's that level there's so much momentum it'll keep sky rocketing!!\n\nHere's a chart for those of you who like crayons. (In comments)\n\nThanks to some apes today it has broken out of consolidation. It's tough to see on the chart but the 3EMA has crossed the 8EMA also (stock go up). \n\nPositions: 60 shares @9.35\n4 6/18 13C (picture in comments) \n\nTLDR: STOCK HIT $13 WHICH EASY TO DO \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d GET ON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80GO TO \ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90\ud83e\ude90", "id": "nrkk9i", "created_utc": 1622745505.0, "score": 721, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "You forgot to mention that CLNE ingeniously built their stations near Amazon warehousing", "score": 138, "replies": [{"body": "I completely forgot about that part.

QNX has been installed and used in vehicles since 2004 and prior to that being utilized in telematics before it was purchased by Harman International Industries. \ud83d\ude80\n\nBlackberry acquired the company in 2010 from Harman and has continued leveraging QNX's assets in embedded systems for transportation, defense, medical, grids, robotics, and mobile devices. \ud83d\ude80\n\nIn 2012 BlackBerry released forward vision videos on what they believed to be the future of QNX and the automotive industry. In recent years this vision is coming to fruition no pun intended. Video linked below.\ud83d\ude80\n\nAn example of this forward looking mentality of the automotive industry is BlackBerry's recently awarded patent for methods and systems for autonomous vehicle refueling. Article linked below. \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor anyone that doesn't already know, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are applications built atop of QNX OS. And even Android Automotive will utilize QNX's components for securing the vehicle even if it's not directly used for infotainment. \ud83d\ude80\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY9AzUfSdKU)\n\n[BlackBerry Patent Application For Autonomous Vehicle System Approved: What's Next?

{"title": "Why short-sellers aren't inherently \"greedy\". Hear me out. (I'm not a short-seller)", "selftext": "Hopefully this doesn't get me banned. I'm not out to get anybody here, just trying to offer an alternative perspective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredentials:\n\nI'm a professional analyst. My undergrad is in Economics from Ole Miss. I have an MBA from Southern Methodist University.  I'm about to begin the CFA exam/study process. I started as a credit analyst for commercial banks, I worked briefly as a loan officer (I'm an awful salesman!), I've worked in portfolio credit risk management, and as a corporate financial analyst. I've analyzed the financial statements of thousands of companies. At work, I'm known as the guy who's not afraid to offer my view, regardless who might disagree. I've been the nail that stuck out and gotten hammered before. But for the most part, I've found my honesty to be deeply appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nContext:\n\nI pick value-stocks. I'm not a short-seller. For one thing, I don't have that kind of capital; and two, short-selling is HARD. REALLY HARD. I've talked with short-sellers who've been in that game for 30+ years. A wise one told me he was \"right\" about the direction about 80% of the time, but only gets the timing right about half the time.\n\nI'm not here to talk down to anyone. I'm not here to convince you what you should or shouldn't do with your money. And I'm not here to convince you to \"like\" hedge funds or anything of the sort. I'm here to try to convey what I believe to be true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArgument:\n\nThe way I see it, most short-sellers aren't \"greedy\" just because they bet against companies. Think about this. Short-selling has finite/limited up-side risks, and (theoretically) infinite/unlimited down-side risks. Stock prices can only fall closer and closer to zero, but as this sub has shown several times, there is no limit to the upper-bound of an equity-share price.\n\nIf I were incredibly greedy, why would I want to take that kind of bet? A rational greedy investor would only buy stocks because as the mantra here goes, stock prices have unlimited potential to move upwards \"to the MOON!\".\n\nIn my financial statement analysis classes, perhaps my smartest professor advised \"Short-sellers are ARBITERS OF TRUTH in the market-place. If you're analyzing a stock and you think you like it a lot, but it's heavily shorted, you NEED TO KEEP DIGGING, until you understand why it's being shorted. Short-sellers have to be the best analysts of them all. You need to be supremely confident in your analysis, and too, the timing (which is 100x harder to get right). The question for those going long on heavily shorted stocks should be \"What are the short investors telling us about this security?\".\n\nSee Michael J.

And no Odd Job, we all know that shit is for pussies.\n\n\u200b\n\nOK - now that that's out of the way....\n\nLet's talk about some things that stonks need to thrive, for you short term FD rainbow warriors who are obviously looking for somewhere to put your newly found crispy tendies that's guaranteed to pop (read: probably fucked too).\n\n\\Something fucky with the formatting has made everything listed below a #1 of a therefore seemingly eternal list. I can't count though so I have no idea.**\n\nTraffic/Sentiment - CLNE has rocketed (pun) into the fourth position in a list of tickers mentioned on Reddit today. \"So what, fourth is for kids with wrinkles\" exactly - but it came from nowhere - DEAR GOD YOU MIGHT GET IN EARLY. Yesterday it was bottom feeding with the likes of people who buy bath water off of onlyfans.com (hey guys, how are ya). Today it's riding high, passing the likes of an absolutely garbage weed production, another weed outfit that is actually a business, and the commander-in-chief of DoucheCoin itself.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sx218g50b4371.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=b459fe1b11fa9990865a1c23abe47c3f6462c406\n\nA catalyst... - I'm sure you've all seen the DD which I will link (here: DD). However, since I know you can't read that much anyway and you're just looking at the pictures, I will simplify it for you here and accompany that with an image of the options chain below. (Accompany means \"tag along with\" like when you get lucky enough to be the camera guy for Jefe and your \"wife\").\nCLNE daily volume is low and it's small/mid cap, shares purchases drive the price up quickly\nThere's a metric shit ton of options interest in the coming price levels, which started generating excitement today like a Britney CD insert at a middle school in 1999 (don't judge me)\nWhen the price hits $13, 2.5 million or so shares worth of OI will suddenly fall ITM and get exercised faster than your b-hole after 7 of those $1 chipotle melts from T-Bell fuck me are those good for $1\nNow, obviously that strike is the trigger for a major event, but the $10 - $12 levels are no joke either and will only accelerate the climb on June 18 and before.\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjn752u1b4371.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=649d6abf38c5098f4bcaaf3d9b792e2f2c2a0082\n\nVOLUME - So you're thinking fuck off retard, 2.5 million shares isn't even going to fill my gaping asshole since it hasn't recovered from my PLTR calls and UPST puts (FUCK UPST FUCK) and AMC had 17.38 billion shares traded today (overestimate, I haven't checked). 2.5 million is a TON for CLNE though - it would be 50% of an average day's volume, and in terms of $$$ that's about $32.5 million in equity\n(HOLY FUCK IT FINALLY MADE A 2) A very influential user on here who definitely likes the stock ran some actual, not retarded math and determined that a sweep of only $6 million or so of total capital would be needed, based on the order book on that given day, to push the price to that level and put the options ITM. That's only 550k buys or so. Will 550K shares purchased sustain it there? Obviously no, because rainbow bear homos will sell too, but the point is that it will take very little action (a concept which you're very familiar with) to get there.\n(what the fuck now it's 1 again) Shorts have been beating this thing down DAILY and the interest increases steadily over time. This isn't a play where we're going to see huuuuuge volumes of short shares, but it's still important to mention because when you use buzzy words like \"AI\" or \"equality in the workplace\" people start to feel good about what they're supporting. Here's an example from the stolen DD linked in this post:\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ysa9cxm2b4371.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2e78a7c75979d2764cae684515b49c264ddaca2\n\nNow let's talk about thing that are actually important, like competing technologies, farting cows \ud83d\udc04 \ud83d\udca8, and the future of heavy transportation:\nand absolutely zero travel centers of america, this section is going to be brief because I know no one fucking cares\n\nThe point of this section is that beyond this epic short term opportunity, this company is going to fuck long term and for legitimate reasons. This is not financial advice my mom ties my velcro shoes daily.\n\nCLNE is focused on heavy transportation markets and providing trucking with a fuel that isn't killing the planet faster than social media influenced justice campaigns. Let's review some alternative green energy technologies and talk about how they can (spoiler alert, they fucking can't) better serve this market\n\nHydrogen: no substantial infrastructure in the US, and if it does come it will be years/decades before it's developed enough to support network of highways for trucking\nHydro/Wind: lol wtf are you talking about how could that power a truck\nEV's: the obvious competitor here, and very feasible for consumer transportation. However, trucks are fucking heavy. Like heavier than your mom after [another] trip to Golden Coral for $10 all you can eat \"filet mignon\" (you know she says \"MIG-NAHN\" and you want to kill her for it). You know what trucks don't need? Substantial amounts of additional weight in the form of batteries dragging their efficiency down.\nSolar: I'm not even going to entertain this\nRNG (renewable natural gas, FUCK why are you here) requires a truck only to have its engine converted (read: not replaced) and it runs just like normal. The fuel is carbon negative because CLNE traps already existing bad gasses and repurposes them into fuel. Sources include dairy industry, landfills, and your PLTR wrecked anus.\n\nI found it very interesting that cow's farts \ud83d\udc04 \ud83d\udca8 are made up of the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crd55yl5b4371.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=b684309932543861cf0d6aa8251029a16e17bb5c\n\nThat has no bearing on my post, I just wanted to share it.\n\nAutism is really starting to take over so I'm going to wrap this shit up. You've got a company with mega partnerships with Amazon and others, heavy involvement from big players like Total and Chevron, an actual product, fuck loads of infrastructure, and good news coming out frequently. California's ports are already moving to provide subsidies to truckers for using RNG and are integrating the fuel into their processes.\n\nTL;DR\n\nCLNE is sitting at $9 per share (52wk high around $20) after months of beat down from shorts like SHITADEL and Blackstone, moves on very little enthusiasm (different than orgasm), and is only a small amount of volume (read: apes) away from a huge series of circuit breakers on the ride upward. RNG has a longer term future than this play, so there's something for everyone.\n\nOh and Cramer doesn't like the stock.\nEDIT: HOLY SHIT I almost forgot to say Ultra-Bull as promised. I have no fucking clue what this chart means, but the word triggered me as I mentioned before and I liked the looks of this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bd4j5ug7b4371.jpg?width=787&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7203aa9d5e0cbc0189c15b77500c42d3e5b307b\n\nDisclaimer: You know the drill. \n\n\nShit I forgot rockets too \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "nrq2i4", "created_utc": 1622760007.0, "score": 380, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "How much coke and y u ain't share none", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Somewhere between a lot and a fuck ton.

As someone in the industry, do you know if they are in fact carbon negative?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In this case carbon negative is a bit of a misnomer. They're not carbon negative in the way most people think (ie sucking carbon out of the atmosphere like a tree or Aether Diamonds) but they are carbon dioxide equivalent negative. The greenhouse gases emitted through the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) are less than those emitted by the feedstock (methane) if it were left alone. \n\nSince different greenhouse gases have different warming potentials they are converted to carbon dioxide equivalents (1 metric ton of x = y metric tons of CO2) for the purposes of comparison. Methane (cow farts, manure, etc) has a CO2e of roughly 30. \n\nSo when RNG is made from methane some of it goes into making trucks go vroom and some goes into the atmosphere as CO2 (not as potent as methane). When you leave the cow shit alone, it sits there happily producing methane and roasting us to death. \n\nThe big potential for RNG is not in reducing emissions (which it does do) but in waste management. It literally turns shit into cash. \n\nIt is also a bitch to remove methane from the atmosphere so it's better if there are any emissions, they are CO2 rather than methane. Atmospheric methane's only real sink is bacteria in the soil (most commonly found in forest floors). There are machines that can scrub CO2 from the atmosphere and turn it into diamonds. All we got for methane is a bunch of trees close together. \n\nSo go invest in RNG and \ud83d\udc8e\u270a some \ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf33.\n\nEdit for legal purposes: I am not an investment trade-y person, none of this constitutes insider trading, I'm just a tree-hugging nerd who doesn't like when the planet burns down around them.
