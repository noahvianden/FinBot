{"title": "Call Options 101", "selftext": "# Call Options:\n\n>**This post is intended for beginners that don't know the basics yet. I have simplified things and covered the only basic ideas.**\n\nA **call option (or just \u201ccall\u201d)** is a contract that gives you the **opportunity**, **not obligation**, to buy **100 shares** of a stock, bond, commodity or other financial asset at a specific price (**strike price**) by a specific date (**expiration date**). The financial asset in question is the **underlying asset**, you profit when the underlying asset\u2019s price increases.\n\n**Example**:  You buy a $100 call option for AMD that expires on July 10th. With this  call option, you have the right to buy 100 shares of AMD at $100 per  share before end-of-day on July 10th. If the price increases to $120  before your expiration date, you can still buy the contract at your  original $100 per share price.\n\n# Premiums:\n\nThe premium the money you need to pay the seller of the option in **exchange for the contract**, obviously they need to make money too. A premium **increases** your **breakeven** price, as it is an additional cost.\n\n**Example**:  Your $100 AMD call has a $3 premium. This means, that for each of the  100 shares in the contract, you owe $3 to the seller. $3 x 100 = $300.  In exchange for this premium, the seller gives you the call option.  Therefore, in order to breakeven, you now need $103 share price for AMD  because if it were to only go up to $100, you\u2019d still be out of pocket  due to the $300 premium paid. If the stock price goes to $104, you have  made a profit, as it is higher than your $103 cost per share.\n\nIf the AMD share price **dips** lower than your $100 contract (known as **Out of the Money or OTM**), **you do not have to buy the 100 shares**. Call options give you the **right, not obligation**  to purchase the shares, at most you will lose the premium paid, but you  won\u2019t have to buy the 100 shares. On the other hand, if the share price  **increases** (known as **In the Money or ITM**), and you cannot afford to buy the 100 shares you can then **sell your contract to someone else**. **Contracts can be sold prior to your expiration date.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This is how you\u2019ll see people write their position: **AMD $100c 7/10**This translates to an AMD **call** option, with a **strike price of $100** and an e**xpiration date of July 10th.**\n\n# Selling a Call Option\n\n**Sell to Open vs Sell to Close:**\n\n**Sell to Open:**\n\nA Sell to Open order is a short option, you're writing (selling) a new option contract with the hopes that the underlying asset price will drop making the contract expire worthless and allowing you to collect your premium (profit).\n\n**Sell to Close:**\n\nA Sell to Open order involves writing (selling) a new options contract, in contrast a Sell to Close order is used to sell an options contract you currently own.\n\n*There are different ways to profit from a position:*\n\n* If the underlying asset price of your call option increased, you could wait till the expiration date and exercise your right of buying the shares at the strike price. After which you could either hold or sell the shares for a profit. \n* Otherwise, you could execute a Sell to Close order, your position will be closed and the profits will be automatically added to your account. This option is simpler and common among investors as it helps avoid commissions associated with buying/selling the underlying asset.\n\n**Covered Call Options:**\n\nA covered call when you write (sell) a call option of an underlying asset you currently own (covered). The idea is that you don\u2019t mind holding an  underlying asset long term and that you believe it\u2019s price will remain  stable over time or at most decrease. So, you write (sell) call options hoping they expire worthless (below strike price) meaning you keep the shares of your underlying asset while collecting the premium paid by the buyer. The writers (sellers) profit on covered calls is the premium paid by the  buyer.\n\n**Naked Call Option:**\n\nA naked call is when you write (sell) a call option without actually owning any of the underlying asset (uncovered). Naked call options are like shorting a stock, the seller (writer) of the naked call is speculating that the price of the underlying asset will go down so that they can collect their premium.\n\nNaked calls are very risky as they expose the seller (writer) to theoretically unlimited losses. Lets imagine you write (sell) a naked call option. If the price of the underlying asset exceeds the strike price and the buyer of the naked call exercised his right to buy, you as the writer (seller) have the obligation to purchase the shares at market price in order to provide them to the buyer.\n\n# Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Value\n\n**Intrinsic:**\n\nThe intrinsic value of an option is how much it would be worth if the time ran out and it expired right now.\n\n* If you would make nothing, then the intrinsic value = 0\n* If you earn money, that amount would be the intrinsic value.\n\n>An option having intrinsic value is the same as it being In the Money (ITM).  \n>  \n>An option having no intrinsic value is the same as it being Out of the Money (OTM).\n\nCall options are In the Money if their current stock price are below their strike price.\n\n    Stock Price - Strike Price = Intrinsic Value / Value at Expiration\n\n**Extrinsic:**\n\nThe extrinsic value of an option is the difference between the premium and intrinsic value. It increases when market volatility increases.\n\n    Premium - Intrinsic Value = Extrinsic Value\n\nInvestors buy call options because they believe the price of the underlying asset will increase before the expiration date. The extrinsic value is the additional time and volatility investors pay for.\n\n**Time Value**\n\nCall option buyers expect the price of an underlying asset to increase over time, the more time left until the expiration date of an option, the more chance there is for the price to increase above the strike price. This is why some investors are willing to pay more than what an option can currently be exercised for.\n\n**Implied Volatility**\n\nImplied volatility (IV) is the other part of the equation when looking at an options extrinsic value.\n\nIt is expressed as a percentage of the expected, annualized one standard deviation range for the stock based on option prices.\n\n**Example:** IV of 10% on a $100 stock represents a one standard deviation range of $10 over the next year.\n\n>In statistics, one standard deviation accounts for \\~68% of outcomes. For IV, one standard deviation means that there is an \\~68% probability that the stock price will be in the expected range calculated using option prices.", "id": "npvykp", "created_utc": 1622559547.0, "score": 596, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "I'm starting with covered calls.

(Vets typically don\u2019t have a wide variety of stocks on hand, and understandably, many owners prefer things to be shipped to their home rather than having to come back for them in a few days time) This is apparently taking a lot of sales away from local vets, so Chewy is getting a piece of the pie from vets across the country, and aren\u2019t just competing amongst other brick and mortar pet stores.

People probably downvoted your comment for that, and skipped the wall of text I wrote below to explain their downvote. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nHere's a quick summary:\n\n- The Cybertruck looks the way it does because of first principles engineering: the \"looks\" are a necessary result of the stainless steel exoskeleton design, which brings numerous advantages the EV F-150 cannot possibly match:\n- Significantly lower production costs.\n- Significantly lower capital expenses: no paint shop, fewer body parts - main frame is made with the Gigapress.\n- Unibody design, which allows significant weight savings.\n- F-150 is body-on-frame.\n- Stainless steel exoskeleton enables ***much*** faster product cycles: only steel bending machines & welding robots need to be reprogrammed. With traditional aluminum trucks new sets of body panel dies have to be manufactured, which takes 1.0-1.5 years (!).\n- Much higher durability: no paint. There are  86 years old stainless steel cars around, in pristine condition.\n- Unparalleled protection of passengers, not just in crash tests, but all around.\n- The angled shape of the Cybertruck gives it unparalleled low drag coefficient, which increases its range vs. the F-150 that has a cabin with the usual flow separation problems.\n- Ford exaggerated the F-150 specs & the pricing, Tesla is sandbagging them.\n- Tesla advantage in battery production is unmatched - and this matters for pickup trucks with 150-200 kWh battery packs. The F-150 has a 180 kWh battery pack, and they can only make 20,000 of them in 2022. Ford plans to have a 60 GWh/year battery factory up by 2025.\n- Tesla plans to reach 200 GWh/year battery production from their own sources alone, at the end of 2022 ...\n\nFord is *brutally* outclassed in this endeavor & your prior comments missed most of these arguments.\n\nThe unconventional design of the Cybertruck was used not due to Elon's eccentricity, but for very good engineering reasons, and both owners and investors will reap the advantages of these decisions as Tesla takes over & dominates the EV pickup truck market unopposed...\n\nJust watch ...", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!\n\nEveryone is so hung up on the \u201ccyber\u201d branding that they completely miss the fact it was a consequence of the design not the impetus for it.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34160128235816956}, {"body": "How is it protecting passengers if there is no crumple zone?

I got maybe about 30000 miles or a little more out of it before it wore out beyond economic repair, so I came out ahead of what I could have done with a newer vehicle, but not by a huge amount.\n\nTeslas are designed to last a very long time, with low costs for maintenance and repairs from regular use, and as experience has shown, the resale value drops considerably more slowly than ICE vehicles.\n\nThe batteries are also designed to last a long time, and the way by which they \"wear out\" is typically a slow reduction in the amount of charge they can hold, which lowers the driving range of the vehicle. Even after a battery no longer holds enough charge for a vehicle, it could have many useful years as a stationary storage device (and then finally, many years later, to be recycled). This would tend to keep the value of the battery fairly high even in an old vehicle.\n\nEVs are now only a tiny fraction of all vehicles being sold, and ICE vehicles can often last 20 years or more - so there is a good chance that cheap old ICE vehicles will still be on the road (in decreasing quantities) for 30 or 40 years, unless they are eliminated by legislative changes (banning them, carbon taxes, etc.). Long before old ICE vehicles are gone, there should be robotaxis, which Tesla believes will be much less expensive to ride than the various costs (lease or purchase price, maintenance and repairs, insurance, etc.) associated with owning or leasing a vehicle.\n\nTeslas are also expected to become much less expensive to make, lowering the cost for purchase or for riding robotaxis.\n\nSo I don't think the advent of electric vehicles (including Teslas) is likely to make it more difficult for low income families to afford transportation.

Over150M (near 50% volume) shares traded hands at these prices.If you are checking the borrow rates [here](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/sndl), then you know the cost to borrow has gotten a bit more expensive as the day went on.\n\nPersonally I think this looks a lot like we have a solid $1 floor as the price line was tried 3 solid times, each time we broke the $1 line we saw a massive bid back up to $1. The shorts on SNDL don't have a lot of days to cover as shown [here](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=sndl&submit=Short+Quote). Short interest still looks around 15%. Nothing crazy, but has potential given any hype news.\n\nThe fact that the $1 floor seems to have held solidly is fantastic. Honestly I'm surprised. It has held the up channel very very well. Because of the lack of volatility (IV) you may have saw your options slightly decrease in value today. To me it was a good day to roll out my options. I took gains from the Jan 11 1.5s and rolled them into the Jan 18 1.5s on the drops near $1. I still don't meet the minimum for the side bar but I'm now the proud owner of 225 Jan 18 1.5 calls (just over 2k at my .09125 cost basis).\n\nThe rocket fuel here is the push towards Federal Legalization. Keep that in mind. I noticed a number of calls being written for $2 and $3 strikes today at the 18th expiration. That's a big move to hit that. I saw the $9 calls being written for Jul 16th. Again these are big moves, I'd stay modest in the 1$ - $2 range to be realistic.\n\nEdit: Amazon is onboard https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amazon-backs-federal-bill-to-legalize-marijuana-.html", "id": "nq36v4", "created_utc": 1622577906.0, "score": 334, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Yay!\n\nPS: *remembers his 895 shares at $1.87*", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "man im stuck with 1800@$1.83", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "2200 @ 2.07 \ud83d\ude43", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Oh God I'm glad no one can one up you on this on\n\nPS: We will come back to get you in about an eon", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13220052421092987}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15233373641967773}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08700185269117355}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2042064666748047}, {"body": "Federal legalization is inevitable.
