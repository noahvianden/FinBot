Then after 6 PM or even the next morning some news comes out or an after hours/pre-market print causes the short leg to go ITM and the asshole that doesn\u2019t have to play by the rules gets their broker to lie about receiving instructions by 6 PM to exercise that short leg. So now you are assigned and RH won\u2019t lie for you to the OCC to tell them that you told them to exercise the long leg by 6 PM the prior day. \n\nEssentially you find out after about assignment after your time window for exercise has already closed.\n\nIf you take a spread into expiration you do not have a spread: you have a naked short option. \n\nAdditionally, you can lose thousands even on expiring long options due to the fact that they are supposed to be exercised for you, even if you don\u2019t have the money, unless you specifically gave instructions to not exercise them. As an example, say you have a long $300 call expiring. At 4 PM the underlying is $298 so you think you lost and log off. At 5:30 PM a $308 print comes across the wire and your option gets exercised so now you own 100 shares of the underlying. The next day the market gaps down and opens at $290.

{"title": "I analyzed last 15 years of news articles to see how many times Michael Burry predicted a crash and how many times he turned out to be right! Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** Michael Burry is definitely a controversial figure. He rose to fame betting against the subprime mortgage market and making a 489% return for his investors between Nov\u201900 and Jun\u201908 (SP500 returned just 3% in the same period).\n\nBut, I recently observed that in every news article/tweet, he always talks about an impending crash. As recently as last week, he issued another warning stating that there would a \u201cmother of all crashes soon due to the meme-stock and crypto rally that will approach the size of countries\u201d. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was\n\n**Whether Michael Burry always predicts a crash and gets lucky when there is an actual crash or does his prediction actually turns out to be true most of the time?**\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe various news articles spanning over the last 15 years were obtained from Google News \\[1\\]. I flagged the date of each crash prediction and then analyzed the performance of the market/stock over the\n\na. Next 1 Month\n\nb. Next 1 Quarter\n\nc. Till Date\n\nI will not be including the subprime mortgage crash prediction in this analysis as we all know how that turned out and how that made him famous. Also, there are no news reports covering Burry before that.\n\nThe performance figures are calculated based on the prediction. If Burry specifies a stock, then I am using that particular stock as the benchmark. If its broader prediction relating to the overall market, then the benchmark used is S&P 500.\n\n**Results**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cdhqi5pkne871.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3560c38bbf2051a4d890523f2e31a9618bcaeb4)\n\nThere was a long gap of 9 years after the 2008 crash where Burry stayed out of the public view and did not make any warnings or predictions about the market.\n\nHis first verifiable prediction after the 2008 crisis [came in May 2017](https://www.lombardiletter.com/michael-burry-stock-market-crash/10895/) where he warned that we can expect a global financial meltdown and World War 3. In his exact words\n\n>I didn\u2019t go out looking for this, I just did the math. Every bit of my logic is telling me the global financial system is going to collapse\n\nBut it\u2019s been 4 years since the prediction and the market is chugging along just fine. S&P500 has returned a respectable 93% to date and there is [no imminent threat](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/timeline/) of a World War happening.\n\nBurry\u2019s next prediction was in [Sep 2019](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-big-short-s-michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos-1.1310874) where he said that index funds are the next market bubble and are comparable to subprime CDOs. He said that index fund inflows are now distorting prices for stocks and bonds in the same way that CDO purchases did for subprime mortgages more than a decade ago. He said the flows will reverse at some point, and \u201cit will be ugly\u201d when they do.\n\nThis prediction also did not pan out as S&P500 has returned 50% to date over the last two years and the only crash that occurred during this period was the Covid-19 flash crash from which the market made a sudden recovery.\n\nBurry\u2019s next target was on Tesla where he said that Tesla\u2019s stock price is [ridiculous](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-reveals-hes-short-tesla-tells-elon-musk-to-issue-more-stock-at-its-ridiculous-price/articleshow/79538731.cms) and that it would [collapse](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-predicts-tesla-stock-will-collapse-like-the-housing-bubble-enjoy-it-while-it-lasts/articleshow/80171258.cms) like the housing stock bubble. I have kept both the articles there which had only one month difference as we don\u2019t know exactly when he shorted the stock. The returns would be substantially different if he did it in Dec\u201920 when compared to Jan\u201921 as Tesla had a phenomenal run in December.\n\nHe [reiterated](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warns-the-stock-market-is-dancing-on-a-knifes-edge-and-fears-hes-being-ignored-again/articleshow/81154288.cms) again on Feb\u201921 that the market is dancing on a knife\u2019s edge and he is being ignored again. He felt the boom in day traders due to the meme stock mania and the increasing cash flow to the index trackers would cause a massive bubble. This prediction also hasn\u2019t turned out to be right as the market has returned 11% to date over the last 4 months.\n\nBurry\u2019s only prediction that we can say confidently was right after the 2008 mortgage crisis is that he called [Bitcoin a speculative bubble](https://moguldom.com/340499/michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-mortgage-crash-says-bitcoin-is-a-speculative-bubble-sends-prices-lower/) in March\u201921. Bitcoin has since dropped 28% in around 3 months. Even in this case, we don\u2019t have enough data to showcase how this prediction would turn out over the next one/two years.\n\nBurry was most active in 2021 making the most number of predictions with the latest in Jun\u201921 stating that we are currently in the [greatest speculative bubble of all time](https://moguldom.com/358632/investor-michael-burry-who-predicted-2008-subprime-mortgage-crisis-says-this-is-greatest-speculative-bubble-of-all-time-in-all-things/). Only time will tell how this one will turn out!\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI have immense respect for Michael Burry and his skills. He was a doctor and worked as a Stanford Hospital neurology resident and then left to start his own hedge fund that became [extremely successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry). But, as you can see from the above analysis, he is more often wrong than right with his predictions \\[2\\].\n\nBut, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \\[3\\]. Out of the 100 predictions you make, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high.\n\nThe key point here is that if you believe in Michael Burry, you will have to follow all of his recommendations \\[4\\] and not pick and choose what you feel comfortable with as most of the returns would be from an extremely unlikely scenario.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] Google News has a [nifty feature](https://researchbuzz.me/2019/07/22/if-youre-not-using-more-of-google-news-date-options-you-might-be-missing-out/#:~:text=As%20you%20probably%20know%2C%20Google,hours%2C%20and%20the%20past%20hour.) where they allow you to search news in specific time periods. Also, Google News seems to capture almost all the major publications other than the historical archives.\n\n\\[2\\] The current analysis is done using all the publicly available records. We are not considering the personal bets he made, conversations he had with his friends/family/investors, etc. This can definitely alter the\n\n\\[3\\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).\n\n\\[4\\] At that point, if you are that confident in his predictions, you can [invest in his hedge fund](https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/scion-asset-management-review).
