This is going to go against all the stocks only go up but sometimes they need to go down to go up. Currently we are breaking into record levels of retail investors buy stocks. This is good right... well not when you are taking out loans to get in on the action. \n\nThe past two years have been a whirlwind seeing unseen gains in our history. to break it down for you apes I'm going to go over the different market scenarios we have seen. Their was the 2000's .com bubble when the S&P rose 236% from 1995 to 2000. At that time we had a 2 year bear market where we saw a drop of -50%.\n\nNext we had the housing bubble in 2008. So as the market cycle goes we had a very nice bull run from 2003 to 2008 seeing gains of 104% on the S&P. This was all great until people started taking out loans and spending money they didn't have to get a house. practically they got margin called and everyone had to pull there money/assets to cover. So in return we saw this impact the market of a -51% drop in that year.\n\nOkay housing bubble is over and if you are still reading, you ape might be big brain. Now we come into present time where are we at? well from 2009 to 2021 we have seen a gain of 488%. Wow holy shit this is amazing well it could be bad. Retail investing has hit an all time high. This is great people are getting into the market which is part of the reason we are seeing some of the 15%+ gains Year over Year. But a record number of people are taking out loans or borrowing money from others just to invest. This is great for taking money from your wives boyfriends but terrible for the economy. 2021 the margin call crash. We are caught up with the war with hedge funds they will get margin called and they will pay whatever amount necessary. Also you will get margin called and if you cant pay you will go bankrupt. we could easily see a correction of -50%. \n\nAre you prepared for a market crash? I am. Sorry but I have officially entered gay bear territory. going to buy puts year ending for the next year or two and cash in if I'm right. If not I will see you in my parents basement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6hpkowuiu771.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=67329f32cd87baceead6f413a49025bd5851247c", "id": "o91xxj", "created_utc": 1624816131.0, "score": 329, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 261, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's true that we're up a LOT since March 2009, but honestly, I've heard this song pretty much every year since those lows. And the idea that we can't 'count' the Feb/March 2020 as a 'Bear Market' (a fall of 20%+) correction is just plain ignorant.  We fell 34% in less than 1 month!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I think the thing most people are missing, is that even though there is recently high inflation (and recent indicators suggest that inflation is going down, ex: Lumber), there is also very high economic growth (everybody wants to spend)!  These 2 things combined, inflation with high economic growth, are actually good for stocks!   Indeed, the economy is growing so fast that manufacturing could not keep up with orders!  You can't just 'flip the switch' that quickly!  Companies are slowly catching up, and inflation will continue to fall as supply continues to increase.  This is economics 101.  There is no reason the market should fall, not in the next 6 months anyway, not unless we get a black swan event.  Covid was a black swan event, albeit short lived!  Short of a Black Swan event, I don't expect a market crash for the next 2+ years.  That said, correction's of \\~10% should happen, several times over the next 2 years, that's normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegardless, I wish you luck in your trades, long or short, puts or calls.  \"This\" is what makes a market!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation", "bubble", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "You guys check out the new Andre video?

The entire point of owning/operating a business is to be profitable and make money. It\u2019s not very sensible to me to own a piece of a company that doesn\u2019t even pay me. I am a part owner after all. Simply relying on the stock price to hopefully go up isn\u2019t very comforting. \n\nIn order to realize any profit from a non-paying company you\u2019ll have to sell your shares. Dividend stocks provide cash flow without the need to sell at all. And on top of it, each year the distribution will most likely grow. After a handful of years, your yield in the past will be much lower than what it would become in the future. (Assuming no cuts and reasonable payout hikes.)\n\nCompanies themselves do this for various reasons. Mainly mature and predictable companies offer dividends.

The market is aways looking for signals about the health of a company. For companies that pay dividends, convention has decided that increasing dividends are good, and decreasing dividends are bad.\n\nThis, by the way, is *yet another* reason that dividends are generally a bad way to return capital to the shareholders. Nobody says \u201cAha, BIGCO, you bought back 10 million shares last year, but this year you didn\u2019t buy back any! You must be in financial distress!

I can focus on living my best life via  improving my body, exploring the world, and learning interpersonal skills such as dancing, and use Instagram to document all this.

Paying $5.99 every trade while daytrading isn't a smart thing to do. I use C.Shwabb now but use RobinHood for fun trades, still.\n\nAs for the 'selling data', honestly, this just stems from a narrative you're ignorantly using presumably from what you see other Redditors spamming during the GME debacle.\n\nCitadel is a market maker. What that means is brokerage firms, such as RobinHood, sells their order flow to Citadel which in turn processes the trades for RobinHood. You mentioned Fidelity. You do realize Fidelity does the exact same thing as RobinHood, right? Fidelity and RobinHood are brokerage firms. They are not market makers. When you 'purchase' a share through them, they are simply acting as the intermediary.\n\nYou bring up RobinHood stopping the trade but Fidelity not stopping it. Do you know why? Because brokerage firms are required to have a certain amount of safety net $ in case the trade clears and RobinHood can't pay for it particularly when a stock is extremely volatile and some were using margin to fund these trades. Think of it as a down payment. The reason Fidelity didn't 'stop' the trade is because Fidelity has been around for a LOOOONG time. They had the sufficient $ to hold a safety net. RobinHood, being fairly new to the brokerage industry, didn't have that kind of capital which is why they had to borrow money in order to allow trading for certain stocks to resume. The reason people were allowed to sell is because when you push a sell order, you're getting the money. You don't need to 'promise' anything in return. Think of it as when you're buying a home. You might agree to buy a home for $500,000 but the bank wants you to pay the $100,000 down payment before they issue the loan. When you sell your stock, you don't need a 'down payment'. Someone pays for your share(s) and you get your money. Same concept with a home. You sell your home, you get your money. You don't have to pay a 'down payment' on the sale of a home.\n\nThis isn't anything new. What you're upset about has been how trades have been cleared for decades. Fidelity, E-Trade, WeBull, and RobinHood all use Citadel to push their orders... And they all profit from the order flow.

{"title": "Wheeling TSLA with $4MM", "selftext": "I welcome thetagang's thoughts and reactions here.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, I will be wheeling $4 million worth of TSLA. I'm selling deep OTM weekly CSPs. I'm selling around 5 Delta and the IV is usually \\~100%. The goal is not to get assigned for as long as possible and have risk exposure for as short as possible which is why I'm selling weeklies. Mathematically, this approach implies around 13 consecutive trades until the odds of the assignment are about 50% so theoretically I should only be getting assigned about a handful of times a year. High-level thoughts on why I'm doing this:\n\n* I believe the bull market still has legs for at least the next few years; I am bullish on TSLA for the long-term and believe it will reach a multi-trillion market cap this decade. I think the current setup is ideal to wheel TSLA after its incredible 2020 run. The stock will probably consolidate for a while or rise at a much slower rate than last year\n* In 2021, TSLA is now a mega-cap so short-term price action, while still quite volatile compared to other mega-caps, should not be as volatile as last year when it had a much smaller market cap prior to its massive run\n* Related to bullet 2, I don't expect the bottom to fall out from TSLA to the tune of 25%+ in a one-week period. Such a crash in a one-week period has only happened a few times in its history, most recently last September when S&P inclusion was not announced as expected\n* If TSLA crashes in a week and I get assigned, by selling very deep OTM, I am hoping to be at the bottom of the down-range. I will then sell reasonably far OTM CCs for the bounce\n* Even if we enter a bear market and my puts come close to getting assigned in a given week but escape, I'll just continue selling them on the way down. I.E. I sell a 450 strike but TSLA crashes to 470 in a week...for the following week I'll just sell the 350 strike or whatever is the same 5 Delta equivalent\n* By far the biggest risk I envision isn't related to TSLA, it's a sudden market crash ala March 2020 where all stocks shed 30+% in a very short window and the stock blows through my strike price\n* I don't have the intestinal fortitude to take a concentrated position in any common stock. Historically I've YOLO'd into shares of one stock. I did VERY well last year but I'm not going to do that in this year's market. I no longer have the appetite for volatility that comes with owning millions of dollars of one stock. 5-10% drawdown days are simply too painful psychologically and in absolute dollar terms. I still think this bull market has legs...thus the CSP approach\n* I can make \\~20K a week on $4MM or \\~25% annually which easily beats the historical market return. If I want less risk I can sell lower Deltas and get a smaller return\n* I don't want to employ a more complicated options strategy", "id": "o8zfiv", "created_utc": 1624808270.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 207, "comments": [{"body": "you say you don\u2019t have the intestinal fortitude to take a concentrated position\u2026 but isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re doing here by locking $4mn up in Tesla csps?", "score": 131, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe $4M in his portfolio is like owning 1 share of Ford vs a share of Berkshire Hathaway Class A.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2551814019680023}, {"body": "Yes you're right, but of course I don't own the stock until it gets assigned.

The reason that we all haven't been replaced with robots yet is also battery power since there are only so many applications where you can run a power cord, so everything else requires humans.

I don't think that there's as big of a risk for anything else, although in the next few years a breakthrough in self-driving would have the same effect but I just don't think we're there yet with the technology itself so I think superconductivity or supercapacitance is the bigger threat, since that would be immediately useful to any company currently making electric vehicles.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Also add to the list:\n- serious of tech malfunctions / recalls\n- immediate departure of key executives\n- geopolitical conflicts causing supply chain disruptions", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.327404648065567}, {"body": "A fire at the freemont plant, a giant recall, major safety issues, war in the pacific - the possibilities are endless .\n\nHe deserves to lose it all at this point really", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30240893363952637}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41079580783843994}, {"body": "Why not wheel like 4 stocks instead of just Tesla?

My lowest cost basis shares (split-adjusted) are at $38.95 though (up 1600%) so I don't want my shares to get called away which is why I wouldn't want to wheel like you are for the entire position. But what happened as TSLA started trading lower the premiums on the covered calls started going down quite a bit. What I did instead was I sold puts on TSLA when it was in the mid $500s to low $600s and right now I'm holding 9 puts on TSLA for Jan 2022, Jan 2023, and June 2023 at various strike prices that are (currently) in the money but as long as TSLA has some modest growth I'll end up with ~$280k in gains from the puts I sold (all of the puts are up 5% - 22% so far). I used this cash to buy more TSLA.\n\nWhen TSLA recovers to higher SP ($700s), I'll start selling covered calls again. I just don't like selling covered calls when I think TSLA is more undervalued or you end up in a situation like this most recent week where TSLA started at $620 before dipping to $610 on Monday and hitting a high of $690 on Thursday.\n\nAnyway, I'm still refining my strategy but the next goal I'm shooting for is 5,069 shares of TSLA, then 6,900, then 10,420.\n\nI added something like 1,000 shares last year and 300 - 400 this year so far from trading. Last year was cheating though because any idiot that bought long dated call options on pretty much any stock made great returns and I was one of those idiots.\n\nOverall, I'm very bullish on TSLA and I expect another 10x over the next 10 years. So I'm looking at my current position being worth ~$30M by then but ideally, I'll continue to add more shares along the way and have substantially more than that.

I made a lot of mistakes in the beginning due to short-term (1 step thinking). I knew if I was playing the long game, I needed to think about this in a 2 step manner. Although I am technically \"gambling\" on the fate of these companies, I think the next 5-10 years will be splendid. Personally I like these companies, and their growth prospects in the near/long term future.\n\nPLTR - Palantir. They have only just begun. People compare this company to Microsoft, or the \"next Microsoft\". Fuck that. They're playing a different game. I think they might get more notoriety if their software suite, was used by intelligence agencies against nation-states like Russia or China. In the electronic warfare front, I think they will be a key player for cybersecurity companies to utilize in offense, and defense. Lots of potential in every industry where information gathering puts you ahead of a competitor or a nation state.\n\nBNGO/NNOX/CRSP - Bionano Genomics/Nanox/Crisper. I don't think this is a joke. I think their tech, with good merit, is a direct disruptor to existing devices and machinery out there. Until their business is cash flow positive, with actual customer purchases, info on whether or not hospitals would jump at the chance to grab these machines, as well as smaller firms. I'm lumping BNGO in with this because of devices, and genomics in general. I also started a small position in CRSP, genomics is relatively new. We don't know what the next decade holds for genome editing, curing diseases, identifying malformed genes and pathways. This is a bright future for humanity when this becomes normalized. Maybe I'll even throw Gingko Bioworks into my genomics port, idk.\n\nU - Unity. Not a call for some kumbaya moment, but a way to bring players and audiences from any location, into immersive worlds, where we can get lost in the reality of our own choosing. I think video games are underrated. Mostly because software of our predecessors has been shit, and in some rare cases, actual gems of ingenuity have formed over the decades. VR might have been a flop, but its not dead. Immersive experiences are really important for a person (imo). Intimacy and belief in a different relativity is RARELY seen in video games or movies in a viewing experience. I hope to see movie theaters and home media centers really trying to draw audiences in with newer experience in the future. How long that might take, I don't know, I'm not an oracle, but whether its in self-driving automobiles, giving you a person car ride / media experience or you have goggles on at home bumping into shit, U will be right there.\n\nATOM - Atomera. If I were to pick some companies that were easy 10x-50x baggers over the next decade or two, then I would be mostly fucking wrong. But I believe in ATOM. From the particles of our very existence, to semiconductors which run our technologies, and gears innovation, companies like this are actual disruptors.\n\nHOL - Astra. Fedex of space deliveries, or the USPS? Not sure yet. But with an all-star team, (keeps growing), successful launches, and forseeable goals, this is a winner for me. The CEO alone, is a rockstar. Although that could throw people off (think Elon rockstar and what he tweets/says), Chris Kemp is like if Spoc and Kirk had a baby, and Edward Snowden took care of the education. I think he's geniune article, and his experience alone makes me root for the jockey and horse. Ultimately, this is a very young company, in an even younger industry.\n\nSTEM/ITAC/ETWO - STEM/Arbe Robotics/E2Open AI/robotics and supply chain AI software, with big customers to boot. reddit buggy ass got rid of my whole section here, too lazy to rewrite.\n\nWOOF - Petco. I have dogs, and I love animals. omnichannel brick and mortor with various subscriptions, and services ready to go? All for the well being of your animal and others? Vet and grooming services? Clothing? Medicine? Toys? All with a good customer experience? Count me in. (i have a 17 page dd on notion about woof, if anyone is interested, pm me i guess). Resides on a more safer delta.\n\nMP - MP Materials. I like metals? Easy non-china winner for materials. It irked me that this was also a Chamath de-SPAC, but whatever. Judge by the team and merits right? Resides on a more safer delta.\n\nSKIN - Beauty Health Company. A staple, well managed company, that's no going anywhere. Long term this is a great hold. Something I considered was Hims, and possibly mental health stocks like Mindmed. I don't know how those companies really work. But I am sure about SKIN.\n\nI don't have fintech, yet.

{"title": "The Weekly DD - WISH: The shopping mall in your pocket (Full DD because nobody asked)", "selftext": "**Overview**\n\nWISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world. In short, the company is a direct-to-consumer online retailer. However, a few key features differentiate it from its competition:\n\n* WISH does not operate any brick-and-mortar locations\n* WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings\n* WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler\n\nLet\u2019s go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation.\u00a0\n\n* WISH not operating any brick-and-mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures (CAPEX) and frees up its cash flows.\n* WISH\u2019s focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e-commerce giants. This is a space that WISH dominates.\u00a0\n* WISH\u2019s decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers. With independent sellers, WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors.\n\nThese three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base. WISH targets mostly younger, low to middle income households. It offers cheap and unbranded products, an area that was historically ignored by larger e-commerce companies. Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this. According to Pew Research, lower-income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets.\n\n**The Future of E-commerce is Mobile**\n\nE-commerce is not a new term. Years ago, a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in-store experience. Today, that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e-commerce. However, what most people do not know is that e-commerce is still in its growth phase. Although due to COVID, 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e-commerce. Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. In 2020, online spending represented 21% of the total retail sales while in 2019, online spending represented only 16%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lazx0wzots771.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9d9b596338c225c0fb8d9dbae4579b9f84faf2e\n\nFurthermore, the growth is mostly being captured by the American and European markets. This is especially useful for WISH as over 80% of its global sales is coming from these two regions.\n\nA few macro trends are expected to drive e-commerce for the next decade:\n\n* Mobile shopping: COVID-19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years! Mobile commerce or m-commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years, rising at a rate of 25.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its expected that by 2024, m-commerce will represent 44% of all e-commerce transactions accounting for \\~$500B in sales.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv5jnzupts771.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=5489e4e7f314565eb6cd89fc599c7c50deff7bab\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Big data and AI: A key advantage in e-commerce is going to be in data whether that is to power a recommendation feature or to power targeted advertisements, data is the new gold for e-commerce companies. Increasingly, the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator. BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25%.\n\n**WISH, More than Just a Retailer**\n\nWISH has a few main product lines:\n\n* Online retail store, the Wish mobile application\n* ProductBoost, a marketing service on the Wish mobile application\n* WishLocal, a digital presence service for smaller brick-and-mortar retailers\n* Wish Express, a logistics service for customer delivery\n\n**1. WISH as an online retail store**\n\nAs an online retail store, WISH is growing quickly in all areas. As of 2021, its revenue per active user increased 76% YOY, led by an increase in orders over $20 which increased over 50% in Q1 2021. However, total monthly active users declined 7% YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market.\n\nAs stated before, the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI. WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage. At its very inception, WISH has always recognized the value of data. As of 2020, WISH catalogued the following data points:\n\n* 100M+ monthly active users: their age, gender, location, etc.\n* 150M+ activities on Wish: clicks, scrolls, items sold, etc.\n* 500K+ merchant data: refund rates, ship times, etc.\n* 640M+ items shipped: ratings, pictures, etc.\n\nThrough this enormous warehouse of data, WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world. WISH sees **70%**\u00a0of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query. This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer, which in turn enables\u2026\n\n**2. ProductBoost, the AdWords for Shopping**\n\nBy proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base, WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user-base. In 2020, 30% of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented $140M of revenue for WISH. The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable, high-margin service offering for them. As of Q1 of 2021, they are already seeing a 14% increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019.\u00a0\n\n**3. WishLocal, Helping those Behind the Curve**\n\nWishLocal is a service that brick-and-mortar retailers sign up for. Through WishLocal, they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee. They will both earn the fee as well as can cross-sell to the customer. This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant. While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature, it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick-and-mortar stores.\n\n**4. Wish Express, Driving Business Forward**\n\nWish Express is the global logistics service at WISH. They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product. Like this, they can both improve their own delivery services (shipping-related refunds were down 40+% in 2021) as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners. In 2021, their logistics revenue was \\~$250M which represented a 338% increase from the previous year.\n\n**Strong Balance Sheet, Weak Income Statement**\n\nWISH is a risky company, and this is reflected in their finances. They have a cash reserve of $2B which is balanced out with nearly $900M in current liabilities. In 2020, they issued $1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a $750M net operating loss. This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years.\n\nThe $750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins. The SG&A (primarily driven by marketing) expense went up by 40% which corresponds to a 33% increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erjzrtqqts771.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c34dd891a3104e2fc3228d1ea78efcbb142e1f5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile the marketing expense can be easily controlled, it\u2019s a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80% in 2019 to 64% in 2020 especially as they have a long-term goal of 75% margins. If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending, another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health.\n\nIn 2020 WISH did 2.54 billion in revenue, a 33.7% increase from 2019 revenues. Their trailing twelve month (TTM) gross margin is roughly 60%, which is very good for the e-commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40% range. Like mentioned above, WISH's SG&A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash.\u00a0\n\nIn their most recent earnings report, WISH management guided revenues of 715-730 million revenue for Q2 2021. What\u2019s concerning is that it\u2019s only 2-4% growth when looking YoY, however, management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world. This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation.\n\n**The Bottom Line**\n\nIn many ways, WISH reminds me of an early Amazon. Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store. After all, they have many things going for them:\n\n* The most downloaded shopping app in the world\n* High market share in the niche unbranded sales space\n* Expansion into high margin services\n\nHowever, there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon.\n\n* Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH\n* It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing\n* Its gross margins declined in 2020 (though its been steadily rising beforehand)\n\nFor me, I see a company with $1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of $2B being valued at $8.5B. I believe the $8.5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through $750M of cash in a year (it only happened once, 2019 was much better). If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution, their stock price should rise as a result.\n\nWith their focus on data, their considerable market share, and some core high margin products already underway, I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\n1. WISH is in the e-commerce space and they are what I would call a \"flea market in your pocket\" that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app. They do not operate brick and mortar locations, and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers (cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses).\n2. WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e-commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type. WISH's customer-base is targeted toward the low-to-middle class which is evident if you go to their site. Many products are under $5 and in unusual categories to say the least.\n3. One advantage in WISH's business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer, cutting out the middle-man while maintaining low capital expenditures (CapEx), which free's up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition.\n4. When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a \"risky\" company. They aren't overly indebted, but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve. Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition. This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out-perform in a short period of time.\n5. Having said all that, their gross margin (\\~60%) is quite healthy. For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out-perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG&A expenses.

Most of the retail crowd is trying to front-run the purchases by hedge fund managers (Fund managers that track the Russell index will need to purchase the shares after its added to the index).\n\n**Trade Desk($TTD):** TTD was generating discussions as Google announced that they would delay the removal of third-party cookies that help advertisers track users until 2023. The news also sends the stock price soaring as the stock finished the week with a 25% gain. \n\n**Purple Innovation($PRPL):** The current volatility of the market is perfectly reflected in this stock as an 8% run-up in a billion-dollar company has generated zero news! The retail crowd was hyping up the stock as the company has announced an off-cycle investor event which will take place on 6/29 and also because the company was one of the first meme stocks that were picked up by Reddit almost a year back.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.*\u00a0Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s issue!", "id": "o8x3dy", "created_utc": 1624800518.0, "score": 277, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|47|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|151|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1t0yz/i_analyzed_all_the_motley_fool_premium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.534176230430603}, {"body": "Holding CLOV, AMC, WISH and GME.", "score": 35, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16105085611343384}, {"body": "Thanks as awlays!

I'm pretty shocked at the current market cap. Last year when we had the stock split. I told my friends it would sell off and to buy NIO. I told them this, \"Tesla is more stable but you're paying higher prices for the stability and certainity. NIO is undervalued but less stable in the growth phase\" so Nio would give a better ROI based off the market cap regardless of the companies current performance. This was based mostly off this.\n\n1. Projected growth over time.\n2. Market caps of the companies.\n3. Company business model and phases of growth.\n\nI think NIO will give a better ROI over the next coming years. But I think Tesla is more stable. But stable is subjective, because I think both companies will succeed. But in terms of growth/spec, I believe Tesla priced in alot and for early investors like me, that's good. Because now I get the stability while owning Tesla at such a low price.\n\nWhile on the other hand Nio while i do believe will succeed in their own realm similarly to Tesla. Has yet to be priced in based off current market cap in terms of growth/spec. I also think the current phase of the company along with political climate, bullish economic projects for China, more money pouring into foreign/emerging markets/China, HKSE listing, more strict regulation on China will lead to more certainty and transparency etc. I think Nio has much potential investors while Tesla just simply does not.\n\nEven when you consider the pps. Regardless of the valuation, people see NIO as just a better choice. \" If you missed Tesla, then buy NIO.\" I also see the same large institutions selling Tesla and buy NIO. I think retail investors and the avg Joe is willing to buy what they see as a \"good deal\". Versus Tesla, ahen considering the current phase of growth, market caps, pps, and maybe later down the line factor in economic advantage/ political advantage.  \n\nIf you want to discuss \"oVeRvaLuEd\". I think we would have to consider looking at more than just NIO and Tesla and question the entire financial system.  I think we should consider many factors besides the company in order to predict where a price is headed.
