{"title": "WSE:CDR CD Projekt Red Analysis. Is it undervalued after the 37% drop due to Cyberpunk problems on consoles?", "selftext": "**Background**\n\nCD PROJEKT S.A. (WSE: CDR) is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw. CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nCD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.\n\nThe subsidiaries are:\n\n\\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)\n\n\\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)\n\n**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.\n\nSteam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.\n\nHowever the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.\n\nThis is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.\n\n***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.\n\n**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.\n\nI'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.\n\n**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:\n\n>\u25a0 sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:\n\n\\- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.\n\n\\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.\n\n\\- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.\n\n**Co-Founders and Board History**\n\nCD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock, including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.\n\nCompany shareholding structure is made up of the following people:\n\n\\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **13%**\n\n\\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **11%**\n\n\\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP, CFO) is **6%**\n\n\\- **Adam Kicinski** (President & Joint CEO) is **3%**\n\nIncentives for management:\n\n>Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.\n\nThese are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.\n\nManagement hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:\n\n>Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  \n>  \n>Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.\n\nThese goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nCD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there\u2019s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.\n\nThus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.\n\nCD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n**Industry**\n\n>**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020\u20132024).  \n>  \n>\\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).\n\nYou can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.\n\n**Reverse DCF**\n\nr/StockMarket does not allow images so you will need to view my user to see the reverse DCF /u/krisolch if you want to see it.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.\n\nPlease comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation.

{"title": "The Dummy's guide to trading the Georgia Senate Runoff", "selftext": "**TLDR: There is a Senate runoff in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which political party controls the Senate.   \nIf you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays.**  \n\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**  \nRecall the price action of QQQ (the tech etf we all know about) around Nov. 3. If you can't because you're that guy from the movie [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) , pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid:\n\nOn the eve of the general election, when most polls indicated that it would be a Democratic sweep, **QQQ sat at $269.** The next day, with the election contested, **QQQ rocketed to $294.** It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week. \n\nWhy did the election affect the price the way that it did? It is because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. **In particular, a simple majority in the Senate allows President-elect Biden to raise corporate taxes to 28%, which [he has promised to do](https://joebiden.com/two-tax-policies/)**. These corporate taxes would heavily affect tech companies.\n\n\n  \nTo explain, the institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:\n\n- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.\n* Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  \n* Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.\n\n\n\nDon't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf  \n\n\n\nOriginally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) were trending down. But when it seemed that the Republicans would hold the Senate with a 51 seat-majority, tech stocks made a sharp U-turn\n\nYet, there was a small blip downward the very next week. This was not a circumstantial correction. It happened because David Perdue (R) in Georgia fell below the threshold to prevent a Jan. 5 runoff, leaving the Republican majority at 50, and injecting the slim possibility for the Democrats to still fully control Congress.  \n\nNow let's jump to the week ahead:\n\n**Right now, Democrats control 48 seats in the U.S. Senate. If they can win both Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, they will have 50 seats.** With Vice-President Harris as the tie-breaker, they would be able to pass Democratic legislation like tax increases. **In other words, the outcome of this election would have a huge impact on certain stocks.**\n&nbsp;\n\n**Which stocks are impacted, and why**\n\nIf Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.\n\n* Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)\n* Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)\n* Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)\n\nTo make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:\n\n* companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n* companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n\nSo what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  \n\n* Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.\n* Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.\n* Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.\n* Pure financial companies like CME, saw their effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.\n\nObviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:\n\n* Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n* Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n\nOut of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.\n\nHowever, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.\n\n&nbsp;\n  \n**Information about the races to consider:**\n\n* In the November General election:\n\t* Perdue (R) won **49.7 percent** of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won **47.9 percent**. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.\n\t* The Republican candidates (Loeffler + Collins) won a combined **49.4 percent**, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined **48.4 percent**.\n\t* **These are both substantial leads for the incumbent Republican Senators.**\n* What the \"reputable\" polls say about Jan. 5:\n\t* Republican-leaning **Trafalgar Group** (\"most accurate pollster of 2016\"), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll, has now pegged **both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.**\n\t* Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting **a Democratic sweep** of both Senate seats\n\t* Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll for Georgia this year). **This will be released soon.**\n* Trump has been calling the runoff \"invalid\", which might mean some of his supporters could boycott the election.\n* The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)\n\n\n**The plays:**\n\n- If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep** (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.\n* If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to win** (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.\n* If you expect **Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat**, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15. An OTM bear put spread is recommended, but calls should be fine.\n* If you expect **Republicans to sweep**, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15. Use synthetic long options strategies if you can, as those are not affected by vega contraction.\n* If you expect it to be **nail-bitingly close**, and unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ, e.g. NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be buying OTM puts, or buying a medium-term strangle. \n* If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.\n\n\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**Q: What is the expected outcome?**  \nA: Republicans win, but there is enough uncertainty that you can definitely make money.\n\n**Q: Why bother trading an election?**  \nA: This is largely a binary event. A candidate either wins or they don't. This beats trading earnings, as often we could get the earnings result right, but still get cucked by guidance. Moreover, as shown by what has been happening in recent years, the market is often no longer sure of the outcome.\n\n**Q: Why is NFLX a particularly good short in the event of a Democratic sweep?**  \nA: Netflix has a fairly simple business model. Its value is dependent on the expected number of subscribers, the monthly price they pay minus the server cost per subscriber, the amount of its business costs to produce shows, and the tax rate. So let's go through these one by one:\n\n* Unlike when it was still a growing company, or at the start of the pandemic, it's unlikely for NFLX to suddenly see unexpected explosive increases in its subscriber base in the short term. \n* Moreover, they only recently increased prices a while back, so it's fairly unlikely for them to announce price increases within the next two weeks. \n* Their costs are unlikely to change drastically, since show production budgets are generally fixed. \n* As a company with a low worker count, you won't see any Congressperson arguing for tax carveouts or subsidies in the way automakers or airlines would. Sure, when they produce shows, there is an economic benefit to certain communities at places where shows, but shows are always temporarily (~3 seasons) and tax subsidies are generally done by local governments, not federal.\n* As a largely B2C company, they can't structure their revenue to take advantage of tax loopholes that companies with B2B segments can. Indeed, this was why the corporate tax cuts benefitted them so much, and why a tax raise will hurt them.", "id": "kouetj", "created_utc": 1609578399.0, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "I am just long spy AND green energy.\n\nCause remember stonks only go up.", "score": 68, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42118945717811584}, {"body": "Great DD but I can\u2019t believe you did not mention weed stocks.

{"title": "Alibaba is UNDERVALUED \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "One after another negative catalysts have been annihilating Alibaba\u2019s share price. First it was the [ANT IPO fiasco](https://imgur.com/kDpBPlg) and then it was CCP regulatory concerns. Do you really think the CCP is on a warpath to meaningfully hinder one of their most profitable companies? If so then stop reading here. This is literally a gift from the CCP and here is why.\n\nFirst lets start off with some fundamental boomer valuation metrics. According to Nasdaq.com here\u2019s a comparison of the two largest e-commerce companies.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nALIBABA Forward P/E:\n\n2021: 30\n\n2022: 23\n\n2023: 17\n\n12 month Forward PEG ratio: 1.46\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAMAZON Forward P/E:\n\n2021: 73\n\n2022: 52\n\n2023:(no estimates)\n\n12 month Forward PEG ratio: 3.22\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAside from the valuation metric comparison above Alibaba has [wonderful financials.](https://imgur.com/a/MX8rA12) YOY increases in cash flow and assets while maintaining low debt as a growth company is very attractive. \n\nAs you can see Alibaba is CRITICALLY undervalued compared to Amazon. When PEG is taken into account with P/E it can justify a currently high P/E IF AND ONLY IF said company is expected to grow earnings fast enough YOY. According to Zack\u2019s the E-commerce industry as a whole has a PEG ratio of about 2.56 which would indicate that Alibaba is undervalued in comparison to not only Amazon but most if not all of its peers as well. Lets also not forget that Alibaba recently increased their [share buyback program from 6 billion to 10 bilion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alibaba-raises-stock-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-but-stock-continues-to-sink-11609124627). That's an increase of over 66%.... Even Alibaba themselves thinks their shares are undervalued and wants to take advantage of the recent sell off.\n\nSecondly lets check out the technical side of things. Here is a [weekly chart](https://imgur.com/5ffIMmO) that shows a very attractive uptrending pattern for the last few years. It also shows that Alibaba was overextended and needed a healthy pullback. Now it's oversold and in prime territory for a true dip buy opportunity. An opportunity this large has presented itself just 4 times in a little over 2 years. The huge green candle tells me that after the sell off Alibaba bulls were lying in wait for a moment like this to scoop up more shares.\n\nLastly  lets break it down in WSB valuation metrics. Daniel Zhang YOLOd his way into an empire and his wife\u2019s boyfriend(The CCP) has noticed that he is incredibly profitable and doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The wife's boyfriend is starting to fear for his top position in the house. This is why the wife's boyfriend wants to regulate the little autist so that he can maintain power over both his wife and the autist. That said the wife's boyfriend doesn't want to kick the autist out. He still wants to keep the little autist around because he generates money for him while he hangs out with his wife.\n\nTLDR; The CCP wants to make sure it stays in position as the wife's boyfriend. Alibaba is undervalued and presents an opportunity if you believe the CCP regulatory concerns are just smoke and mirrors.", "id": "kp2oxc", "created_utc": 1609612189.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Cathie Wood has been buying the dip", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "She is an Alibaba bull indeed.

This is why the CCP can force incredibly wealthy and powerful companies to bend over backwards and force Jack Ma to report for political remediation. Imagine the US doing that to Bezos and Amazon.

Your factually correct but, \"come on man.\" \n\n\nIm thinking at the very least, BABA gets a fine and dick slapping over forced exclusivity they have been using with some of the larger retailers. Which then means those retailers can go to the other 2 major platforms Pinduoduo or JD com. I like JD just because they are focusing on growing their e commerce at the perfect time, and they also have a lot of value in how much of their workforce is robotic. From warehouse to drone delivery, it's kinda fucking cool. Also, their drones allow them to serve more rural areas in China at a much faster pace than currently offered. Need farming equipment/tools? Milk for dinner? Daddy JD be there in an hour via drone. \n\nTL;DR BABA gets dick slapped for exclusivity and JD or Pinduoduo moons. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5733182430267334}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "We're a proud group here.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20004215836524963}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.027431000024080276}, {"body": "3 rockets in the title? say no more, fam.. im all in!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01726076379418373}, {"body": "I wouldn\u2019t play options on this, but I am long holding some shares.
