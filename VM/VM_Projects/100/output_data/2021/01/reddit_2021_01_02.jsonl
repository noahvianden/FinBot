{"title": "WSE:CDR CD Projekt Red Analysis. Is it undervalued after the 37% drop due to Cyberpunk problems on consoles?", "selftext": "**Background**\n\nCD PROJEKT S.A. (WSE: CDR) is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw. CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nCD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.\n\nThe subsidiaries are:\n\n\\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)\n\n\\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)\n\n**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.\n\nSteam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.\n\nHowever the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.\n\nThis is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.\n\n***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.\n\n**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.\n\nI'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.\n\n**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:\n\n>\u25a0 sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:\n\n\\- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.\n\n\\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.\n\n\\- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.\n\n**Co-Founders and Board History**\n\nCD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock, including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.\n\nCompany shareholding structure is made up of the following people:\n\n\\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **13%**\n\n\\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **11%**\n\n\\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP, CFO) is **6%**\n\n\\- **Adam Kicinski** (President & Joint CEO) is **3%**\n\nIncentives for management:\n\n>Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.\n\nThese are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.\n\nManagement hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:\n\n>Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  \n>  \n>Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.\n\nThese goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nCD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there\u2019s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.\n\nThus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.\n\nCD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n**Industry**\n\n>**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020\u20132024).  \n>  \n>\\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).\n\nYou can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.\n\n**Reverse DCF**\n\nr/StockMarket does not allow images so you will need to view my user to see the reverse DCF /u/krisolch if you want to see it.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.\n\nPlease comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation.

{"title": "The Dummy's guide to trading the Georgia Senate Runoff", "selftext": "**TLDR: There is a Senate runoff in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will determine which political party controls the Senate.   \nIf you are pretty sure about what the trajectory of the Georgia Senate Runoffs will be, you can make money. Scroll to the bottom for the plays.**  \n\n\n\n\n**Introduction:**  \nRecall the price action of QQQ (the tech etf we all know about) around Nov. 3. If you can't because you're that guy from the movie [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) , pull out your Robinhood app and follow along with me kid:\n\nOn the eve of the general election, when most polls indicated that it would be a Democratic sweep, **QQQ sat at $269.** The next day, with the election contested, **QQQ rocketed to $294.** It remained steady on Friday, before declining the next week. \n\nWhy did the election affect the price the way that it did? It is because Biden's legislative agenda depends on Democratic control of Congress. **In particular, a simple majority in the Senate allows President-elect Biden to raise corporate taxes to 28%, which [he has promised to do](https://joebiden.com/two-tax-policies/)**. These corporate taxes would heavily affect tech companies.\n\n\n  \nTo explain, the institutional whales (the folks who actually move markets) believe that:\n\n- Companies that benefitted bigly from Trump's tax cuts (tech companies especially) will be hurt by Biden raising taxes.\n* Companies that would benefit from fiscal stimulus (green new deal, infrastructure) will be helped by Biden's plans, and even more if Biden controls Congress.  \n* Regardless of who controls the Senate, the divided nature means some companies are guaranteed to benefit.\n\n\n\nDon't take my word for it. Read this report from Goldman Sachs (p.15-16): https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/beyond-2020-post-election-policies-f/report.pdf  \n\n\n\nOriginally, tech companies (facing more regulation and tax increases under the Democratic Trifecta) were trending down. But when it seemed that the Republicans would hold the Senate with a 51 seat-majority, tech stocks made a sharp U-turn\n\nYet, there was a small blip downward the very next week. This was not a circumstantial correction. It happened because David Perdue (R) in Georgia fell below the threshold to prevent a Jan. 5 runoff, leaving the Republican majority at 50, and injecting the slim possibility for the Democrats to still fully control Congress.  \n\nNow let's jump to the week ahead:\n\n**Right now, Democrats control 48 seats in the U.S. Senate. If they can win both Georgia Senate runoffs on Jan. 5, they will have 50 seats.** With Vice-President Harris as the tie-breaker, they would be able to pass Democratic legislation like tax increases. **In other words, the outcome of this election would have a huge impact on certain stocks.**\n&nbsp;\n\n**Which stocks are impacted, and why**\n\nIf Democrats gain control of the U.S. Senate, that means Biden can pass his legislation.\n\n* Some companies will be helped bigly (e.g. Renewables)\n* Some companies may be hurt (more taxes) but also helped (more fiscal spending)\n* Some companies may be hurt bigly (more taxes, regs, and less gov't subsidies)\n\nTo make this a pure election-related play, we want to trade:\n\n* companies that benefit bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n* companies that are hurt bigly from Democratic legislation (and don't have short-term non-political risk)\n\nSo what companies benefitted the most from Trump's tax cuts? (Source: Goldman Sachs Client note)  \n\n* Tech companies like Netflix, which saw its effective tax rate go from 23% to 7%.\n* Railroad companies like CSX, which saw its effective tax rate go from 37% to 23%.\n* Healthcare companies like HCA, which saw its effective tax rate go from 32% to 20%.\n* Pure financial companies like CME, saw their effective tax rate go from 36% to 23%.\n\nObviously, pandemic-related questions muddle price-action on healthcare. At the same time, there is still some policy uncertainty to what will happen to railroads regardless of the outcome of the runoffs (they will have higher taxes, but that may be offset by stimulus/infrastructure spending). That leaves two sectors as our pure election plays:\n\n* Tech companies will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n* Financials will get more regulation and higher taxes if Biden takes Senate\n\nOut of those sectors, specific companies may be overvalued or undervalued, and other concerns may matter more than legislative impact by the U.S Congress. For example, BABA is a tech company in QQQ, but as a Chinese company it sure isn't going to impacted much by U.S. tax legislation. We can just ignore it.\n\nHowever, a U.S. company like NFLX which is a bit overpriced and very exposed to a tax-cut rollback, is an excellent bear trade for a Democratic Senate scenario (especially if corporate tax increases start being mentioned). While MSFT, which is slightly under-valued and also exposed to tax increases, may be a good trade against a Democratic Senate.\n\n&nbsp;\n  \n**Information about the races to consider:**\n\n* In the November General election:\n\t* Perdue (R) won **49.7 percent** of the vote, while Ossoff (D) won **47.9 percent**. In other words, Ossoff substantially underperformed Biden.\n\t* The Republican candidates (Loeffler + Collins) won a combined **49.4 percent**, while the Democratic candidates (Warnock et al) won a combined **48.4 percent**.\n\t* **These are both substantial leads for the incumbent Republican Senators.**\n* What the \"reputable\" polls say about Jan. 5:\n\t* Republican-leaning **Trafalgar Group** (\"most accurate pollster of 2016\"), which had Trump up 3-4% in its November poll, has now pegged **both the Democratic candidates leading slightly in its late December poll.**\n\t* Democratic-leaning Survey-USA (which has pretty accurate polling) had Biden up 1-2% in its last general election poll, is now predicting **a Democratic sweep** of both Senate seats\n\t* Poll to Watch: AJC/UGA, with polling by UGA Professor Trey Hood (the most accurate major poll for Georgia this year). **This will be released soon.**\n* Trump has been calling the runoff \"invalid\", which might mean some of his supporters could boycott the election.\n* The Rev. Raphael Warnock is currently in divorce proceedings, and was recently accused by his wife of running over her foot with his car. Watch for whether this gains any traction (or at least enough to sway swing voters)\n\n\n**The plays:**\n\n- If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to sweep** (both 2%+), then AGGRESSIVELY short QQQ, NFLX, CME, and long green energy + industrials (e.g. etfs like TAN and Solar stocks like ENPH). I would buy weekly Jan. 8 FD puts.\n* If you expect **both Democratic Senate candidates to win** (both 0.5%+), short QQQ, NFLX, CME. I would buy puts for Jan. 15/22, since the counting might drag on a few days.\n* If you expect **Republicans to comfortably hold at least one seat**, long QQQ (specifically NFLX, FB, and MSFT) for Jan. 15. An OTM bear put spread is recommended, but calls should be fine.\n* If you expect **Republicans to sweep**, long QQQ and short green energy for Jan. 15. Use synthetic long options strategies if you can, as those are not affected by vega contraction.\n* If you expect it to be **nail-bitingly close**, and unclear whether Republicans can hold at least one seat (think month-long recount), long vega on QQQ, e.g. NFLX with a bearish tilt. This would be buying OTM puts, or buying a medium-term strangle. \n* If you expect Trump to still be President on Jan 22 following the events of Jan. 6, aggressively short SPY and long MAGA because a civil war is probably coming.\n\n\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**Q: What is the expected outcome?**  \nA: Republicans win, but there is enough uncertainty that you can definitely make money.\n\n**Q: Why bother trading an election?**  \nA: This is largely a binary event. A candidate either wins or they don't. This beats trading earnings, as often we could get the earnings result right, but still get cucked by guidance. Moreover, as shown by what has been happening in recent years, the market is often no longer sure of the outcome.\n\n**Q: Why is NFLX a particularly good short in the event of a Democratic sweep?**  \nA: Netflix has a fairly simple business model. Its value is dependent on the expected number of subscribers, the monthly price they pay minus the server cost per subscriber, the amount of its business costs to produce shows, and the tax rate. So let's go through these one by one:\n\n* Unlike when it was still a growing company, or at the start of the pandemic, it's unlikely for NFLX to suddenly see unexpected explosive increases in its subscriber base in the short term. \n* Moreover, they only recently increased prices a while back, so it's fairly unlikely for them to announce price increases within the next two weeks. \n* Their costs are unlikely to change drastically, since show production budgets are generally fixed. \n* As a company with a low worker count, you won't see any Congressperson arguing for tax carveouts or subsidies in the way automakers or airlines would. Sure, when they produce shows, there is an economic benefit to certain communities at places where shows, but shows are always temporarily (~3 seasons) and tax subsidies are generally done by local governments, not federal.\n* As a largely B2C company, they can't structure their revenue to take advantage of tax loopholes that companies with B2B segments can. Indeed, this was why the corporate tax cuts benefitted them so much, and why a tax raise will hurt them.", "id": "kouetj", "created_utc": 1609578399.0, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "I am just long spy AND green energy.\n\nCause remember stonks only go up.", "score": 68, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42118945717811584}, {"body": "Great DD but I can\u2019t believe you did not mention weed stocks.

{"title": "Alibaba is UNDERVALUED \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "One after another negative catalysts have been annihilating Alibaba\u2019s share price. First it was the [ANT IPO fiasco](https://imgur.com/kDpBPlg) and then it was CCP regulatory concerns. Do you really think the CCP is on a warpath to meaningfully hinder one of their most profitable companies? If so then stop reading here. This is literally a gift from the CCP and here is why.\n\nFirst lets start off with some fundamental boomer valuation metrics. According to Nasdaq.com here\u2019s a comparison of the two largest e-commerce companies.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nALIBABA Forward P/E:\n\n2021: 30\n\n2022: 23\n\n2023: 17\n\n12 month Forward PEG ratio: 1.46\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAMAZON Forward P/E:\n\n2021: 73\n\n2022: 52\n\n2023:(no estimates)\n\n12 month Forward PEG ratio: 3.22\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAside from the valuation metric comparison above Alibaba has [wonderful financials.](https://imgur.com/a/MX8rA12) YOY increases in cash flow and assets while maintaining low debt as a growth company is very attractive. \n\nAs you can see Alibaba is CRITICALLY undervalued compared to Amazon. When PEG is taken into account with P/E it can justify a currently high P/E IF AND ONLY IF said company is expected to grow earnings fast enough YOY. According to Zack\u2019s the E-commerce industry as a whole has a PEG ratio of about 2.56 which would indicate that Alibaba is undervalued in comparison to not only Amazon but most if not all of its peers as well. Lets also not forget that Alibaba recently increased their [share buyback program from 6 billion to 10 bilion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/alibaba-raises-stock-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-but-stock-continues-to-sink-11609124627). That's an increase of over 66%.... Even Alibaba themselves thinks their shares are undervalued and wants to take advantage of the recent sell off.\n\nSecondly lets check out the technical side of things. Here is a [weekly chart](https://imgur.com/5ffIMmO) that shows a very attractive uptrending pattern for the last few years. It also shows that Alibaba was overextended and needed a healthy pullback. Now it's oversold and in prime territory for a true dip buy opportunity. An opportunity this large has presented itself just 4 times in a little over 2 years. The huge green candle tells me that after the sell off Alibaba bulls were lying in wait for a moment like this to scoop up more shares.\n\nLastly  lets break it down in WSB valuation metrics. Daniel Zhang YOLOd his way into an empire and his wife\u2019s boyfriend(The CCP) has noticed that he is incredibly profitable and doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The wife's boyfriend is starting to fear for his top position in the house. This is why the wife's boyfriend wants to regulate the little autist so that he can maintain power over both his wife and the autist. That said the wife's boyfriend doesn't want to kick the autist out. He still wants to keep the little autist around because he generates money for him while he hangs out with his wife.\n\nTLDR; The CCP wants to make sure it stays in position as the wife's boyfriend. Alibaba is undervalued and presents an opportunity if you believe the CCP regulatory concerns are just smoke and mirrors.", "id": "kp2oxc", "created_utc": 1609612189.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Cathie Wood has been buying the dip", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "She is an Alibaba bull indeed.

I like JD just because they are focusing on growing their e commerce at the perfect time, and they also have a lot of value in how much of their workforce is robotic. From warehouse to drone delivery, it's kinda fucking cool. Also, their drones allow them to serve more rural areas in China at a much faster pace than currently offered. Need farming equipment/tools?

{"title": "I think WSB is sleeping on a huge opportunity in Apple this month. Here\u2019s why.", "selftext": "**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    \n    \n# Analysis:    \nHappy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I\u2019m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I\u2019ve bought outright calls. Here is what I\u2019m seeing with Apple: \n    \n## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    \nWhat kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter due to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here\u2019s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    \n    \n## The \u201csuper cycle\u201d rumors appear to be true.    \nAs a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn\u2019t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a \u201csuper cycle\u201d of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I\u2019ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     \n    \n[Here\u2019s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush\u2019s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   \n    \nHere are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don\u2019t read around here.    \n>\"Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds \u2026 **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,\" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    \n    \n>Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a \"stretch goal\" in the mid-80 million range.    \n    \n>Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is \"north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards \u2013 an eye popping figure)\" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    \n    \n>**\"We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.\"**.   \n    \n[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   \nNotable quote:    \n> That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    \n    \n    \nIt\u2019s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    \n    \n## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   \nIt\u2019s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it\u2019s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn\u2019t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   \n    \n## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.\nSee further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my \u201cmacro\u201d and \u201crisks\u201d sections.    \n    \n    \n\nApple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here\u2019s a Barron\u2019s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    \n\n    \n    \nApple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that\u2019s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn\u2019t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you\u2019re \u201callowed\u201d to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. \n   \n\nThose are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn\u2019t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   \n    \n## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace\nI can\u2019t track down the things I\u2019ve read here and there on Twitter and I\u2019m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple\u2019s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    \n    \n## App sales are crushing it.   \nThanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     \n\n## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     \nThe biggest thing I\u2019ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that\u2019s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. ATT may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d for them.    \n    \nApple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     \n    \nIt is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.\n    \n# RISKS\n**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    \nI don\u2019t know.  Based on the reports I\u2019ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn\u2019t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn\u2019t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     \n    \n    \n\n**Macro factors causing a crash**.    \nA lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don\u2019t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it\u2019s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    \n    \n\nI\u2019m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    \n    \nAs we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late \u201821 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it\u2019s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don\u2019t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. \n    \nA much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.\n\n**Bad subscription numbers**    \n\nIf subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn\u2019t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don\u2019t know that for sure. \n\n**Sales could have cratered in October**    \n\nSales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I\u2019m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don\u2019t really know what October sales look like.\n\n**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    \n\n[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that\u2019s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.\n\n##  Technical Analysis   \nI don\u2019t believe in technical analysis. Charts don\u2019t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person.      \n     \n## Price Target    \nI don\u2019t pretend to know things like that.     \n    \n\n\n## Fun rumors    \nI\u2019m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that\u2019s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn\u2019t really my cup of tea, but if it\u2019s yours those are two things to consider. \n\n## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    \nI\u2019m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn\u2019t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent \u201cto the moon\u201d meme stocks) with limited float. (That\u2019s not to say those aren\u2019t great companies or great trades. I\u2019m just sayin\u2019).\n\n\n## My positions: \nI\u2019m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you\u2019d expect.    \n    \nI have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 AAPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that\u2019s going to sit there for the next two years.\n\nBut I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     \n    \nThis puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.\n\n## How to get rich\nI intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don\u2019t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    \n    \nI intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.\n\n## Criticism    \nIf you think I\u2019m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I don\u2019t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If I\u2019m wrong, I want to know it. \n\n## The Most Important Factor    \n\nThis ain\u2019t my first day around here, and I know that DD is absolutely useless without rocketships, therefore: APPLE TO THE \ud83c\udf19  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.     \n\n\n\nGodspeed, fellow autists.", "id": "koonr3", "created_utc": 1609553867.0, "score": 761, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 284, "comments": [{"body": "This idiot is gonna be really surprised when he realizes he dropped 20% of his net worth on APPL instead of AAPL.", "score": 598, "replies": [{"body": "Good point. \ud83d\ude02 I belong here.

{"title": "GME Price Targets for 2021 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c (According to the Short Float Data) \ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c GME GANG CHECKING IN. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nDear GME gang \ud83d\ude80,\n\nI wanted to share my Price Targets (PT) for GME but no BS here. I give you my PT according to actual facts.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the table and check when the short % of free float went from a high point (\\~160%) at around February 2020 to a low point (\\~140%) - which by the way they, in absolute terms,  both are huge numbers of course - I won't talk about the potential short-squeeze here (I will publish the ultimate DD on GME TOMORROW and talk about it in here, stay tuned).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f72yer03mx861.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf02cf200c7f1c1722a7e55dc6c02138f1dd2de\n\n[www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4h6ff/this\\_week\\_will\\_be\\_the\\_final\\_blow\\_for\\_gme\\_shorts/](https://preview.redd.it/zojf6rxwnw861.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=a535a48d71f7c0ec722e766018004eca4aa9c1b0)\n\nThe stock went up \\~94% **BUT** most of the gain took place at 2 key moments: at the recovery of the market crash and then in late August which shows that \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c-ing is key to capture most of the gains. Why do I say this? Because when holding the stock at the time you could \u201cfeel\u201d like you bled all along esp. when you watch the stats:\n\n*Positive daily returns:          49.3%*\n\n*Negative daily returns:         50.7%*\n\nBUT IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD. CHECK THIS OUT:\n\n*Best daily return:                   23.0 %*\n\n*Worst daily return:                -13.7 %*\n\nImagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns. So just \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c and let those shorts go bankrupt.\n\nOkay, here I showed **FACTS**. Stuff that actually happened. Now here is **my opinion about a reasonable price target** according to the data.\n\nI think we could **easily** hit +80% over the next 6 months when the short % of free float will return to 140% it makes **a lower bound PT of $34 without a short-squeeze**. But this doesn\u2019t even account for the fact that some short-sellers will not be able to hold from here. Keep in mind that some shorts have a triple-digit % drawdown already.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**Price targets for the 3-6 next months according to the data from 2019-2020 (assuming the short float drops by 20%)** :\n\n* Conservative:  $34 without a short-squeeze (+80%)  \ud83d\ude80\n* Likely to happen: $50 without a short-squeeze (+180%) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n* Optimist:  $70 without a short-squeeze (+372%) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo I'd suggest that for those of you who DO NOT believe in a short-squeeze to put a take profit at around 70-80$.\n\nNote that these are price targets assume the short % of free float go down to \\~140%, if it goes to 130% or even less the price could go up substantially more. And...\n\n**Keep in mind that my PTs are overall all VERY CONSERVATIVE given that:**\n\n1. I DIDN'T even account for the fact that the next earnings will be good/great.\n2. I didn\u2019t even account for the fact that Ryan Cohen\u2019s stake is now at 12.9% - those will NOT be sold, so the potential sell-pressure will be LESS than before = bullish.\n3. With a short-squeeze I have actually no idea where this could go but again **very easily $100+**.\n\n**I WILL PUBLISH THE ULTIMATE DD ON GME TOMORROW BE SURE TO CHECK THIS OUT (100% TENDIES, 0% BS IN HERE).**\n\n**Positions**: a lot of shares. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDisclamer for the bears:  I only try to make the best PT estimations and share it with you all. I do my estimation, not by technical analysis but with actual data and what I believe to be the best hypothesis (short float will decrease by 20%). By no means I am saying I can see into the future unlike some people seem to think. I thought it was obvious but I must clarify it apparently. Anyway, I put my money where my mouth is and I share my personal insights that's it. If you really think I am wrong, by all means go ahead and buy some puts or short the stock, I'll be glad, the money you will lose is the money we will earn.", "id": "kow6gs", "created_utc": 1609587670.0, "score": 547, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 251, "comments": [{"body": "Dude, is this even DD?

Businesses worry that it could do the same in other industries, like software and chips.\n\nChina has long denied that it forces foreign companies to give up technology. They do it willingly, Beijing asserts, to get access to China\u2019s vast and growing market. Still, Chinese officials say they are taking steps to address the concerns.\n\n...\n\nAmerican companies say Chinese companies also use more subtle tactics to get access to valuable technology.\n\nSometimes China requires foreign companies to form joint ventures with local firms in order to do business there, as in the case of the auto industry. It also sometimes requires that a certain percentage of a product\u2019s value be manufactured locally, as it once did with wind turbines and solar panels.\n\nThe technology companies Apple and Amazon set up ventures with local partners to handle data in China to comply with internal security laws.\n\nCompanies are loath to accuse Chinese partners of theft for fear of getting punished. Business groups that represent them say Chinese companies use those corporate ties to pressure foreign partners into giving up secrets. They also say Chinese officials have pressured foreign companies to give them access to sensitive technology as part of a review process to make sure those products are safe for Chinese consumers.\n\nForeign business groups point to renewable energy as one area where China used some of these tactics to build homegrown industries.\n\nGamesa of Spain was the wind turbine market leader in China when Beijing mandated in 2005 that 70 percent of each wind turbine installed in China had to be manufactured inside the country. The company trained more than 500 suppliers in China to manufacture practically every part in its turbines. It set up a plant to assemble them in the city of Tianjin. Other multinational wind turbine manufacturers did the same.\n\nThe Obama administration questioned the policy as a violation of World Trade Organization rules and China withdrew it, but by then it was too late. Chinese state-controlled enterprises had begun to assemble turbines using the same suppliers. China is now the world\u2019s biggest market for wind turbines, and they are mostly made by Chinese companies.\u201c\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty big perspective and a lot of history to ignore.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This is literally also what happened to Siemens and Alstom and their railway contracts with the CCP.
