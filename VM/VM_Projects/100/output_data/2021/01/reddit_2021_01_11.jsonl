{"title": "Time to Sell Tesla...Tesla March 2021 CONVERTIBLE Senior Notes Due - Add $30B+ shares to the markets", "selftext": "These days its all about \"Tesla to MARs\" but time to be careful. With Tesla trading at $880, take your profits before a correction.\n\nTLDR of the below: Sell Tesla, or/and buy puts. Lot of new shares/liquidity of shares coming on to the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whats happening:**\n\n$1.2B of debt was issued in 2013 in relation to the 2021 convertibles. Each at a face value of 1,000Therefore there are 1.2M NotesEach note can be converted by the unit holder to 13.8940 shares of Tesla.Total shares = 16.6728M shares\n\nAt the closing price of $880, thats $14.672B in added liquidity - these are non restricted shares that can be sold right away, and therefore can encourage \"shorting\" by the holders.\n\nTesla also issued warrants for the amount of 19.2M additional shares. These however are not \"dilutive\" as they entered into essentially an options contract to purchase those shares at the effective conversion price for the notes. But these are still shares that were previously being \"held\" and will not be on the open markets.\n\nThe 19.2M \"additional shares\" are currently shares likely held by a hedge fund against the options contract written to Tesla. This means that those 19.2M shares are essentially being added to the open markets upon exercise of the warrants. Adding an additional \\~$17B in liquidity.\n\nTotal: 35.9M shares to be added to the open market, or approximately $31.7B worth.\n\nThe equity dilution will be limited to about \\~$15B, but a total of $31.7B more shares will be available on open markets. Note this is 6x each of the previous offerings still, and could add significant downside pressure to the stock.\n\nAdd the above to natural profit taking at record highs...well I would expect a big correction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpecting: <$600 by March.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the Financials:\n\n2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 NotesDuring the first quarter of 2020, we classified the carrying value of our 2021 Notes as current liabilities as the maturity date of the 2021 Notes is March 2021. During each of the quarters of 2020 through September 30, 2020, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of each of our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; causing the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the 2021 Notes would be in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common stock for any conversion premium at our election, we reclassified $26 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2021 Notes and the carrying value as of September 30, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. As we now expect to settle a portion of the 2022 and 2024 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020, we reclassified $249 million and $32 million, respectively, of the carrying value of the 2022 and 2024 Notes from debt and finance leases, net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. Additionally, we reclassified $13 million and $9 million, respectively, representing the difference between the current portion of aggregate principal of our 2022 and 2024 Notes and the current portion of the carrying value as of September 30, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the remainder of the 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes would be in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof is at our election, the liability is classified as non-current. Should the closing price conditions be met in a future quarter for any of these notes, such notes will be convertible at their holders\u2019 option during the immediately following quarter. The debt discounts recorded on the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2024 Notes is recognized as interest expense through the respective maturity dates of each note and early conversions can result in the acceleration of such recognition.As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes is now convertible into 13.8940 shares, 15.2670 shares and 16.1380 shares, respectively, of our common stock, which is equivalent to conversion prices of approximately $71.97, $65.50 and $61.97 per share, respectively. Under the note hedge transactions we entered in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes, we have the option to purchase 19.2 million shares, 14.9 million shares and 29.7 million shares, respectively, for the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes at prices of approximately $71.97, $65.50, and $61.97 per share, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 19.2 million shares, 14.9 million shares and 29.7 million shares, respectively, for the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes at prices of approximately $112.13, $131.00, and $121.50 per share, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $71.97, $65.50, and $61.97 per share, respectively, to approximately $112.13, $131.00, and $121.50 per share, respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTransactions relating to our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.The conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiaries would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes by their holders, and we may be required to deliver a significant number of shares. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market prices. In addition, the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.Moreover, in connection with certain of the convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, which are expected to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties, which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates. In addition, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions, which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible senior notes.\n\n\n\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm", "id": "kuqyaw", "created_utc": 1610324728.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Have you seen what happens to this stock post dilution?", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "Buddy doesn\u2019t understand if all of the shares sold it would drop the stock 1.5% in dillution.
