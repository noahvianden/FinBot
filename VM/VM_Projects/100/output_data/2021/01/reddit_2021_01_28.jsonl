Obviously, with the deletion of discord due to ToS violations, the moderators here are dealing with an existential threat to our community.\n\nWhile in the past, automated moderation using bots has been effective for dealing with human users violating the WSB sub ToS, I think a has been reached where the quantity AND quality of posts, primarily by bot accounts, has likely overwhelmed our moderator resources.\n\nOur moderators are not paid I don't think (unless we send occasional tendies their way). They are likely working on a way to:\n\n1. Prevent bots from creating ridiculous quantities of noise. The community up and downvoting system doesn't work when there are endless bots able to downvote posts by non-bot accounts. Similarly, even with eliminating accounts to those registered in the past 45 days, people have been sitting on thousands, potentially millions, of accounts that were registered in the past, purely in case there was a need to obfuscate legitimate content and concerns. This has been a tactic used by nation-states for other websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and more. I don't see why powerful groups wouldn't employ this tactic as well.\n2. Refresh the rules surrounding WSB etiquette. I know you all like to say \"retarded\" and such, but I've seen a huge quantity of copypasting, misinformation, low-effort/quality, and often highly abusive posts in this sub now. These can be grounds for taking down this subreddit, and we need to evolve from that.\n3. Work with Reddit to identify how to safely operate and manage this subreddit. The traffic to this sub is creating enormous strain on Reddit itself. As Reddit is a private company, they have to consider the interests of all other communities here in addition to WSB. The influx of bot traffic is causing performance bottlenecks site-wide.\n\nSo, remain calm. Trust in our moderators. Try not to spout any meme's or offensive material, and check back in later. They will find a solution.  \n\n\nEDIT EDIT: Friends, I appreciate your love and I know the moderators do as well. Take care of yourselves and be kind to one another. This community is special.. in several ways, I hope we all reach the moon.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I am not a moderator, but I empathise for their situation as I work in a cybersecurity and content moderation role for a major website as well.\n\nAlso, mods, feel free to take this down if you want to write your own explanation.

Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme\n\nIf you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.\n\nShares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!\n\nAdditionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09990475326776505}, {"body": "WE LIKE THE INVITATION", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.252175897359848}, {"body": "Anyone posted the content of the article?

GME... who would have thought a bunch of crazy retards could reach the front page of the New York Times.\n\nAnd when you're done with GME, it's time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the Bear Stearns / JPM merge. It's all in fucking Bloomberg:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-16/precious-metals-traders-charged-with-rigging-futures-contracts)\n\nThere's an excellent explanation of their scheme here\n\n[https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/palisades-gold-radio/ted-butler-squeezing-out-the-hqxQ5mOdt02/)\n\nYou think GME squeezed hard?

This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.\n\nAnd then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT.

{"title": "GME - EndGame part 4: The Saga Continues", "selftext": " \n\nThis is an extension of my DD series on GME. If you haven\u2019t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous predictions, some of which have already come true. In this post, I\u2019ll share my thoughts on what I think is going on, plus some tips to manage your positions and exits. \n\n**TL;DR:** Shorts are in but likely want to get out. And they want to get out at the best price possible. See tips for managing positions. \n\n# Previous Important Posts\n\n* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven\u2019t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close \n* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME. \n* **HEY SEC, if you\u2019re reading please read this one** \\- After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading. \n* [EndGame Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/) covered the gamma squeeze, potential shady tactics by MMs, and some tips for staying safe. \n\n# What\u2019s happening with the price? \n\n### We\u2019re still gamma squeezing\n\nMany media outlets are reporting this as a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d. They\u2019re only partially right, as [if Melvin isn\u2019t lying they\u2019ve already been squeezed out](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-short-sellers-melvin-capital-citron-surrender-bets-gme-2021-1-1030010382). \n\nHowever, the reality is so far we\u2019ve been Gamma squeezing - repeatedly - and some shorts have been casualties along the way. \n\nSee [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/) for a deeper explanation, but the essence of it is that market-makers have to buy shares to hedge the calls they sell. The more calls people buy, the more shares they MMs have to hedge with. As I explained in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), GME has ultra low liquidity, i.e. there\u2019s **waaaay fewer actively traded shares than what shorts need to buy to cover with**, and then when you get lots of people buying calls and shares in the hot new stock it just **removes more availability** from the market. \n\nAs a result, when MMs buy shares to hedge, it moves the price of the underlying up. Combine that with the buying pressure of people piling into a stock climbing 100% a day, shorts getting liquidated, and it\u2019s a perfect storm. \n\nToday, GME closed at $347 (before the after market selloff, but i\u2019ll get to that soon). \n\n320 calls were added yesterday. Similarly, when 115cs were added we squeezed to >115 in two days. Same story with 60c\u2019s etc.\n\nRemember this commentary from [EndGame part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/) on Friday\u2019s price action:\n\n*Notice how the stock dropped from a high of $75 on Friday to below 60 - the highest expiring SP for the 1/22 options, and* ***stayed tight in range for the rest of the day****. Now, for compliance reasons, MM are required to be neutral by EOD, so 20 minutes before close, MMs had to buy back all their short positions, which led to the strong close above 60.*\n\n*All this led me to believe that the* ***real fair market price for GME was above $65.*** *Without the market makers interference, GME would have closed higher.* \n\nNow, what happened today? We opened at **$351, more than double the previous close of $145** and after the morning profit taking, we squeezed to a **high of $372** as MMs furiously tried to hedge the 320 calls they sold you the day before for peanuts. \n\nSee, the thing is, [Kenny G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin) doesn\u2019t like to lose money. The magical method Citadel\u2019s market makers make money, is that they sell you call giving you the right to buy shares at a certain price, say $320, for the nice price of $10/share (for example). Now, as long as Citadel\u2019s MMs can buy all the shares they have to give to you for less than $320, that $10 is free money. However, when the underlying moves too fast, the MMs have to buy shares for more than $320, and **Kenny G does not like that.** \n\nToday was a shock to the MMs that sold all the 320cs yesterday. A ***six-sigma event after a six-sigma event after a six-sigma event***. Yet again, within days (a day?) of offering new, higher strikes - **every call option ever sold was in the money, before they had a chance to adequately hedge.**  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cq5wy45433e61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c75a1e1a6e3808b54bafc646e2e6a7f29ca7cc3\n\nSo, just as on Friday, if the price got too high above **$320**, market makers dug into their bag of tricks to start selling it off. (People taking profits here helped too.) However, multiple times, when GME went **below $300**, MMs took their opportunity to hedge the 1/29 calls. So, just as before, *we traded in a tight range around the highest strike.* \n\nMy conclusion from this action the first time was that **GME\u2019s fair price was being actively suppressed**, and **it proceeded to 5x** in the next few days. There\u2019s a possibility we\u2019re in a replay and will see more upward movement on delta hedging alone.  \n\nThe point of this is: I think shorts are feeling the squeeze, for sure, reporting [massive mark-to-market losses**.** ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-short-sellers-squeezed-losses-reddit-traders-army-cohen-palihapitiya-2021-1-1030006226) **But I believe the shorts are still in.**\n\n### Shorts are still in\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Ortex was estimating a **short interest of 65M shares**, down from 71M shares the day before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ze8wx15633e61.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a034dbb3c54509c6267f20c4122ecdf3f6cf4bc\n\nIf you\u2019ve read my Part 1 ([DTC Infinity](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/)), you\u2019ll hopefully recall my thesis that there are actually less than **24M** shares available, and therefore that it would be nigh impossible for shorts to close. Since then a slew of new investors have piled in to **buy and hold** GME, from little guys like us to big-ass-whales like [Blackrock](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000083423721001340/us36467w1099_012621.txt) **increasing their holdings to** **13% of GME.**\n\nSo what? I think the available shares for shorts to buy **are down to under 20M, and they have to buy 65M shares to close**. *Shorts have barely begun to cover.* We\u2019ve only been increasing the cost of their exits!\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Melvin Capital. I loved watching Chamath defend retail investors and argue against the institutional leveraged shorting that got us here in the first place, but I also learned something interesting that helped me understand how the 140% short interest had in the first place, and how the unwinding may go. \n\nAt [2:10 Chamath says](https://youtu.be/DYZHtF-tV0k?t=135) \u201c*Gabe Plotkin is one of the giants of our era, but at the end of the day, what happens is that his trades are copied by umpteen other hedge funds that follow along* \u201d \n\nThis tells me 2 things:\n\n* A lot of hedge funds (likely [Maplelane](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/hedge-fund-maplelane-loses-about-33-on-short-bets-this-month), [D1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/dan-sundheim-s-20-billion-d1-capital-loses-about-20-this-month), [Viking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Global_Investors), [Point72](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/point72-gamestop.html), and more) followed each other into this short. Much like retards like us get behind good DD shared in the open, these institutional retards got together with their cigars and golf clubs behind closed doors and decided together to go in together against GME. \n* If Melvin is really out, it\u2019s unlikely the other funds are going to want to stay in, lest they be compared poorly to Melvin if GME continues to go against them. **The other shorts want out.**\n\nChamath also tells us that prime brokers (the brokers that hedge funds use) are seeing [**\u201cthe biggest 4-day degrossing from hedge funds they\u2019ve ever seen\u201d.**](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354646282678149127?s=21)\n\n**Again, the problem is - there just aren\u2019t enough shares.** Shorts have dug themselves a massive grave by shorting more shares in existence and continuing to short while Cohen grabbed up 9M shares, institutions added to their positions, and retail traders piled in.\n\nFor [**boomers like this tard**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgYZk9Mc804) that can\u2019t understand why the price is so high - go back to Econ 101, supply and demand bitch. \n\n# It\u2019s costing shorts incredible $ to hold their positions\n\nHere\u2019s all the ways shorts are losing money.\n\n* They pay borrow fees to loan the stock. At one point today, the GME stock borrow fee [hit 250%](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354646088221913089) for new borrows. At $300/share that\u2019s $2/day. That doesn\u2019t sound like much right? What if you shorted at $50? \n* The short position on GME has ballooned to **$25BN from a low of $1B.** *The borrow fees are applied to the latest closing price, not the price you shorted at.* \n* Funds are paying **interest fees on the margin they are using for the short**\n* And oh yeah, GME\u2019s up like 800% in 5 days. \n\n# Dirty tactics continue\n\nAt this point, I think \u201cTHEY\u201d have figured out that gamma squeezes are absolutely destroying hedge funds. So what do they do? \n\n* **THE BIGGEST DIRTIEST TACTIC OF ALL - they only allow you to sell, not buy. HEY SEC, WHY ARE SHORTS STILL ALLOWED TO SHORT WHEN LONGS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BUY. WHY ARE INSTITUTIONS ALLOWED TO COLLUDE?**\n   * **This is insane. Funds, prime brokerages, and market makers all stood to lose money so they disabled trading of GME due to \"volatility\". Citadel invests in Melvin capital. Then brokerages shut down buying!**\n* Brokerages down\n* Options not loading\n* Restrict retail trading on GME\n   * **I\u2019m seeing reports that retail buyers not allowed to hold more than 100 GME options now**\n   * &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/is4qn8n733e61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=741f80fc182e27584954691ebb581ffee15f86ef\n\n* This is a direct defense against more gamma squeezes and an **attack on retail investors, giving institutions a distinct advantage.** \n* **HEY Shortsellers Enrichment Corporation** \\- how is it ok for [Citron to buy thousands of puts minutes before their tweet](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) and how is it ok for prime brokers to give hedge funds 10-100x leverage, but the little guys can\u2019t have more than 100 options total?  \n   * Personally, I don\u2019t really do 100s of options all at once but now I really want to. Fuck this. \n* More short ladder attacks. Look at after-hours trading on GME - a rapid short ladder attack during low-volume trading in order to bring the price down. \n* **If you use stop losses on GME and leave them on, you will get stop-loss hunted.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRipple effects of the squeeze\n\n* These hedge funds that are short GME, are also short other equities like BBBY, AMC, etc. \n* These hedge funds are also long other shares with leverage, so the ONLY way they\u2019re staying alive and not covering their shorts, is that they\u2019re **reducing their long leverage. This means selloffs in the broader market** as they have to shore up their margin requirements against the massive short squeezes in their portfolios.\n\n# I believe we\u2019re at a tipping point\n\n* I don\u2019t believe shorts have really covered yet. They have defended by getting capital infusions and reducing their long leverage. I.e. they have begun liquidating long positions. \n* If GME climbs more, they will be **forced to cover and liquidate.** \n\n# Things to be careful about\n\nAs you can see, this is no easy win. In addition to the [suggestions I wrote about in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), here\u2019s some things to be careful about. \n\n* **There are threats to halt trading. Shares are safe, they do not expire. Calls can be destroyed by tactics like buying halts.** \n* **Be careful about swapping ITM calls for OTM calls:** it can be tempting to trade-up your options for higher return, but be mindful of the delta impact. You may actually be driving the sale of shares by MMs when you don\u2019t mean to. For example, if you sell a .5 delta call for 2 .2 delta calls, that\u2019s net reduction of 10 shares that MMs have to hold long as leverage. \n* **Be careful about being short any calls this week:** Not only do you limit your upside (which is dumb in the prospect of a squeeze), you could end up in a nightmare scenario. A call that ends OTM on Friday could end up ITM after hours if you didn\u2019t sell it, and you may get assigned while the underlying continues to go up. **Close spreads if your short legs are deep ITM** unless you want to risk early assignment and high hard-to-borrow fees. \n* **There are a few other dirty tactics shorts can play.** I\u2019m not specifically going to share them here because I don\u2019t want to give the ideas circulation, but \n   * **Choose your own limit sells based on personal sell points.** Don\u2019t copy others and don\u2019t try to be memey. Make your own decisions. \n   * **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it\u2019s an **attack vector** for you. \n* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn\u2019t resume for the rest of the day? **All your 1/29 calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you\u2019re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. \n* **Be careful about buying on margin.** Brokers are rapidly increasing margins. If you bought on margin with 2:1 leverage, and the stock went up 100%, you\u2019d be in margin call even without a margin change. If the broker moves margin against you, you\u2019ll get to margin call faster. \n* **Don\u2019t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I\u2019ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing (remember last Monday with the short sale restriction?), you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I\u2019ve held through multiple 30-40% drawdowns in the underlying; and **held through a 50% drawdown today**, so you need to be ready for the volatility. \n* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It\u2019s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you\u2019ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. \n* **Don\u2019t sell on dips.** You\u2019re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it\u2019s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.\n* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.\n\nThis is not financial advice; do your own DD. I\u2019m holding over $1M in shares and calls.  **I AM NOT SELLING WHEN THE BUYING MARKET HAS BEEN REMOVED. YOU ARE BOUND TO NOT GET A FAIR MARKET PRICE.**\n\n**Update** New ortex data shows 51M short interest. So the covering has begun.\n\n**Update 2:** what you are seeing in the price drops is likely the gamma squeeze in reverse. People are rightly selling their short term calls, so MMs are selling shares they bought to hedge. That drives the price down, which then causes more de-hedging. This is all a manufactured selloff by elimination of ability of people to buy the equity and should absolutely be investigated. It's very likely the big boys knew the buying restriction was coming and started the selloff last night.\n\n**Update 3:** getting angrier by the minute. Reviewing the volume and price action and shorts bought in volume at the absolute bottom.

There's been a few posts floating around disagreeing about a skyrocketing price:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4uhms/comparing\\_the\\_gme\\_squeeze\\_to\\_the\\_vw\\_squeeze\\_needs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4uhms/comparing_the_gme_squeeze_to_the_vw_squeeze_needs/)\n\nThis one for example. It mainly has me worried in that it calculated the maximum bull price at $500 per share. Are the numbers correct? I'm not the greatest at math or economics, so I can't really say. It makes mentions of newer shorts and the like preventing it from truly taking off like Tesla. There's something about it not mattering that options expire tomorrow. What do you think? I think it's kind of invalid considering we're nearing 500 just today.\n\n2. Assuming all the things you've mentioned in previous DD posts are true: that Cohen becomes CEO, Elon buys stock, whatever catalyst happens, and the prices skyrockets; would that be a good time to sell in the context of long term investment? By that I mean sell when the stock goes huge, and then buy back as much as you can when the final squeeze is over, and then hold out for Cohen getting Silicon Valley investors. Or should someone just hold hold hold even through that skyrocket? And just play the multi-year game? It's a good long term stock for 2022 yeah? Buying at current \\~300 seems insane.\n\n3. Where is a good place to watch the short percentage? And how do you interpret it? I saw several websites with many numbers and 39% and 25% and stuff like that, and I don't really understand it. I've been told that if I'm particularly nervous, then selling at 50% short is a safe exit.\n\nMany thanks!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This was helpful, thank you!

They aren't as sexy as EV's with their cutting edge marketing and cool, you're in the future vibes, but they save money that companies would spend on fuel and they cut CO2 emissions. They do this through three existing services:  \n\t* XL Hybrid - 25% MPG improvement, 20% CO^2 reduction\n\t* XL Plug In - up to 50% MPG improvement, 33% CO^2 reduction  \n\t* XL Link - basically just software to monitor your upgraded hybrid fleet to save more money and stuff.  \n  \n\nThese are the three systems that they have installed so far, but they have two others they are racing to deploy:  \n\t* XL Electric - Full on BEV's, none of that hybrid shit, not available yet but companies that are happy with XL Fleet will start buying these guys down the road.  \n\t* XL Grid - Handles the charging and storage for your fleet of environmentally friendly vehicles  \n  \nThe XL Hybrid one is pretty straightforward. They use regenerative braking to provide electricity the car can use when accelerating afterwards. Over time this saves fuel. The Plug in option is a lot more EV style. Basically, they have a bigger battery that they charge up at a station, and that handles the power needs for the vehicle until it can't, at which point the regular engine kicks in.  \nTheir goal is pretty straightforward - to provide simple, sustainable fleet electrification solutions to the commercial fleet market. This term \"electrification\" comes up a lot with them, it's just their half step towards fully electric vehicles that might be too expensive at present. Just how big is this market? XL Fleet's investor presentation cites their total addressable market as being over 1 Trillion. Now I can't count that high but my understanding is that it's quite a large number.   \n  \n**The Leadership**  \nTod Hynes - Founder and President - literally teaches a class called Energy Ventures at MIT in his spare time.  \nDimitri Kazarinoff - CEO - scaled hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x in two years. This matters a smidge because of that 1 trillion number and the fact that, while XL fleet is leading the electrification market,there is enormous potential for growth.  \nColleen Calhoun - just brought her in a month or two ago - former VP and General Manager of the  XL Grid Division at General Electric and worked with them on Global Growth Markets.  \nDeb Frodl - Previously served as Global Executive Director for Ecomagination at General Electric. I don't even know what that word means but it sounds smart as fuck.  \nNiharika Ramdev - worked in supply chain finance for General Motors.  \nSara Sclarsic - made a biotech company on her own, works with climate change stuff, also pretty hot.  \n  \n  \n\n**Why XL Fleet?**  \nTransporation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the US and fleet managers are under increased pressure to curb emissions. Some of you may have noticed the United States had an election recently, and the new guy wants us to save the planet and have non binary drum circles. Now you can feel how you want about that, but the bottom line is that if we don't have a biosphere conducive to the existence of the human species, then civilization collapses, and that means there is no more stock market. Pretty lame.  \n  \nIf you really don't give a shit about climate stuff, then just focus on the fact that XL Fleet saves companies money. One Coca Cola fleet manager said, \"There are fuel savings and potential maintenance savings. The XLH powertrain unit pays for itself three times over its lifespan due to these savings.\" Well that's notable. That's the little guy, too. Just the XL Hybrid, not even the plug in version. XL Fleet is working with tons of big names like Coke, Pepsi, FedEx,Harvard?, Seattle firefighters, etc. They specialize in Class 2-6 commercial vehicles but are expanding into the large class 7 and 8 ones. That means they electrify utility vans, pickup trucks, box trucks, school buses, mini buses, delivery vehicles, step vans, bucket trucks and are going to eventually upgrade transit buses, tow trucks, refuse trucks, and semi tractors. Now I only know what about a quarter of those are without pictures, but you get what I'm saying. If it's a boring, task oriented vehicle you see a hundred times a month, then its probably something XL Fleet is trying to \"electrify.\"  \n  \nIf the government makes a hard pivot to BEVs then XL Fleet may miss that market, but the big companies will still want to use them. Coke, Pepsi, and others have millions of vehicles. And no EV overhaul can happen overnight. By the time its in full swing, XL Electric will be up and running, bringing on new customers and converting existing customers.  \n  \nOne last thing, they already have deals with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) like Ford, Chevrolet, and Isuzu to make it easy to install their productst. I believe the financial types call that a moat. I'm a bit of a simpleton and just consider it another reason this rocket ship is heading for the heliopause.  \n  \n  \n**Slightly Financial Stuff**  \nXL already sells stuff. Oh yeah, you read that right. In this speculative EV landscape where people throw money at you for talking about skateboards and shit, XL has customers and real life products. Don't get me wrong, I think Canoo and Arrival sound cool, but they aren't going to be pumping out millions of vehicles any time soon. XL has plans to scale up exponentially by 2024.  \n  \nEstimated revenue in 2021 is 75 million with 17 million in profits. Fast forward to 2024 and estimated revenue is 1.3 billion with 340 million in profit. Those estimates are on 6% North American Market penetration. That's ignoring their efforts at expanding overseas and their potential to outdo that 6% estimate.   \n  \nLet's look at valuation, specifically estimated Enterprise value/revenue for 2023. Their investor presentation states their EV/Rev will be 1.5. For comparison, Tesla will be 6.4 and Workhorse will be 5.5. The numbers for 2024 look even better. Now I would have made a chart or attached a link but I'm tired and don't want to figure that shit out.  \n  \nThe bottom line is they have a product, a plan, and a good foothold in a massive addressable market.  \n  \n  \n\n**....Oh yea, the motherfucking short squeeze**  \nAlmost forgot. So XL has a float of about 8 million shares. 71% of those are shorted. 8 million is a comically low number. Now, their shares outstanding is about 140 million or so, but those are locked up till roughly mid summer. If I've misunderstood that please correct me, but it looks like we've got some time to throw money at it, so do your GME thing and put some profits in XL Fleet. \n  \nPositions: 735 shares at 20.46. Cramer said don't buy it in the 20's and I say fuck Cramer. Also I don't know enough about the specifics of option pricing to really tell you if there are good deals to be had there, but the latest dated ones are August so I dunno.  \n  \nIf you've made it this far, I question how you spend your time.  \n  \nDisclaimer: This is not financial advise, I have no clue what I'm talking about, I JUST LIKE THE STOCK!", "id": "l6ypdq", "created_utc": 1611845725.0, "score": 332, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "Well said!", "score": 39, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08579057455062866}, {"body": "I own 500 shares at 20.2 myself", "score": 42, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32953256368637085}, {"body": "ASSAMBLE ARMY LETS GO TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd0b", "score": 33, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16247376799583435}, {"body": "Great DD - we ride tomorrow - f the shorts", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19439296424388885}, {"body": "Let\u2019s go", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1263522505760193}, {"body": "I like XL on a number of levels.

{"title": "Bullish thesis for Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing", "selftext": "Semiconductor demand is off the charts right now. TSM is getting more orders than they can fill.\n\nOne of the concerns with foundries, from a fundamental perspective, is the potential that the high capital costs with expansion can cause the foundries to be underutilized during periods of dormancy in demand. Which historically may have been true, but as we surge forward as a society technologically, semiconductor demand will only increase and increase and increase with time...computing demands, graphics, autos, IoT, everything...TSM has a wide lead with HUGE barriers to entry with foundries.\n\nBullish checklist:\n\n1. Incredible demand for semiconductors, unlikely to dwindle soon.\n\n2. Monopoly on market share (54%) / world leading production capacity.\n\n3. partnerships with the best fabless firms, apple, amd, nvda, etc.\n\n4. industry leading in technological advancements - ahead of the game on 7nm, 5nm, 3nm, and 2nm r&d\n\n5. not significant antitrust risk as they focus purely on manufacture of semiconductors and have not been trying to buy out other biz\n\nThe main risks imo are below:\n\n1. geopolitical risk, literally getting caught in a war/raid between china/us in the semiconductor arms race. & \n\n2. intellectual property theft.
