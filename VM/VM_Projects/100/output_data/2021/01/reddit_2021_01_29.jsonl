The stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading Friday, after losing 5.4% over the past two days. Selesky reiterated his buy rating and raised his price target to $1,010 from $777. That would make him the second-most bullish on Tesla, of the 37 analysts surveyed by FactSet, behind only Oppenheimer's Colin Rusch, who has a $1,036 price target. Selesky said he expects EVs to account for an increasingly larger portion of auto sales, as lower costs for battery packs makes them more affordable to the average car buyer, and Tesla is the \"undisputed leader\" in the EV space. \"We also believe that Tesla is well positioned to expand in the Chinese market and further believe that the incoming Biden Administration will offer rebates and new tax incentives to encourage consumers to buy EVs, which we think favors Tesla versus all the rest,\" Selesky wrote in a note to clients.

SGMO uses ZFNs (zinc-finger nucleases) which are much more efficient, site specific (less off-target effects), and even able to edit mitochondria. And they are miles ahead clinically.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation, feel free to read the first two DD I posted. First one was before SGMO stock price tan to $18:\n\n\\-[SGMO DD- Crispr Patents, Valuation, and ARKG](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klfpgo/sgmo_dd_crispr_patents_valuation_and_arkg/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;context=3)\n\n\\-[SGMO Investment Thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh7x4x/sgmo_investment_thesis_full_dd/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;context=3)\n\n* **But what do I know?** Not much. But I\u2019m relying on the fact that the 5 big pharmas that have partnerships with SGMO being able to deliver the goods, namely Pfizer, Kite, Takeda, Novartis, Sanofi, and [Biogen](https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-and-sangamo-announce-global-collaboration-develop-gene).\n* **Look at this sexy pipeline:** [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline) With 17 programs, one Phase 3, three Phase 1/2, it\u2019s a thick snacc. I don\u2019t even need XHamster any more with this page out there, free to view. Cancel your gamer girl only fans with bath water delivery, and instead stare at menage-a-17 of collabs and wholly owned programs.\n* **Compare it to** [**CRSP\u2019s pipeline page**](http://www.crisprtx.com/programs/pipeline)**:** 9 trials. And rather than list pre-clinical, phase 1/2, and Phase 3 like most reputable biotechs do, theirs is a unique \u201c Research- > IND enabling- > Clinical- > Marketed \u201d. I\u2019m all for self-expression and every biotech is a beautiful snowflake, but \u201cIND-enabling\u201d??? Clinical???? EXACTLY HOW CLINICAL??? DID YOU WALK A VIAL THROUGH A CLINIC BY ACCIDENT???? Maybe they made up a pre-Phase 1, like Phase 0.5 and they just thought it would be too avant-garde to bust out at this moment. Either way, it seems shady to choose to present your pipeline in such a\u2026unique way. Also, I don\u2019t see 5 BP partnerships listed\u2026 If SGMO is Xhamster, the CRSP pipeline is a local grannies in your area sidebar thumbnail.\n\nAlso, CRSP market cap is 12.5 Billion, *SGMO market cap is 2 Billion.*\n\n* **BTW, all those biopharma partnerships are on contracts** [**worth up to 7 Billion dollars in royalty and milestone payments**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;mn=154676&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pt=msg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;mid=21620681__;!!Cjnu1T6GFXg!_cgn4l56GtrBDe8c2-opcbkgBr5f7TmBPRwif3U3Eq2R5Bw8c3KV_aHoHEUexZJ3FD-rsXqp1Q$)**.** And SGMO has its own programs for organ transplantation and Fabry\u2019s disease.\n* **So when are some events that could make SGMO share price pop?** As I\u2019ve said before: I\u2019m not Ms. Cleo, you can\u2019t call me now, and I don\u2019t know the future \ud83d\udd2e.

There was some initial data pointing to superiority of CRSP in this indication (transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia) but what most analysts failed to realize or under-emphasized was that CRSP achieved a better result via a highly toxic conditioning regimen. So toxic in fact, one of the two patients they treated went septic (an infection in the blood).\n\n^(Without getting into it too much, this is ex-viv0 editing where cells are edited outside the body and re-infused with the genetic abnormality fixed, so it\u2019s very similar to chemo before an autologous (you use your own cells) ^(bone marrow transplant.))\n\n1. **Departure of Sung Lee has a curious little clause in an SEC submitted document about extending his stock options through the end of May.** [Looks like he\u2019s leaving in February but his stock options are good through May 27th](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;mn=154699&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pt=msg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;mid=21623366__;!!Cjnu1T6GFXg!5pklnKreXWxQetxQZIWa1nOMKMMreAzPbfmL9LdUxcqXgp8CZ8750A8uSASYgJGHTfJtkBcubw$)?

Albeit an N=5 sample set for dose cohort 4, an excellent dose-response curve for an objectively measured result (factor levels) across dose cohorts.\n\n^(For you stonk apes, Phase 1 and 2 are \u201cdose finding\u201d studies where the first concern is safety, and Phase 3 is focused on efficacy. Factor levels appear to wane over time, but in hemophilia the difference between severe and normal lifestyle can hinge on a marginal amount of clotting factor produced. So although I wouldn\u2019t use the word cure outright, excluding re-dosing tech coming down the pipeline this is a functional cure for X years in a patient population that not only experiences life threatening frank bleeds, but other debilitating symptoms secondary to small bleeds and clots (arthralgias, limited quality of life), and ultra-high cost factor infusions (up to $ 100,000k per year) for some.)\n\n* **And as far as safety/efficacy is concerned,** SGMO had one bleed 52 weeks out and Biomarin (BMRN) had so many bleeds and low/unresponsive factor levels and intra-patient variability that the FDA requested a more data when they tried to file for accelerated review and got rejected.\n* **And in case you don\u2019t believe BMRN think's you're stupid and is doing everything they can to try and get their inferior product to market before SGMO,** [check out this graph of factor levels where coloration does not correspond to zero on the y-axis to make its data look better](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/twitter.com/maxpowerngs/status/1348521834749169666?s=21__;!!Cjnu1T6GFXg!8xRKAHZ2s_AeGmrM05Eannm-jgMJedChjUH8nRCTTw16jCWU93xUaWA7foP_XePvMSQTtpXK8A$).

SGMO is** ***2 billion with 17 programs***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n* **SHORT INTEREST**\\- Normally I wouldn\u2019t post this given the difficulty of finding up-to-date, accurate short info, but given recent events I think it\u2019s of interest. SGMO has had a longstanding short float, [about 17 millions shares](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/twitter.com/_b_i_o_t_e_c_h_/status/1354336139994345472?s=21__;!!Cjnu1T6GFXg!73JP2BJmbnZDnIT1jAW2WQwMUQgI8dhQHmLrN-6ps4n11L_HV7kG9T-4cWpTMQWqifTy3h9uOQ$) right now, about 11 days to cover. Also, every major pop this stock has had due to good new or collaborations was methodically whittled away to the pre-event price (which is why I said **BE VERY CAREFUL SURROUNDING MARCH 9th**). So although it can be tricky to trade, there\u2019s a metric shit ton of stuff not priced in.\n* **And if you want to see real stock price manipulation in action**, check out the share price on the following dates that correspond to the article header pic:\n\n\n* **12/7-12/10:** Best-in-class hemophilia A results for SB-525 reported 12/7, premarket and SGMO opens $9.93 and closes at a loss for $9.05. Positive beta thalassemia results reported 12/9, premarket. Notice the run up doesn\u2019t happen until 12/10, ***A FULL 3 DAYS AFTER INITIAL HEME A TRIAL NEWS***. Sounds like enough time to cover. Stock immediately pulls back after run-up 12/10.\n* **12/18-12/23:** stock runs from low of $13.50 to high of $18.24 on announcement of Pfizer taking over heme A trial in phase 3 following stellar Phase 1/2 results. Notice the run up starts 12/18, ***5 DAYS BEFORE NEWS RELEASE ON 12/23***.\n* For record I posted my first DD on Sunday Dec 20th, with shares at $14.36 from the previous Friday, in full fucking disbelief that share price hadn\u2019t gone up from Heme A results and Pfizer takeover of the trial. Next few days it rocketed to $18.64 before the shorts decided it was time to tap it down again. **Since then, red days on low volume. Just taaaaaaap it down, shorts. Give it a little tappy. Tap tap taparoo.**\n* YOLO Screenshot attached, and that's one of 3 accounts (need to roll out those May calls). SGMO is still the majority of my tradeable retirement.\n\n**TL;DR- SGMO undervalued with proven gene editing tech headed to market. Buying shares or LEAP Jan 22' and Jan 23' calls seems cool, but I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. Selling some covered calls each month to buy more OTM LEAPs makes the time pass quicker.**\n\n[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/6ngp46n1i6e61.jpg?width=1184&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=f7c6f88f32c8daaad55a492863cf2977ea62dfcf)\n\nEdit 1: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 2: ~~I forgot I rushed this out because notorious dickhead JPM analyst Eric Joseph just upgraded PT to $35 after years of misrepresentation and shoddy research undervaluing SGMO, so I think he knows an upward move is coming.~~ I was informed this was not the case- I got this info from a repost of an older-dated post from 2018 for IV. I am leaving it here edited for transparency\u2019s sake and to show I\u2019m not perfect (RIP my perfect DD career, but as always this is all for entertainment purposes only and not investment advice anyway) but would never intentionally pump a stock I didn\u2019t fully believe in. Notwithstanding we **have** seen numerous other analyst upgrades this year, with a new average Buy rating and PT around $18\n\nEdit 3: I changed the initial lines to say when I posted first was before the $14-$18 run up I detailed in price movement analysis. I incorrectly put \u201cbelow $10\u201d. I\u2019ve been holding for 2 years and adding on all the new data, but the first post was above $10.\n\nEdit 4: I follow SGMO on Investor Village for most of the information to keep me up to date. You should too, but I\u2019ll keep distilling it all down for wallstreetbets until stock hits $100. To all my Investor Village buddies, I\u2019ve loved lurking the site, and if I pay off my student loans I\u2019ll buy a membership and say hello. Until then- spaddy, MaxNGS, gomansa, retirement, bct1192, bioimmuno, gg100, NewJeans, 2Fingers, shammy, ackje, Templedog21, compostman, SFV- you guys rock and have kept me informed and \ud83d\udc8e  \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe. **Marty Chillberg- we miss you.** Civic and Rhyno- Every village needs an idiot but we have 2 at this point (I kid, and I value the contrarian POV)- I love you guys but calm the fuck down. I\u2019ll pay for a membership and say hello when we hit $25. Maybe earlier if I\u2019m feeling rich on some particular day.\n\nEdit 5: Whatever SGMO is paying their PR/IR guy, it\u2019s probably too much because I feel like I\u2019m doing a better job for free.\n\nEdit 6: if anyone knows the people picking the new Chamath Reddit team-if you guys need a PharmD BCOP doing fucking stellar, conflict-free DD who\u2019s willing to actually be transparent and show his portfolio (I think that should be in the model). Call me. I\u2019ll work my dick off and love it for the same that I make now, which is probably a lot less than these analysts out there entrenched in the system.", "id": "l7gajy", "created_utc": 1611886569.0, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "Great stuff.

I saw myself through multiple ups and downs. I have gone through around 4(four) low, low, low -30% swings (the fourth being today's).

{"title": "Update from the Scientist who posted original NVAX DD: NVAX reports best efficacy to date against original COVID variant (95.6%) and remains massively undervalued \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "For those who followed my NVAX posts over the last few months and stayed with the trade, congratulations. For those looking for a new trade, I will outline why NVAX is de-risked and remains enormously undervalued, even with the 26% pop since data was released today. **I will also explain the significance of the results and why the reduced efficacy against the SA variant is bad news for the world, but actually presents a huge opportunity for NVAX and moreso than any of the other vaccine makers**. For those who didn\u2019t read my previous posts, I worked in vaccine R&D for several years and am currently a biomedical PhD candidate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Tldr: Despite the confusing headlines, today\u2019s data confirm that NVAX has a highly effective vaccine on par with PFE/MRNA and will allow them to lock in the billions of dollars of existing supply deals. NVAX is uniquely positioned to benefit in the booster market because it\u2019s the only vaccine that can be easily multiplexed and repetitively dosed and can be stored in standard refrigeration. There is still time to get in before the market digests this information and realizes that NVAX is tremendously undervalued with a market cap of $10.7B and is on the cusp of several billions of annual COVID vaccine revenue.***\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Headlines may have undersold the results, but make no mistake - NVAX has highest efficacy reported to date\n\nUnlike trial results we\u2019ve seen from Pfizer/Moderna, which were conducted in the US during summer/fall against the original COVID variants, Novavax\u2019s two trials were conducted in the presence of the troubling UK and SA COVID variants. For those unaware, these variants have several mutations on the spike protein which have subtle, but important differences from the spike protein in the vaccines.\n\nWe already knew that the ability of antibodies from people vaccinated with PFE/MRNA were less effective against the new variants, so differences in efficacy between variants were expected (2-fold less effective against UK variant, and 6-fold less effective against the SA variant).  As a result, the only way to compare results between MRNA/PFE/NVAX is to subset the data by each variant, otherwise it\u2019s not an apples to apples comparison. When we subset the data, here are the results:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2u6g4lwb7e61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b107fc15468cbc899f85fbccc7be6d7200a8ec18\n\n**Against the original COVID variant which PFE/MRNA was tested against, NVAX has the highest** [reported](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) **efficacy.** Yes, it\u2019s a slight margin and yes this is a smaller subset of patients than for PFE/MRNA, but the data is the data and it matches what we expected based on pre-clinical and phase 1 immunogenicity data. The fact that NVAX had higher efficacy than PFE/MRNA against the same strain seems to be missed based on most of the headlines I've seen tonight which report the 90% number. Also note that NVAX had the highest proportion of participants >65yrs old, with 27%, compared with PFE and MRNA, which had 21% and 24.8%, respectively.\n\nNot surprisingly, efficacy against the SA variant in non-HIV+ patients is significantly lower at 60%, but the vaccine will still be useful against that variant. Once again, the overall number including HIV+ patients is what seems to be getting reported which is not a reflection of the efficacy that we would expect in the general public. Note that the original benchmark from OWS was for a vaccine that was at least 50% effective so a vaccine with 60% efficacy isn't useless. The big question is the efficacy levels that the other vaccines will report against the SA variant. We\u2019ll know soon enough, but as I explain later in the document, I suspect that other vaccines will have a more significant drop off in efficacy against the SA variant than NVAX.\n\n# NVAX stands to benefit most from boosters and updated vaccine formulations to cover new variants\n\nThe results against the UK and especially the SA variant have huge implications for vaccine makers and how countries around the world are going to manage this pandemic. If NVAX went from 95.6% -> 85.6% -> \\~60% against the original, UK, and SA variants, respectively, then I expect to see similar, if not more significant drop-offs for other vaccine makers (see footnote at the end of the post for explanation).\n\nThis is a big deal because it's expected that protection will drop off over time but if you start off with lower protection and lower neutralizing antibody titers at baseline, then you\u2019d expect to lose protective immunity even faster. I made the graph below to illustrate the concept (red line for SA strain crosses the threshold of protection sooner than the blue line for the original strain).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3z6mnc1oi7e61.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5f8e6030b1f7237ee43aeab7703be6ba6cdb597\n\nSo, what does this mean? First, boosters are going to be essential and vaccine makers are going to sell a lot more doses as a result. Second, vaccines will be updated to cover multiple variants, which will continue the virus evolves. We already knew that Pfizer and Moderna were working on new versions of their vaccine, and after NVAX\u2019s conference call today we know that NVAX is working on a bi-valent vaccine (i.e. a combination shot).\n\nThe need for boosters and coverage against additional strains is a huge deal and favors NVAX significantly over MRNA/PFE/AZN/JNJ because it\u2019s the only vaccine that can be so easily multiplexed and repetitively dosed:\n\n1. Novavax\u2019s existing vaccine has only 5ug of protein (millionths of a gram) and can add multiple additional strains without concerns over dose limiting toxicity. For instance, they could add an additional 4 strains and have only 25ug of protein, which is a dose evaluated during phase 1 trials that was found to be safe.\n2. mRNA vaccines don\u2019t have this same luxury because there is an upper limit to how much mRNA can be included in a dose before toxicity becomes a problem. For instance, Moderna includes 100ug of mRNA in each shot and we already know that they discontinued their 250ug dose from Phase 1 due to toxicity. They\u2019re not going to be able to just add another 100ug of mRNA to cover another strain. This will be much more complex and may require separate shots for separate strains.\n3. mRNA vaccines also have higher reactogenicity symptoms from subsequent injections. Note that there\u2019s a huge difference in symptoms between dose 1 and dose 2 for both MRNA and PFE. This will likely carry over for boosters and additional shot and could become limiting.\n4. The adenoviral vector vaccines \u2013 AZN/JNJ \u2013 suffer from vector-mediated immunity, which makes additional doses problematic bc your immune system develops an immune response against the vector itself and significantly less DNA is transcribed into spike protein. It\u2019s unlikely that the adenoviral vectors will play a big role in the booster/additional strain market without some relatively complex and unattractive logistics (i.e. mixing Ad26 and Ad5 vectors).\n\n**The need for boosters and for strain updates means that COVID vaccination isn\u2019t going to be a one-time event.** This is bad for the world, but this is a huge deal for NVAX bc revenue forecasts for 2022 and beyond will be significantly higher than the DCF models used to arrive at current price targets from JPM and Jefferies, both of which are over $200.\n\nAlthough the need for updated vaccine formulations presents an opportunity for 2nd wave vaccine makers to become relevant (i.e. $ALT, $VXRT, $ARCT, $CVAC), it will be more challenging to recruit and conduct trials, creating a bit of a moat for NVAX and other 1st wave vaccine makers. There might be some interesting plays in that space, but NVAX remains best positioned at this point in time for future COVID vaccine revenues.\n\nAnother thing worth addressing is the fact that the speed by which the mRNA platforms can develop new candidates is very exaggerated. They have about a one month jump over NVAX's platform, which is time that's easily made up by the ease with which NVAX can be distributed due to standard refrigeration requirements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# NVAX's is significantly undervalued with a $10.8B market cap ($170/share)\n\nI'm not a CFA and prefer to stick to the science, so I will reference the fact that multiple analysts had price targets north of $200 (Jefferies at $200 and JPM at $215) BEFORE considering the newly revealed importance of boosters and multivalent vaccine formulations which will add billions to annual revenue projections for 2022 and beyond. I suspect price targets will end up being much higher once the data and implications are digested and models are updated. These price targets were also before considering having best-in-class efficacy data against the original COVID variant.\n\nFor reference, consider some COVID vaccine competitors such as MRNA, BNTX, and CVAC, which have market caps of $63B, $26B, and $15B, respectively. Yes, their platforms are being given a higher multiple due to potential revenue for other indications, but NVAX successfully completed its phase 3 trial for their flu vaccine ($4B market) by demonstrating superiority versus existing best in class flu shot and have an advanced RSV vaccine candidate. Oh and they'll likely have a multi-valent COVID vaccine and annual booster revenue.\n\nLast but not least, it's important to emphasize how big of a deal it is that NVAX requires standard refrigeration and not the cold chain requirements of MRNA and particularly PFE. We tend to think the most about the US and EU, but a lot of the world cannot distribute vaccines with special temperature requirements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Upcoming catalysts\n\nAs mentioned above, I anticipate that we\u2019ll see a wave of analyst upgrades in the coming weeks.  I expect that we\u2019ll see a wave of new supply contracts with countries that don\u2019t yet have a secured supply of vaccine.\n\nJNJ will be reporting data next week from their Phase 3 trial evaluating their 1-shot formulation. They had several sites in SA and I anticipate that they\u2019ll be reporting efficacy specific for the SA variant and I expect it to be low. The efficacy readout for JNJ\u2019s 1-shot trial is based on protection at day 15 post injection and based on immunogenicity data published this month, I\u2019m expecting poor efficacy against the SA variant due to low NAb titers at day 15. I anticipate that poor results against the SA variant will act as a positive catalyst for NVAX as JNJ is viewed as an important competitor for NVAX due to also having standard refrigeration requirements.\n\nAnother likely catalyst will be the revelation that UK data will be able to be used for US emergency use authorization. For reasons that I can't understand, the media has largely ignored the fact that UK data can and will be used to support US EUA and that the US trial is relevant for eventual full licensure in the US which is a status that no COVID vaccine will have for at least another year. I don't think this has been appreciated and I think it will serve as another catalyst.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll see efficacy data in the near future for PFE/MRNA against the UK and SA strains. It\u2019s possible that we see some of this data next week at conference that all are attending on February 2nd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nCurrently have 1/29 $150c, $160c, and $170c with a handful of 2/19 calls and call spreads.\n\nAfter I dump the 1/29s tomorrow, I plan to buy a combo of shares and 2/19 call spreads to play the next wave of catalysts.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for your time \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n1. There are two reasons why I'm expecting to see bigger drop-offs for other vaccines against the SA strain compared with NVAX: 1) lower baseline efficacy in the case of AZN and likely JNJ and 2) lower baseline neutralizing antibody titers compared with NVAX \u2013 true for PFE/MRNA/JNJ/AZN. Yes, T cells are important and may be an important differentiator for the mRNA  vaccines, but efficacy numbers to date have correlated with neutralizing antibody titers. T cells can\u2019t prevent a virus particle from infecting a cell; they can only kill a cell once it\u2019s infected (impt for disease prevention) whereas sufficiently high levels of neutralizing antibodies can prevent a virus particle from ever infecting a cell in the first place. One way or another, we\u2019ll have comparative data very soon.", "id": "l7l3nn", "created_utc": 1611900443.0, "score": 413, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "This is great and all but we\u2019re kind of in the middle of something right now", "score": 194, "replies": [{"body": "I will donate 10% of my gains to the GME shares of your choice", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "So you think it\u2019s still a good time to invest at this $220 price?

In the very near term, I think it\u2019s possible that we see some revised PTs (JPM already revised up to $290) as well as increased discussion around the new variants and need for boosters/updated vaccines and a continued increase in PPS. \n\nThe other important missing piece of the puzzle is that we don\u2019t have comparative data from other companies for efficacy against the SA/UK variants. JNJ managed to avoid reporting it with their evasive PR, but we might get updated efficacy in the near future for Pfizer/Moderna. If it\u2019s lower than NVAX - and I think it will be - then that would be a big catalyst, IMO.\n\nLast, I don\u2019t think the market has fully appreciated the ramifications of the SA variant for future vaccine development and the clear need for boosting.

Ill go into detail\n\n1. 2 billion annual production capacity\n2. 1.7 billion in contracts\n3. Lower efficacy for SA strain means people will need a booster every 6-12 months\n4.  mrna strains will not be able to provide boosters for multiple strains at once like novavax\n5.  Novavax is only company in world to test a flu/covid combo in a phase 3 trial (UK)\n6. Nanoflu will become the market leading flu vaccine\n7.  The potential for an annual flu/covid booster is enormous.\n\n1. So the first one is pretty straight forward.  8 manufacturing facilities in 7 countries including the massive facility at serum institute.  Serum Institute expects it to cost about $2 to produce each dose.\n\n2. Novavax has contracts with US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, EU, India, Israel, Philippines, and all poor/middle income countries via CEPI.  about 1 billion of the annual doses will be sold via cepi for a profit of .50 a dose.  The other billion are close to $16. cost on those may be closet to $4 a dose and a portion of those are partner shares via japan south Korea.  lets say 700 million with $12 profit and 300 million with $6 profit.  Thats .5 Billion plus 8.4 billion, plus 3 billion.   11.9 billion annual profits for the best in class vaccine...\n\n3. The lower efficacy was actually good news for vaccine manufacturers as it means demand will be perpetual (like flu) as vaccine companies will need to protect against different strains. (as a result of the JNJ and NVAX data JPMorgan increased their expected covid vaccine market size\n4. Going forward, the mrna vaccines are at a disadvantage in responding to multiple variants due to the side effects.  They are unlikely to be able to increase dose size as demonstrated by all Moderna phase 1 participants getting very sick with the high dose(100% had fever over 101).  novavax went with their 5 dose instead of 25.  Both were safe and equally effective.  This means novavax could easily give a booster for 5 variants.\n5. 400 participants were tested with a flu/covid combo in uk trial.\n6  often forgotten is Nanoflu which beat the market leader in head to head phase 3 comparison for all 5 flu strains.  Flu market is 4.1 billion for over 65 and nanoflu is positioned to capture a large portion of that.\n7. So um who isnt going to want a flu/covid booster? This is why Ra capitol invested early.  They saw the potential.  Who wouldn\u2019t want the best in class flu and best in class covid vaccine combined??  This is going to be HUGE..........\n\nSo in summary we\u2019re looking at 11.9 billion in profits... before even talking about income from nanoflu or the future covid/flu combo which is going to be the most demanded vaccine in history.  We now know there will be annual boosters needed due to reinfection rate seen in nvax and jnj trials as well as the new strain being less effective.  Other future strains are bound to happen and will also require different boosters.\n\n11.9 billion times 20x PE is 230 billion...

Fabs take years to build and outfit and the fabs that ARE up are over-starting to meet the demand  but they still can't.  \n\nWhat does that mean?  For one, it means ASP is going up for supply.  AMD probably has most contracts locked for the time being but next year's supply will cost them more.  They are competing with auto companies, whose big swinging dicks are gonna win, since they pay more for higher reliability.\n\nThe second part, the over-starting?  That's a risk that means any issue in the supply chain can't be made up in time.  It means AMD needs every wafer and when there's an manufacturing issue they can't get caught up with 110% utilization in the plant.  \n\nMake that worse because with the over-starts, maintenance gets pushed out.  CRitical stuff will get done, don't get me wrong.  But people start trying to push out maintenance 10-20-50% and stuff starts slipping, making it more likely that one of those supply issues happens.\n\nIt's also not totally in their control.  The supply chain to semi's has been stressed with covid and while better now, is still close to a cliff.  Most critical materials don't have a quick backup available and if a suitable replacement can be found its a costly and timely qual with added risk.

We learned that Robin Hood's boss is Citadel. Yes the same Citadel that bailed out Melvin Capital. The most likely reason Robin Hood bailed them out is because if Citadel goes under Robin Hood will probably go under.\u00a0\n\n\n(Yes you read that correctly) You hear that at the \u00a0 mark\n\n\n2.We learned that Citadel's boss Steven Cowon use to own a hedge firm that got (word for put out of business).... (Destroyed maybe? ) for insider trading. 16.08 in mark\u2014\u2014 Steve Cohen Company S-A-C \n\nNow this mother fucker is in charge of the company that is in charge of Robin Hood where we put our money. This makes a shit ton of sense.\u00a0\n\n\nSee this at the 13.20 min mark.\n\n\n\nWhy does Robin Hood need Citadel you may ask? Robin Hood is a (free-ish app) that doesn't charge you for commissions. How do they do that?\n\n\nThey do that by sending your order out to be filled by a brokerage slash hedge fund like Melvin Capital or Citadel. That company then makes it's own stock moves to play off your stock moves to make better decisions. Decisions that will make their company the most amount of money. Hear that at this mark. \u2014\u2014(22.27 minute mark)\u2014\u2014 \n\nRobin Hood actually paid out 34 million dollars in Dec 2020 for not giving their members the best deals on there trades being made (by these crooks like Melvin Capital and Citadel, and Steve Cowan NY mets owner) \u2014\u2014\u00a0 (7.19 minute mark) \u2014\u2014payment for order Flow (best execution) (with rebates)\n\n\n(Watch at this Mark) \u2014\u2014\u201414.05 minute\u00a0 mark\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nThe fucked up thing is they paid up but didn\u2019t confirm or deny these allegations.

I\u2018m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. \u2022\t\u2060Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. \u2022\t\u2060A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. \u2022\t\u2060Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80\n\nAnd of course, this isn\u2019t financial advice.

{"title": "I have been doing interviews about this whole ordeal after posting my positions and the fact that GME has changed my life. I have been contacted by Huffington post, New York Magazine, Forbes, and a few others....", "selftext": "Here are some text clips from the script that I used for my last interview. Would like to know if you all agree.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nIt seems like people have really bought into this cause and are willing to take signficiant losses\n\nwhy do you think that is\n\nheapsp:\n\nI think you have a combination of rising expenses such as student loans, rent, and stagnant wages causing a whole generation of folks to lose faith that life for them will be the American Dream that everyone talks about. With crippling debt and no way out anytime soon, you have people who want to succeed but feel like they can't. Then they see Wall street folks or CEOs making record profits, they know it is wrong but have no way to fight back. A bunch of people get interested in activism or politics thinking that they can make a change for the better and improve the situation, but the game is still rigged against them. This is an opportunity to fight back. The fact that everyone is worshipping /u/deepfuckingvalue is obvious, because he is also a father of two and took all of his savings and made it. Everyone is just looking for an opportunity to level the playing field.\n\nheapsp\n\nThe idea that you can succeed by pulling yourself up by the bootstraps in this day and age is so false. I have a good job and career that I've been working at for 11 years. I work in technology. I still worry every month about buying formula and paying rent in a decent neighborhood so my kids can have a normal life. I have no savings and I don't waste my money. Half of my friends in their 30's either still live with roommates or at home with their parents. I am fortunate to be working with a great company, but I work incredibly hard. 60 hours a week, sometimes nights and weekends. The board of directors is insanely wealthy - I am scraping by. I can't imagine how difficult it is for people who are out of work or are under-employed and trying to make a decent life for themselves. For a lot of us, joining this community and banding together is about a lot more than trying to make a quick buck. We see it as our 'French Revolution' where we can strike back at the greedy and corrupt. Who better than greedy hedge fund managers that have pushed their greediness to the maximum level by shorting businesses into oblivion. The fact that we are in a pandemic and a hedge fund can short a brick and mortar store into the ground with illegal naked short selling and no one is going to do anything about it - well we are doing something about it. If the system won't handle it, the community will.\n\nheapsp\n\nI think you will find that wallstreetbets investments for the most part are really grounded in altruism. Tesla - Making the world not rely on fossil fuel and improving the environment.  Gamestop - punishing a hedge fund that wants to step all over a brick and mortar store during a pandemic. Also notice that you won't see many companies being supported that would have made the community a ton of money - AMZN for instance. For the community investment isn't only about making money - lots of retail investment is done from the heart. In no other community of investors would you see so many people HAPPY for other's success. We treat each other like a band of brothers, not competition. That is why we hold. That is why so much due diligence is shared. Some very smart people share some very insightful information without even investing themselves, if it would help the community succeed.", "id": "l87j8t", "created_utc": 1611962402.0, "score": 356, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "\u201cI just like the stock\u201d\n\nEND OF INTERVIEW", "score": 202, "replies": [{"body": "WE LIKE THE STOCK", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Yesss!

And that difference, means (when buying a call), that if you get it wrong, you are only out that token price. And at best, if you exceed the price that you bet on in the time that you're given then you start making extra ordinary amounts of money - possibly.\n\nNow the *problem* with options is there's a risk if you make that call and sell it and someone buys it and they're right in your wrong you can lose infinite amount of money. There's also a bunch of funny things you can do by linking options together, and it gets really exotic.\n\nOptions are generally used to hedge. For example if I was a farmer and I routinely buy my grain for $4 in the spring. However I'm a smart farmer and I know this winter has a strong possibly of going to be very bad - or just for good financial sense, I just don't want to take the risk. So I go and buy an option for a dollar (token price) that allows me to buy an option for $4 (strike price I want) in the spring. The whole thing now costs me five bucks total - but only 1$ upfront/is consumed.\n\n- If winter comes around and it's bad and in spring the wheat is now $25. I can exercise my option and buy it for $4 and bank the saving, or because I'm now the owner of a $25 commodity/stock, I could then immediately turn it around and sell it and turn a profit if I wanted to. \n\n- If winter was mild and the wheat turns out to be abundant, and thus cheaper then 4$. I just let my option expire for 1$ in loss and I buy the stock itself/commodity for the new lower price of $3 or whatever. Then you are out $1 if you want to look at it that way, but you hedged, against crippling 5x (25$) normal costs. \n\nAnd that's kind of the basic principle, but of course like all things in financials *people get very exotic with it* - and when you're hedging corporations that are mostly non physical-made-up stuff/value, it gets a whole lot of complicated. Example: Tech companies trade at 30 times plus what they're worth - So if you're hedging. You saying are they going to just be more exorbitantly overpriced? Or less overpriced?
