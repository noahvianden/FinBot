{"title": "If the Markets Shut Down Tomorrow for 10 years, What Would You Invest in Today? - A Buffett Exercise", "selftext": "\u201cOnly buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.\"\n\nAs The Great One likes to point out, investing isn't complicated. He's consistently preached about investing in good companies with great management or investing in within your circle of competence. Sure, he's missed out on the tech boom, but results are results. His teachings span across all generations and his quirky teachings make investing seem so simple. \n\nWe're now in an environment that many say is a bubble (though that's been the case for 20 years), uncertainty about the FED artificially inflating the price of stocks, and an army of young investors YOLOing it all on garbage companies, perhaps exploiting how easily the market can be manipulated. But for Buffett, the dude just grabs his McDonalds sandwich each morning, heads to work, sucks down a Coke, and reads for like 8 hours...completely ignoring all the noise. Why? He's invested in good companies with good management. \n\nSo assuming you could only invest in 6 stocks, (1 of which is completely speculative just for fun) and TOMORROW the markets shut down for 10 years, which companies would you invest in TODAY?\n\nHere's my list in the order from highest to lowest portfolio %\n\n1.

What are you talking about? \n\nYou seem to fundamentally misunderstand what a stock is. It means you own a portion of a company. The stock has an intrinsic value which will go up or down depending on how the company performs, regardless of whether the markets are open. It will pay dividends, and the price of the stock will update when the markets reopen.

How else would the price change if there are no buyers?\n\nIn the meantime, the economy is still on the go, and inflation is affecting the prices of common goods. So technically for the $200 you're holding you are not able to buy the same amount of goods anymore which means your money is worth less than it used to at the time of buying the stock.

It doesn't deflate or inflate. While your broker might track the market value of your portfolio, you don't actually have $200 in your account after buying a share worth $200. You can't buy common goods with your share.\n\nIf you buy a share of a company, you are buying a portion of the ownership of that company, no more no less. The point Buffet and every other great investor makes is: when you buy a stock, don't worry about what the price of the stock will be in a week or in a year. Concern yourself with how the company will do. If the company does well, you'll do well. If it pays dividends you'll get dividends.

There was a dip in 2008 and Q1 2020 for obvious reasons. Now we see rising trend and analysts estimate it to keep raise at least for the next few years.
