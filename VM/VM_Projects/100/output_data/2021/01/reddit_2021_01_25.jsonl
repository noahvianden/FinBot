Tesla's ML is considered \"online\" (ie- tracking is being performed on a realtime feed), so there's no future frames available to help inferencing, but it's possible offline videos (using future frames) could be used for training weights used in online inferencing.\n\nThere's several ways to do this- the one I'm familiar with is \"optical flow\", which is the motion vectors of individual pixels over previous frames. Nvidia uses this for their DLSS ML-based upscaling algorithm. You can Google \"FlowNet\" for a common CNN example that's often used today in CV/ML courses, but there's more complicated approaches that use more than 1 previous frame for nonlinear motion estimation.\n\nThen there's object-tracking. Let's say you've already classified objects (cones, pedestrians, cars) in a previous frame with a very high confidence. These labeled objects will help discriminate classification in the next frame. Objects identified across multiple frames will be given velocity vectors to increase accuracy of prediction (greatly affecting behavior output), which also helps guessing where they end up in future frames.\n\nIt's already obvious that Teslas uses previous frames in some form in their network, otherwise it would be difficult to calculate motion vectors of other vehicles, so I'm not 100% sure what is implied in this context.

{"title": "Follow the King; Join the $GILD", "selftext": "Hello my buddies! It is our favorite time of the week-Tendie Time-and today we will be examining the next big thang, Gilead Sciences, or $GILD. Most of you are surely familiar with the Remdesivir producer, but it's recent foray into cancer therapeutics and drugs telegraphs a likely big move being an acquisition by Roche the leader in all cancer drugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, of course we take everything some random user shouts on here with a grain of salt. So, I made sure to bring a mountain of DD done by some true autist. I will provide links and breakdown each in case you're just a lazy fuck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to 5 parts of Roche merger with GILD theory:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.griproom.com/gilead-and-roche-merger-theory](https://www.griproom.com/gilead-and-roche-merger-theory)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part One: It looks like Gilead is about to Merge with Roche\\*\\*\n\nThis starts with some background on the playout of the market as Covid-19 began unraveling. How the idea to repurpose Remdesivir could lead to benefits and this dude flipped 50k to 1.5 mm. Unfortunately some shit got leaked and sent the stock spiraling, but in the end Remdesivir was shown to shorten hospital stays by 5 days which is pretty huge\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the autistic shit in this part is an evaluation of revenue to market caps of peers in the biotech industry.\n\nJohnson n Johnson:\n\nMarket cap: 406\n\nRevenue: 82\n\nR to MC: 20%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoche\n\nMC: 300\n\nR: 61.5\n\nR2MC: 23%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNovartis\n\n207\n\n48.5\n\n23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMerck\n\n201\n\n47\n\n23.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPfizer\n\n210\n\n52\n\n24.7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbbott\n\n193\n\n32\n\n16.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmgen\n\n133\n\n23\n\n17.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbbVie\n\n184\n\n33\n\n18\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAstraZeneca\n\n133.7\n\n24.4\n\n20.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEli Lilly\n\n163\n\n22.3\n\n13.7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Gilead Sciences\\*\\*\n\nMarket Cap: 74\n\nRevenue: 22.5\n\nR to MC: 30.4%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean? That GILD is the most undervalued of all its peers. If they do as good as last year, the R2MC goes to 31.3. Sales of tecartus, yescarta and trodelvy are supposed to go up though and the higher it goes the more ripe it is to get boughtout just like GME is a steal at 60 and goin to 420.69 for a blaze out before 1000, but I digress. Once this gets to 40% a buyout at 100% premium is solid. GILD also has Kite, Forty Seven, Arcus, and Immunomedics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome facts are shown about how current CEO worked 30 years at Roche type of shit. How Roche is world leader in cancer treatment and worked with all these companies that Gilead proceeded to buyout. This is important because Gilead could buy these companies for cheaper because they smaller than Roche and therefore Roche acquires them cheaper. Just good ol fashioned business practices or some shit I guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cool thing is that 80% of the stock is owned by institutions so is has that infinity squeeze vibe type of feel to it. This is also super relevant because the pandemic is causing a backup of cancer diagnoses and so cancer drugs are going to be booming for awhile. If GILD were priced like its peers itd be at 90+ points. A merger could be expected to be priced around 120$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 2: Gilead is the Next Celgene\\*\\*\n\nThis is the craziest part about all this shit. These people are getting caught manipulating GILD using the same stocktwits and yahoo finance accounts they used to shit on Celgene in fall of 2018 before its buyout by Bristol-Myers. The deal took years to pull off and GILD checks all the same boxes like 52 week lows and losers on stocktwits calling their management dumb and the stock just never following the broad index or responding to good news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis parts definitely worth a check cause he found all the lame comments of people trying to manipulate the price. They use this trick called the anchoring effect. For example sale 50$ (reg price 95). \"Ill buy that stock at 50\". Just shit these astroturfers try to do to fuck with us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese two companies are basically the same story so the same players that were involved with Celgene could be in charge of merger here with Roche n $GILD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 3: Signs that Gilead and Roche are Reading our Merger Articles\\*\\*\n\nHere, the guy figures out that executives are going through from $GILD and Roche reading his stuff. His buddy helps him sifon through the data to establish statistical anomalies like lil Foster City Cali having a ton of views like top 5 and its one of smallest cities in cali. There's also ties to a bunch of other cities and executive headquarter location type of stuff. Even in fuckin Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 4: Gilead is Insanely Undervalued\\*\\*\n\nGilead just plummeted last six months of 2020 and never responded to good news anymore. Roche is chugging away. As their marketvalues keep growing apart it makes it even more plausible. Again, 80% owned by fuckin institutions that just gotta sit and hold that shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 5: Market Cap Spread Between Gilead and Roche Continues to Widen\\*\\*\n\nRoche's current market growth makes it able to sell shares and dilute in order to buyout GILD. Up until Dec 31 2020 GILD kept sinking and sinking. Since GILD is 80% owned by institutions a buyout needs to be very lucrative. All was well until Remdesivir brought the hype train and it spiked the shares to the 80s. This shit couldn't be accepted though so MM fuckers made sure to short it back down the rest of the year to fucking 7 year lows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason they waited till the new year is likely tax related, so this explains why we are seeing current growth these first few weeks into the new year as well as an analyst upgrade by MS to 83. This shit is massively undervalued and its ripe for a short squeeze because 80% owned by institutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck these fuckers who try to steal the game. Let's make some money, gentlemen and gentlewomen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nGILD is being manipulated as fuck and is probably getting boughtout by Roche up to 100 or possible infinity squeeze because 80% institution owned.

{"title": "January 25th, 2021 GME Battle Diary: 4:00AM - 4:00PM", "selftext": " \n\n**4:00 AM**\n\nLight skirmishes started early with retards from the 136th Armored Idiots surprising the enemy and taking substantial ground out of the gate. Caught off guard, the enemy was driven back on their heels. The boost in morale was immediate and would reverberate through the rest of the bloody day.\n\n**5:00 AM**\n\nThe enemy awoke to chaos and confusion, but managed a minor rally, driving the 136th back into the arms of the 103rd Sleepy Retards. They would go on to put up a valiant fight and suffer many casualties in the coming hours. The fighting was sporadic but intense at times.\n\n**6:00 AM - 9:30 AM**\n\nSkirmishes continued between the lines of the 90th Diamond Dildos and 103rd. Battle lines were drawn and troop positions massed in these key early hours. The skirmishing saw gains come and go and would telegraph the bloody day to come.\n\n**9:30 AM - 11:30 AM**\n\nIn an explosive maneuver, general [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) assembled and unleased the full might of the 159th Weaponized Autists. The fighting was sustained, intense, and bloody. The 159th gained ground at an alarming rate and it appeared as if total capitulation of the enemy was imminent. Troops that managed to penetrate deep into enemy territory reported seeing the enemy General Left stuff mouthfuls of crayons into his face and shit waxy rainbows.\n\n**11:30 AM - 1:00 PM**\n\nWe underestimated the resolve of the enemy. A flanking move by General Melvin took the 159th in the rear and scattered our troops. The fear caused a substantial complement of our soldiers to desert and run for the hills on the spot. I have not words for these cowards. At the same time, I saw good men - nay, great men - of the 159th, 150th, 140th, 130th, 120th, 110th, 100th, 90th, and 80th cut down en-masse. I will not speak further of this here other than to say that they will be avenged and see their names carved into the stones of Valhalla itself.\n\n**1:00 PM - 4:00 PM**\n\nI can only note here the deep pride I feel in my men and in my cause. I am not an emotional man, but what I saw with mine own eyes today would evoke emotion in the stoniest of hearts. After what appeared to be a stunning reversal and brief loss of ground, my men dug in their heels and fought like legends out of my childhood stories. Ground was given and taken over the next few hours, but at the end of the day, the enemy was driven back. My heart is filled with pride and hope for the future.\n\nThis day will not be forgotten.\n\n100 shares, 1/29 60c", "id": "l4xs9m", "created_utc": 1611609396.0, "score": 2369, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "TO VALHALLA AND BEYOND MY BROTHERS!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 397, "replies": [{"body": "Happy cake day", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks man!

{"title": "Why I'm Long GME", "selftext": "Why I'm Long GME. No, not because I live for yolo plays. Not to post screenshots of tendies. No, it's because I'm thinking about what GameStop could be.\n\nIt seems to me that the biggest weakness of professional stock analysts is their lack of imagination. Think of the analysts who covered AMZN early on and could only see an on-line book seller. How about the people covering NFLX who could only think about how many DVDs were being broken by USPS. Or the naysayers who still, to this day, look at TSLA as a \"car company\" to be compared to F.\n\nThe reason I'm Long GME is a simple, perhaps overlooked, two-sentence comment in the most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, on page 23, which reads:\n\n\"***Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.*** Create the social and cultural hub for games and entertainment and expand GameStop\u2019s addressable market through category and product expansion to offer the most comprehensive product offering across the GameStop omni-channel platform. Our customers are increasing their engagement across the spectrum of games, entertainment and technology and our focus remains to meet those expanding needs.\"\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm)\n\nIn my opinion, GME could easily become a multi-purpose gaming hub. After Covid, of course, but imagine this please: GameStop becomes the destination for comics, graphic novels, collectible card games, table top games, and, naturally, video games.\n\nMalls are dying. Imagine a space the size of those pop-up Halloween stores that had an area of connected XBoxs and PS5s (so that a group of friends or strangers could run a Fortnite match. maybe even store vs store matches); a separate area of tables for D&D campaigns; an area to build gaming PCs; and an area for collectible card game matches (GameStops existing used game system could easily be adapted to handle the massive market for M:TG cards). Imagine a wall of comics, graphic novels and magna. Another wall of D&D books, modules, minatures and dice. GameStop locations already have TVs, so why not Livestream Critical Role and eSports events? Of course they could sell snacks and beverages. GameStop has the clout and size to make lucrative leases with Malls and make gaming hubs a reality.\n\nImagine this gaming hub, with endless free parking, and just a short walk from the Starbucks, Cinnabon, and the entire Food Court! Would you go to such a location? I would!\n\nThat's why I'm long 100 GME @ $38.50 and thinking about going longer after I rebalance my portfolio.\n\nDisclaimer: This posting should not be construed as investment advice!\n\nTL;DR: GameStop + Gaming Hubs  = $GME x Moon\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "l4cvmt", "created_utc": 1611538597.0, "score": 936, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 323, "comments": [{"body": "We are all long game.

That\u2019s a mistake. Look up design thinking. Businesses that are successful are taking a long view\u2014thinking about fulfilling customer needs, even if it sometimes comes at the expense of short-term profit or runs contrary to how businesses traditionally think. As an example, Chewy is known to basically hand out refunds without making you send a product back if you\u2019re dissatisfied. Stupid move on a micro level, but on a macro level, they\u2019re gaining loyalty and repeat customers.\n\nAs for GME, having an e-commerce experience that is specific to gaming has a lot of potential, the same way that having an e-commerce experience specific to pet care was so successful in the case of Chewy. Take Amazon or Best Buy. They sell a lot besides video games. It\u2019s hard for them to invest a lot of time and money optimizing their information architecture, including their navigation, product listings, and product pages for video games, specifically. They use the same boilerplate page structure as they do for other products on their site, like refrigerators and TVs.\n\nIf you primarily sell games and consoles and accessories, you can make pages on your site and your site\u2019s navigation super optimized for finding, reading about, and purchasing games. Being able to optimize a site in a way that makes it easier to navigate might not sound like a big deal, but works. You can also use personalization to more effectively surface and recommend games that a person might be interested in. Trust me, I do this shit for a living.\n\nAlso, think about the potential for return policies specific to games.

To get people to come back, make it so that the money spent renting the unit in-store can be used (to some degree) to offset the cost of purchase. The idea is to reward coming to GameStop to purchase the item you demoed.\n\n3. Gaming distribution, especially as a publisher for smaller games offered with their subscription service. Currently, Steam takes a 30% cut but makes no effort to promote games. What if GameStop cut into the lower-volume sector and tried to find diamonds in the rough (like Among Us)? Employees would be happy to play new games, I'd imagine. The profit comes from taking a cut at retail or bundling it into a subscription.\n\n4. Used physical card games, collectibles, etc. The market is ripe for disruption here, and this does not change much from GameStop's current core business.\n\n\nSimilarly, in the PC space:\n\n1. Used electronics is a market ripe for disruption, and GameStop is well-placed to become an arbiter for transactions (more trustworthy than Craigslist, but takes a cut in exchange for basic operating checks on sold devices).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This Autist *gets it*!!!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.050288230180740356}], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I believed in GME when it was 4$ per share and covid19 lockdown started.
