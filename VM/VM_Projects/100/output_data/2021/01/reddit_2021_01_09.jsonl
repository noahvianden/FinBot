{"title": "I invested half my net worth buying Volkswagen stocks, here's why", "selftext": "The EV market is booming and so are the stocks of new players (Tesla, Nio, etc.). After its last run, Tesla is now worth 9 times Volkswagen (VW). You could argue that there is a bubble and Tesla stocks will go down hard eventually, which is true, at least to some degree. But will it lose 90% of its value and remain at that valuation? I highly doubt that. \n\nFor those who don't know, VW owns major brands like \u0160koda, Seat, Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, among others, so it offers cars in every price segment. \nln the last couple of years, VW has invested a lot of money into EV, creating a modular platform for all their brands (MEB) and the core brand released both their ID.3 and ID.4 this year, which were promptly sold out.\n\nNow I want to compare Tesla's and VW's chances in a new car market dominated by EV:\n\nAdvantages Tesla:\n- Hype, image, design\n- They were the first movers, which was an advantage because they could focus on their strengths and force competition to follow their lead\n- current market share in EV\n- autonomous driving (although 'real' autonomy is still far away and others could catch up/cooperate; https://on.ft.com/38aIV0v)\n\nAdvantages VW:\n- experience building cars, quality of production\n- existing factories with staff (ramping up production numbers is comparatively easy)\n- existing retail network\n- different brands offer the opportunity to target their customers more specifically, improving margins\n\nBasically, Tesla's biggest problem is production, they can't increase production numbers as fast as the EV market does, so they will lose market share, giving other players a chance to compete. Even though VW was late to the party they are now in a position to overtake them in production and sales in 2021 or 2022 (e.g. Norway, where 52% of cars sold in 2020 were EV. In that segment Audi - owned by VW - surpassed Tesla in sales. Or Germany, where the ID.3 sold extremely well considering that delivery only just started in September).\nNA is a market VW has historically not been very successful in, that might still be the case in the future, but I am optimistic about the rest of the world.\n\nThere are other reasons why I think VW will be successful:\n- the company has remained highly profitable throughout hard times like the emission scandal and Corona, while at the same time investing huge amounts of money into the switch from combustion to EV\n- if I am not mistaken, they also invested into Fuel cell technology, diversifying risk\n- VW is market leader in China and Europe, people know and like their vehicles and will continue to buy them\n\nThe biggest issue VW has is probably software. Like most German companies, they seem to be unable to deliver competitive products in that aspect, but they'll sort it out eventually. \nLastly, I want to say that I don't expect VW to rise as much as Tesla did (obviously), yet I expect huge jumps in the future, decreasing the gap in market cap of both companies. Patience is key. \nI would love to hear if you agree with my analysis or not. Please point out aspects I might have forgotten to take into consideration.\n\nEdit March 19th 2021:\nI am quite happy with how things have gone so far. I did sell about half of my shares a week ago in order to buy some shares of growth companies on the low. \nThere are currently some rumours regarding plans to put parts of Porsche on the market. Everybody owning VW shares would receive Porsche shares if that were to happen, further increasing the value of the company. I see a bright future for the company, although I am not following the day to day developments very closely anymore. \nRegarding Software: As sb pointed out in the comments, VW has founded a new branch called Volkswagen Software Org. The VW CEO wants it to become the second largest software company in Europe after SAP with over 10000 employees. They plan to finish their operating system by 2024 and sell their autonomous cars by 2025. \nTo sum it up, Tesla is still ahead in Software, but it is unclear if they will be able to increase production enough in order to dominate the market when other manufacturers catch up in that regard.

Let me explain.\n\n1. Experience building cars.\n\nThey have experience building ICE cars. Not EVs. Could they have fewer problems with panel gaps than Tesla? I'd assume so. But that's not what makes an EV. There is a reason Tesla has, by a significant margin, the most efficient electric drivetrains (evidence is found in range which Tesla dominates) of any auto manufacturer and that's because they specialize in it. Not dabble. And even if that wasn't the case wouldn't every OEM have that same advantage? If so, how is it an advantage specific to VW?\n\n2.  Existing factories.\n\nThose factories are designed, from the bottom up, to build the wrong type of car. Say goodbye to all the machinery and skilled workers to make engines. Say adi\u00f3s to all of the same for traditional drivetrains. Also consider that they will have to rework factories to build electric motors and electric drivetrains. A traditional ICE factory can't make electric cars without SIGNIFICANT expenses and downtime. Something Tesla will never have to deal with as all of their factories are designed from the foundation up to build EVs.\n\n3. Existing distribution networks. Aka dealerships.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, please, but does VW own the majority of their worldwide dealerships? I don't think they do. While this might on first glance seem like a benefit there is a major downside. In many countries OTA updates are considered a service and thus must be done in a certified dealership or repair center. Since Tesla owns all of their distribution network they can push out OTA updates asap to everyone on the same day. Many OEMs are required, by law, to have this update be installed in the physical dealership which inherently slows down the speed of innovation.\n\n4. Brand differentiation\n\nI mostly take issue with the part where you mention the margin. Tesla already has a, sans regulatory credit, margin of above 23% which is near industry leading. As production ramps in Shanghai continue those margins should only inceaae and with FSD enabled taxi's they could easily exceed 50% margin within 2 years. While this is speculative the current margins are already nothing to scoff at and if their stated goals work out then it could completely redefine what industry margin standards look like.\n\n\n\nI am long Tesla, if that wasn't already clear lol, but I genuinely hope for EV success across the board as that is fundamentally a good thing for competition, innovation, and the planet.

Not hard whatsoever to imagine a Tesla with FSD bringing in $100k per car per year in NYC. Even in smaller cities with less taxi's it's still probably going to be $30-40k revenue on a car that cost Tesla ~$20k to make. I can't imagine Tesla charging anything less than $100k per semi for companies like Walmart or $30k a year if a subscription either.

I'll try to address the points you are making.\n\n1. Experience building cars/existing factories\n\nMost of my arguments here are applicable for all traditional OEMs entering the EV market, I just think VW is furthest ahead.\nI'll give you the drivetrain, but that's a traditional engineering problem, the one thing Germans really excell at. I don't expect that advantage to last. \nI am talking about the experience of having production numbers of tens of millions of cars every year, including logistics (coordination of just in time delivery), close cooperation with suppliers, having production plants in the countries you are selling your cars in, knowing their local regulations and culture and train your staff to have your mentality/work ethic.\nRegarding staff, if assembling an EV was more complicated, you'd have a point, but it just simplifies the process and you only need to train a few people to mount it.\nI think you overestimate the problems that are caused by switching production in a plant and underestimating the time and cost involved in creating new factories. Just look at the planned production site next to Berlin, it won't build cars until 2023. Keep in mind Tesla would need to increase their production at least tenfold in the next couple of years and it's not guaranteed to be smooth. VW on the other hand switched the production to EV in at least two factories fast and without any real impact on total car deliveries.\n\n2. Car dealerships\n\nI don't have any knowledge in this field to dispute your claims\n\n3. Brand differentiation/margins\n\nI think you're overly optimistic. Tesla could offer those margins, as there was little competition on the market. Unless they manage to become an Apple equivalent in the car market, I don't see them maintaining that margin once competition enters the market. And I doubt that will happen, as there are brands that are more premium than Tesla. So they either become a premium car maker and stay with low market shares and high margins or they will build huge numbers of cars and reduce the margins.\nTesla's FSD has less of an advantage over the competition and the introduction of that kind of tech is further away than you think (see the ft article I linked).\nIf they manage to to introduce it 1-2 years before everybody else, that would mean big gains for that period, but other manufacturers will follow and pricing will again be a main differentiator.\n\nAgain, I am not saying that VW will surpass Tesla, I am just stating that stock valuations are very often heavily influenced by a US-American perspective on things. \nApparently, VW sell shitty cars over there and just aren't on the radar of many investors. Once the sales numbers for 2021 are published that will probably be different and I wanted to make you guys aware of that. \nOf course I also have an interest that people reading this at least take a look at the stock and assess it themselves. The more people know about a stock, the higher the probability of it rising.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like you really just brushed drivetrains aside. Those are obviously extremely critical to the overall performance and value of a car. It's a pretty significant advantage for Tesla imo.\n\nAlso Berlin will be building cars by Q3 this year per Tesla. Idk where you get your 2023 info from but that's way off.\n\nI guess what doesn't sell me on your argument is that as someone who has followed Tesla for about a decade is that it's literally the same exact argument people said against Tesla in 2012,13,14,15,16,17,18,19... the competition is always 2 years away. It's just not convincing to me anymore. Now I know that OEMs are actually making EVs now so I suppose it's true in a literal sense but I don't find their cars compelling. Shorter range, nothing even remotely close to FSD, and significantly smaller charging network. It's just not compelling. Not that VW can't succeed or that your investment won't pay off but I just simply don't see anyone beating Tesla unless they beat themselves.\n\nIn regards to FSD I really do think you're greatly oversimplifying the scale of the difficulty involved. In terms of capability there isn't even a close 2nd place and no one has 5% of the data to train their software that Tesla does. That's an enormous advantage that can't just be explained away by two or three years of VW working hard. \n\nAnyways. I think VW will make it as they seem to at least understand how the market is shifting. The same can't be said for many OEMs and I think a few will either go bankrupt or be a tiny shadow of their former selves. I'm sure I'll get downvoted again for thinking FSD is undervalued lol. I just fundamentally can't understand the bear logic here. It's like trying to convince me that 1+1=0. The TaaS market is a multi-trillion market on it's own. It just seems plain as day to me. We didn't even go into any of Tesla's other businesses btw. I can't understand why they're so easily dismissed by so many as nothing. \n\nBest of luck with your VW investment!

It's Total Addressable Market is 300B. \\[2\\]\\[5\\]\n\nHydrogen will be bigger than Lithium-Ion batteries. It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen. ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \\[2\\]\\[6\\]. This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now. The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \\[3\\]\\[2\\].\n\nThe advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:\n\n1. More power density than Lithium battery. What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery; or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings. Picture the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.\n2. Quick charge. Fueling a fuel cell would take minutes rather than hours with Lithium batteries.\n\nNote: blue hydrogen is made from natural gas. grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuel. green hydrogen is made from wind/solar/hydrodam/nuclear\n\nThe EU already moving to a green hydrogen economy \\[3\\]. Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \\[1\\]\n\nSo comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.\n\nBE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells). They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.\n\nLastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \\[4\\]. So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.\n\nYou are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035. Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery. And we are only here because of the deep investments in solar and wind to reduce the cost to produce green hydrogen.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://s22.q4cdn.com/122868703/files/doc\\_presentations/2020/11/Bloom-Energy-Hydrogen-Day-2020\\_11\\_18-FINAL.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/122868703/files/doc_presentations/2020/11/Bloom-Energy-Hydrogen-Day-2020_11_18-FINAL.pdf)\n\n\\[2\\][https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/112020-green-hydrogen-costs-need-to-fall-over-50-to-be-viable-sampp-global-ratings](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/112020-green-hydrogen-costs-need-to-fall-over-50-to-be-viable-sampp-global-ratings)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://www.bloomenergy.com/company/board](https://www.bloomenergy.com/company/board)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://s22.q4cdn.com/122868703/files/doc\\_presentations/2020/12/16/Bloom-Energy-December-2020-Analyst-Day-v2-(002).pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/122868703/files/doc_presentations/2020/12/16/Bloom-Energy-December-2020-Analyst-Day-v2-(002).pdf)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/201119-how-hydrogen-can-fuel-the-energy-transition-11740867](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/201119-how-hydrogen-can-fuel-the-energy-transition-11740867)", "id": "ktvsha", "created_utc": 1610215222.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "I've done research and taken university courses on hydrogen fuel cells where they talked a lot about the hydrogen market and the FCV to EV comparison.\n\nThere are three main issues with hydrogen cars in my opinion.\n\nThe first is that we have no effective way to produce green hydrogen. Using electrolysis to produce hydrogen and then running it through a fuel cell gives an overall efficieny of 30-40%. This is much worse that EV vehicles and adds multiple unnecessary steps in powering the car in my opinion.\n\nThe second issue is infrastructure. One of the biggest obstacles in the adoption of EVs was the chicken and the egg conundrum in that you need EVs to for EV infrastructure demand (charging network), but you need infrastructure to make EVs viable. In order for FC cars to be viable you need a distribution network of hydrogen. This is much more difficult to do since we already had a network for distributing electricity (the electricity grid) whereas we don't have  the high pressure transportation and storage infrastructure for hydrogen. People also very easily had the ability to charge at home since they already had electricity access, something they don't have with hydrogen.\n\nThis brings me to my last issue which is high pressure Hydrogen storage. One misleading fact I heat quoted a lot is that hydrogen is much more energy dense than batteries and other fuels. While it's true that hydrogen is very energy dense by WEIGHT it has very poor VOLUMETRIC energy density. This means that in order for the hydrogen to not take up a huge amount of space it needs to be compressed to very high pressures which adds a lot of cost and complications to the distribution and storage.\n\nOverall this doesn't mean that all fuel cell electric vehicles are doomed, but you should be aware of the obstacles they face, which in my opinion are far greater than EVs.

He was stubborn and confident that since we use eyes so computers can you use just cameras. \n\nI have Tesla model 3 and it does a bad job in parking. Auto pilot works great but atleast 5-10 times between LA to SF it does phantom breaking and scares the shit out of me. The model 3 h/w (original not the new one), is laggy, youtube display stutters. I can list a ton like these. The H/W is old for Model 3 and the new H/W will again be old in 2-3 years. People keep their cars for atleast 10 years. So potentially there will be a class action lawsuit in another 2-3 years, if H/W in these cars don't work as they are promised. My Acura MDX 2005 works even today great but it never a single OTA :-(\n\nTesla did an amazing job on making EV market viable. Kudos for Tesla. But self-driving is a different beast. All the market leaders will go through ups and downs till a viable solution works. The chance of leader taking all won't happen, as everybody is in the race with enough $$. \n\nThe most likely winner would be Google, MobileEye, Amazon (zoox), Tesla. Others are working on the tech, but Tesla is building cars. Having production cars is a baggage when you want to launch a new tech. Because the tech will change so much, all the cars has to retrofitted ( or may be obsolete). What if there is a viable solid state battery that comes out in the market. Quantum Scape is confident in launching one. Now Tesla can't take advantage of that one, as it has gone into cylindrical cells. \n\nToo many technology changes can come in battery tech, self driving tech etc. No one has the crystal ball to predict how this is going to evolve.\n\nLastly, I don't believe in cult personality and I think Elon is a baggage going forward.

Getting something working from 99% to 99.9% takes 10 times the effort. That is the reason I don't believe in Tesla. Because they have handcuffed themselves and convinced Cameras and Radars will work. I agree Lidars have challenges in adverse weather. I am ok in my car driving like a grandma during adverse weather, but I prefer it to drive better than me, when the weather is great. To make such thing, if we need to add any kind of sensors, we should add it. That's is my point.\n\n\nTesla, Waymo and others are trying for Level-5 automation using different approaches. Waymo works great but it is geo-fenced. But atleast it works. Scaling is hard and expensive, but it is doable. If Waymo can scale their solution by expanding their geo-fence, to me that works great and they will take the market.\n\nTesla approach shines for any route, even if it has never seen. It is awesome. Generic solution to any problem, which is an awesome driver assist. But to make it a level-5 and reach 99.99 and beyond would be hard.\n\nWaymo seems to be working 100% but area restricted. Now you tell me which approach will work? Waymo is willing to add any more sensors or anything to make this work. They are still in development stage, once they figure out it works 100% and it can be scaled, then they will go to production ready vehicles (built on purpose with autopilot in mind). \n\nBut in Tesla's case, they have production cars that has cameras and radar. Any major change to these sensors or adding new ones, would trigger a huge recall. Will Tesla will do this? I doubt it.

In Tesla\u2019s case, the customer is paying to be part of the data collection fleet.

Waymo is interesting because it might drive the best for its location, but if it takes many years and billions of dollars to scale, it may end up in the dust of another approach. How long could it be before Waymo exists in Seattle where it rains frequently? Phoenix rarely has rain, snow, or dense fog so we can\u2019t say for sure how much work they might need to support it.

Waymo does work great for  good clear region, but may not work in rain, snow etc. Tesla works for generic scenario, but doesn't seem perfect so far.\n\nBut Waymo can have tweak solutions ( sensors etc) for different market.

It is restricted by form factor of how the car looks and also since the cars are in production, so they want to work with what they have.\n\nThis is my sole argument.

During the dot.com people bought massive amounts of stock in all kinds of computer related companies, as soon as it had something to do with computers and internet their stock soared. It was the future right? (just like EVs) However the best of the best are still here and valuable today right? (Microsoft, Apple). So people bought shares without any proof of profitability, demand or the proof that the product can be delivered. (Nikola anyone?)\n\nTesla has demand as proven on their reports, it has just become profitable, they can deliver and they are the best in the business just like Apple and Microsoft was during the dot.com bubble.\n\n2. When the stock prices soared in these companies they took massive loans which they couldn\u2019t pay as there was not nearly enough demand for their products which made a lot of companies go bankrupt and the bubble burst! Do you see Tesla having a demand problem? I don\u2019t, but i\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on their reports. \n\nThere is a lot of ev startups out there and many of them will go bankrupt and many old timers are on really shaky ground like Fisker for example. Tesla is moving so fast and outperforming the other ev automakers they might not survive.

Every orifice we have has been smokefucked relentlessly by Melvin and his circle jerk penises hiding in suits. It hurts, but the bleeding will stop. Now suck it the fuck up. It's time to pack some gauze and toilet paper. Put your helmets and retard safety gear on because Ryan Cohen has us swaddled in his arms.\n\nFor all you raisin brains working your double fast food shifts and lacking the time to watch Ryan Cohen's twitter like the fat kid eyeing the last 5 donuts in your Krispy Kreme box, I have your back.\n\nAs we all know, a great leader doesn't show face 24/7, but they do come around when you are bent over backwards getting pillaged into oblivion by Melvin's STD riddled uvula puncher in a dark alley behind a Waffle House. This time is no different. Our savior Ryan Cohen just told all you dimwit-fell-off-the-shortbus-smooth-brains to strap in for a \"fun ride.\" I went ahead and took a break from half chub jerking off to my friend's TESLA gains to reverse image search this high quality piece of treasure.\n\nMassive Membrane Ryan Cohen took some time out of his day to search roller coaster memes and found this one. We have been instructed to \"keep arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times\". This isn't just some numbing gel to soothe the pain of our torn open and prolapsed assholes. ICR conference is next week and I know some of you weak handed semen squirters hopped on the ride and chickened out at a fucking loss, right before it started. You left your dignity in the same bathroom that you threw your shit-stained underwear. We are gonna go on the ride of a lifetime with enough action that you'll finally have something relatable to tell your wife's boyfriend. It's one that will make your chump pump inflate so explosively that you'll feel a sharp tug on your butthole.\n\nYesterday was everyone but us (and PLTR, sorry guys). Today was Tesla swinging their nuts like vibranium reinforced wrecking balls, knocking every sell wall out like Mike Tyson KO'ing your crippled grandma over the last bit of Chicken Tikka Masala... and everybody else but us again. However, our time to shine is almost upon us. Our balls drop next week and you might even get your first erection. When this rocket starts blasting, you'll go from your first pube to filming your first consensual orgy in record time. (Thanks Melvin for making me point out the sex acts you've forced on us).\n\nFor all you cowards that sold out of GME today and made some money. I am still proud. Either hop back in with more than you had before or go make tendies elsewhere and be prosperous. For you other sperm suckers that sold out of GME today at $17.08 because you have weaker hands than a sleeping quadriplegic, I hope you like giving throat jobs at truck stops for pocket change. Lemme do you a favor, if you sold out of GME at a loss and weren't up EOD, don't hop back in or your toilet paper hands will dissolve as soon as this girl starts getting wet and you'll just lose money all over again.\n\nI know Melvin has done some damage and our assholes move like a blown sub and at this point, probably can't even hold in a fart. It's okay, sometimes making tendies causes grease fires and 3rd degree burns. If you want Melvin out of your guts, you better pull your head out of your own poopchute and throw up a \"Do Not Enter\" sign to prevent future mishaps.\n\nAt this point, I'm more excited to see Melvin capitulate into a ball of wrinkly old man writhing in despair and loss, than I am to see green dildos on my screen. Regardless LOAD UP THE FUCKING ROCKETS AND LIGHT SOME CANDLES BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE BITCH IN HERE. IF MELVIN WANTS TO STICK HIS ONE DROP WONDER PLUNGER INTO GME'S CHILI RING, P-UMP IT AND SQUEEZE THAT SHIT CLEAN OFF!!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAlso, for the last 10 times I tried to post this, it got blocked by some anti-evil bot and I've had to go back through and censor the more vulgar parts of my post. It doesn't matter because you idiots can't read anyways. Puts on reddit.\n\nEdit 1)  First off, I have tried to post this since noon. I found that the automod was blocking the word \"quickcl0t\" of all the words in this post, which, surprisingly, took me forever to narrow down. It was initially supposed to be \"pack some gauze and quickcl0t\" but toilet paper had to suffice. I suppose it was triggering some sort of call to vi0lence bullshit so it took me forever to find out what was wrong and get this thing approved. Secondly, [/u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) and his VisualMod bot smacked me with using the banned ticker \"p-ump\" so that's why that shit looks stupid. Sorry this shit is late, I wanted ya'll to have it earlier, but fighting Melvin and reddit is a full time job.

They have not pushed the boundary in this field at all. If you want good software engineers, go to Google, Red Hat, Elastic, Akamai, Shopify, SAP, Adobe or Salesforce, Palantir, or maybe even Facebook, but good luck getting those guys out. Potentially tier one breakout unicorns like bolt, airtable, fastly, tiktok, database companies, or edge companies amongst others.\n\nNot apple. There I would headhunt if I want marketing or design.\n\nWhat you need to understand is how difficult it is to build fully self driving cars, suitable for robo cabs.\n\nThe best self driving car makers are:\n\nWaymo (Google)\n\nGM\n\nArgo.ai (autonomous intelligent driving), part of VW.\n\nThose are the companies leading in every conceivable metric in this field.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly!

So the future where people no longer own a car and just spend $1 to get an autonomous taxi ride to work is completely and utterly impossible under Cruise.  When it rains, Cruise shuts down, and you can't operate an infrastructure replacement that way.  It would require everyone to own a backup car.\n\nTesla, on the other hand, was designed to operate in any conditions and anywhere on the map.\n\nSo yes, Cruise may be able to perform better in a small pre-defined area under ideal conditions. *If it couldn't, that would be embarrassing.* But Tesla can drive from downtown SF to downtown LA without driver interaction and can do it today, and it can do that anywhere.\n\nThen there are all of Tesla's financial advantages. GM has $120B debt and has to pay high interest rates to raise more, Tesla can raise $10B instantly and debt-free through offerings. Cruise needs to buy and operate their own fleet, at massive capital costs, as well as pay to maintain, charge, and clean them.  Tesla taxi would operate under the Uber model of just taking a cut off the top and use the roughly $100B in customer-paid cars on the road.  Cruise has to pay employees to generate each mile of FSD data to analyze, Tesla just pulls it off cars driving around today for free.

Selling people on idea's of great dreams is all well and good and part of the speculative plays of the market, but one day those people will awake to realize the company may never achieve those lofty ideals they were sold all those years before.\n\nThis is similar to the cold fusion boom and bust during the cold war.  People were and still are being sold on the idea of infinite energy, batteries, and green energy global warming etc etc.  But truth be told, this planet is never going back to a molten ball of energy because of us lowly humans, no matter how much gas we burn or nukes we set off.\n\nWe stay warm because below us all is a nuclear reactor & the sun warming the surface, as time goes on the total net energy has and will be loss through leakage into space and we're here scrounging for ways to harness it before it's leaked off, which is good.\n\nWe will not be alive to witness a major revolution in our ability (to retain/reuse the majority of this energy on the earth) but we're being sold on the idea that it can happen TOMORROW because we're susceptible to false information/ideals that we believe worth pursuit, this is just the way it is.\n\nThe point is, realistic goals such as harnessing energy for more than 1 use can be a great thing (such as Rube Goldberg) but actual reduction of pollution in food supplies/revivors to preserve longevity of existence of humanity (for the next generations to live) on this rock is going unattended/unaddressed by 99.9% of the world.\n\nWe're being sold the idea of how to fix those other polluters by fixing ourselves or paying a tax under the guise of \"it's global warming\" and \"it's to save the world\" but that avoidance will cause a worse outcome in the long run because it doesn't change the bad thing from becoming worse/an even greater problem, it just masks it and blames you for it!  We should be addressing it in a realistic approach such as fines / outright suspension of trade of pollutant products/companies or some other reasonable means but we don't (for fear of war while promoting greedy & feckless morality leaders who will continue to sell the mask idea to live richly rather than have solutions for everyone's future) and in the meantime people will get FOMO &/or hype the shit out of a company such as TSLA by saying they will be the cure to all these ailments because they want ever so badly to be part of 1 good thing.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "additional thing, I was just informed by a family member they came across someone who said \"Tesla must be great because Elon just became richest in the world.\"  So there we go, we know there are these types of people who will, tomorrow go try to buy TSLA stock because of 1 headline but will then go -60% in a year and panic sell and wonder why the stonk pick didn't work out after Elon has cashed in on those billions of floating $'s.  \n\nElon himself could tank the company valuation if he sold his 30% stake and then rebought the same amount or even just 25% of the company shares just a few months later.

{"title": "I'm calling bullshit. Why I'm shorting TWTR", "selftext": "TLDR: bad fundamentals, bubble burst insurance, political landscape\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are 3 reasons why I'm going to buy put leaps on twitter this coming Monday. I usually stay away from puts as I'm a bull myself, but the uncertainty we're facing now requires some kind of hedge and I believe this is one of the better hedges out there. You guys do your own DD as always.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nTwitter doesn't actually turn up any profit. They have a negative cash flow and this is despite being public for over 7 years now. Their stock price has hovered between 14$ and 60$ over these past 7 years and its valuation right now has reached the point it was in 2015. 85% of twitter's money comes from ads. This is due to take a hit due to Apple's upcoming privacy changes which makes it harder to do targeted ads. At the same time, as the pandemic is beginning (eventually) to wind down, online commerce should go down a bit, maybe not to pre pandemic levels, but still, and that will further affect ad revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bubble insurance**\n\nWhether we are in a bubble or not doesn't matter. However, due to skyrocketing valuations of tech companies, you'd have to be extremely retarded not to at least hedge your positions. I'm sure most of you read the arguments for and against the bubble on other threads by now, so I'm not going to debate those here. What I'm going to assume is that there is a CHANCE that we're in a bubble and that it may burst at any time during the next 2 years. Could be tomorrow, could be in 2 years, could be in 5 years, could be fucking never idk. \n\nBut if you want to hedge, Twitter is one of the good companies you want to buy put leaps on. It's an online tech company that's already losing money in an environment that's supposed to make them TONS. if that doesn't reek of failure, idk what does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Political headwinds**\n\nI don't want to get political here, but we do have to at least mention the current situation. Twitter's decision to give a big fuck you to half of america is not how business works. If you're a conservative, forget about 'fairness'. If you're a liberal, forget about 'revenge'. If you want to make money, all you need to look into is just how monumentally they're fucked up from a business perspective. Twitter's user base has been hovering around 320 million mark since 2015 until today, while their userbase grew from 30 million to 300 million from 2010 to 2015. Clearly they've stagnated for a long while now. One of the reasons why social media has risen to be so influential over the past decade has been the freedom it allows users to express themselves. Big tech didn't pick sides in the beginning so their platforms attracted people from all over the place. \n\nNow, I don't know what portion of twitter's userbase is conservative, but it's surely not inconsequential. Booting off the platform this portion of the userbase will only make the company's value go down even more over the long term. There are also non conservatives who value freedom of speech who will also bleed out from the platform. Less users = less ads = less money = lower stock value.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the big tech antitrust and monopoly issues they're facing. And this is something the DEMOCRATS have suggested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: All the signs point to twitter's demise. The company has very few positive things looking forward to, and most of these positive things are market wide, such as the new stimulus package. Any one sign written above in itself is not a good enough reason to short the stock.

{"title": "AAPL Earnings DD and iPhone 12 Sales Estimates", "selftext": "TLDR: My spidey senses say Apple will beat earnings bigly on strong iPhone sales and higher av. selling price. AAPL calls for Jan 29 - March on any strikes above 130 will print\n\nPositions: AAPL 132c 2/5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbm5039np2q71.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f72f7a9a132c930a5e4c15d1e0b62120833e8b21\n\nOver the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Anyone could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133.\n\nA few articles from shills and morons below\n\n[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)\n\n[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)\n\nI did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.\n\nAnalysts expect a [38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales.\n\nAdditionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at.\n\nUsing availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7q5pohtp2q71.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=927b11be38e74768546a25a863b40433dcea5895\n\nAnalyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call.\n\n**Positions**\n\n\\\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.\n\nI have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play.\n\nIf you buy puts fuck you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g52442yxp2q71.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd225c90c6908ca53df8de1c0515155b1ee934a\n\nOn top of that I just have that little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9. I'm not so good with words but I like my numbers and they check out. And lets face it, you've yolo'ed on worse DD before.\n\nEdit: Completely forgot the crucial part of a DD\n\nTO THE MOON!\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 literally can\u2019t go tits up", "id": "ku0e2j", "created_utc": 1610229415.0, "score": 107, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "Totally agree.

{"title": "The Pot/Weed/Cannabis DD that WSB has been missing. Real roadmap to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "Sup retards? Here's my opinions, make your own decisions. \n\nSo I'll start with the TL;DR: Pot stocks are gonna \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udca5 over the next 2 years and 2022/23 calls are future printers (or as early as 90 days) that even Elon himself will raise an eyebrow at. Decriminalization is just a layer of icing on a beautiful cake of banking reform. Also, Biden speaks on the same day Aphria presents at JP Morgan conference, big potential. Grab your helmet and HOLD the fuck on. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude80\n\nOkay retards, let's talk about weed. First off, some have mentioned this, but nowhere near enough. Since the Democrats took the senate, the next HUGE catalyst for the marijuana industry is the banking bill, this may cause bigger spikes in stocks than even legalization, as that will get priced in over time as momentum builds towards full legalization. Will stocks go up the day it is passed, absolutely. But will they be Powell level printers? Probably not. More like those busted Bitch McConnell ones. Basically like Pfizer's lackluster performance after saving the world. It was already priced in. So I believe pot stocks will do the same over a period of time. Meaning, again in my opinion, the biggest catalyst for Marijuana is the soonest change we can expect from our new government. I really expect this to be as soon as February and as late as July of this year, for the banking bill. Calls out to 2023 are extremely cheap imagining the upside coming, but calls in July might as well be BOGO. Do your own research as far as what timeline you guess the Senate will take. I'll tell you it was said that It will be addressed in the first session. \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\nAlso, imagine basically any major company being forced to grow with no reasonable access to capital and no access to common tax write offs that every other company gets to use. Can they find debt currently? Sure. But basically at rates that a \"subprime\" lender would get, and then some. Access to reasonable and competitive capital is gonna be a game changer and allow them to invest and expand into things that are working in preparation of national legalization. Also, depending on how it all shakes out it may allow companies like Canopy (CGC) to purchase Acreage (A deal already made.) Or even better, companies like Marlboro to purchase Cronos (again, already a deal). Both deals are contingent on federal legalization though. \n\n Any kind of renewed commitment to the M.O.R.E act or marijuana decriminalization from Biden would make stocks go on \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25. Also, I expect Aphria's presentation to go well. Why? Well, other than being retarded, we have all been locked down for months. You really think stoners stuck at home are smoking less? No, \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udf08, they are not. They are smoking hella weed and playing hella video games. Weed stocks and GME Gang are about to do some Ricky Bobby slingshot shit when Biden locks everyone down thanks to Covid 2.0. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Though, I have no positions in GME just to be clear. I pray for the MOASS to be bestowed upon you by Lord Cohen, but theres just no way marijuana stocks aren't %1,000+ gains just waiting on Senate approval for fucking blastoff. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSo, within the next 2 years, we can pretty confidently say we will have made huge strides for the marijuana industry under a vice president who was the senate sponsor for the MORE act, and a president who wants to make himself appear to fight social injustice. Those conversations are going to be hard to have without bringing up marijuana.  Also, a slow path to legalization would be decimation for the chances of small companies to compete considering the infrastructure and experience more established companies will have. Not many companies will be in a position to supply a meaningful amount to a national demand. \n\nIn summary for Marijuana moons: Marijuana jumps again on news of senate vote for MORE act, could jump also if  Papa \"Don't touch me there\" Biden renews any marijuana commitments, MOONS when MORE passes senate, jumps on news of full legalization talks, and finally baby moons again for legalization and starts a nice slow climb into the industry it is expected to be. There's going to be a lot of scaling and growth for quite a while after legalization to meet supply. Companies with experience doing this already are going to be in a much better position than newer companies just frantically trying to meet demand. \n\nWhich companies?? For me I personally like Canopy and Cronos. Why? Because I'm betting on Corona (Canopy) to do well with a cannabis product in a party/bar scene and Marlboro (Cronos) to do well targeting daily users. Marijuana may have been legalized in multiple states, but there's still barely any places for consumers to enjoy THC in a social setting regardless of what state you're in. There's massive business to be made here, once it is an option. Alcohol wouldn't be where they are today without bars. Regardless, just pick one, do what you can and I think there will be a pretty green number there very soon. \ud83e\udd37 \n\nGood luck out there retards.", "id": "ku2fx9", "created_utc": 1610235924.0, "score": 122, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "That\u2019s a lot of words GE 1/29 11c", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Pot stocks go \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "If pot goes tits up it is TOP?
