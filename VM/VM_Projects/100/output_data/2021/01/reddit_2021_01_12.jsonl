They have a phenominal new CEO with some Lisa Su level turn around potential.  He is doing everything right.  Cutting garbage unprofitable brands, doing the hype videos and apple/tesla style car releases.  They're focused more on high quality, high margin hype cars than \"lets just produce a bunch of shit\". \n\n They're aiming for a GLOBAL profit margin of 8%.  Sure, they plan on taking a revenue hit, but so far the profits have been growing exponentially and the revenue hasn't been hit very hard.  \n\nRemember, Ford consistently hits 140-150 BILLION in revenue a year.  Currently, they have a 1-2% or abour 3-4 billion in profit a year.  Even if they take a massive hit in revenue, like 25 billion, thats still a minimum of 10 billion dollars profit, and thats only if they don't exceed that.  \n\nThey did something similar after the 2008 crash, and their stock price went 1.80$ a share to nearly 20$ a share.  Remember, just prior to this, they also took a hit from the dotcom bubble crash, when they hit 90$ a share.  As well, in the following 3 years of the 2008 crash, they paid off nearly 70 billion dollars in debt.  Going from 150 Billion, to nearly 80 billion in debt in a very short time. \n\nPersonally, I could easily see this stock hitting a minimum or 15$ by 2022 and 20-30$ by 2023. Getting some WSB momentum behind it could easily raise that number quite a bit.  If it picks up some steam, and their CEO keeps doing everything right, then we could easily see 20$ by 2022.  \n\nAlso, no its not a boomer stock anymore.  They got rid of the dividend for now, which means bigger profits and stock gains, they're producing tons of EV cars, apple style hype car releases, and Lisa Su level CEO comeback story.  \n\nEdit:  JPMorgan just gave it an 11$ PT \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  The analyst pump has begun.

I make ~2-300 a week selling calls.  If it's on a predictable downtrend then its closer to 4-600$ a week selling calls, or even 400-600 a day if its really dropping fast and hard.  I will eventually make 3-4k from the dividend a year.  I can also day trade using margin and scalping the stock.  Since the stock doesn't hardly move after-hours at all, but moves alot through the day and is very predictable,  I can easily scalp it for a couple times a day for free money.  \n\nToday, for example, the stock went up 5% but I made about 20% from these strategies and getting lucky somewhat. I sold calls near the top and scalped .20 cents or so on margin, and then usually when I scalp, any money I make I just sell back in shares.  Usually for every penny I scalp I can make 4-5 shares or so.  So the 20 cents scalp, I just sell 100 shares less or whatever, which in turn gives me the extra money as it goes up.  \n\nI usually still lose money as it goes down though, but I gain alot more shares", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Hi buddy.
