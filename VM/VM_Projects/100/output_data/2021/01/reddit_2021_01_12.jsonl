They have a phenominal new CEO with some Lisa Su level turn around potential.  He is doing everything right.  Cutting garbage unprofitable brands, doing the hype videos and apple/tesla style car releases.  They're focused more on high quality, high margin hype cars than \"lets just produce a bunch of shit\". \n\n They're aiming for a GLOBAL profit margin of 8%.  Sure, they plan on taking a revenue hit, but so far the profits have been growing exponentially and the revenue hasn't been hit very hard.  \n\nRemember, Ford consistently hits 140-150 BILLION in revenue a year.  Currently, they have a 1-2% or abour 3-4 billion in profit a year.  Even if they take a massive hit in revenue, like 25 billion, thats still a minimum of 10 billion dollars profit, and thats only if they don't exceed that.  \n\nThey did something similar after the 2008 crash, and their stock price went 1.80$ a share to nearly 20$ a share.  Remember, just prior to this, they also took a hit from the dotcom bubble crash, when they hit 90$ a share.  As well, in the following 3 years of the 2008 crash, they paid off nearly 70 billion dollars in debt.  Going from 150 Billion, to nearly 80 billion in debt in a very short time. \n\nPersonally, I could easily see this stock hitting a minimum or 15$ by 2022 and 20-30$ by 2023. Getting some WSB momentum behind it could easily raise that number quite a bit.  If it picks up some steam, and their CEO keeps doing everything right, then we could easily see 20$ by 2022.  \n\nAlso, no its not a boomer stock anymore.  They got rid of the dividend for now, which means bigger profits and stock gains, they're producing tons of EV cars, apple style hype car releases, and Lisa Su level CEO comeback story.  \n\nEdit:  JPMorgan just gave it an 11$ PT \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  The analyst pump has begun.

I make ~2-300 a week selling calls.  If it's on a predictable downtrend then its closer to 4-600$ a week selling calls, or even 400-600 a day if its really dropping fast and hard.  I will eventually make 3-4k from the dividend a year.  I can also day trade using margin and scalping the stock.  Since the stock doesn't hardly move after-hours at all, but moves alot through the day and is very predictable,  I can easily scalp it for a couple times a day for free money.  \n\nToday, for example, the stock went up 5% but I made about 20% from these strategies and getting lucky somewhat. I sold calls near the top and scalped .20 cents or so on margin, and then usually when I scalp, any money I make I just sell back in shares.  Usually for every penny I scalp I can make 4-5 shares or so.

There are almost no unused water resources in Austria, they were leading in hydroenergy before investors in the US knew what it is. What's your hope for this stock? They might expand in CEE with relatively small plants, but surely not in the USA, at least short- to mid-term.\n\nOn a more serious note, I believe that in short-term stocks from countries in which the government handled COVID-19 relatively well are quite good in the short term, since their home market is actually doing better than others right now so the stock growth is not that much disenfranchised from reality as it is the case with NASDAQ-100.\n\nMid-Term I believe tech and renewable energy stocks from the EU are a decent choice as they are undervalued compared to NASDAQ stocks (or let's be honest: just less overvalued). There are many innovative companies there who would have much higher growth rates if they would be NASDAQ-listed and/or residing in US. For example, Neste (Finland) and Verbio (DE) are researching innovative biofuels, have cooperations with multiple airlines and airports etc....they are much closer to disrupting transportation markets than eg Plug Power. But they are not on NASDAQ, their product doesn't sound as \"sexy\" as fuel cells, they are not a target of the Robin Hood Gang. Still crazy growth, but nothing compared to stocks like Plug Power who have much more to prove", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["de"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I normally refrain from giving advice on individual stocks but I personally think AMD is where it is at in tech.

Our terminals store and handle renewable fuels, petroleum products, chemicals, vegetable oils and **other products**. \n\nNow, almost everyone that knows Kinder Morgan knows them as one of the largest natural gas distributors/pipelines in the country.\n\n2019 rankings (as 2020) are not out yet:\n\n[https://www.aga.org/contentassets/d68b868b7cd94ed2889b704b441ab469/1002totvol.pdf](https://www.aga.org/contentassets/d68b868b7cd94ed2889b704b441ab469/1002totvol.pdf)\n\nIt is going to take a while for natural gas to get back to levels where it is profitable for drillers, but it is still being used and you need someone to distribute it.\n\n$That is where $KMI comes into play and they are expanding the distribution and pipelines:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005083/en/Kinder-Morgan-Announces-Commercial-In-Service-of-Permian-Highway-Pipeline](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005083/en/Kinder-Morgan-Announces-Commercial-In-Service-of-Permian-Highway-Pipeline)\n\nOk, so you understand that they are big and move a lot of natural gas.\n\nWhat they also do is handle logistics for other commodities and where we are concerned:\n\n**STEEL, SCRAP and COKING COAL.**\n\nTheir terminals handle **59 BILLION TONS** of dry bulk goods annually.\n\n$KMI's terminals are used to store and ship steel scrap, finished steel coils, slabs, coal etc.\n\nWhere this becomes juicy is China's entry into the US steel scrap market for the first time in many, many years.\n\n[https://agmetalminer.com/2020/12/23/chinese-steel-scrap-imports-could-be-market-mover-in-2021/](https://agmetalminer.com/2020/12/23/chinese-steel-scrap-imports-could-be-market-mover-in-2021/)\n\nDo you know who the largest exporter of scrap in the world is?\n\n**THE UNITED STATES.**\n\nThis was talked about today on $CMC's conference call -

{"title": "GameStop: Melvin Capital Put Positions", "selftext": "**TLDR: Melvin are fuk when their 51000 FD puts expire on Friday**\n\nIn November u/ronoron, wrote an excellent DD detailing Melvin Capital Put positions on GameStop which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3gn91/people_pumping_gme_melvin_capital_management/). He found that Melvin Capital held a short position of GameStop of 54,000 15 Put Contracts exp Jul 16 2021 equaling their disclosed short exposure of 5,400,000 shares on the [Q3 13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110000090571820001111/0000905718-20-001111-index.htm) form.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short Interest vs. Share Price](https://preview.redd.it/qpoz2i4agra61.jpg?width=3038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=544c69e831f419afc6cdf5f87853d57b2ac58225)\n\nSince that DD, GameStop has risen to a high of $23.35, Ryan Cohen increased his stake to 12.9% along with obtaining board seats for himself and Chewy CFO and COO. The Q4 13F form for Melvin Capital will be released on February 16 so their concise short exposure isn't public yet.\n\n[Melvin 13F Ending 9\\/30\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/di6hfhz0gra61.png?width=2576&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb9dd25d1f1a6c9b53fc2f5584fbbcb4ea7d9dc)\n\nThrough the OI on the options chain we can get a decent enough picture of the institutional short positions and which positions Melvin Capital and other Institutions are likely holding. As of EOD Jan 11, the open interest on Melvin Capitals Jul 15p is down 88% to 620. We will see in their new 13F if they fully closed their position however after some further investigation, I believe they rolled their position to Jan 15.\n\nOn the 15 Jan 21 chain, there is significant open interest for the 24 put. Currently 51025 contracts are open which is a similar quantity to Melvins July puts. Melvin Capital is the only institution with such a large put position publicly disclosed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw0u0igljta61.png?width=1947&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6aa82e353606c84433e230fcc51842de185e823\n\nSecondly, the lower strike puts (Under $10) have significant OI. There is a specific block of puts, strike 5-10, totaling 57155 in open interest. These strikes have disproportionate OI to comparable strikes and other expiration dates. To hedge their long put position of 15 Jan 24 puts, they would open up put debit spreads to cap their max loss and cheapen their positions.\n\nImportantly, their 24 Put FD's are decently fuk. Accounting for the average expected move, their position has an 81% chance of closing ITM. Overall those puts have been destroyed by GME's increase in value and theta decay depending on how long they have held these. If you remember Ryan Cohen just announced his board seat than Melvins position is looking seriously precarious. They cannot easily scape their position right now since they have gone all in on one strike which is significantly illiquid. Trying to sell would crater the bid/ask. They will most likely close out through a block trade with the MM that wrote the options. This way Melvin avoids the liquidity issue on the open market.\n\nAccounting for all of this, todays price action makes a good amount of sense. After the board announcement, the stock rose in PM over 21% briefly before getting crushed. Simultaneously, shares available to borrow on IBKR dried up from 45,000 to just 100 shares. Fidelity experienced similar action. As some commentators have mentioned, yes this is not a full picture of shares available to borrow and institutions have multiple avenues outside retail accessible desks to short. While not an exact view it is still a decent picture of short activity. If someone can see all the shares available through other desks, please comment.\n\nSomeone is going all in trying to keep the price down and it stands to reason it is Melvin, the only institution with FD puts and an underwater position. They have the capital to keep the price down for this week until their position expires and by no means face solvency issue.\n\nShort interest update will be updated tomorrow and I bet it is up bigly. All this selling pressure isn't coming from profit takers especially with such low borrowing availability.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tpuciifxlta61.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f0a371de79cffb21de32edce9d3249b87323a5\n\nThe most important factor here is delta hedging from whichever Market Makers wrote the puts for Melvin.  They are supposed to be delta neutral to avoid conflicts with customer interest. This means they will hedge their short options positions with Delta\\*Contracts number of shares. For the week ending 15 January, the total hedging is disproportionately short at -8124390 shares. Those are all shares MM as an aggregate sold to neutralize their positions. MM's can't sell 8 million shares so they buy further OTM put positions to help neutralize their greeks. Significant OI lower on the chain supports this. Their position of short shares and long puts will be unwound when their short 24 puts are closed out. The significant overall negative delta hedging will cause upward pressure end of week depending on how many shares were sold. In most weeks the overall hedging is fairly even or positive delta (thanks to WSB buying so many calls) but the market is very heavy in puts this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofix6wdl6y181.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=b57c6b018a1e140e6106d5a5f3be2a3e92df59d6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9m3dysl6y181.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=5081f892b41ba92f5fe6db9f65855d0ad0009f4b\n\nAll of this evidence points towards massive upside for next week. Melvins short selling pressure should be off and a significant degree of institutional buying should be expected as those positions are unwound. Melvin will presumably start unwinding any short stock positions after their puts are closed which will increase upward pressure.
