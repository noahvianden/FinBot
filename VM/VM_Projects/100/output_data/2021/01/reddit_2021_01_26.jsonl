We started a recession in 2020 and got out of it later in 2020.

Rarely, you get a double dip recession, but most of the time, early cycle is the furthest point from another recession. Usually you see a lot of rapid growth, then it moderates out, and eventually you see another recession, but the average timeframe for that is about 7-10 years and the rest of the time the market tends to go up. \n\nBy crash, do you mean correction? Because those happen all the time, even in the best of market conditions. Typically they're defined by a 10+ percent dip. \n\nTo your point though, no one that is a disciplined investor should give two fucks about a correction. At that point, you either stick to your plan or even buy more since stocks are now on sale. Corrections take weeks/months to recover from, not years. Even people close to retirement shouldn't get fazed by a correction. \n\nFollow the economic (business) cycle, listen to what the experts are saying about it, and don't let a short term dip in the market cause you long term problems by panicking and selling at the bottom.

Do you periodically sell and re-buy these stocks, to reap the rewards of the growth, or would you hold until they have reach their maximum potential?  I can see the forma a good strategy for a young fast growing stock, but for an established long term stock like Microsoft, their growth potential is on going and for the long-long term has undetermined growth potential.  What are your strategies in these cases?  \n\n\nB: I ask my first question, because if the 'BIG CRASH' happens, and you have long term growth with the latter strategy, with  I don't know say 15-20% in the green and you haven't sold. It could all disappear turn in to 15-20% in the red.

You may not ever be able to buy it at a cheaper price. It is certainly weird to speculate that the stock(that you believe in) will go down soon, and for that reason you are selling it.

Ofcourse when you invested all your money in it(this is money you don\u2019t need for day to day things ofcourse) it is hard to buy the dip. 2 options: one, just wait and let you wealth increase back up again, or two, have some backup money to use when you ever get in this kind of situation.\n\nYou got to believe in long term profit, or else it is all for nothing\n\nEdit: sell your investment when you are happy with the profit, no man ever got poor by selling at a profit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for the quick response.   \n\n\n I see what you are getting at.

{"title": "$BB long boi", "selftext": "\n\nPosition:194 shares at $19.28\n\n\nDisclaimer: I started trading this January and my views are purely informational and I do not condone anyone making financial/trading decisions based on this post. Don\u2019t be a retard and do your DD before you trade. This is a bullish take on BB and may have some holes in it.\n\n\n\nSo I have been watching BB for a while now and feel the company is undervalued. Forgive me as I have not made a DD post before, I failed English in high school, and I am typing this up on my phone.\n\n\nBB originally caught my attention because it struck me that it survived being primarily a phone company and shifted its business to its cyber security and other software. I Put it on my watch list to swing it a little bit and recently sold 140 shares at $11.\n\n\nSeeing the price go up and the volume I decided I would jump back in since the trend analysis looked pretty good. Bought in at 19.28 and it almost immediately crashed, I suspect likely due to the pullback the whole market had this morning with stimulus talks being delayed and people taking profits.\n\n\nCanada Halts trading today due to the volatility followed by BB making a statement in response basically saying idk why investors are buying up the stock we haven\u2019t made any announcements \nTrading resumes and the price rises back up beyond open in AH, closing at nearly 20 dollars.\n\nTHEN as you have already probably seen, BB announces partnership with Baidu - coincidence? Probably not, investors probably coaxed that information out of them and they likely didn\u2019t want to get caught in some insider trading schenangians. \n\nSpeculation for tomorrow: BB Will open strong and meet or exceed the 40% growth of today since it just got that huge news. Baidu is Chinese google, and they partnered with BB since they need a operating system platform to mass produce their maps software in autonomous/ev vehicles with their partner GAC. Now this is a lot of China talk but BB is headquartered in CANADA which is much friendlier in regards to trade than the U.S.\n\n\nA little bit of information about GAC, they are a Chinese automotive giant that has came to the United States National Automobile Dealers association expos begging for investors, however has not had much success since the last 4 years have not been good for U.S. and China Trade.\n\n\nThe LONG game: Once our new administration warms up to China after those in charge of trade take their cuts, (and they will because history repeats itself, but right now the bear case would be that Biden is not looking to change tariffs on China, playing tough until he gets some leverage is what I think is really going on) GAC will have lots of opportunity to start putting their vehicles on our roads. \nGAC is the highest rated car brand in China so it may have a chance in the United States if it plays its cards right, which means we could have Blackberry powered Autonomous EVs on our streets in the next 5 years. That in conjunction with Amazon partnership in their future autonomous ev ventures means this company is making a major comeback and is aligned with the right companies to potentially be a major player.\n\nThis company has a lot of value in our up and coming future of Electric and Autonomous vehicles.\n\nI am too new to this to speculate on where this stock should be valued at, but here are some resources where I got my information so you can decide for yourself:\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-stocks-idUSKBN29U28L\n\n\nhttps://www.autodeal.com.ph/articles/car-features/10-things-you-need-know-about-gac-motor\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/blackberry-expands-partnership-baidu-power-020000067.html\n\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-beijing-global-trade-22f525e41676d4e6abf96f3ca9255d15\n\n\nEdit: Obligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit2: Looks like I was a little overzealous for today\u2019s speculation  overlooking the fact that other people want this thing to tank back down to buy in with less risk, RBC downgraded their rating today and there have been millions of dollars worth of buy orders in the sub 18$ range.

Bought calls on everything tech, FB, AMD, SE, NVDA, PTON, FSLY, etc, etc. Started to find that \"money was so easy to make\" and even took out bank loans.\n\n**August 2020** \\- Indices rally all day everyday, stonks only go up, earnings always beat and stonks rally, made $175k in only 3/4 months.\n\n**September 2020** \\- Crashed hard for 3 days, and due to poor risk management with absolutely ZERO take profit / stop losses, watched ALL my tech calls bleed into oblivion. Profit got wiped out and I was literally back at breakeven. Wasted 4/5 months of my time, had no job, and was in debt. Went into semi-depression.\n\n**October 2020** \\- Figured I had to find get my money back, all I needed was just ONE good play to go all-in, and I would recover. Or at least that's what I told myself. Found this guy NoProblemChanging who seemed to be really accurate at predicting the markets - literally followed the advice of a stranger on WSB and went all in on puts due to his bearish views and certainty that the market was going to crash.\n\n**November 2020** \\- As we all know, everyone was expecting elections to be a shitshow but vaccine news rallied the markets with multiple gap ups and stuff. **By now I was already down $100k and was depressed. Imagine having made easy money ($175k in 4 months) in the greatest bull market of all time, only to lose it all in 3 days and even going negative, while seeing every stonk around me go up everyday while my puts bled all day. Not going to lie, at this moment I felt like $ROPEing although logically I know $100k is money that can still be earned back.**\n\nI was so desperate at this moment that I HAD to find something that I could ALL IN and GUARANTEED to make money. Then, I found $GME. I found u/DeepFuckingValue and that's when I climbed into the rabbit hole, knowing it was a fundamentally undervalued company. Bought around $15\\~.
