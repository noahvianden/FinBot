{"title": "Clover Health ($CLOV) will moon soon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "Alright listen up folks. I know this industry isn\u2019t sexy like EV or FinTech, but this space is important. Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to the fucking moon soon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\n$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath\u2019s SPAC). Chamath\u2019s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover\u2019s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he\u2019s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she\u2019s in it for the long haul. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 if there\u2019s one thing we know, it\u2019s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There\u2019s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable \u201csmart money\u201d includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don\u2019t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they\u2019ve invested in. Follow the smart money \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn\u2019t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they\u2019ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There\u2019s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They\u2019ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That\u2019s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that\u2019s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLet\u2019s talk a little more about what Clover does. They\u2019ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They\u2019re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that\u2019s not all they do. Here\u2019s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. \n\nFuture catalysts include:\n\n-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn\u2019t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) \n\n-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12. Check out the deep dive presentation. Tons of great growth states there. JP Morgan coverage/price target soon?\n\n-they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1/27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership. Could be great PR. \n\n-Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day. He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1/28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age \n\n-future PR from Chamath, Clover, major news outlets, and price targets. There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO. Once that picks up we are going to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n-technicals: there\u2019s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin. The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge. Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out, shorts will cover, basically making this a mini squeeze out. Chart looks ready. \n\n-float: a lot of the public float has been eaten up with the executives involved increasing their share. 67% is owned between $CLOV CEO Vivek and Chamath alone. According to Yahoo Finance data, there\u2019s only 11M float left of 145M shares outstanding. That\u2019s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there\u2019s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR. That\u2019s getting close to low float levels. Low float + short squeeze = \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nThis to me seems like a no brainer especially under this new administration.

They are a medical imaging company with a vision of \u201cpreventative healthcare through early detection\u201d. The OTM calls (I haven\u2019t verified them, but I\u2019ll take your word on that) is probably due to a \u201cSecond Opinion\u201d AI they demonstrated in a virtual radiology conference on Jan 6th, 2021. (I couldn\u2019t find a link to the actual demo, but the other company demos are [here.](https://www.nanox.vision)) \n\nThey have some interesting tech. Their electron source is not filament-based (normal ones use a heavy metal filament, such as tantalum, and run a current through it like a lightbulb, then they slam those electrons into an x-ray emitting material using magnets. Filaments like those generate a lot of free electrons randomly, so the x-rays generated can\u2019t easily be controlled. Control\u2248resolution.) They claim the nanotechnology electron source is digital, allowing them more control over the electrons generated. In the demo, they used less power to generate the image, so that might be true.\n\nTheir 3-D imaging device looks cool. High res images they can shuffle through layers to see different things. In that demo, they said they don\u2019t have approval for the 3-D imaging device they created, but from what I understand device approval is easier to get when there are similar devices, so that may not be a huge obstacle. (Tons of imaging devices out there.)\n\nI\u2019m guessing there will be a short bull run as news of it picks up and gets translated into mainstream media. However, since they are in the medical research field and haven\u2019t/won\u2019t post a profit for some time, don\u2019t expect it to go to the moon in the short term. Good long term bet tho.\n\nI\u2019m not an expert, this is not advice, I\u2019m just an internet autist with a physics degree I don\u2019t use. Please don\u2019t sue me for my Wendy\u2019s paycheck if you lose all your tendies, I don\u2019t have enough to share.

SRPT is a big player in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases. [**SRPT is 1.36% of Aunt Cathie's ARKG**](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_GENOMIC_REVOLUTION_MULTISECTOR_ETF_ARKG_HOLDINGS.pdf) **ETF (ranked #30 in the ETF at the time of this writing)** most of which she added recently.\n\nIn the past couple of years, they've been working on cures for **Duchenne muscular dystrophy**, which is a genetic disease that weakens a kid's muscles (usually ends up with them not being able to walk) and occurs in 1/3500 kids.\n\nEarlier in January, they released the primary results of the trial for one of the treatments (SRP-9001) and it was not very promising. As a result, the stock price dropped by about 60%.\n\nThe CEO [claimed](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/07/2155237/0/en/Sarepta-Therapeutics-Announces-Top-line-Results-for-Part-1-of-Study-102-Evaluating-SRP-9001-its-Investigational-Gene-Therapy-for-the-Treatment-of-Duchenne-Muscular-Dystrophy.html) (which I can't verify) that the lukewarm results of the trial were mainly caused by an unfortunate and unlikely event. In every trial, you have volunteers. Some of those volunteers are in better condition (the disease hasn't progressed much yet) and some in worse condition. A computer program randomly assigned each volunteer to be in the treatment group (receive the actual drug) or in the control group (receiver placebo, i.e. sugar pill). None of the volunteers and the people administering the drugs know if a person is in which group. Also once done, it's not possible to re-hash the assignment. Anyway, according to the CEO, with bad luck, most of the people who were initially in worse condition get assigned to the treatment group and the healthier ones to the control group. This skews the results toward showing the treatment is ineffective.\n\nIn the secondary trial (ongoing now) those kids who were previously in the placebo group are getting the actual treatment. So the results may be promising this time. But it will take time for the results to come out.\n\n[SRPT Chart](https://preview.redd.it/fhuo37gn64d61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=af2ed01539f704aaa3555e8b9d425ce22264a841)\n\nSRPT has also developed another treatment for Duchenne called Casimerson that has been awarded a priority review by the FDA on 2/25/2021. If approved, this can gap up to where it used to be before the drop. The price may also move up monotonously until then in anticipation of approval.\n\nFrom [biopharmcatalyst.com](https://biopharmcatalyst.com):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1x17uqw374d61.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=974f7c2deb936add6033f6ee46251c3c4a6900f4\n\nPharma stocks are tricky. A single trial can send them to the moon or the earth's core. Gap-ups are also unexpected. Sometimes they happen quickly, sometimes they take months if not years to return to where they used to be. If history is any indication, SRPT usually recovers within 3 months of a downfall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/293ks15u64d61.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=7779ce17d73db99c0fcad7249b0f7767e6afc264\n\nThat's it!\n\nPosition again: SRPT 100C 3/19/2021", "id": "l3g3l5", "created_utc": 1611421980.0, "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "I'm already in on SRPT.

Coty owns several cosmetics brands and makes the fragrances for several other brands (Marc Jacobs, Lacoste, Chloe).\n\nSpeaking strictly about the cosmetics brands that they own: Over the last year or so, KKW has been seriously losing hype. Girls love watching beauty youtubers for makeup reviews and tutorials. I haven\u2019t really seen beauty youtubers talk about KKW in a while (nor Kylie)\n\nLooking at all the makeup brands under Coty, a majority of them are drugstore brands. Shit that you won\u2019t find in Sephora (one of the largest cosmetics retailers, and possibly the most popular\u2014your wife has probably dragged her boyfriend into a Sephora a few times before). Why is this important? Because bitches love Sephora (I\u2019m one of them). The only brands under Coty that are sold at Sephora are GHD and Philosophy\u2014two brands that aren\u2019t even that popular, compared to their competitors.\n\nTL;DR $BB to the moon \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "Did you follow what revlon did? I started tracking it back in November when that bitch was down around the $4 price point. I poked around and saw that they were bleeding money and didn't own a single brand I would put on my face. So I said \"No thank you\" and moved on. I was wrong. They still don't own a single brand I would put on my face BUT I wish they had been in my portfolio since they peaked at $15.\n\nI think Coty will do something similar. They still haven't made it back to their pre covid stock price. Which was lower than revlon's. However they own better brands. For example they own both OPI and Sally Hansen. I bet you have at least one bottle by them in your bathroom. I know I do.\n\nBitches love Sephora, that's true. But outside of GME holders? Bitches in this country is broke. I think drug store brands will do just fine in this economy. I've been to the nail salon once since covid started. It was a miserable and depressing experience. I'm buying more nail polish than I have since high school since even around the house I don't want to look at naked toes.\n\nThis stock gambling potential.
