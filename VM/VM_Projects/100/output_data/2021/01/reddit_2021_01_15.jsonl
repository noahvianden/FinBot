{"title": "Bet on the recovery of the travel industry with this 1 yr option play", "selftext": "The history of financial markets tells us that these good times won\u2019t last forever. Eventually, a significant correction will come along to rain on the parade.\n\nThat said, I believe select sectors of the market \u2013 like 5G stocks and battery metals plays \u2013 will continue to zigzag higher amid the volatility.\n\nGiven the robust travel recovery I\u2019m anticipating later this year, I\u2019m recommending a great company in the sector:\n\n**Sabre Corp. (SABR)**, a technology leader in the travel industry, is one of the travel industry\u2019s \u201cBig 3\u201d global distributions systems (GDS).\n\n**Amadeus\u00a0IT Group SA (AMADY)** and the privately held Travelport are the other two. Together, these three companies make up 97% of all travel bookings worldwide.\n\nSpain-based Amadeus is the largest of the three. It processes about 40% of travel bookings worldwide. Texas-based Sabre is No. 2, with a 35% market share. Travelport is No.3, with a 22% market share.\n\n**More than 400 airlines and 1 million hotels use the Sabre system to process travel bookings.** Every major travel website also uses Sabre. The company\u2019s client list is a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of the travel industry:\n\n* **Booking\u00a0Holdings Inc. (BKNG):** Kayak, Agoda, Priceline, CheapFlights, Momondo, OpenTable, RentalCars\n* **Expedia\u00a0Group Inc. (EXPE):** Orbitz, Travelocity, [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/), [TripAdvisor.com](http://tripadvisor.com/), [SeatGuru.com](http://seatguru.com/), [Cheaptickets.com](http://cheaptickets.com/)\n* **Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)**\n* **Hilton Worldwide\u00a0Holdings Inc. (HLT)**\n* **Marriot\u00a0International (MAR)**\n* **Hyatt Hotels\u00a0Corp. (H)**\n\nIn all, Sabre\u2019s system processes 2.5 million bookings every minute.\n\nSabre generates its revenues from the volume of transactions it processes, not the dollar value of those transactions. So when travel activity increases, Sabre\u2019s revenues also increase. The connection between the two is very close and predictable.\n\nTherefore, when the COVID pandemic torpedoed travel activity, Sabre\u2019s revenues tumbled. The company\u2019s second-quarter revenues collapsed more than 90% year-over-year.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sabre\u2019s share price also collapsed.\n\nBut that vicious cycle is becoming a virtuous cycle of rising travel activity\u2026 and rising Sabre revenues. From the second quarter to the third quarter, revenues more than tripled.\n\nAnd this favorable trend is certain to continue strengthening in 2021.\n\nThere\u2019s no mystery here. As the pandemic recedes, travel activity will increase\u2026 and Sabre\u2019s revenues will climb. The share price should follow.\n\nOnce travel activity recovers to pre-COVID levels, Sabre\u2019s share price could easily double from current levels.\n\nBut the company has not been simply sitting on its hands during the last 10 months, waiting for the inevitable recovery. Instead, it has taken decisive steps to fortify its competitive moat.\n\nSpecifically, it has collaborated with Google to migrate its IT infrastructure to Google Cloud. Sabre followed up that initiative by partnering with Google last fall to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technology platform that is an industry-first.\n\nAs Sabre explains:\n\n>*The technology, known as Sabre Travel AI, is infused with Google\u2019s state-of-the-art AI technology and advanced machine-learning capabilities that will help its travel-industry customers to deliver highly relevant and personalized content more quickly.*\n\nSundar Narasimhan, president of Sabre Labs, further explains:\n\n>*Sabre Travel AI is a game-changer. We are proud to be working with Google to build technologies that will seek to re-define the way travel companies do business, and turn the insights derived from analyses into repeatable, scalable operations\u2026With the creation of Sabre Travel AI, we are rebuilding our platform on cloud-native, data-driven technology that can be integrated into the existing and future products that Sabre offers. We are combining Google Cloud\u2019s infrastructure, AI and machine-learning capabilities with Sabre\u2019s deep travel domain knowledge to create, not next, but third-generation solutions that we believe are smarter, faster and more cost-effective \u2013 a first-of-its-kind in travel.*\n\nThe company expects to integrate Sabre Travel AI into certain products in its existing portfolio and begin rolling them out into the market over the next few months.\n\nFrom an earnings perspective, the Wall Street community expects Sabre to generate about $300 million in gross earnings (EBITDA) next year, and then ramp up to more than $600 million in 2022.\n\nIf the company hits those targets, the stock would be trading for 12 times 2021 EBITDA and six times 2022 EBITDA.\n\nBut I expect earnings to ramp up more quickly than that. I also expect the company\u2019s technology and AI investments to amplify the company\u2019s recovery and growth trajectory over the next couple of years.\n\n$1 billion of EBITDA by 2023 is feasible.\n\nOne word of caution: The company\u2019s balance sheet isn\u2019t bulletproof. It has \u201cB-rated\u201d credit, which puts Sabre deep into junk territory.\n\nThat said, only $500 million of the company\u2019s $5.6 billion in debt outstanding comes due over the next two years. Offsetting that near-term obligation, Sabre is sitting on more than $1.5 billion in cash.\n\nIn other words, it possesses ample liquidity to ride out the rest of the COVID storm\u2026 unless the storm rages anew and lasts well into 2022.\n\n**Bottom line:** I consider Sabre to be an excellent speculation on recovering travel. To make this play, I\u2019m recommending a one-year call option on the stock.\n\n**tl;dr:** **Sabre Corp. (SABR)**, is a tech leader in the travel industry. **More than 400 airlines and 1 million hotels use the Sabre system to process travel bookings.** Sabre generates its revenues from the volume of transactions it processes, not the dollar value of those transactions. So when travel activity increases, Sabre\u2019s revenues also increase and the share price should follow. It is also using AI to become more efficient and thus more profitable.\n\n*Buy the* ***Sabre Corp. (SABR) January 2022 $12 call options*** *for $3.60 or less. The current offer price is $3.30.*\n\nI am not a financial advisor.

The brand name is worth more than that and BB is a significant player in the IoT, Cybersecurity and EV industries.
