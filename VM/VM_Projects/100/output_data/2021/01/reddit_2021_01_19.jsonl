{"title": "\ud83d\ude80$PLTR Premarket DD", "selftext": "Alright, as promised in some comments last night I\u2019ll give you retards some buy sentiment for Palantir.\n\nWHO AM I AND WHY GIVE A FUCK\n\nI am a big tendie eating retard that works military intelligence for the Marine Corps, I worked Palantir before they stopped funding. (Don\u2019t let that scare you). I bought in day one around lunch, if you wanna see DM me and I\u2019ll provide receipts. Additionally I\u2019m now 135 shares in and opened 5 call contracts.\n\nMilitary use of the program is simply not  \u201cspying on you\u201d bullshit they\u2019d have you eat up on the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b articles that cause our tendie machine to slow down. In fact military intelligence is legally prevented from conducting intelligence on US Persons. I can\u2019t speak for other actors in the Intel community but it\u2019s expressly forbidden on my end. Palantir doesn\u2019t enable us to spy on you, but it allows for us to compile data and speed high level decision making up at a rate that was simply beyond expectations previous to utilizing it. What does that mean? Well for one, if you provide military organizations with success in \u2018killing bad dudes\u2019 then they\u2019ll always have you in their pocket. I say if your taxpayer dollars are funding a program, you might as well double down and buy what you\u2019re already paying for. I wouldn\u2019t bet against a country that nuked another...twice. We can talk about Japan more later tho.\n\nCommercial use? The fucking cuck circus over at shitron fails to see that they\u2019re reliably and consistently expanding business. France, South America, Africa, JAPAN \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 (should\u2019ve put Japan first but stuck with caps to provide a bit less of a smooth read for you autistic cunts.) I\u2019ll elaborate that. Japan has been historically tough for US companies to break through to, but Sompo and its associates are big Palantir and we shouldn\u2019t be taking that lightly. The uses for Palantir are unlimited and can greatly improve over time, with new products ie. Palantir Apollo. The market for data collected or data synthesis isn\u2019t ripe with competitive companies like the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs would have you believe. Sure snowflake and other peers have similar mission but none have the same reach and same customer specific outreach and development cycle. I can\u2019t express enough how much of a buy this is.\n\nPalantir as a company. This is huge because it speaks volumes about where they could go. Palantir was operating shy of 20 yrs before their listing, and they\u2019ve been increasing the amount of \u2018news\u2019 on their site loading up on contracts all over the globe. Sure their operating losses are scary at first sight but they\u2019re dumping heavily into R&D, building new SaaS as mentioned before and expanding heavily into the commercial market. Karp is the new Jobs, or even the next Alphabet CEO. Palantir is headed to household notoriety. Expect it, sooner than you can imagine it\u2019ll be everywhere, even Queen Cathie bought in. \n\nTL;DR \nI wear camo and hate life...but Cathie, Japan, and Biden are fucking fueling our little rocket, next stop, fucking Jupiter \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n\nPS: Thank you window lickers for my first Reddit gold, truly humbled by your response.", "id": "l0k8aw", "created_utc": 1611064400.0, "score": 224, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Hello fellow crayon eater, you lost me at intelligence and marine corps.

Looking at the cyber security industry, BB outperforms on a number of metrics.  Price to sales is 5.85 vs 11.31 industry.  As well price to book is 3.11 vs industry 11.44, this indicates relative to its industry BB is highly undervalued(Value investors look for P/B ~(0-3), so BB just about fits in there). They also operate on gross margins 3.3% higher than industry.  All this to say, BB is going to reach a more accurate share price, it\u2019s just a matter of time\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n-outperforms market in cyber security, 10% more growth on the year than the industry average and it still has undervalued metrics, this is only the beginning\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nAWS Partnership\n\n-Partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand QNX systems that are already trusted and viable.  New system will be backed by Amazon and allow new capabilities for car manufacturers to interpret sensor data and improve driving experience for their cars.  Possible features included but not limited to predictive maintenance, tracking driving habits and even book spots for EV charging along your route.  Once integrated with Amazon\u2019s IoT and machine learning services, IVY will be ready and is expected in 2023.\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n-Amazon is helping to market IVY so it will be extremely competitive from an industry leading cloud computing company and also backed by the goat of cyber security (BB), their birth child IVY will secure Tendies for all WSB retards\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n-John Chen\ud83d\udc51\n\nSaved BB in 2013 from sinking to nothing with Apple as competition, pioneered them back to the front(soon)of another field and is still CEO.

As well they settled with FB for an unknown amount, this also is a double edged sword, no more uncertainty(or fees) due to lawsuit and they will have a sizable settlement (hopefully to spend on R &amp;amp; D) for IVY\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nReasons (not)to Buy:\n\nEarnings Down/\nAnalysis, QNX loses a significant portion of revenue, given auto industry was significantly impacted, so was licensing sales of QNX, Chen says sales will return to previous when auto sales correct.\n\nIf IVY cannot increase profit margins or expand user base it will be an R and D cost alone...
