{"title": "\ud83d\ude80$PLTR Premarket DD", "selftext": "Alright, as promised in some comments last night I\u2019ll give you retards some buy sentiment for Palantir.\n\nWHO AM I AND WHY GIVE A FUCK\n\nI am a big tendie eating retard that works military intelligence for the Marine Corps, I worked Palantir before they stopped funding. (Don\u2019t let that scare you). I bought in day one around lunch, if you wanna see DM me and I\u2019ll provide receipts. Additionally I\u2019m now 135 shares in and opened 5 call contracts.\n\nMilitary use of the program is simply not  \u201cspying on you\u201d bullshit they\u2019d have you eat up on the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b articles that cause our tendie machine to slow down. In fact military intelligence is legally prevented from conducting intelligence on US Persons. I can\u2019t speak for other actors in the Intel community but it\u2019s expressly forbidden on my end. Palantir doesn\u2019t enable us to spy on you, but it allows for us to compile data and speed high level decision making up at a rate that was simply beyond expectations previous to utilizing it. What does that mean? Well for one, if you provide military organizations with success in \u2018killing bad dudes\u2019 then they\u2019ll always have you in their pocket. I say if your taxpayer dollars are funding a program, you might as well double down and buy what you\u2019re already paying for. I wouldn\u2019t bet against a country that nuked another...twice. We can talk about Japan more later tho.\n\nCommercial use? The fucking cuck circus over at shitron fails to see that they\u2019re reliably and consistently expanding business. France, South America, Africa, JAPAN \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 (should\u2019ve put Japan first but stuck with caps to provide a bit less of a smooth read for you autistic cunts.) I\u2019ll elaborate that. Japan has been historically tough for US companies to break through to, but Sompo and its associates are big Palantir and we shouldn\u2019t be taking that lightly. The uses for Palantir are unlimited and can greatly improve over time, with new products ie. Palantir Apollo. The market for data collected or data synthesis isn\u2019t ripe with competitive companies like the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bs would have you believe. Sure snowflake and other peers have similar mission but none have the same reach and same customer specific outreach and development cycle. I can\u2019t express enough how much of a buy this is.\n\nPalantir as a company. This is huge because it speaks volumes about where they could go. Palantir was operating shy of 20 yrs before their listing, and they\u2019ve been increasing the amount of \u2018news\u2019 on their site loading up on contracts all over the globe. Sure their operating losses are scary at first sight but they\u2019re dumping heavily into R&D, building new SaaS as mentioned before and expanding heavily into the commercial market. Karp is the new Jobs, or even the next Alphabet CEO. Palantir is headed to household notoriety. Expect it, sooner than you can imagine it\u2019ll be everywhere, even Queen Cathie bought in. \n\nTL;DR \nI wear camo and hate life...but Cathie, Japan, and Biden are fucking fueling our little rocket, next stop, fucking Jupiter \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\n\nPS: Thank you window lickers for my first Reddit gold, truly humbled by your response.", "id": "l0k8aw", "created_utc": 1611064400.0, "score": 224, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Hello fellow crayon eater, you lost me at intelligence and marine corps.

Looking at the cyber security industry, BB outperforms on a number of metrics.  Price to sales is 5.85 vs 11.31 industry.  As well price to book is 3.11 vs industry 11.44, this indicates relative to its industry BB is highly undervalued(Value investors look for P/B ~(0-3), so BB just about fits in there). They also operate on gross margins 3.3% higher than industry.  All this to say, BB is going to reach a more accurate share price, it\u2019s just a matter of time\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n-outperforms market in cyber security, 10% more growth on the year than the industry average and it still has undervalued metrics, this is only the beginning\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nAWS Partnership\n\n-Partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand QNX systems that are already trusted and viable.  New system will be backed by Amazon and allow new capabilities for car manufacturers to interpret sensor data and improve driving experience for their cars.  Possible features included but not limited to predictive maintenance, tracking driving habits and even book spots for EV charging along your route.

As well they settled with FB for an unknown amount, this also is a double edged sword, no more uncertainty(or fees) due to lawsuit and they will have a sizable settlement (hopefully to spend on R &amp;amp; D) for IVY\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nReasons (not)to Buy:\n\nEarnings Down/\nAnalysis, QNX loses a significant portion of revenue, given auto industry was significantly impacted, so was licensing sales of QNX, Chen says sales will return to previous when auto sales correct.\n\nIf IVY cannot increase profit margins or expand user base it will be an R and D cost alone...

{"title": "GME - EndGame Part 2: Cohen, Market Cap, Potential Investors", "selftext": "Hello again folks. This is an extension of my [DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) in which I shared some research on short positions, GME\u2019s debt, and some speculation on institutional investing. Since that post, GME is up 75% and there\u2019s been lots of good [bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyuu13/gme_margin_changes_and_their_implications/) / [bearish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) DD on the short term.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019m going to cover 3 topics, focusing on the mid-to-long term prospects for GME: 1) Cohen, 2) GME\u2019s market cap potential, and 3) potential investors that could continue to pile in.\n\n**TL:DR;** You need to think about GME differently. Not as a trader. Not as an investor. You need to think like a venture capitalist. This is an **unprecedented** opportunity, and the first time I\u2019ve gone all-in - *I\u2019m more bullish now than when the stock was trading sub $15.* If you\u2019re in GME you need to get in ***with conviction*** otherwise you\u2019re going to lose by selling when it drops.\n\n# Quick aside - my history and positions:\n\nI\u2019ve been a passive investor for many years. This is literally the first time I\u2019ve taken an interest in becoming an active investor. I opened an RH account in August to start speculating on GME. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/isn2g0/cheap_gme_calls_for_a_potential_lottery_win/) called out some cheap lottery plays that took my speculating account from $5K - $20K in 3 weeks. I\u2019ve since posted a few times on GME, [even trying to tell you to buy the post-earnings dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9c95d/gme_earnings_thread/gf4g5vn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and added more to my active trading accounts. I\u2019ve taken $10K -> $130K on RH and $230K -> $480K in IBKR since slowly adding to GME since September.\n\n**UPDATE**: I have deleted my positions in this post - will explain why in my next post. I'm still holding. \n\nAll that being said, thus far I\u2019ve been thinking about GME as a *trade* \\- trying to get in at the lowest cost I could for the maximum upside on a near-term exit, but **I\u2019ve switched completely** into thinking of GME is a **ridiculously asymmetric investment** with massive potential in the next 2-3 year timeframe - even at $35. Even at $45, $50, $60. That\u2019s why I added roughly 2500 shares on Friday at around $36 despite adding very cautiously when GME was below $20. I\u2019m also completely all-in on RH with options (mostly deep ITM, a few fds) - $0 buying power left.\n\nGrab a drink, sit down. Let me tell you why I\u2019ve gotten more aggressive, and probably why you shouldn\u2019t worry about what price you pay right now, as long as you\u2019re willing to **believe and hold.**\n\n# About Cohen (and friends)\n\nFrom the [recent 8K about the board changes](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) (which you should **definitely read** if you\u2019re putting serious money in):\n\n*As part of the Agreement, RC Ventures has agreed to* ***customary standstill provisions***\\*, which provide that from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date that is 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company\u2019s\\* ***2022*** *annual meeting of stockholders and (b) the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (such period, the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), RC Ventures will* ***not, among other things: (i) acquire beneficial ownership in, or aggregate economic exposure to, directly or indirectly, more than 19.9%*** *of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock; (ii) make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company; (iii) make any offer or proposal with respect to any extraordinary transactions; or (iv) seek, alone or in concert with others, the appointment, election or removal of any directors in opposition to any recommendation of the Board, in each case as further described in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Company has permitted RC Ventures to acquire, whether in a single transaction or multiple transactions from time to time, additional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to the extent such acquisitions would result in RC Ventures having beneficial ownership of less than 20.0% of the outstanding shares, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), and RC Ventures has agreed that upon acquiring beneficial ownership 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL would apply to a potential business combination with RC Ventures as an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).*\n\nThis is critical: **This agreement was the result of a negotiation** between Cohen and the existing board.\n\n1. After his [activist letter calling out the board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) and then [13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm) buy after the earnings dip rocketed the stock up from 12 -> 20, it was clear to everyone that RC was the reason GME\u2019s stock was heading up. The GME board was afraid of a hostile takeover / losing their jobs. This agreement allowed Cohen and 2 others on the board as long as he didn\u2019t attempt a hostile takeover.\n2. Cohen wants it all. In the activist letter, he publicly said \u201cno\u201d to just one board seat. He then publicly bought more as soon as Sherman threatened a shelf offering to dilute him below 10%.\n\nIn addition to getting added to the board, Cohen brought along [2 execs who built Chewy with him](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html):\n\n* Alan Attal - the previous **COO and CMO of Chewy** (2011 - 2018)\n* Jim Grube - the previous **CFO of Chewy** (2015 - 2018)\n\nHe\u2019s not fucking around folks. He wants to build another Chewy, and he\u2019s bringing the people who helped him do it the first time to do it again.\n\nAs a result of the agreement, he\u2019s limited to buying up to 20% of shares until 2022. **Why not 13%? Simple - Cohen wants the option to buy more.** He\u2019s not happy with a single board seat; he\u2019s not going to settle for simply getting added to the board; and **he\u2019s not going to settle for 13% ownership.**\n\nAlso, remember that **Alan and Jim have \ud83d\udcb2 to buy in** as well. I haven't seen their holdings yet. Their time is worth more than their money and they've already decided to put their time in.\n\n## Cohen is not an exec - he\u2019s a founder with an all-in mentality\n\nGo read this [bloomberg Cohen interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo) to understand his mindset.\n\n1. Cohen himself is an all-in person. Key quote:\n   1. *\u201cWhen I find things I have a lot of* ***conviction*** *in, I go* ***all-in***\\*.\u201d\\*\n   2. Cohen is a founder that has gone through the successful creation of a startup. **When you are startup founder, most of your NW is tied to equity in your company.** You are trained to have skin in the game. You\u2019re not allowed to think you have a safety net. You give up years of your life and bet everything because you have to believe in what you\u2019re doing. **Founders typically have 30-50% ownership of their company.**\n   3. *\u201cCohen uses the word \u201cconviction\u201d a lot. He says it\u2019s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. \u201cHe taught me how to block the noise from the masses,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cTo have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.\u201d*\n2. He only sold Chewy rather taking it to IPO because of his Dad\u2019s health. He cut his entrepreneurial career short and he\u2019s itching to get back in.\n3. Cohen sold Chewy for $3.35B, with estimates stating he personally walked away with about $600M after taxes.\n4. Cohen has a lot of capital to buy more. After selling Chewy, he went all-in on Apple & WFC, which as of June was **up 40%**.\n   1. *\u201c Cohen says his portfolio, when including dividends and a few other stock holdings, has returned more than 40% over the past 3 years, beating the market.\u201d*\n   2. Aapl **was his largest holding, and** **is up another 50% since June 5** when the Bloomberg article was published.\n   3. Cohen lives in FL - with no income or capital gains for individuals, unlike other founders who live in CA which taxes all cap gains as ordinary income.\n   4. I\u2019m going to estimate *his net worth (minus his GME holdings) is around $800M-$1B.*\n5. Cohen\u2019s 9,001,000 (it\u2019s over 9000! \ud83d\udc32\ud83c\udfd0) shares have thus far been purchased at something like an average of $12/share, for a total investment of around $110M.\n\nSo Cohen has put in $110M out of his $1B into GME. **Does that sound like he\u2019s all-in?** Absolutely fucking not. Cohen\u2019s **going to buy up to the max he can this year** (20%), likely by selling some other holdings prior to [cap gains tax law changes](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/guide-potential-tax-law-changes-under-biden). He can **add more next year** after the standstill period is done.\n\n## What will lead to Cohen\u2019s next purchase of GME\n\nThus far, every RC purchase has been *about sending a message*.\n\n1. Prior to Q3 earnings, his purchases were signaling an intent to the board that he was serious about wanting to get involved. He also rubbed it in their faces that the stock price was largely appreciating because of him. From the [activist letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf):\n   1. \u201cWe recognize that the Board may feel it is insulated from stockholder scrutiny after adding new directors this past spring and seeing a recent stock price uptick **(which only came on the heels of RC Ventures filing its 13D)\u201d**  (what a *fucking burn*).\n2. If there was any doubt about RC\u2019s impact on the stock price, it was put to rest after Q3\u2019s earnings, where the current leadership\u2019s hubris and threat of diluting RC led to a drop of almost 30%. RC then bought the dip, shoved it in their faces, and the market GME again rocketing GME to 20 in a massive post-earnings recovery. Message sent again - \u201cThe market wants me. Let me the fuck in.\u201d\n3. Now that Cohen and the Chewy folks are on the board, he\u2019s going to angle for CEO. He\u2019s not looking to **advise** GME. He wants to go all-in, to run GME. *He\u2019s holding the optionality of buying more based on the success of his attempt to take over GME through non-hostile means.*\n\n**If you see Cohen buy more GME, he\u2019s sending another message.** This time it\u2019s because it\u2019s clear to him he\u2019s going to be CEO and wants to max his skin in the game. **If you see Cohen buy, it\u2019s \u201cCEO talks going well\u201d - you fucking buy.**\n\n# GME\u2019s market cap potential\n\n1. Cohen sees a [$200BN+ total addressable market cap for gaming by 2023](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf). For contrast, Chewy was playing in the pet food/supplies market, which has a total addressable market (TAM) of [under $50BN annually](https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp). **GME\u2019s potential is at base 4x that of Chewy.** This **does not even account for the pc gaming hardware market**, which is another $[35BN](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269244/graphics-hardware-market-value-in-the-gaming-segment-since-2009/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,by%20the%20end%20of%202020.)\\+.\n2. Chewy\u2019s market cap is [$44BN](https://www.google.com/search?q=chewy+market+cap&oq=chewy+market+cap&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30l3.6432j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) on [$6BN](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/3Q-2020-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf) of annual revenue.\n3. Chewy\u2019s Q3 quarterly income was up 45% YoY. While GME\u2019s quarterly income was down YoY, [its e-commerce revenue was **up 257%** trouncing Chewy\u2019s growth rate](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth).\n4. GME\u2019s Q4 early sales preview reported [**300% E-commerce growth and annual run-rate of $5BN**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)\n\nIn other words, *even if you give GME\u2019s physical locations no value*, GME\u2019s ecommerce business is **growing 5x faster than Chewy** and already has 75% of online revenue.\n\n**Summary:** Chewy is priced > 7X times its annual **total revenue**. GME is priced at .45 **its annual ecommerce revenue,** despite GME having **5-6 greater TAM** and growing its ecommerce business **5X as fast Chewy.**\n\nWhat. The. Fuck.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a stock more mispriced.\n\nPeople talking about $100 price targets are suffering from a *fucking lack of imagination.*\n\nEven if you *completely* discount\n\n1. GME\u2019s physical business\n2. its rev sharing partnership with MSFT\n3. its 5x faster growth and 5x TAM\n\nand give GME the same P/S multiple that Chewy has on its ecommerce business, **that puts GME currently at a fair market cap above $35BN.** That means GME should be **at least $500/share.**\n\nIn pictures:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparing Ecommerce Revenue vs Market cap on Chewy vs GME today](https://preview.redd.it/ig5kkkan38c61.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a955c07ef3502d4644fc0b35949c9d0726c4af)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Showing what the fair market value Market Cap of GME would be with Chewy's P\\/S](https://preview.redd.it/qtac0v6r38c61.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=54331bbdf749bdea5818092970edf17094d6e752)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fair Market Value \\(using comps\\) of GME is at least $500\\/share.](https://preview.redd.it/gimdi0au38c61.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b7a548c7125ccb14d3e93c78f8c24f5123e2ed)\n\n**$35/share is a fucking steal.** Who cares about the short-term dips as shorts try to weasel themselves out of their positions. The market will eventually wake up to this sleeping beast. In a year you\u2019re not going to care if you got in at 4, 12, 20, 35, or 50. You\u2019re going to only care if you\u2019re in or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Potential Investors\n\nAn asset is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, right? So are the potential buyers of this growing company?\n\nHere\u2019s a list in decreasing order of likelihood.\n\n1. **Elon** (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar? ***Elon\u2019s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** Elon could **buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours**. One call from fellow entrepreneur and [aspiring twitter-meme-god](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) would absolutely wreck the game.\n   1. **If you are short gamestop**, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. \"Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it.\" \ud83d\ude80\n2. **Buffett** (More likely, still improbable). I\u2019m actually amazed that while Buffett & co were lamenting that there are no interesting stocks to invest in and moving to cash, that they absolutely missed the boat on GME while it was at its lows. It\u2019s a complete value play right up his alley (in a business he can understand). My only hypothesis here is that the market cap is too small and he could not make a meaningful investment. Once GME grows to a more respectable market cap ($10b+) I can see Buffett stepping in and making an investment.\n3. **Cohen\u2019s connections. (Highly likely if Cohen is CEO).** This is the big one. And I mean absolutely nail in the coffin re-pricing of GME for the foreseeable future. [Go read this Harvard Business Review piece](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale) on Cohen specifically on how Cohen puts importance on raising money and the people that backed him.\n   1. Look, I\u2019ve started a startup before in the valley (unsuccessfully unfortunately). However, you don\u2019t start a company without making a shit-ton of venture capitalist & angel investor connections. Cohen has stated that when pitching Chewy he was rejected by [over 100 investors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=4e3c77f95840). I can absolutely-fucking-guarantee you that every single one of them remembers their mistake and would not miss the opportunity to invest in Cohen again. And don\u2019t forget all of the investors who DID invest with Cohen and reaped the benefits with Chewy. While venture capitalists don\u2019t generally make investments in public equities, this is a **truly unique situation. Cohen is treating this like a rebirth, a new venture bootstrapped from GME\u2019s bones.** If VCs as a firm will not invest, you can bet your ass that those individuals will throw their personal money at Cohen. **However this only happens if he\u2019s CEO.** As soon as he\u2019s CEO, a single long weekend trip to the valley might mean 100+ investor meetings with the strategic pitch.\n      1. My biggest fear here is that VCs/PE band to take the company private at some small multiple (2-3x) and then reap the benefits while Cohen turns the company around only to re-list it to us 5 years down the road at 30X the valuation.\n   2. Thus far, it\u2019s been us retail retards vs the wall street shorts. HFs shorting this thing have the advantage in both tactics and capital. However, **if Silicon Valley money starts pouring money into this the game is over.** You cannot believe the amount of money that gets thrown into startups with 90% of it burning up into thin air. $3B market cap? That\u2019s nothing. Folks with Silicon Valley money & risk tolerance would have no problem betting on a serial entrepreneur making something amazing out of a company that already has a customer base, revenue, distribution - all in the same business (e-commerce) the entrepreneur already proved themselves in.\n4. **You, and every other retard that believes.** Look, this was my point at the beginning. You need to think like a VC here. VCs are the ultimate YOLO autists making million dollar bets and not seeing a penny of it for years. They are the ultimate \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83e\udd1a. **You need to decide if you have conviction** for the long term and then buy in. \ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83e\udd1a doesn\u2019t mean selling at $100. It doesn\u2019t means selling at $200. **It means not selling at all this year no matter the price, and at least until you learn for sure whether Cohen is the new CEO**. It means believing so hard that you 20-100X your investment in 2 years when the market wakes up to the ridiculous mispricing.\n   1. Remember that if Cohen is elected CEO he can (and likely will) buy more than a 20% stake in 2022.\n   2. Remember Buffett\u2019s actual quote: [**\"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\"**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/01/30/winning-in-the-market-with-the-patience-of-the-wright-brothers-and-warren-buffett/?sh=26303ec3633b)\n\n**I\u2019ve put every dollar I can** into shares in IBKR, minus some April calls. I hold no covered calls except for some call spreads I had in RH prior to recent bump. I have April calls because I will put more cash into GME after taxes are done, and I know much cash I have to use. Calls let me cap the price I would have to pay now.\n\nThis is personal research. **Do your own DD.**\n\nA wiser investor than me gave the advice of ***\u201cDon\u2019t aim to maximise profit, minimize regret.\u201d*** If you\u2019re not in GME yet, ask yourself how you would truly feel if what everyone here is saying panned out to be true, and you weren\u2019t participating.\n\nOh, and of course: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Update 1:** I'm still holding today, but I realized I made a pretty big mistake on the ecommerce revenue analysis.

I see a lot of people complaining about prices in Switzerland, but Switzerland is like one of the top consumers of organic and vegan food in the world. It's a choice to eat organic. Or living in an expensive apartment is also a choice not many can afford, you know? It's also a choice to be frugal and if you're not specifically making that choice, the argument of \"stuff is too expensive to save\" doesn't hold much. Not to say stuff isn't expensive, it's definitely very expensive lmfao. There's something wrong if the poverty line is like 2.5k.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree.
