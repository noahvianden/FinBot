I think the psychological angle here is if you dilute shares so much that it gives shorts a complete out, while raising a shitload of cash for yourself, you've now alienated your main customer base who is wrapped up in this fiasco.

I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

{"title": "Prisoner's Dilemma - Hold $GME", "selftext": "This is not financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor. These are just my opinions and do not represent the views of this community.\n\nEarlier today I [tried to debunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/explodinghedgefunds/comments/l8jed7/gme_autistic_epiphany/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) the fUnDaMeNtAlS argument against holding shares at these new prices.\n\nThen I read this awesome post about how [we're being manipulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) from all sides.\n\nThis made me want to come up with the simplest win strategy for every retail investor, acting on their own, no matter what bullshit comes our way over the next week or more. Yes, we've already figured out that this means to hold $GME. However, not everyone will not understand the method to our madness and chalk it up to the fact that we're just a bunch of degenerate gamblers. We need them to know why this time.\n\nEnter the $GME [prisoner's dilemma game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Here's the setup. The hedgies and banks can secretly coordinate a crash without being punished. If we cooperate on a short squeeze, it is publicly visible and can result in consequences for us. Still, last week proved the fact that humans, acting individually, have a bias to cooperate on a collective good (see wiki link at start of this paragraph for source). This is our ace in the hole.\n\nThe only way they can win is when we betray each other (we won't) like prisoners being pressured by cops to rat on each other in separate interrogation rooms. The cops (hedgies and banks) will try everything to manipulate, scare, sow distrust, and incentivize the prisoners (retail investors) to rat on each other. The only way the prisoners get the best outcome is if they HOLD $GME \ud83d\ude80.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium for this game is for the prisoners to rat on each other. That's the mathematical equilibrium/outcome. However, I'm arguing that we've demonstrated our ability to surpass that. We're using our human bias to act individually (not cooperatively) for the collective good to overcome this math. We're maximizing the collective gain, not the individual gain. This is the whole point of a short squeeze that sticks it to the hedgies.\n\nTLDR: HOLD\n\nEdit: A throw away account commented that this is sometimes called [superrationality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality) and then deleted their comment...", "id": "l9chts", "created_utc": 1612100486.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 124, "comments": [{"body": "instructions unclear.

(In my defense we did get loud, highly upvoted complaints about the dominance of GME posts too, and I felt obligated to respond to those.)\n\nWhile I cannot undo the damage this caused, I did the following:\n\n- I spent the last ~~two~~ three hours going back ~two weeks of daily threads and restored all the non-disruptive comments that got removed. This affected less than ~200 comments out of well over ~10,000 - but I believe it was those comment removals of comments made by active contributors to the sub that upset our members as \"moderator overreach\" the most. My comment removals were mainly in the January 26 and 27 daily threads. Some of the comments I removed & restored were my own GME/Bitcoin comments - which I wrote with a contributor hat on, and then had to remove with my moderator hat on. \ud83d\ude10\n- I only banned a single user over the GME comment removal controversy, two days ago, whom I un-banned yesterday - but to make certain I reviewed the ban list today again as well: there's been no new bans for the last 48 hours and for the last 23 days there's only been 2 bans of over clear abuse unrelated to the daily thread controversy, and of 3 bots.\n- Going forward I will refrain from policing the daily thread for anything other than clearly disruptive behavior - i.e. no topical filtering.\n\nI've been a junior mod on this sub for only a month. I have never moderated a larger sub before, and I have to say it is a lot more work, is at times stressful, and is less rewarding overall than I imagined when I accepted the invitation.\n\nI'd also like to point out that according to \"anonymous sources\", RealTesla, the \"TSLAQ sub\" is already quietly celebrating over the split & schizm of the Tesla investor community on Reddit - which was the farthest from my intentions when I joined /r/teslainvestorclub as a moderator.\n\nBeyond the above actions I'd also like to tender my resignation to end the schizm, and would like to ask /u/IS_JOKE_COMRADE, /u/upvotemeok and /u/whiskeyH0tel and the others to re-join the daily thread and other threads to make the community whole again.

If everyone KNOWS what's going to happen, then the guys paying $20,000 a year for a bloomberg terminal will get there first. I know you will already downvote and move on due to how many words are below so here's some rockets to keep your attention \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAlright, listen up dumbasses. This subreddit has turned to absolute shit in the past couple of weeks and all 5 million of you new members need a lesson in how hedge funds work. Not here to say $GME can't rocket further as retail investors keep piling on, but the \"GuArAnTeEd ShOrT SqUeEzE\" and \"Make them pay OUR price!!\" is some of the dumbest shit I've heard in my life. If you didn't get in and out at the beginning of the week and don't sell on the next big pop, you're fukt. Eventually we will run out of retail investors pumping the stock.\n\nEver noticed the first part of hedge fund? These guys seek to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Their GME positions will all be hedged one way or another. Maybe they bought calls when this went on its way up. I personally believe that they have been selling cash secured puts to meet the interest requirements while they wait for the bubble to pop. You guys have been pushing IV so high, that even Gamestop $1p a year out will get you something like a guaranteed 25%. The stock shooting up to $300, $400 a share is everyone pricing in the short squeeze. As the funds continue using this upward momentum to hedge their losses (or even make money if their short position wasn't large), we'll run out of retail investors and everyone will make an exit for the door.\n\nThis is a casino, not an investing community, or leftist radical movement. You guys have no idea what you're talking about thinking you're taking down the big hedge funds. The only people truly getting burned here are the dumbasses that buy for $250 and \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f at $500, then sell at $80 when they can't stomach watching it go down further", "id": "l9gvml", "created_utc": 1612113645.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "Wsb mods should remove all the members who joined in the last 2 weeks.
