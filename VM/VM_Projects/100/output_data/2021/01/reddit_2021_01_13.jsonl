{"title": "I made an Options crash course YouTube playlist", "selftext": "In an effort to stop the inflow of noob questions, I made a YouTube [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc16maowxl-XkZZYbXfNspdVAX5w9QHv8) that should do a pretty good job at explaining what options are, and how to trade them effectively. I tried to keep the playlist in order, so you can just binge them if you're determined. This isn't meant to be some super in depth playlist about the Black Scholes model or any of that 200 IQ shit. These are answers to most of your basic options questions. I probably missed a few videos, but I'll update the playlist as I learn.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the awards!

Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy.

Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).\n\nBIDU's new EV?

It is not some AWS relationship). There is INSANE value here. TSLA can be a customer. They have a HUGE percentage of the EV world already are customers of BB. QNX by BB is in 175 MM cars already. \n\nThis shit is only at 4x sales, and by the end of 2021, it will be at 10x sales with sales at least doubling.
