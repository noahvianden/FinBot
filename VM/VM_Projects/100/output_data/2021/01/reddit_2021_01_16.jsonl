{"title": "Everyone is a genius in a bull market: The Dunning-Kruger Effect.", "selftext": "The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task. We are incapable of objective evaluation of our own competency levels. I'm writing about it as I've come to realise I suffer from it.\n\nDunning and Kruger's main finding from their 1999 study \u201cUnskilled and Unaware of it\u201d was that the worst performers consistently overestimate their ability relative to others.\n\nI've outlined two examples of this bias in action and how you can avoid some of these pitfalls:\n\n1. Investing\n\nAs the age old saying goes, \"Everyone is a genius in a bull market.\"\n\nWhen your portfolio is growing and the markets are ripping as they have in 2020, many fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We tend to wrongly attribute this performance to our ability as talented investors.\n\n2. Politics\n\nAn obvious example people have been using recently is Donald Trump, whose confidence never wavers, despite his weak interest and understanding of policy matters.\n\nThe first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. But we're all human, and it's important to recognise that we are all prone to this cognitive bias.\n\nHere are a few strategies to avoid it:\n\n1. Identify your circle of competence\n\nThe circle of competence is a sacred place. It's a set of topics or areas that align with a person's expertise. Be ruthless in identifying and protecting the boundaries, and it's usually smaller than you think.\n\nAs Charlie Munger said, \"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of being very intelligent.\"\n\nKnow your competencies, focus on them. Know your incompetencies, avoid or outsource them.\n\n2. Be a first principles thinker\n\nA first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition - it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions. In chemistry, it's like an element. It cannot be broken down further.\n\nGround yourself in foundational truths and build up from there. Challenge your reasoning, and most importantly, always ask why.\n\n\"It isn't what you don't know that gets you in trouble. It's what you know for sure that just isn't so.\"\n\nLink to original: https://mrsk.substack.com/p/everyone-is-a-genius-in-a-bull-market", "id": "kykf4c", "created_utc": 1610809434.0, "score": 1074, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "Oddly enough, after observing Donald Trump's success regarding constant self-praise, I jokingly began implementing it myself at work shortly after he became president.\n\nI'd constantly mention how I was \"Killin' It\" on a daily basis.

Citron punched PLTR first, then came Credit Sussie, then Morgan Stanley.... recently Citi... and ya'll had to show them your paper hands. PLTR is a diamond which needs the same. Big guys trying to downplay the stock till the next financials come in. Thats where they get in, and you keep watching the stock price go up. Obvious cue ignored.\n4. Just like TSLA is backed by a CEO trying to change world conventions of commuting, energy and space travel. PLTR is the revolution of how corporations would strategize and optimize their existing pipelines! Still ya'll selling shares and buying puts. Obvious cue ignored.\n5. Ya'll profited big time out of GME and BB. But, do you really even consider or plan to stay? Doesn't PLTR look like an obvious place to dump your gains?\n6. Specifically for you \"simple men\" looking for \ud83d\ude80- Alex Karp's entire life makes papa Musk's dance look normal.. and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Isn't Alex Karp's hair style enough for you to YOLO your life savings into PLTR?\n\nHere is a company which is skyrocketing off of skyrocketting other companies and ya'll pumping GME and BB?\n\nTL;DR - Confused about where the bucks are flowing. Obvious explicit and implicit cues point straight towards PLTR\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. Simple as 1 + 1. Yet you guys pumping GME and BB?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT1: Sorry my point 3 and 6 got repeated. Changing it to what I originally intended it to be. I don't know how to copy paste shit.

{"title": "Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) has some MAJOR catalyst approaching. Don\u2019t miss out like you did with $GME", "selftext": "Yesterday we ended the day on a 3% gain, albeit this was a 10%+ gain at some points but the market went red as a whole so this is understandable. Regardless, there\u2019s a number of reasons to be loading up on SHARES before the \ud83d\ude80 takes off.\n\n1. Institutional\u2019s are loading up on PLTR prior to the major catalysts (ARK recently upped their stake by 497,100 shares and so did another number of firms).\n\n2. Demo Day: 26th of Jan we\u2019ll see PLTR do a demonstration day of their main product offerings. This will undoubtedly draw attention and traction to the stock as people better understand the recent standardisation of PLTR\u2019s software. This standardisation is what has enabled them to target over 6,000 large institution/enterprise customers across all verticals. Ultimately this will show their commercial viability outside of what they\u2019re known for (governmental contracts) and will result in a stock uptick due to their future viability.\n\n3. Earnings Day: Early February we shall see PLTR\u2019s earnings report for Q420. This should also cover some of the forward-looking aspects of it\u2019s recently acquired contracts alongside projections. If you are unaware of those contracts, see the link here: [LINK](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx)\n\nAs Palantir will most likely pass $1bn in revenue, this is likely to be a big day.\n\n\n4. Lockup period: Employees and the like are able to liquidate some of their positions come mid February. This has obvious negative connotations to it but for the most part what most people don\u2019t understand is that there will only be a minuscule amount of shares which will be CASHED in. Employees will not cash in all their shares as they will also notice and realise the growth potential of their stock options. They will maybe cash in a small amount if needed but the firm has just began properly marketing their product and concentrating on business development, employees and us alike know the growth potential of this stock.\n\nOnce a lower-than-anticipated amount of stock is liquidated, this will most likely have an inverse effect. People will realise that this dip won\u2019t happen and there will be a scrambled influx to buy in. Most likely driving the stock up and pushing it to ATH (unless we have another Citi downgrade bcos IBs love a bit of MM).\n\n\nThat\u2019s all.\n\nTLDR; Buy PLTR shares NOT calls for the time being or you will see beautiful \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and realise you have missed out on the next $GME / $TSLA", "id": "kyhvog", "created_utc": 1610799011.0, "score": 454, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "Step 1.

{"title": "Everyone is a genius in a bull market: The Dunning-Kruger Effect.", "selftext": "The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task. We are incapable of objective evaluation of our own competency levels. I'm writing about it as I've come to realise I suffer from it.\n\nDunning and Kruger's main finding from their 1999 study \u201cUnskilled and Unaware of it\u201d was that the worst performers consistently overestimate their ability relative to others.\n\nI've outlined two examples of this bias in action and how you can avoid some of these pitfalls:\n\n1. Investing\n\nAs the age old saying goes, \"Everyone is a genius in a bull market.\"\n\nWhen your portfolio is growing and the markets are ripping as they have in 2020, many fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We tend to wrongly attribute this performance to our ability as talented investors.\n\n2. Politics\n\nAn obvious example people have been using recently is Donald Trump, whose confidence never wavers, despite his weak interest and understanding of policy matters.\n\nThe first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. But we're all human, and it's important to recognise that we are all prone to this cognitive bias.\n\nHere are a few strategies to avoid it:\n\n1. Identify your circle of competence\n\nThe circle of competence is a sacred place. It's a set of topics or areas that align with a person's expertise. Be ruthless in identifying and protecting the boundaries, and it's usually smaller than you think.\n\nAs Charlie Munger said, \"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of being very intelligent.\"\n\nKnow your competencies, focus on them. Know your incompetencies, avoid or outsource them.\n\n2. Be a first principles thinker\n\nA first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition - it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions. In chemistry, it's like an element. It cannot be broken down further.\n\nGround yourself in foundational truths and build up from there. Challenge your reasoning, and most importantly, always ask why.\n\n\"It isn't what you don't know that gets you in trouble. It's what you know for sure that just isn't so.\"\n\nLink to original: https://mrsk.substack.com/p/everyone-is-a-genius-in-a-bull-market", "id": "kykg1v", "created_utc": 1610809523.0, "score": 215, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": ">The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task.\n\nIronically this is incorrect. I know that this is also the common explanation (which is even more ironic) because it is not accurate to what the [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Unskilled-and-unaware-of-it%3A-how-difficulties-in-to-Kruger-Dunning/f2c80eef3585e0569e93ace0b9770cf76c8ebabc?p2df) reads.\n\nThe Dunning-Krueger Effect is better understood to be a simple failure of metacognition. In short-hand: \"You don't know that you don't know something and you can't realize that you don't know it.\" Overconfidence is a side-effect but not actually the effect itself; self-assessment typically is overdrawn but the parabolic effect isn't as \"outlandish\" as popular media makes it out to be; for instance people who are just starting with options might say, \"I understand the greeks\" but then turn around and ask something that requires you to understand the greeks *but* that shouldn't be mistaken for the idea that people simply fail to understand that they *don't* know everything about options, hence the question to begin with, etc.\n\n[You are more likely to suffer Illusory Depth](https://ritholtz.com/2019/08/the-illusion-of-explanatory-depth/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBigPicture+%28The+Big+Picture%29) in this particular case of investing in a \"wild\" market. Also, I would not consider this a \"bull\" market in the traditional sense; the number of winners and losers last year (that is, companies that literally no longer exist, not just companies that lost value) is astronomical; what happened with bonds and liquidity functions of other assets and such is not equivalent to a normal and steady rise in valuation over time at all. That's why there are so many saying, \"The Second Coming\" is coming for a fall out and honestly they might be right with the dollar being forcibly devalued. How long can that truly last? We don't know. We've never done this before in history. Which is ironic because again to understand these effects (this is a close cousin of DK) you'll make up stories as to why things occurred. What this means is also you can create [Economic Narratives](https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Economics-Stories-Economic-Events/dp/0691182299) which turn out to be exactly what drives a series of interesting effects.\n\nWe can actually prove this; let's take for instance the Gamestop situation. So first we have \"the initial buyers\", like DeepFuckingValue, now the question is simple: Did he know that Gamestop would rebrand and Ryan Cohen would take interest almost a year and a half before it happened? No. So then, that begs another question; did the short-squeeze itself warrant these prices? No. Now, of course, in the history of the world we will write that *he did* and that there was no difference between the events that occurred and his state simply because it all rolls into itself very nicely (hence Illusory Depth with Narrative) into a clean story.\n\nThe reality is that there are people who make bets like this all the time *and lose* but we don't remember them. Another good story is the Ambulance driver who made a million percent or something; in that same thread there was a guy whose calls expired *one week too early* and do you know what? I remember the Ambulance Driver. I don't remember the other guy.\n\nWe can say the same of Tesla; everyone has an explanation as to why Tesla soared *after the fact* but no one expected this to occur in a single year and anyone who gives an explanation of it is practically lying through their teeth since the story itself of clean energy is 40 years old. There are many, many examples where things went sideways, make no sense, will be explained after the fact, or are just flat out garbage that people will buy into because they see the ticker and know that it will rise regardless of it's actual viability.\n\nTL;DR: **The greatest threat to you in this market are the stories you tell yourself not the knowledge base you think you have.**", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "I will say this regarding DFV: He didn't expect to happen what just happened, not half a year ago.\nHe did tell us what he thought and how he came to yolo on GME.

{"title": "$FUBO DD - Connecting the dots, this thing is going to be a MONSTER.", "selftext": "Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.\n\nFirst, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. \n\nQ3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)\n\n* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  \n\n   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.\n   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.\n* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.\n* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.\n* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.\n* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.\n\nQ4 Preliminary Results:\n\n[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)\n\n* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.\n* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.\n\nIt smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. \n\n*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:\n\n\\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.\n\n\\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)\n\n\\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)\n\nFubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, on to the NBA:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)\n\n\"Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV\u2019s formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world \u2013 Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.\"\n\nDavid Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.\n\nWhy am I bringing up the NBA?\n\n[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)\n\nPeople are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. \n\nThe NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, lets look into two key acquisitions: \n\n\\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. \n\nBalto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)\n\n34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. \n\nSince the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. \n\nShort term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.\n\nLong term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute.", "id": "kyt46m", "created_utc": 1610836628.0, "score": 381, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "I don't even know what fubo TV is and I have calls, tf is wrong with the rest of you?", "score": 73, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4728308320045471}, {"body": "Buy calls ASAP, show those \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "I would but have to clue how calls work.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31703251600265503}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3135959506034851}, {"body": "You wrote this report?\n\nWhat\u2019s your process for DD?
