My list that I sold puts or covered calls on in 2020 is:\n\nABBV\n\nAFL\n\nAMCR\n\nAOS\n\nBAC\n\nBEN\n\nBMO\n\nBMY\n\nBTI\n\nCAH\n\nD\n\nDUK\n\nENB\n\nGD\n\nGILD\n\nIBM\n\nIVZ\n\nJPM\n\nKO\n\nLEG\n\nMET\n\nMMM\n\nMO\n\nMRK\n\nOZK\n\nPBCT\n\nPEP\n\nPFE\n\nPM\n\nSO\n\nT\n\nUl\n\nUNM\n\nVTRS\n\nWBA\n\nWU\n\nXLE\n\nXOM\n\nI sold some weeklies at first but mostly did the 45 DTE target a la Tastytrade.\n\nHere are my mistakes/lessons learned for the year:\n\n1. **Not understanding how to use portfolio margin responsibly.**  This is one of the two primary reasons (taxes being the other) my taxable account barely beat the market.  I started out in March only selling cash-secured puts thinking naked puts were too risky.  Tastytrade has some good back tests showing that up to 60% of buying power could be allocated through events like the great recession without  blowing up.  Much later in the year I starting to target using 25-30% of my buying power instead of only selling cash-secured.  Had I done this earlier my returns would have been greatly enhanced.\n2. **Taxes take a huge chunk out of returns in a taxable account.**  I'm in a higher tax bracket so that matters but it is almost to the point of the effort not being worth it.  With my adjustments going forward and using a touch of margin I think 2021 will be much better even taking taxes into account, but if I am wrong and it is not then I will need to re-evaluate this strategy in my taxable account.  **Edit for clarity:** I am in a \\~35% combined federal+state tax situation for short term gains.  My \"beat the market by 0.5%\" calculation is after paying 35% of my gains in short term tax and 15% on long term gains/dividends.\n3. **I committed fully to positions too soon, which did not allow me to add to them when better opportunities showed up.**  Two tickers this happened with were IVZ and WFC.  I had committed full positions to each, and then they dropped significantly lower, which should have been an opportunity for me to grab more.  However I just wasn't comfortable doing it because of a nagging voice saying \"what if you're wrong and they go bankrupt, that would be too big of a loss to take.\"\n4. **I Figured out too late that I needed to roll out and up before getting deep itm on calls.** Because of this, I have some June WFC 27.5 calls that I wish were at the 30 strike instead. Cost basis on the shares is $25.02 so it's still a gain but it could be a better gain if I had acted sooner.\n5. **I Figured out too late that I really want to be long stock and sell options around my positions.** I let KO, PEP, SO, MET, LEG and AOS get called away at some great prices. All for a profit but I wish I had rolled my calls out and up.\n6. **I Bought back some calls in June for a small profit when I was sure the underlyings were going to pop.**  They never popped.  I could have just kept them on and collected all the theta.  I guess this is the option equivalent of market timing.\n7. **I got assigned some BTI 40 puts early**.  I was planning to roll these until I was right, and it was a surprise that they got assigned to me early.  I had expected that was possible with it covered calls, didn't realize it could happen with puts too.\n8. **Order entry mistakes can happen.**  Using the web version of my broker I sold 10 puts when I wanted to sell 1, and I sold in my taxable account when I wanted to in one of my IRAs.  The web interface is just clunkier.  Thankfully the options I sold too many of had narrow bid-ask spreads and the loss correcting the mistake was only about $2 total per contract.\n9. **I sold some PFE puts not realizing they were about to spinoff VTRS.**  This meant my adjusted puts would become much less liquid.  I bought them back at a small profit thinking I needed to avoid the illiquidity of having adjusted options.  Now that I know whats up I can be prepared for IBM later this year.\n10. **I took some months off from actively monitoring my positions.**  I know this cost me because I didn't buy things back at 50% profit for most of June, July, August, and September.  I was just mentally fried at the time with quarantine, having homeschooled the kids, and everything else going on.  This is an active strategy and taking time off = money lost.  I've since trimmed the time commitment but when the market has a big day I need to take the time to redeploy capital to keep the returns flowing.\n11. **I don't even know why I am comparing returns to the S&P.**  If I was long all of my underlyings that wouldn't compare to the S&P, so I am not sure of the point, other than to make sure what I am doing is worth my time vs buy and hold SPY.\n\nIf I can think of more beyond that 11, I'll edit them in.\n\nHopefully this is helpful to others just starting.

You had a lot of stress going on and that can be a distraction. Far better imo to pause and recollect your focus then start getting sloppy with trades that impact your accounts.\n\n3: **Comparing to the S&P500**. The idea for a benchmark is to grade how well you did. Comparing to the S&P benchmark because you could just place all your money in an index fund and be done with it. The amount amount of time you put in to beat your benchmark should be worth it to you. Otherwise just buy SPY and save a lot of time and hassle. Personally I use a 75% SPY and 25% TLT mix cause that is probably what I would do if I didnt sell options and make individual stock pick investments.\n\n4: **Selling PFE puts**. Didyou also record how many positive unknown events occurred that made you money via vega? Theoretically given enough trades this all balances out. Since you mentioned tastytrade, they stress hitting lots of trades for probabilities to pan out over thousands of trades. There isnt enough time to research and keep track of companies when you have a dozen or more trades going on at once. \n\nStill, I get what you are saying. I use ToS and on my chart page I have the news for a company. A quick glance through is usually enough to spot major news.\n\n5: **Taxes**. Keep in mind that in the beginning of learning any skillset we are going to be making dumb mistakes. If your S&P benchmark makes 8% for the year and you can avoid a dumb mistake that would have caused a 2% loss then in essence you just made a full quarter's worth of profit.

{"title": "Palantir is long term play and takes mainstream finance media news/rating after your own DD only", "selftext": "The whole street made bearish sentiment about the Palantir direct listing and the best target price was given is at 13$ for a year out. What do you think they will do if the stock triples in less than a month. They can't go and say that we are updating their 1-2-month-old recommendations to reflect that. They are OK doing it for 30-40% but not for 300%. They have no option but to issue a sell rating and bearish sentiment about it. At a given time there are always bearish and bull sentiments and with enough confirmation bias, you can write whatever. We have seen this in the case of Tesla for e.g. JP Moron has a price target of 80-90$ for tesla and on another hand, they have a buy rating for Nikola. While JPM was telling street to sell Tesla, they loaded themselves in Q3-Q4 in tesla. They offer unique leveraged products to customers based on ARK etfs, which has maxed its Tesla capacity. Long story short, these people are in business to prove them right instead of giving opinions to the general public. There is hardly anyone in the analyst community who understands AI, ML, Big data beyond tech buzz words (Ark is an exception). I spent 15 yrs in the industry and spent the whole of my career building ANN/PCA/SOM models for large 4D simulation problem for projects required multi-billion$ investments and then executing these projects. Today I work in Strategy consulting and with few things i learned over the years, my POV is Palantir is misrepresented by mainstream finance and instead we should focus on more what Karp is saying, how the quarterly number looks, which industry they are entering and who is the real competition\n\nOne portion of Palantir is little understood is its 2016 acquisition of Silk Kimono, it has to yield results in the coming days\n\nWe listen that Palantir has lost money for a long time. it is important to understand that investing back is not money lost and if we see investments and growth in revenue - it's somewhat a proxy for it\n\nAmazon has done it for 2 decades\n\nOnce you stop doing that you become a tech value company under the clock of innovation growth company (which you are no longer)\n\nI can't say in the short term what is the right price, In the long term, i see Palantir at a 10x-20x valuation of its value from direct listing\n\nWith my own limited understanding of business and things that I learned (certified nerd, with serious degrees from very serious colleges), I ran an exercise that how to identify companies that have 1 Trillion$ potential by 2030 and under 50 billion$ now - Palantir and SpaceX were two filtered out\n\nso I am long Palantir, SpaceX and off course long Tesla also.\n\nThe stock has got volatile as initially, it had a bad press, and then there was no IPO or SPAC euphoria. Once it gained, it became a meme stock. The stock is new in public markets and unique growth stock\n\nSo people are still trying to figure it out. What it does, it does best. Customer acquisition is not easy but as they prove their worth, it should get better.\n\nSee the case of BP, they pay Palantir 120 million $ a year No oil company pays this much to any of the company for digital and software service\u2019s And Bp has stated value of Palantir very openly.\n\nThey only have one client in all the industries they work In private space. There is a huge opportunity. They have started with a top-down solution model, But they will@make more and more solutions\n\nPossibly new business models, As well.\n\nThis company has just started building a sales and marketing team and One thing a good sales team does is to sell proven solutions, again and again, We need 1-2 yrs to see that impact\n\nI assume customer acquisition for Palantir is a 1-1.5 yr process. Thiel has said several times that his focus is to help navigate companies through key inflection points\n\nNo other company symbolizes him more than Palantir today. So I don\u2019t see him bailing out. Alex Karp is super passionate. These guys worry more about the impact they will create and the legacy they will leave than valuation. In their head they see Palantir to be in the same place one day, as we have Google and Facebook.", "id": "kpy6h6", "created_utc": 1609724372.0, "score": 161, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "Commented this in another post. \n\nPalantir has a lot of promise moving forward for a couple of reasons. See below.\n\nSales team:\n\nEssentially Palantir in the 17 years of existence, only has had a sales team for 1.5 years. The reasoning behind this is because internally, Palantir did not want to go the whole sales route of software but recently, that they needed to if they ever wanted to go public and thus reward their share holders. Since the sales team is so new, one can say that they are essentially a new company in that they are in the early years of growth. Palantir also finally has built out their Foundry Platform and Apollo platforms over the years and are now ready to ramp up a lot of customers quickly.\n\nEfficiency / Apollo:\n\nPalantir as a company has become extremely more efficient the past 1-2 years when it comes to acquiring new customers and ramping them up. The reasoning behind this is their Apollo Platform. It\u2019s an in house platform that uses ML to help get a customer up and going a lot faster than previously. In the past, Palantir would have to send \u201cforward deployed engineers\u201d to customers to get them up and running and that could take weeks / months and is costly. Now With Apollo, Palantir can get a customer up and running in hours without sending anyone. This frees up cash for Palantir the invest back into R&D. Also wanted to mention, during the last Q3 earnings call, an analyst asked the headcount growth for the company. Most high growth companies tend to hire a lot of ppl to keep that growth rate up. A company doing that that comes to mind is Snowflake. Palantir\u2019s CFO said that their headcount is only growing 2-3% and mostly in the sales department. The reasoning of this is directly due to Apollo. Palantir\u2019s employees have become more efficient and that with Apollo, they can onboard a lot of customers without hiring more expensive engineers.\n\nPalantir Modules:\n\nOn the Q3 earnings call, Palantir alluded to an ERP type Modules for Foundry that they are working on so that customers can pick and choose which aspects of Foundry they want, instead of getting the whole suite. This is great because it\u2019s way cheaper for a company to get started with Palantir\u2019s software and then slowly ramp up with more options. Palantir has a very high retention rate with their software so by having a company only pick 1-2 modules, it most likely will result in getting more and more modules which in turns create more revenue for PLTR. I suspect they will talk about this come the Demo day.\n\nFinal thoughts.\n\nPalantir has great leadership and are very smart people. They are very methodical in their planning. This company is 100% a long term hold. Think 5-10 years at least. They only had a sales team for 1.5 years and already will have over $1B in sales with virtually no sales team.
