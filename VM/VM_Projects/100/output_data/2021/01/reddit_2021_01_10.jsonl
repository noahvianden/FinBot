Remember in the 80\u2019s when the US government was building and paying $400 for toilet seats?  They will come up with projects and contracts with mills to supply steel. \n\nThere will be a short supply and US businesses will be looking for import material that will come from the largest steel maker in the world - $MT.  Well positioned in Canada and Mexico. \n\nOh, and I\u2019m just giving you the US situation. \n\nImagine the same around the globe in all developed nations. \n\nNot a lot of people realize that government is big business - the biggest when they want to be.  \n\nThrow all the global tension in there as well with all major country\u2019s expanding their military\u2019s - do you know how much steel goes into building naval vessels?  Tanks?  This is why there was a section 232 enacted - steel production is necessary for our safety and self-defense.  Lastly, I once sold steel as part of a nuclear reactor project.  Do you know how many truckloads of steel alone went into the building of one nuclear reactor?  1,600 - 24 ton trucks. 40,000T. To build one aircraft carrier?  60,000T.  \n\nCheck this out:  https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2442969/statement-from-deputy-secretary-of-defense-david-l-norquist-on-the-department-o/\n\nWanted to share as a lot of you keep asking. \n\nI\u2019m bullish on steel. \n\nMy first post said this was a short term play - to trade out in 6 months or when steel prices go sideways for 60 days straight. \n\nI\u2019m starting to believe this is a LONGER TERM PLAY. \n\nI\u2019m pushing out to August at this point.  \n\nBased on what Biden announces and will get passed - this may be a 2021 play into 2022. \n\nDon\u2019t get crazy yet.  \n\nWait for the Vito blessing. \n\nHope Saturday night has been good.  \n\nMore NFL tomorrow - bet the STEELERS TO COVER. \n\nThey win by 25 - guessing that will also be the price of $CMC after earnings pre-market. \n\n-Vito", "id": "ku7yj8", "created_utc": 1610255109.0, "score": 521, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 324, "comments": [{"body": "Guys!
