{"title": "What if TESLA was a Banana Stand that made a profit of $1 per day? ANALYSIS", "selftext": "**Lets say Sneed owns a Banana Stand that makes a profit of $1 per day.**\n\nChuck wants to buy a 50% share in Sneeds Banana Stand. Chuck asks himself, what is a reasonable price to pay for half of this banana stand?\n\nIf Chuck paid $500 for half of the Banana Stand:\n\n* Total Banana Stand market value: $1000\n* Total Banana Stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365\n* Price to profit ratio (P/E ratio): 2.73\n* Time to recoup his $500 investment: 2.73 years\n\nChuck is willing to take on a little more risk than this. Hell, this Banana Stand really shows a lot of promise! And Sneed, well, Sneed is like a genius! He had a great Banana Stand over on the other side of town that sold tons of bananas. What if Chuck paid ... $25,000 ?\n\n* Total Banana Stand market value: $50,000\n* Total Banana Stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365\n* P/E ratio: 137\n* Time to recoup his $25,000 investment: 137 years.\n\nChuck doesn't expect to hold his investment for 137 years. He believes that what's really important is not the money coming into the Banana Stand, but rather how other people like Chuck *feel* about the Banana Stand. See chuck is a growth investor - not a value investor.\n\nChuck feels really good about the future of this Banana Stand. It's only making $1 a day right now, but man Sneed is going to take this Stand places.

Sneed has created a new banana tree strain that only he has access to, the new strain grows faster and produces more bananas than other trees on the market. Sneed also has a a grow light business that stores and gives the banana trees light at the time of  day or night they need it most. This power storage business not only works for bananas but all fruit growing businesses. Sneed also has plans to offer all banana stand operators insurance if their stands don't perform well, bringing in free cash flow for his banana business.

Solid. Thick. Tight. \n\nLet me add some analysis to your post on why FB is guaranteed to fail, and relatively soon:  \n\n\n>1. Facebook can't continue it's previous growth. Simply put they are running out of people on earth qualified to join (have connectivity) and an interest. Once you hit market saturation, you slow down. Unfortunately for them, the US economy is fixated on the idea of growth. Being successful or profitable isn't as important as growth. Growth is what makes the stock go up. How will they deal with this problem? They'll need to they can come up with a plan to show growth in something other than users. \n\n>2. Facebooks original demographic is disenchanted. It's no longer elite, private, interesting. It's noisy, commercial, public. Who wants to friend their grandmother? Who wants their aunt seeing their drunken mistakes from the night before?\n\n>3. People get bored of things after a while. People get bored of things on the internet even faster.\n\n>4. Facebook's only major perk was \"keeping you in touch\", but the cost was privacy and oversharing. Several alternatives are popping up with a lower cost across all of Facebook's platforms. \n\n>5. People prefer less intrusive tools. The best tools are the least intrusive. The reason the cell phone is superior to the landline is it doesn't tie you to a location. The reason a car is superior to a horse is it doesn't require as much maintenance, can go faster for longer. Facebook is very time intensive for the gain of \"keeping in touch\". That goes back to cost... is it worth it? Do you really care if you're in touch with someone you were in 3rd grade with?\n\n\nFacebook is doomed right? \n\n**No, this is a copy of some dunce's post from 2011** who claimed Facebook was on the verge of death. Nostradamus here went 0 for 5: https://www.quora.com/Is-Facebook-dying-in-popularity/answer/Robert-Accettura\n\nFacebook has had unrelenting Q/Q and YoY growth in users and revenue since this turd DD from 2011. And it continued to grow in users and revenue through the 2016 Cambridge Analytica scandal. \n\nAnd it continued to grow in users and revenue through the 2018 Russian Influence campaigns congressional hearings. \n\nAnd it continued to grow (surprise) various scandals in 2019 and 2020, dozens of \"delete facebook\" campaigns on social media in the last 5 years, and most importantly including a large, coordinated effort between dozens of big name companies to completely stop running ads on Facebook. \n\n*And it's still growing* and maintaining absurdly large profit margins.  It's a money printing machine. \n\n\nElon might be the GOAT but that don't mean Zuck and the FAANG crew et al are scrubs.
