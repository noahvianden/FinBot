Trust me your wallet will thank you.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6171336770057678}, {"body": "My advice is to look into selling puts first.  Basically pick a stock that you don\u2019t mind owning for a lower price (let\u2019s say Tesla as an example).  You sell a put for the end of the week at a way OTM strike that suits your fancy.  Let\u2019s say you pick $500 strike or something.  You\u2019ll make $30 for one contract - yes I know not a lot of money but bear with me here.\n\nSo if Tesla does not fall to $500 by Friday, you pocket the $30 free and clear and are free to do it again next week.  Now this is a very bad example - why?   Well you\u2019re locking up $50k in value to earn 30 bucks - talk about not worth it right? (your broker will require you to have this amount waiting to go in case Tesla does fall to that amount and you\u2019re assigned).\n\nSo there are a couple things you can do.  Pick a stock with a relatively low price so you don\u2019t need as much capital locked up.  Or you can do a vertical spread ie sell a put let\u2019s say for $500 then use the proceeds to immediately buy a put for $495 or something even lower.  This is a little more advanced as a concept but the execution is relatively straight forward.\n\nI\u2019m still learning myself but have made quite a bit in the last few months just by doing cash covered put selling (then the wheel when assigned) and vertical spreads several times a week on SPY.\n\nI even created a small account challenge for myself with a 10k starting balance to trade for 2021 so I can better understand the mechanics and limitations of small accounts - so far I\u2019m up a hair over 7.5% in the first week on vertical spreads in that account.  I should be up another 8-9% this week doing very YOLO type stuff for now in that account like betting the farm on SPY verticals but I won\u2019t keep doing this.  My goal is to help my sister and friends who have tiny accounts and little experience in stocks/options and help sift through various strategies to give them some safe bets to execute regularly to grow their accounts this year. \n\nAnyway I wish you luck!  Feel free to DM me for videos that helped me understand all these types of trades.  I think eventually I\u2019ll learn more advanced strategies but I\u2019m the sort of person to sift through various things and find the simplest and most efficient means to accomplish something and these suit me well thus far.\n\nEdit: fixed bunch of typos\nEdit again:  Figure I should post this here as I\u2019ve gotten a few messages already:\n\nSimply put the vertical spread on SPY seems to be the most optimal thing I can find right now.  Again, I\u2019m just learning this...\n\nBasics of the vertical I\u2019m doing now: https://youtu.be/YfYjNovwph8\n\nVerticals let\u2019s you highly leverage for a defined risk is there is a cap to how much you can lose (and gain for that matter). \n\nExample:   I have 100 vertical contracts in my 10k account right now.  This is the Max allowed given my account value.  Each time I do this, I gain $400-600 depending on what strikes I pick.\n\nNow this is not recommended (bet entire account all at once in one play) but it\u2019s my process for learning about something - it wouldn\u2019t be the most I\u2019ve lost in a day haha. I like to test limits and see what happens.  Better for me than just reading about it or watching a video.\n\nSo if I earn $500 on average each trade against my 10k, I earn 5%.  Do this 3 times a week and I make $1500 (15%).\n\nThere a few risk factors of course that and scenarios that can generate max loss which is why I would not keep this.  But short of the market completely tanking by 4pm eastern in Monday, I will have made another $500\n\nThe key is to have an exit criteria settled on (like, I\u2019ll sell out after I hit 75% max gain) and a management strategy ie \u201cwhat to do in case things go the wrong direction\u201d.  Like example:  for most of my covered calls, the goal is premium collection and not to sell the stock.  The side effect of Tesla running up so high is that most of my covered calls have to get rolled up and out each week.  This is my management strategy since I don\u2019t want to sell the stock now. \n\nIt\u2019s no sweat off my back as I don\u2019t count rolling as losses really (rightly or wrongly).  I\u2019m just delaying the premium being mine free and clear - plus at some point I will win since Tesla will have a price shock sooner or later because something Elon says/does or they miss a short term target and the pundits/tv hosts do their thing.

It is way less stressful and more likely to \"work out\" doing boring things like covered calls than YOLOing. I was trying to \"make it work\" with more conservative bets (spreads, condors, etc...) but even then I had one particularly bad month and lost almost everything. I came to the conclusion that options-only positions aren't backed by anything, so they're much more likely to go to 0 than positions backed by a real asset (a share). A few caveats, I didn't really feel like I had enough buying power to get this working until I had ~$5k (but I also turned margin on, so actually $10k without it). You need to choose your underlying carefully. It should be rising or neutral, but good luck getting enough premium from a neutral underlying. If it's rising, don't compare yourself to the \"perfect\" trade. You *will* underperform buying precisely at the bottom and selling precisely at the top. That is not the opportunity cost of selling a covered call. Instead compare to a baseline like $SPY.

You need to go back to what an options contract *is* to understand the answer to that question. \n\nA call option gives the buyer the right to purchase 100 shares from the seller at a given price by a given date. If the price of the underlying is below the agreed upon price (the strike price), then there's no incentive for the buyer to exercise the option and it becomes more worthless over time. If the price is above the strike price the buyer can exercise the contract and buy at the strike price. Then they can sell on the open market and pocket the difference in price. The value of an \"In The Money\" (ITM) call will be a little higher than that, but will decay toward it in time. \n\nSo you end up losing money over time no matter what, but that can be offset by movements in the underlying. For example, if it moves from being \"Out of the Money\" (OTM) to ITM then you start accumulating intrinsic value very quickly. \n\nSo yes, it's possible to buy a contract on Monday and sell by Friday for a profit if the underlying moves favorably, but the risk is that the underlying *doesn't* move favorably and the value of the contract decays to nothing, in which case you lose everything you paid for the contract -so the risk is... high. \n\n\"The Greeks\" are some mathematical terms that describe how the value of an option *should* move with relation to changes in the price of the underlying and time, but they're only approximations because there's a big fudge factor called implied volatility that can only be observed, not predicted. They're very useful to understand, but also understand that the ones making money from \"abusing\" the Greeks are the really big guys to whom the extra few basis points you pick up by playing those positions perfectly are worth it. \n\nPick up a single Greek, I recommend Theta because it's kind of mid level in terms of complexity, but offers a nice risk/return on introductory strategies. Go all in on strategies based on that Greek. You might need to get up to level three options to really do that. Then once you've got a handle on something like Theta, start branching out -Delta is a natural follow on from Theta.\n\nThat would be my advice.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7126670479774475}, {"body": "\u201cIf I will buy a call option (at the money)on Monday and then sell it on the same week on or before Friday hoping the stock price will go up. What risks am I involved in?\u201d\n\nMax risk: The amount you paid for the option. \n\nWhile that\u2019s true, it conceals some of the juicier nuances that make options so interesting and strategic!\n\nFor example, you mention, kind of in passing, that you\u2019re buying at-the-money (ATM) calls. \n\nThat detail is absolutely *CENTRAL* to the conversation and arguably a mistake right out of the gate given your objective. \n\nAssuming I\u2019ve read your note right and your thesis is that the stock is going to go up then you\u2019re likely better off with any of the following:\n\nA) in-the-money (ITM) or out-of-the-money (OTM) calls instead of ATM or, \nB) a bull call spread \n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nTime value is *greatest* at-the-money.\n\nAs such, 1.) as the underlying price goes up AND/OR down, you will lose time value AND 2.) as time passes, theta (or time decay) will also be decreasing your time-value (extrinsic value).  You time value cost/risk will be greatest with ATM calls!\n\nOTM Calls\nUsing OTM calls will increase the chance your calls expire worthless BUT 1.) you will have less money at risk and 2.) moves in your direction will improve your time value, not hurt it like with ATM calls. \n\nITM Calls\nUsing ITM calls can reduce your exposure to time value as well. The further ITM you go 1.) the less you\u2019ll have to spend on time value and 2.) the more your option\u2019s gains will mimic the gains in the underlying i.e., deeper ITM calla have higher deltas. However, you will have to put more money at-risk. So, if you\u2019re wrong and the stock goes down, you\u2019ll have money money on the table (and remember, you can lose it all if the stock drops below the strike at expiration)\n\nBull Call Spread\nIf you\u2019re dead set on using ATM calls, you could reduce the cost of time value by turning it into a bull call spread i.e., writing/selling a higher priced call. You\u2019ll be capping your upside should the stock rip but, you\u2019ll get a decent amount of time value back. \n\n/TLDR:  While your max risk is \u201closing it all\u201d using ATM calls is probably putting you at the biggest risk of realizing that loss. Consider using ITM or OTM calls to reduce your \u201ctime value\u201d costs and effects of time decay. Alternatively, consider also selling a higher priced call to turn the trade into a bull call spread which will reduce both the amount you spend on time value and your time decay. \n\n\u201cHow can I correlate with theta and iv volatility?\u201d\nSince you\u2019re planning on using ATM calls, high IV will increase time value. As such, theta will be higher (because there\u2019s more time value to erode by expiry)\n\n\u201cCan I still make some profits before the expiration?\u201d\nYes, but using ATM calls vs any of the options above will probably make it harder.

{"title": "Why did PLTR sell off last week? (An analysis)", "selftext": "# Everybody that wanted in, was already in\nAccording to finviz.com, retail investors own 79% of PLTR's float (shares available for trading), suggesting that much of the price increase from $10 to over $30 in the past 3 months was driven by said class of investors. It's unlikely that risk-sensitive institutions would be heavily involved in such a feverish stock. For example, Palantir's market cap increased by more than $10 billion in a couple days after the announcement of a $44 million 3-year partnership with the FDA. $44 million over 3 years is a rounding error relative to its annual revenue.\nAfter hitting its $33 peak, PLTR pulled back and consolidated at a $25 to $29 price range. During this time, people continue to be bullish for the stock with many believing that it'll soon break all-time-highs again. Unfortunately, at least in the short term, everyone that wanted in was already in and the lack of new buying primed the stock for a sell-off. Another way to spot this is when /r/WallStreetBets starts being filled with bullish commentary for the stock. On a few days in November and December, the majority of the subreddit was talking about PLTR. If you think about it, users would only create a bullish post or upvote bullish posts of a stock if they already had a long position.\nOnce the buying pressure waned, a small amount of selling compounded with other bearish factors discussed below were sufficient to trigger large waves of selling.\n# Options market makers selling hedged stocks for sold calls\nOptions market makers are institutions contracted by an exchange to supply liquidity to the options market, even when there's no willing external buyer or seller. Market makers make money by buying or selling options to traders at slightly worse prices than the actual price, and pocketing the difference. As such, they aren't interested in making a directional bet on a stock's price by being short or long options and whenever you sell or buy an option from them, they need to hedge their position.\nSpecifically, when a market maker sells a call option to a trader, the market maker needs to hedge by buying the underlying stock. When a market maker buys a call option from a trader, the market maker shorts the underlying stock. Vice versa for puts.\nPLTR had a large number of open call positions expiring at year-end. As price fell, most of these options expired worthless and the market makers that sold them had to unwind their hedges. Because market makers buy the underlying stock to hedge against a sold call position, they sell said stock when unwinding the hedge. As large numbers of PLTR's call options expired worthless at year-end, options market makers sold the PLTR they bought as a hedge which contributed to the year-end price decline.\n# Institutional funds rebalancing\nEven though retail investors own most of Palantir's tradeable shares, institutions do own a non-trivial amount (12% of the float, according to finviz.com) that were mostly acquired during the IPO. These institutions include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Soros Fund Management. Funds have a target ownership percentage for each portfolio stock and when its price increases or decreases dramatically in a short period, the fund needs to rebalance by selling or buying said stock. Rebalancing happens either at a fixed time period or when an imbalance threshold is crossed. Because PLTR's price appreciated so rapidly in just a couple months, it probably fell victim to year-end institutional rebalancing.\n# Frontrunning profit-taking in 2021\nBecause PLTR's price increased so rapidly in 2020, traders are expected to sell in 2021 to defer taxes for one year. It's likely that some traders attempted to get ahead of this expectation by selling a few days before December 30th (trades executed on and after this date settle in 2021). PLTR's price started to fall off a cliff on December 28th and it kept falling until the year's last trading day on December 31st. As such, the selling on the 28th and 29th is partially attributed to traders frontrunning new-year-profit-taking while the selling on the 30th and 31st is new-year-profit-taking.\n# Frontrunning the 2021 lock-up period expiry\nPalantir's IPO was a direct listing meaning that it only made existing shares sellable on the market. No new shares were created and sold. This means that insiders (founders, employees, and VCs) own most of Palantir's shares. During the IPO, these insiders could only sell 20% of their holdings and the other 80% are locked up until after 2021's first earnings report. Unsurprisingly, traders expect more selling than usual when these shares unlock since 80% is a lot of shares. Long time PLTR holders will want to divest at least some of their holdings. It's plausible that, like new-year-profit-taking, traders are selling early to get ahead of the lock-up period ending.\n# Price chart sell signals\nTechnical analysis (using price charts to determine when to buy or sell) is controversial but still popularly used to predict short term price movements. PLTR's chart displayed several sell signals ever since it peaked at $33. For one, the chart has a giant double top with rejections at $33 and $31 on November 27th and December 8th respectively. A double top is a very popular sell signal. Bullish momentum and volume has also waned since the price peak with daily MACD (a technical indicator) becoming bearish on December 10th. Falling momentum is no bueno for a stock driven by momentum.\nYou can find more of my stock market analyses in the [FinanceTLDR blog](https://www.financetldr.com).", "id": "kpkd97", "created_utc": 1609679388.0, "score": 255, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "So buy more PLTR, got it chief", "score": 378, "replies": [{"body": "Scrolled past OP to first comment.

Naturally, I searched for Gamestop Software Engineering jobs. The results are pretty lackluster and have me a little worried.\n\nNot only are there very few job postings, but the postings available have shit job titles and shit job descriptions, requiring experience with dated technology.
