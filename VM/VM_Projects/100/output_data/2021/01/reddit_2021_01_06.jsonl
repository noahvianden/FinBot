No one could've predicted that Amazon would have grown into a true technological giant and software firm that even makes their own flavor of Linux. I mean people knew Amazon was definitely here to stay around that time, that should've been the real indicator that \"now is the time to definitely hop on board\".

Of course today that $1000 turns into nearly $20,000. You don't pick one company with the hope of making it big on that one.

If you saw the company and saw the success it was having in hindsight it was a no brainer to put SOME money in the company. $1000 put into Tesla which was just cash laying around would have been 20 or so shares worth $14,000 today.

Then it is down to execution. If the company has excellent management then they will most likely execute.
