Aperio Group LLC boosted its position in shares of The Macerich by 48.8% in the third quarter. Aperio Group LLC now owns 407,430 shares of the real estate investment trust's stock valued at $2,766,000 after acquiring an additional 133,601 shares during the period.

Institutional investors own 83.77% of the company's stock.\n\nThe top institutional shareholder in the company is Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan Board with over 24.56 million shares valued at $166.78 million. The investor\u2019s holdings represent 16.43% of the MAC Shares outstanding. As of Sep 29, 2020, the second largest holder is Blackrock Inc. with 18.09 million shares valued at $122.8 million to account for 12.10% of the shares outstanding. The other top investors are Vanguard Group, Inc. (The) which holds 16.27 million shares representing 10.88% and valued at over $110.44 million, while State Street Corporation holds 4.77% of the shares totaling 7.13 million with a market value of $48.4 million.\n\nThe biggest takeaway for me is Blackrock ownership - BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with $7.81 trillion in assets under management as of end-Q4 2020 - these guys know value. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know who $MAC is:\n\nMacerich is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, which focuses on the acquisition, leasing, management, development and redevelopment of regional malls throughout the United States. Macerich currently owns 51 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 47 regional shopping centers.  Macerich owns some of the nation\u2019s highest-earning malls, including Tysons Corner Center in Northern Virginia.\n\nhttps://wamu.org/story/20/12/18/despite-the-pandemic-and-popularity-of-online-retail-shoppers-are-still-flocking-to-tysons-mall/\n\n$MAC is an owner of a multitude of well-positioned, high-end shopping centers. \n\nWe aren\u2019t talking about your local mall that is half vacant and has been for years, their properties are high-end, destination attractions:\n\nhttps://www.macerich.com/Leasing/Find \n\nThe low interest rates benefit REIT\u2019s and allow $MAC to do deals like this:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inquirer.com/real-estate/commercial/preit-macerich-fashion-district-control-bankruptcy-gallery-20201217.html%3foutputType=amp\n\nI know what you are thinking, malls are closed, no one is going to bricks and mortar, but as you saw above at Tyson\u2019s Corner, people are out and shopping. \n\nPent up demand + stimulus = profits.  \n\nAs of October 7th all 47 of the Company's major retail properties nationwide were fully open for business, now that LA County has approved indoor mall reopenings. \n\nIn LA as of 12/27:\n\nhttp://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/protocols/Reopening_ShoppingCenters.pdf\n\nREIT\u2019s - Real Estate Investment Trusts - some of the most beaten down stocks by the pandemic and this one, I believe has significant upside from its current price level.\n\nWhat I like about $MAC is this:\n\nRent collections continued to improve, with collection rates increasing to approximately 81% in October of 2020 and 80% in the third quarter of 2020, up from approximately 61% in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nMall portfolio occupancy, including closed centers, was 90.8% at September 30, 2020, compared to 91.3% at June 30, 2020.   \n\nMall tenant annual sales per square foot for the portfolio was $718 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $800 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. This sales metric excludes the period of COVID-19 closure for each tenant.\n\nAverage rent per square foot increased 1.8% to $62.29 at September 30, 2020, compared to $61.16 at September 30, 2019.\n\nApproximately 93% of the square footage that was open prior to COVID-19 is now open and operating. \n\nCash receipts continued to improve, increasing to approximately 80% in the third quarter of 2020 from approximately 61% in the second quarter of 2020. \n\nAs of November 2, 2020, the Company has collected approximately 81% of rent for October. \n\nWith continued improvement in operating cash flow, liquidity also continued to improve. \n\nCash and cash equivalents increased from $573 million at June 30, 2020 to $630 million as of September 30, 2020.\n\nBottom line, this company is getting healthier and owns prime real-estate, with stimulus and vaccines upon us - the animal spirits are ready to be unleashed. \n\nWhat I like THE MOST above the value is the potential short squeeze that is coming (re: $GME and dare I say $TSLA). \n\nShort Interest (Shares Short)\n80,670,000\n\nShort Interest Ratio (Days To Cover)\n14.7\n\nShort Percent of Float\n58.46 %\n\nShares Float\n137,990,000\n\nLastly, I put this together for everyone that has said I\u2019m just a \u201csteel pumper\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m anything but. \n\nI believe Tech has had its year in 2020. \n\n2021 will be the year of finding value with all of the current stretched valuations. \n\nCommodities, travel, shopping, real estate - they will all benefit from a weakened dollar, vaccines, stimulus and low interest/borrowing rates. \n\nGood luck and do your own research.", "id": "kqov54", "created_utc": 1609815364.0, "score": 346, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Can\u2019t do it.

This tells me he's drinking his own cool-aid.\n\n2) At the same time I discover that $MAC had a 60% short interest which now is reportedly 70%, as of today, per seeking alpha.\n\n3) These guys do Class A malls (the nice ones) and if the pandemic couldn't kill them, what's the chance they die now?\n\n4) I have to imagine that most people are dying to get out of the house and go back to malls to shop. California just  announced re-openings today. Class A mall REITS seem like a great re-opening trade to me. It's the easiest way to indulge since travel is still difficult.\n\n5) Based on my research, Fair Value is about $34 per share, so it's trading at half that. A few years back, Simon Properties $SPG tried to take them over for $90 per shave. That tells me $MAC is surely worth a lot more than $17... the number crunchers at Simon can't be that far off? Can they?\n\nSome quotes from the CEO from last quarters call (Q3):\n\n\u201cBy October, for centers opened at least 8 weeks, sales were up to 90% of pre-COVID levels\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have significant liquidity and currently have approximately $675 million of cash on the balance sheet.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking at traffic, in general, it\u2019s running about 80% compared to a year ago. Some of that has to do with capacity limits, particularly for restaurants and also for having no seating in the food court. Sales, on the other hand, are running on average 90% of a year ago, which means there, I\u2019d say, higher capture rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing I would point out is, given the current cash flow, even though it\u2019s less than had been forecasted at the beginning of the year, it\u2019s significantly in excess of the current dividend level and that ought to allow us a fair amount of cash flow from operations to use in the near-term for de-levering, and that would be the play.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking at the balance of 2020, the pandemic has shown that good retail is not going away, especially in A quality centers. Digitally native brands appreciate, more than ever, the profitability of their physical stores. Big format retailers got active again in the third quarter and you\u2019ll hear some of the specifics from Doug. Although we are still in the midst of COVID, our centers are operating at 90% capacity, sales levels of 90% pre-COVID. And even if you look at one of the more challenging categories, restaurants, in our portfolio, we have 247 restaurants and 94% of those are open today.\u201d\n\n6) Even after this whole mess of a pandemic. $MAC is still cash flow positive and paying a dividend of $0.15/share per quarter.\n\nThis does not sound like a business that is dying... Can someone tell me what I am missing? Why is there a 70% short interest in the stock?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

{"title": "Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news (Jan 5, 2021 after market close)", "selftext": "* The market opened slightly red but quickly reversed because JPow realized this was no way to start a New Year, with Chadsdaq and S&P being propelled to green status thanks to Tim Apple and gang. DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* Many underlying in the Chinese ADR/ADS sector also gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng while TCEHY closed the day up 5.23% to $76.66.\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping the NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings later this Thursday after market close.\n\n* GM popped 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, and while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, ~~M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings.~~ FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, ~~M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95~~.\n\n* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.\n\n* Affirm, the online installment loan lender for Americans who can't fucking afford whatever they're buying, is planning to IPO by offering 24 mil shares at $33 to $38 per share. With a market value of $9 bil, AFRM is sure to be a new meme stock in the coming days.\n\n* The DOW closed up 167 pts to 0.55%, Nasdaq up 120 pts to 0.95%, S&P up 26 pts to 0.71%, and RUT closed up 33 pts to 1.71%. Notable numbers tomorrow: ADP employment report at 8:15 AM ET, factory orders at 10 AM ET, EIA draw at 10:30 AM, and FOMC minutes at 2PM ET. \n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/)).", "id": "kr7ze8", "created_utc": 1609881296.0, "score": 3256, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "Upvote for daily recap", "score": 944, "replies": [{"body": "Hell yea.", "score": 38, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2433832436800003}, {"body": "Sign me up", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16922888159751892}, {"body": "Fuck yea", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20101363956928253}, {"body": "My upvote was number 420 so that's like at least two joints.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "ya fatha urinated in ya mothas ass", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Duh, that's how babies are made, afgoot", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28583627939224243}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17205968499183655}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25448837876319885}, {"body": "Absolutely!!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12611141800880432}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26579639315605164}, {"body": "Use Affirm loans to buy AFRM stock", "score": 157, "replies": [{"body": "You've cracked the fucking code!", "score": 79, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.016668008640408516}, {"body": "Literally can't go tits up", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.08320896327495575}, {"body": "The stock will go up if you can\u2019t pay the loan and you will be able to pay the loan.
