{"title": "Can WSB write history?", "selftext": "I used to think WSB was exactly what they describe themselves as: retards at a casino. \n\nWhile that still may be true, there might be some brilliance to their madness.\n\nTraditionally, valuations follow fundamentals. That's what we've all been taught: P/E, DCFs, revenue/earnings growth and multiples. \n\nTSLA completely shattered this reality. A promise of a company that could transform an industry led to retail investors piling up shares and increasing valuations past any sense of normalcy. \n\nWhile we can say that \"eventually all bubbles pop\" it doesn't really matter anymore. TSLA used this irrational market to raise $12B in CASH. That's enough to guide it through whatever obstacles it meets. With this war chest (and its retail investors \"buying the dip\") it's much clearer to see TSLA come out the winner of the EV/autopilot revolution and justify its $800B valuation. (There's a whole other argument to be made about top talent wanting to work in a company that will make you a millionaire thanks to stock options). \n\nIn essence, fundamentals for Tesla are being built around its valuation. \n\nThe recent GME hysteria seems ridiculous, but it could end up being a similar situation. While this week's movements is a game of liquidity between longs and shorts with a limited float, GME could end up being a leader in the gaming industry simply because of the amount of cash it will undoubtedly end up raising at these valuations.\n\nWe've all heard that \"the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\", but that was said in a world when access to capital was more limited and a lack of technology only allowed linear growth. \n\nI'm slowly being convinced that due to technological exponential growth and access to capital, (many cases, not all cases of) irrational valuations will more quickly be caught up by fundamentals than they're caught up by a lack of support. That's especially true with stocks that generate emotional decisions such as TSLA.\n\nSo, is it different this time?

I'm Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan here. For the next company at the tech forum, we have the pleasure of hosting BlackBerry. BlackBerry has transformed from a smartphone manufacturer to a leading security-focused enterprise software and services provider. The BlackBerry\u2019s portfolio competes in a number of interesting markets, including cyber security, automotive software and critical event management.\n\nToday, we will be focusing more on BlackBerry's automotive software, which is QNX. It is my pleasure to introduce Steve Rai, BlackBerry's Chief Financial Officer; and John Wall, BlackBerry's Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions. And thank you both, Steve and John for attending and participating in this conference. Look forward to an interesting discussion.\n\nI will probably just start you off here, Steve, in a sense,* we- before we dive into Q&A for the benefit of investors, reengaging with the BlackBerry story, who probably know BlackBerry from a smartphone days more, can we just start with a high-level overview of the business today?\n\nSteve Rai\n\nSure.* Thank you, and pleased to be here today. So, while we don't build phones anymore, we absolutely continue to leverage the strong software and security heritage of the company. Our trusted software platform, which we call Spark, can connect, secure and manage every endpoint in the IoT landscape.\n\nSo, it leverages next-gen threat protection, intelligent security, and provides a single pane of glass to manage the environment. Further, through AI and machine learning, it continues to get smarter and provides excellent return on investment. So, this area represents a $38 billion and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond securing enterprises, our solutions also enable critical infrastructure such as securing utilities, automotive safety through QNX, which as John will speak to, and securing people through our AtHoc critical event management solution.\n\nWe've got deep credentials which have been hardened in the regulated space. At nearly all of the G20 governments and top 10 global banks as well as the top 9 automotive OEMs, we've got them as customers. Our solutions are equally applicable and provide significant value to enterprises of all sizes.\n\nSo, I believe all this and the strong financial position of the company, of course, sets us up very well to serve the markets that we\u2019re in*. And it plays right into the macro trends that we're seeing, including an ever-increasing mobile and work-from-anywhere workforce, rapid IoT proliferation, and an ever-increasing threat landscape, which, of course, the unprecedented cyberattacks of 2020 underscore, and the evolution of vehicles and smart city infrastructure that John Wall will speak to.\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nQ - Samik Chatterjee\n\nSo, before I kind of move on to some of the other markets, let's kind of hit on QNX and the inbuilt software offering here. For those who are less familiar with QNX, John, maybe if you can kind of explain what it does, that would be helpful?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely, I'd love to. So, QNX has two, what I would call, foundational products. One is the real-time operating system called Neutrino, and the other is our hypervisor that provides virtualization of CPUs. Both are microkernel-based. These are deeply embedded products that are particularly suited to safety critical applications.\n\nWe've been able to reach the highest level of certifications for both those foundational products in the automotive field, medical and industrial. We've achieved ISO 26262 ASIL D and we've achieved 61508 ASIL C and -- ASIL 3, sorry, which is the highest level of safety. And that means that our products are designed for mission-critical. In automotive, in particular, that means our products are designed for things that control steering, braking, anything that controls the vehicle.\n\nSo, examples of this within automotive is obviously ADAS, which is active safety, digital cockpit, which is a new trend where we are seeing the consolidation of infotainment systems and other in-cabin functions such as digital cockpits, get consolidated to one hardware module and using our virtualization to separate safety and non-safety systems, the infotainment being non-safety. But also in other markets such as MRI scanners for medical, medical robotics, nuclear power plants, oil and gas. So, if you've ever seen a wind turbine on your travels across various parts of the world, more than likely QNX is running in those systems to control the pitch of the blade, which is very important for keeping the system stable. So, those are just a few examples.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. John, you did mention kind of the safety aspect becoming one of the key enablers here. Maybe if you can broadly hit on what are the overall trends in autos and kind of where and how are those impacting QNX's addressable market?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely. So, I mean, I think everybody is aware of the macro trends. We have connectivity. Cars are getting more connected. We have electrification and we have automation, so autonomous drive or levels towards autonomous drive. So, what we're seeing within a vehicle is software is starting to play a bigger and bigger role. There are some studies that say that by 2030, 50% of the vehicle's BOM will be electronics, and of that, 30% would be software.\n\nSo, what we're seeing as a trend is the car today is made up of a lot of what we call ECUs, and these are electronic control units. And these today are typically single function. So, you can think about it in terms of door locks is an ECU, my transmission controller is an ECU, my digital instrument cluster is an ECU, and so on and so on.\n\nSo, what we're starting to see within a car is a consolidation of these ECUs into what we call domain controllers. And domain controllers will handle multiple functions on one module. And these domain controllers are typically high-performance compute platforms. So, when you think of these, you think of Qualcomm, Samsung, NVIDIA, things that would run in your computer or things that would run in your smartphone. And this is a sweet spot for QNX, since the QNX products run on high-performance compute platforms, not on the lower end 8-bit and 16-bit single function ECUs.\n\nNow, as more of these systems migrate to these domain controllers, there's an element of safety that's required because these things are either controlling chassis, they're controlling functions within the vehicle. Outside of the infotainment, most of these modules have a safety function. So, this again is a sweet spot for QNX.\n\nWe saw this trend developing four or five years ago, maybe five* or six years ago. We saw that infotainment was moving more and more to Android, but we also saw that the car was moving towards this grouping of domain controllers. And we knew there would be an opportunity to get more in the vehicle, more software sockets within the vehicle. So, we really started focusing our efforts on safety and security knowing that as the car evolves, we have more opportunities within the vehicle to hit many more modules as opposed to just infotainment, for instance.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. You recently announced BlackBerry IVY, a co-development and co-marketing agreement with AWS. So, how is this different to what QNX is currently doing?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nActually, this is quite different from what QNX has been doing traditionally. So, we announced IVY, which is the intelligent vehicle everywhere. So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism.\n\nSo, essentially, what we've done here is we've looked at how do we make vehicles look common from an API perspective? How do we access vehicle data in a way that is consistent from car brand to car brand? This is a very tall order, because vehicles are still pretty bespoke as far as their electrical architectures. No two cars from different OEMs look exactly the same. They use different sensors. They have different architectural layouts.\n\nSo, the idea with IVY is to create a middleware, I would say, translator that goes into the vehicle. At the bottom end of IVY, we are talking directly to sensors within the vehicle. But then, we use either machine learning or other processing to normalize that data into what we call synthetic sensors.\n\nAnd as an example that I'd like to you look at is if you think of a smart city and you think of a smart city that wants to know the conditions of their roads during the winter, a synthetic sensor within a vehicle could be a combination of wheel, speed sensor, antilock brake sensor, temperature sensor and potential camera input. And with those four sensors, you could normalize the data into a synthetic sensor that would allow the smart city to know, do I have an icing condition? Do I have cars slipping in a certain part of my route?\n\nNow, imagine the power of this, if the way to access that data was consistent from carmaker to carmaker. So, the real power behind IVY is to make sure that we grow an ecosystem that allows scale and allows app developers to create common applications, smart cities to access common data across different car brands. And so, the idea here is to ensure that the carmakers have the best ability to monetize their data or to save money by being able to do things like analytics of how their cars are behaving on the road. The idea is to grow an ecosystem that will become a de facto standard in the industry.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nWhat is the level of commitment that it slightly* brings to this, particularly -- I mean, obviously, I'm guessing investors will be looking at what\u2019s the level of commitment of AWS to this?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nRight. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car. I mean, this is part of the reason that AWS is very interested in working with us.\n\nWe have a very good pedigree. We're in over 175 million cars. We've been doing this. This is our bread and butter as working within the vehicle. We have exceptional record of delivery. We've never held up a start-up production, and we have very, very strong relationships with the top automakers.\n\nNow, obviously, AWS is a leading cloud provider. They're an unrivaled provider of ML tools. So, they have a lot of the data expertise to do analysis of the data to create these synthetic sensors. And first and foremost, they're a massive company that has the ability to drive an app ecosystem.\n\nFrom a commitment perspective, it's -- as I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 development. This type of a relationship with Amazon is very rare. They do this with customers. They don't typically do this with partners. I think, we have a very, very strong alignment on the direction of IVY with the exact same goals, and that's to drive this ecosystem and to provide an app ecosystem within the vehicle and off the vehicle that is common across OEMs and brands. And I think that is really the thread that binds us.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIf I kind of think back almost like three, four years ago, I do kind of remember some start-up companies, private companies that were trying to harmonize the data across coming from different vehicles. So, are companies already doing this? Why would IVY be different on this front?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. That's a great question, and there are lots of companies doing this. This is -- we haven't invented anything new here. Carmakers are very interested in monetizing their data. They know there's a lot of value in their data, especially as the car continues to evolve towards autonomous drive and active safety, lots of sensors within the vehicle, one of the most complex IoT endpoints. So, they know there's a lot of value in their data.\n\nI think, the challenge has been, each carmaker is creating a bespoke solution, and there's really no scale to it. And since there is no scale or very little scale, it creates I think a challenge to really get application developers out there ideating on what the next big thing could be. I think, you'd like to be able to see the ability to leverage the ecosystem from the phone. Lots of people have great ideas out there. And I think the more people that have the ability to access this ecosystem, the more great ideas the carmakers will get.\n\nI think, the other challenge with some of the bigger players in this area has been ownership of the data. So, from -- right from the beginning, BlackBerry and Amazon have made it very clear. We have no desire to own the data and we have no desire to control the data. That's solely in the hands of the OEM. And that's really not an area that we're looking to get involved. The real purpose of this collaboration is to create that de facto ecosystem that will really get the ecosystem out there, developing ideas and applications that are going to be cool for the car.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSo, I have like almost 15 questions here, and since I have 15 minutes remaining, let me start tackling some of them. So, let me start with the ones that relate to IVY. A couple of similar ones. What do you think the TAM is that IVY will open up for carmakers? And on similar lines, there is a question which is -- give me one -- yes, when do you intend to provide tangible color around the commercial opportunity that IVY represents? So, I'll let you guys tackle those two together.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSteve, do you want to take that?\n\nSteve Rai\n\nYes, I'll start. So, the first vehicles to have IVY are expected to come out in 2023. So naturally, leading up to that time, we expect to be engaged with the OEMs and potentially with Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers working on this and generating professional services revenues along the way. We're targeting a subscription or usage-based model, in other words, building a recurring revenue stream. And so, that's sort of the time frame I think to address that part of the theme.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nTwo follow-up questions on IVY and more related to automakers. So, again, I'll just combine them for everyone's benefit here. Is BlackBerry QNX or IVY going to be in the new vehicles that NVIDIA and NIO will be working on together? The second question on similar lines is IVY something Tesla will consider?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. Those are great questions. Obviously, I think, everybody -- I think, most people know we have a very strong relationship with NVIDIA as we announced a few years ago that QNX is the foundational OS of their DRIVE OS offering. I don't know that we can make any comments at the moment about specific OEMs as we made the announcement on December 1st. What I can say is the reaction by OEMs to the announcement has been overwhelming. We've already had a workshop with one OEM prior to Christmas.\n\nSo, there is a lot of excitement about the ability to create this ecosystem. When people think about the ecosystem in the past, they've thought about, well, the carmakers are going to have to get together, they're going to have to create a kind of a unified architecture for the vehicles to be able to create this ecosystem. Try to think of it kind of in terms of iOS or Android -- not iOS or Android, but something like that, but that's appropriate to the automobile. This is kind of really taking -- this is really looking to take a shortcut and really create that app ecosystem before the car makers have had the ability to necessarily unify their architectures.\n\nTo the point of Tesla, Tesla could definitely be a customer of this.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nOkay. Is it possible to implement back into the captive market of 175 million QNX current users? So, I'm guessing they are -- it's asking about IVY. So, is it -- yes, so is it possible to implement IVY back into the captive market of QNX users?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely. I mean that\u2019s -- in a lot of cases, that's the intent. There are very few carmakers that we are not working with, especially today when we look at our move towards more of safety software within more modules within the vehicle, especially when it comes to ADAS, autonomous drive, chassis control, digital cockpit. We're very dominant in the digital cockpit market. So, I believe that, that's obviously going to be the case, but I also think it's going to open up new customers. And I mean, that's a very strong reason why we made this OS independent and cloud agnostic is we wanted to address our current customers, but we also wanted to address carmakers that are not our customers that are running different operating systems or have different architectures or have different cloud solutions. We wanted this to go to our existing customers and to open up new customers.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. A ton of new questions on QNX, but before I get to that, one question that came in is the patents for sale, which kind of coincides with a news release, I think I saw saying that BlackBerry\u2019s selling to 90 patents to Huawei. And I'll just give you an opportunity to answer that question as well as comment in terms of anything that's been announced recently.\n\nSteve Rai\n\nSo, if that question is referring to what has been in the press in terms of some of the broader rumors about the portfolio, I'm not going to comment on those rumors. Regarding Huawei, there was a very small number of patents that are no longer relevant to the business. So, small sale, not part of our recurring transaction. And certainly, it was permitted under the applicable rules. So that's it.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSo, moving to QNX, let me take this one. Could you outline the content per vehicle opportunity for QNX on an EV and separately on AV? And if you don't want to give dollar per car, could you suggest the number of QNX RTOS, I apologize, I don't know the acronym and hypervisor installs for EV and AV versus internal combustion engine vehicles. So, essentially, I think, in a nutshell content for vehicle for QNX on EV and AV separately?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. I don't know that I really look at them all that separately. One has a battery manager, one has an engine controller. I think -- so I'll try to answer it more generally speaking, and then I will make a comment to EVs. So, generally speaking, the ability for QNX to be used in more places within the vehicle is what drove our decision to focus on safety.\n\nTraditionally, if you look back at where QNX was playing in automotive 10 years ago, the opportunity was typically a telematics box, an OnStar or an infotainment unit. And at the time, we were very dominant in infotainment and in telematics. If you -- so you kind of add two potential sockets there that we were fighting for, and for the most reason, those were the most -- those were the two high-performance compute platforms with telematics box and the infotainment box. I think as we see this consolidation of ECU to domain controllers, the opportunity has gone up dramatically. You have domain controllers that are handling gateway. So, you have a gateway functionality within the vehicle, you can do that almost like a router, that's going to manage safety systems and non-safety systems within the vehicle, the different buses. You have chassis controllers, you have ADAS controllers, you autonomous drive controllers. You have the digital cockpit, which is probably the first consolidation that's been happening within the vehicle, where we're taking cabin functions such as digital instrument cluster and infotainment and merging that onto one high-performance compute platform, using our hypervisor.\n\nSo, I think, without actually throwing out numbers, as far as the dollar amount, from an opportunity within the vehicle, there is definitely going from 2 or 3 opportunities to 5 or 6 or 7 opportunities within the vehicle. To us with IVY is just one more, a different function.\n\nNow, having said that, from an EV perspective, I think we put a status during earnings before Christmas that I believe we're in 19 of 25 of the top EV producers and that we have a 61% market share of working with EV customers. And one of the reasons that EV is interesting is in a lot of cases, it's clean sheet. They're starting with new architectures, and they're able to move to these new domain controller type architectures more quickly.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIs Automotive Grade Linux a strong competitive threat? Who is the most significant competitive threat in terms of the auto ecosystem? And how is QNX superior to these over time?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nRight. So, I would say that we have two groupings of competitors. We have the traditional under-the-hood safety-based operating systems. And those are Green Hills and Wind River. Green Hills is very well-known in aerospace and defense, and so is Wind River. I think, we've been quite successful against those two.\n\nAnd then, on the other side of the spectrum coming more from consumer side and coming more from high-performance compute platform, you have Linux in all forms, whether it's AGL or Ubuntu or something else. It doesn't really matter.\n\nNow, the advantage that QNX has over Linux is that those Linux distributions are not safety certified. Safety certification is a lot of work. It's very hard to achieve. It's especially hard to achieve when you look at a product like Linux that -- part of the beauty of Linux as it moves very fast, and it's contributed to by the community. But that's also -- it's Achilles\u2019 heel when it comes to safety because safety requires due diligence around safety cases, design, knowing the providence of where the software came from, a lot of testing, a lot of impact analysis.\n\nSo I mean, our view is we take all the competition seriously. And we're just trying to continue to push our product forward to be better performance and a higher level of safety against all our competitors. And we believe that will help keep us in the lead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIn the couple of minutes we have remaining, let's take a couple of questions on IVY here. First question, and I\u2019ll again kind of club them together. How will the IVY app store ecosystem be monetized? And then, a second question, can you talk about the dollar investment and the time investment, how are you splitting that as it relates to development of IVY?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nI'll answer the second piece first. As I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 investment by both, Amazon and BlackBerry. It's a significant investment. But, we're not providing any numbers. But, there is a significant investment in doing this.\n\nAs far as monetizing from the OEMs and the app store and how that's going to look, we're just starting to have those conversations with the OEMs. I don't know that we have a clear picture on this. Based on the discussions we've had with the OEMS, we know there's a lot of value there. And the idea of providing a more comprehensive and more standardized SDK and API across car brands is only going to make that more valuable. But, we haven't gotten into all the nuts and bolts of what this is going to look like, except that we know that the OEM is going to control the data, and it's going to control the access to the data.\n\n**Samik Chatterjee\n**\nOkay. Last one, let me squeeze this one in. Where do you see the biggest catalyst for your loyal shareholders?\n\n**Steve Rai\n**\nWell, I think, the trends that I spoke to in my opening comments are really what position -- all of the Company's technology, the way that it's come together and the drivers that we have play in very directly to these trends, and the trends being proliferation of IoT, security, all of the concepts that John described in the auto sector as well as the general embedded space. And those are things that the Company is just ideally suited for in terms of the expertise and the solutions that we have.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGreat. That's all we have time for. Steve and John, thank you both for taking the time to attend the conference. And it was a pleasure hosting you and great discussion. Thank you.\n\nSteve Rai\n\nThank you, Samik.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80\n\ud83d\ude80", "id": "l3nxjh", "created_utc": 1611446516.0, "score": 644, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "bro everyone in here has attention deficit and you just wrote a 1000 pages novel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nplease give me a tldr with some emojis or somthing", "score": 347, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 125, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.504397988319397}, {"body": "Somebody create a calculator that converts text into emojis", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33899563550949097}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4223306179046631}, {"body": "Tldr: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02\ud83d\udc02", "score": 43, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.504397988319397}, {"body": "He didnt write it dumbass it was a transcript", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "A transcript lacking a TL;DR or emojis.\n\nI only react to colourful emojis, especially rockets.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32173898816108704}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2699998617172241}, {"body": "!emojify", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3330194056034088}, {"body": "$APPS", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08597467839717865}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10899438709020615}, {"body": "Can you chill out you retard I can't read", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "Omfg.

{"title": "GME - Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick", "selftext": "Alright my fellow mouthbreathers (for real breathe through your nose) -  I want to round out a few thoughts I had while daydreaming about (edging to) Gamestop all day. Stay with me here - I'm drunk off shitty beer because I'm loaded to the fookin tits on GME and anyway I still drink like I'm in college, but I digress.\n\nThe actual points:\n\n1. Ryan Chewy has epitomized ol' Teddy's quote to a tee with single emoji tweets and even deleted some of the more erotic ones. I believe this is the ideal way for WSB to act as well, but as we are far past that with twitter and the talking heads on to us - this brings me to point 2.\n2. Gamestop has received an incredible amount of free advertising over the past few months - this will only continue with the squeeze and feels similar to the free advertising for Tesla by resident meme lord Elon. I took a look at google trends but it doesn't work like robinhood with the green and red and so I couldn't read if it's up or down (**If anyone is in marketing or some shit and has any good ideas for getting a rough value for impressions created in the past months please share**)\n3. Reversal of the negative GME stigma - I know we all got fucked out of our used games with shitty prices once upon a time and that kind of badwill is something a lot of bears bring up. With the amount of retail investors in gme, I think this has been more than counteracted by the good vibes of riding a rocket to the moon and taking out the big bad hedgies. I've personally converted at least my family from buying gaming shit from big box stores by getting them a pro membership and showing how they will undoubtably save money. **This will 10x with RC's focus on the customer's experience over all else.**\n\nTLDR: Bears going extinct, GME to continue up bigly, we should all calm the fuck down and wait patiently for RC to use that big stick of his and act like we've been here before.\n\nEdit: One last thought, I keep seeing people talk about current price and what if big guys get out etc. and I was definitely worried about this for a while when gme was hovering around 20. I read something though and am now more confident at 60 than I was then - This long/short battle feels like a zero-sum game and investors love The Art of War, Meditations, etc. - Essentially this is war and the big guys feel they have other guys bent over a barrel in addition to what I believe is a good-to-great growth turnaround story and chance by RC and crew", "id": "l3ore9", "created_utc": 1611449259.0, "score": 549, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "I wager that massive +70% spike reported all over the press brings a few fresh shorts to exploit.\n\nNext report on %shorts and holdings comes at the end of this week.

{"title": "Positive Steel News - MT, CLF, VALE, etc.", "selftext": "So I'm on the steel train and these past couple of weeks have sucked, but a bunch of news came out today regarding the increases in steel and iron prices and how that's impacting the market. This news may give us a peek into the kind of shit we might see when the steel players we follow start reporting from next week into February. Sharing this here as a lot of the steel info exists on another subreddit now. So this is for any of the stragglers still here.  In recent days (not covered in this post) we saw [Tata Steel post awesome results](https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/tata-arm-show-hints-at-sunny-days-in-steel/cid/1803856) for one of their subsidiaries as well as Jindal Steel & Power report a 29% increase in revenue along with their [highest ever steel production volumes](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/jindal-steel-and-power-q3-results-posts-profit-of-rs-2432-crore-revenue-up-39-25/ar-BB1cXpps).\n\nOne of the biggest highlights in the news today for me was that **the world's fifth-largest steelmaker**, Posco, is estimated to have logged **double digit operating profit growth for the fourth quarter**. This is with them needing to absorb the iron ore costs. Remember that ArcelorMittal (MT), the world's largest steel manufacturer, doesn't experience this issue at the same magnitude (they provide 50% of their own iron ore). Nothing is certain, but that tells me to expect better than expected results from MT earnings that will surprise Wall Street.\n\nThe iron ore input cost angle continues to bolster the case for integrated players MT, Vale, CLF. As noted, they can widen their margins and even offer competitive pricing if they'd like due to providing a lot of their own raw materials.\n\nSomething that I'm mildly concerned about and watching is the push for steel price regulation which is happening in [India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-use-alternatives-nitin-gadkari-warns-steel-cartel-on-price-hike/articleshow/80428821.cms) and [Malaysia](https://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/165251/after-mco-prices-of-materials-have-gone-sky-high-complain-builders/). In New Delhi the road transport and highways minister is threatening to use synthetic and composite fiber bars in place of steel for roads and bridges. The argument being that steel industry is inflating prices despite mining their own iron ore and therefor don't have higher input costs. Curious to see how far that goes.\n\nMy positions: MT (Calls June $25-$35, Sept $24-$32 \\[added this week\\], Commons), VALE (March $21)\n\n\\---\n\n**Posco, the world's fifth-largest steelmaker by output, is expected to have logged double-digit operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.** [Link](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210124000086)\n\n>Posco is estimated to have posted an operating profit of 838.3 billion won ($760.1 million) in the fourth quarter, up 50.3 percent from a year earlier, according to a median forecast of market research firm FnGuide.  \n>  \n>The quarterly results reflect a quick recovery of steel demand amid short supplies in the United States and Europe and a hike in steel prices, analysts said.  \n>  \n>Posco's quarterly results also \"got a boost from increased demand for steel in China,\" Park Hyun-wook, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Investment & Securities Co., said in a research note.  \n>  \n>Looking ahead, Kim Hyun-wook, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp., said Posco could enjoy the effects of a price hike of its steel products, noting a spike in raw material costs could lead to an increase in Posco's steel prices.  \n>  \n>A spike in raw material costs can weigh on Posco, but the company can increase prices of its steel products amid strong demand, which could help improve the steelmakers' bottom line.\n\n**Tata Motors is passing on the cost of input costs to their customers placing orders past 1/21/21 calling out steel costs as a major reason. Demand for vehicles continue to rise.** [Link](https://www.drivespark.com/four-wheelers/2021/tata-cars-price-hike-announced-for-all-models-new-price-list-effective-date-details/articlecontent-pf134171-033441.html)\n\n>Steel, which is a major component in the process of automotive manufacturing, has increased substantially in pricing over the past few months in the country. This is because of the rising domestic demand and iron ore prices, higher international prices and subdued production and limited imports. As a result, it could be among the key factors for automakers announcing a price hike on its entire model range.  \n>  \n>Despite the current market conditions, Tata Motors has seen a significant increase in its demand for its passenger vehicle range. The sales of its cars grew by 39 per cent in the first three quarters of the current financial year as compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.\n\n**JSW Steel\u2019s net profit jumps** ***14 times*** **to Rs 2,669 crore backed by a strong recovery in steel demand for the three months of October-December** [Link](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/jsw-steel-s-net-profit-jumps-14-times-to-rs-2669-crore/ar-BB1d0CDZ)\n\n>\"Various high frequency economic indicators are better than the initial expectations pointing to a robust recovery. Growth in passenger vehicles and motorcycle sales, railway freight traffic, and electricity consumption is also strong,\" the company said in a statement.  \n>  \n>The company r**ecorded highest ever quarterly sales** of flat products, propelled by strong demand of coated products. Automotive steel sales increased by 57% y-o-y, while India's domestic automotive production grew by 16% y-o-y. Consequently, exports were much lower during the quarter. Overall value added and special products sales were up 12% y-o-y, making up 57% of overall sales versus 51% in Q2FY21. This was mainly driven by robust automotive sales and increased off-take from industrial and engineering, solar and appliances segment.\n\n**Port of Duluth-Superior saw December and January tonnage topping the previous season** ***significantly***\\*\\* [Link](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/other/pounded-by-the-pandemic-duluth-shipping-seeks-rebound-in-2021/ar-BB1d0Kdh)\n\n>The season \"will be remembered for early promise crushed by coronavirus, but the late-season rally was encouraging,\" said Jayson Hron, spokesman for the Duluth Seaway Port Authority. \"**December and January tonnage topped the previous season \u2014 significantly**, in January's case \u2014 and **with mines reopening, steel demand rising** and COVID vaccinations beginning, it hints at hope for 2021.\"\n\n**Malaysian contractors are asking the government to step in and try to regulate material pricing. Steel prices were called out among others.** [Link](https://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/165251/after-mco-prices-of-materials-have-gone-sky-high-complain-builders/)\n\n>Md Nasir Ibrahim, chairman of the Guild of Bumiputra Contractors Bhd, said that steel in particular had increased in price by nearly 40% in the last six weeks up to nearly RM3,000 a tonne.  \n>  \n>He urged the government to \u201cinterfere\u201d by controlling the prices of these products and penalising suppliers who take part in unethical price manipulation.  \n>  \n>This was echoed by the Master Builders Association of Malaysia, who said price increases are particularly damaging to smaller stakeholders, who may not have predicted the cost of adhering to Covid-19 standard operating procedures, like testing workers and operating with a limited workforce.  \n>  \n>\u201cThe government should implement strict control over prices of construction materials to prevent cartels and monopolies taking advantage of these,\u201d it said.  \n>  \n>It further suggested that it be made mandatory for a price variation clause to be included in all contracts to account for fluctuations in material costs.\n\n**US steel buyers continue to struggle to find materials.

Lack of supply is opening door for imports.** [Link](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3971961/Carbon-steel/US-hot-rolled-coil-index-edges-lower-tightness-continues.html)\n\n>Sources reported that there was still a shortage of spot material, with some distributors and consumers able to purchase only a fraction of the material they need. The surge in prices and lack of supply are opening the door for imports, some respondents said.  \n>  \n>Split between those projecting that the rally is coming to an end and others expecting prices to climb further. Respondents who think the rally has run its course pointed to weakness in the ferrous scrap market and a decline in Chinese flat-rolled prices. Sources who anticipate additional price increases were focused on tight supply, and did not see any indications that the situation will change during the first quarter.\n\n**China iron ore edges higher on supply concerns.

{"title": "PLTR vs Child Rapists, Starvation, Hurricanes, Ukranian Mafia, and $CRM (DD from an Early Palantir Engineer)", "selftext": "I joined Palantir in early 2007, back when it was a penny stock (I paid $0.011/share for my initial stock options). As one of the first 50 employees, I wrote code for the core product, then transitioned into a Forward Deployed Engineer role, and ultimately led Palantir\u2019s Philanthropy Engineering Team. \n\nI came to WSB for the fucking hilarious Palantir memes, but I stayed for the education and DDs. I\u2019m on the tendies train with GME and BB, so I figured I\u2019d give back to the sub with a DD on PLTR in advance of Demo Day. \n\nImportant caveat for the mods and alphabet regulators reading this: I left Palantir in 2015 to co-found Ada Diamonds. I no longer have any insider knowledge about Palantir. All I am sharing in this DD is publicly available information with links to my sources, as well as my personal strategy for the Palantir shares I own free and clear.  Neither Foundry nor Apollo were launched when I was employed at Palantir, so I am excited to see the demos of both, as well as how far Gotham has come in the last 6 years.\n\nLots of words below, so here\u2019s the TL;DR for those of you that can\u2019t read good: By 2030, I believe that PLTR could have a $250 billion market cap. I\u2019ve yet to sell all of my 20% that is unlocked and am largely diamond hands-ing my soon-to-be unlocked 80% until PLTR is past Mars and approaching the asteroid belt. \n\nWhy am I so bullish? I view Palantir as the kid-brother of Salesforce (more on this thesis below), and I think PLTR is just fueling up. If Palantir continues to execute well in the decade ahead, I believe they will capture enough market share to grow like Salesforce has in the last 8 years:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aubihrloscd61.jpg?width=635&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2f897fda6f7c75a8a315dab02aaa4909b40dd6e\n\nTL;DR of the TL;DR - (lots of rocket emojis and some Mars emojis)\n\nPositions or ban:\n\n* More than enough PLTR shares to cover Cathie\u2019s latest purchase\n* r/smallstreetbets on GME and BB (shares)\n* A boomer portfolio of low risk bonds\n\nIt\u2019s also worth flagging that many other early employees are in the same boat (rocketship) as me. Unlike alumni of some of the quick to IPO companies, we\u2019ve been responsibly diversifying for over a decade in the private markets. In addition to private market sales, Palantir did multiple internal liquidity events where employees could sell 10% of their holdings to a large Palantir investor as part of oversubscribed fundraising rounds.\n\nThus, it\u2019s not a question of what I am doing with my remaining 80%, but instead a question of what I am doing with my remaining \\~35%. I\u2019ve used pre-IPO PLTR tendies to buy a nice house, 1,635hp of cars, nice vacations with friends, etc. So, I\u2019m diamond hands-ing my remaining PLTR stock with a decade long diversification plan, as I believe PLTR will far outperform the market, just like CRM, TSLA, and the FAANGs have done in the last decade.\n\nAlso, most of the bears I know from Palantir (including those that quit, got fired, pushed out, or flamed out) long ago sold most/all of their shares. The alumni I keep in touch with are collectively long-term bullish as well.  \n\nI\u2019m going to break this DD down into a few sections:\n\n1. What is Palantir\n2. Examples of Palantir in Action\n3. Why CRM is the closest comp to PLTR\n4. The Under Discussed \u2018Secret Sauce\u2019 of Palantir\n5. What I\u2019m looking for during Demo Day\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**What is Palantir?**\n\nPalantir is one of two things:\n\n1. The best product on the market to help organizations make better decisions\n2. The best product on the market to help organizations find, fix, and finish/prosecute malicious actors & dark networks.\n\nYou can add as many buzz words as you want on top- SaaS, AI, big data, operating system for data, UBL, deviant philosopher, cloud, Skynet, link analysis, off-road rollerblades, GIS, ML, terrorist hunting, multi-level security, etc.- but at the end of the day, large organizations pay 8 to 10 figures for Palantir because Palantir is the best product available to help them: A) make better decisions and/or B) find bad guys.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Examples of Palantir in action- #1** **World Food Program (WFP)**\n\nThe WFP delivers 15 billion meals per year in 80 countries around the world. WFP uses Palantir\u2019s Foundry to bring together data sources from across the organization, enabling staff to access and analyze programmatic and operational data in a secure, unified environment to make better decisions.\n\nThe sheer scale of WFP\u2019s operations, assisting some 90 million people in about 80 countries, means that even small efficiencies in operational and supply chain management can lead to dramatic savings. WFP generates vast amounts of data through the purchasing of 3 million metric tons of food every year and the delivery of 15 billion rations across dozens of development projects worldwide. \n\nMaking this data accessible across the organization helps WFP become even more efficient in multiple programme areas, including cash-based transfers, supply chain optimization, and nutritional requirements.\n\nThe WFP literally won the 2020 Nobel Prize for their incredible work to help those in need, powered by Foundry.\n\nSources: \n\n* [https://www.wfp.org/news/palantir-and-wfp-partner-help-transform-global-humanitarian-delivery](https://www.wfp.org/news/palantir-and-wfp-partner-help-transform-global-humanitarian-delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-and-the-world-food-programme-9d8b418dd94b](https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-and-the-world-food-programme-9d8b418dd94b)\n* [https://www.wfp.org/stories/world-food-programme-chief-lauds-front-line-staff-and-partners-after-nobel-peace-prize-win](https://www.wfp.org/stories/world-food-programme-chief-lauds-front-line-staff-and-partners-after-nobel-peace-prize-win)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#2 - National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)**\n\nNCMEC is a non-profit that leads the fight against the sexual exploitation of minors, as well as a few other garish responsibilities, such as the solving of cold cases of murdered children.\n\nNCMEC is congressionally mandated to securely hold evidence of crimes against children (aka child porn), and works closely with law enforcement bodies around the world (Interpol, FBI, etc) to find, arrest, and prosecute the producers and distributors of heinous material.\n\nNCMEC has been using Palantir since 2010 to ingest evidence, find clues in the evidence, and connect the dots to find the perpetrators. In 2019, NCMEC received 16.9 million images/videos of exploited children, and COVID has caused an exponential increase in online exploitation of minors.\n\nOf all the work I did in my 8.5 years at Palantir, this was my most important work. I can\u2019t get into details of sources and methods (for obvious reasons) but I can say with absolute certainty that many truly evil perpetrators of crimes against children are behind bars thanks to the power of Palantir\u2019s products in the hands of NCMEC analysts. Without the power of Palantir\u2019s products, many of these pedophiles would still be abusing children today. \n\nThere\u2019s an important part to the DD to understand here - Palantir is entrusted with the most sensitive data in the world by some of the most important and high functioning organizations in the world. It takes decades to develop the technology and trust required to provide audit logging and access control sufficient to handle this type of data, and that is a huge moat of Palantir.\n\nSources:\n\n* [https://medium.com/palantir/fighting-child-exploitation-with-big-data-86868bad559e](https://medium.com/palantir/fighting-child-exploitation-with-big-data-86868bad559e)\n* [https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/us/child-abuse-online-coronavirus-pandemic-parents-investigations-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/us/child-abuse-online-coronavirus-pandemic-parents-investigations-trnd/index.html)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#3 - Hurricane Sandy** \n\nWhen Superstorm Sandy ravaged New York, all communications methods (phone, internet, cell towers, etc) went down in large areas. As a result, information was scarce, and the response was disorganized, chaotic, and ineffective. \n\nIn less than a week, my team (the Philanthropy Engineering Team) built and deployed a brand new satellite-based system to manage response efforts by hacking and deploying simple Garmin satellite communicators that are used by hikers and sailors. \n\nIn partnership with Team Rubicon, a kick ass non-profit group of military veterans that respond to natural disasters, we used these devices to support some of the hardest hit communities.\n\nHere\u2019s Bill Clinton and me talking about the project:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0yCcTRSa4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0yCcTRSa4)\n\nTeam Rubicon is a data-driven organization, utilizing Palantir extensively to collect, catalog, and analyze information during operations and inform the rest of Team Rubicon\u2019s support functions. Palantir Operators train members on Structure and Damage Assessments using the Palantir Mobile application as well as provide crucial situational awareness information for Command and General Staffs and government Emergency Managers during approved Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance Programs. \n\n[https://teamrubiconusa.org/blog/remote-support-a-crucial-part-of-tr-operations/](https://teamrubiconusa.org/blog/remote-support-a-crucial-part-of-tr-operations/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#4 -Disrupting Ukranian Mafia from Laundering Body Parts**\n\nOne of the areas I supported in my time at Palantir was data-driven investigative journalism. Here\u2019s a demo of Gotham being used by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to integrate and analyze dozens of data sources to expose a criminal enterprise that was stealing dead bodies, laundering the bodies without the required testing for diseases, and selling human tissue for a profit. \n\nNote that this demo of Gotham is 8 years old, so you might be interested to compare this to Demo Day to see how far Gotham has come:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLyWXGaaMYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLyWXGaaMYA)\n\nHere\u2019s the results of the investigation: Safer knee surgeries, skin grafts, etc.\n\n[https://www.icij.org/investigations/tissue/our-blog/](https://www.icij.org/investigations/tissue/our-blog/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#5 - United Airlines & Airbus**\n\nThis work started after I left Palantir, but I want to mention it as it touches on the network effects of Palantir, and it highlights the core utility of Palantir\u2019s products: improving high-stakes decision making.\n\nPalantir & Airbus\u2019 Skywise breaks down traditional data silos by bringing together an airline's operational, maintenance, and aircraft data with data provided by Airbus. Now, airlines can use massive-scale sensor data, maintenance systems, aircraft schedules, passenger bookings, and more in one environment. On top of this data asset, Skywise offers a diverse analytical suite for operators to make sense of that data in both code-free and code-based environments.\n\n[https://www.palantir.com/solutions/skywise/](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/skywise/)\n\n\u201cDeployed on United\u2019s instance of Palantir Foundry, these models aim to minimize discounted cash flows spent on maintenance activities and maximize operational flexibility in the face of air travel demand uncertainty. The aircraft storage optimization recommends the best storage states (parked vs. active vs. prolonged) and locations (internal & external) for nearly 800 mainline aircraft. The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they\u2019re airworthy when we need them. Since we don\u2019t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between, then produce a single, discrete solution that considers all likely scenarios. In practice, this means the models help create plans to execute specific maintenance activities over the next several years; it also means when our Network Planning team unexpectedly asks for N planes by a certain date, the models help decide exactly which planes we should provide.\"\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Why CRM is the closest comparable to PLTR**\n\nInstinctually, people compare Palantir to the traditional consultancies and system integrators: Booz, Boeing, Raytheon, Accenture, etc. \n\nYes, Palantir is currently competing with those types of organizations for various contracts, but Palantir is fundamentally different than those entities, as Palantir is a \\*product\\* company leveraging repurposable platforms, versus a services company seeking to deploy as many contractors as possible, and bill as many hours as possible to reinvent the wheel over and over again.\n\nFrom a technology standpoint, Salesforce (CRM) is the closest comp to Palantir. \n\nI say this as a computer scientist who has written core features for Palantir Gotham, written integrations between Salesforce and Palantir, and written tens of thousands of lines of Apex and Lightning code for Salesforce.\n\n* Both are cloud based SaaS data entry and analysis platforms. \n* Both can ingest or access existing data/systems to provide analytics on that 3rd party data.\n* Both have dynamic ontologies capable of modeling virtually any data set and any use case. \n* Both have granular access control to information at the property level.\n* Both have default tools and visualizations, as well as no-code builders.\n* Both have robust APIs and programing languages for bespoke tools and capabilities.\n* Both have (deserved) reputations and niches; however, both are general purpose tools to help organizations make better decisions.\n\nSalesforce started with CRM data entry (easy) and has matured to offer higher level analytical capabilities and AI. Palantir was always focused on advanced analytical capabilities, and it would be trivial to build a CRM capability on top of Palantir\u2019s products.\n\nI run my entire business on Salesforce. Lead gen -> diamond selection -> bespoke CAD creation for custom jewelry -> hand production -> delivery -> service as well as ERP functions of inventory management, shipping/logistics, etc. I could easily replatform my business from Salesforce to Palantir in a month or two, if Palantir chose to sell its products to small and medium businesses (Which they shouldn\u2019t, but I want to highlight that the two core technologies are isomorphic).\n\nIt\u2019s my belief that by 2030, **Palantir and Salesforce will divide the business analytics market like Android & iOS, Coke and Pepsi, or Facebook and Twitter.** CRM will lead in market share of small and medium sized businesses, whereas PLTR will lead in market share for governmental organizations and larger scale businesses.\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? It\u2019s little discussed, but Palantir does offer a competing Sales/CRM product:\n\n[https://www.palantir.com/solutions/sales-and-revenue/](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/sales-and-revenue/)\n\nStill don\u2019t believe me that CRM and PLTR are converging technologies? Salesforce bought a company founded by two Palantir employees, RelateIQ, for $390 million dollars in 2014. Salesforce\u2019s headline on the purchase?\n\nGoodbye Relationship Management. Hello Relationship Intelligence.\n\nGoodbye CRM. Hello data analytics.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**The \u2018Secret Sauce\u2019 of Palantir: Granular Access Control & Vetted Information Sharing**\n\nIMHO, the one thing that has not received enough attention in the IPO is Palantir\u2019s ability to track the source and pedigree of every single piece of data in the system, empowering granular access control on a need-to-know basis, which enables organizations to share information across borders/boundaries.\n\nBig data is hard. Providing granular access control to big data is much harder. Convincing sensitive organizations that your tech is safe enough to share classified information with other countries/organizations is even harder. \n\nI cannot overstate how difficult access control is at scale and why it\u2019s a key part of Palantir\u2019s present and future value.\n\nHere's recent videos from Palantir explaining the tech:\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zqE8J4WKOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zqE8J4WKOU)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbo65u9Yt1o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbo65u9Yt1o)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**What I am looking for on Demo Day:**\n\n* Has the usability & approachability of Gotham significantly improved? \n* How flexible/customizable is the Gotham Object viewer? (Salesforce is FAR superior here versus my 2015 knowledge of Gotham)\n* How mature are the admin tools and speed to deploy? Are they mature enough that 3rd party contractors can create and manage Palantir instances? \n* Is there a robust marketplace for 3rd party tools, data sources, and plugins?\n* What is the AI offering, and how does that help organizations improve decision making?  \n* Will there be enough rocket emojis used in the presentation to win over WSB?", "id": "l49dut", "created_utc": 1611527494.0, "score": 645, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Tbh?

Based on the interviews that's what Palantir seek to address. You can see the same failure playing out right now between Federal and state governments, hospital systems, pharma companies when it comes to a reliable vaccination plan. Why is that? Because of all the legal requirements.\n\nBesides all the problems I mentioned about good access control, the difficulties are compounded exponentially when you talk about multi-organization data share. PLTR has the experience in implementing platforms compliant to the highest standards (IL-6, or SECRET).

Let me play devil\u2019s advocate and look at two direct subsidies and also an overall picture of the situation,\nFour points in all:\n\n1. Intangible drilling costs. O&G company has to pay per hour for a rig to be in their location drilling. They deduct this expense from their taxable amount. This acts as a deducted expense just like other industries.\n\n2. Depletion: They buy/lease an asset (piece of land) that has hydrocarbon reserves. When they extract hydrocarbons and pay their expenses, they deduct the amount they extracted from their asset base. Another example of this is how you can depreciate the value of your heavy equipment as a construction company, or write off depreciation on a rental property over time. It\u2019s called something else, but it\u2019s the same as almost every other industry. (Tesla depreciates the equipment in their factories.)\n\n3. When an oil company writes things off, they make more profit. When the make more profit, other companies begin to compete, driving the price down. We all save money on heating our homes and driving to work because oil companies extract more hydrocarbons for less.\n\n4. The US government heavily subsidizes agriculture because it\u2019s a good thing, but they also want the US to be able to feed itself in dire situations like war. It\u2019s the same for oil. If we produced no oil, another nation could simply cut off the supply chain being shipped into the country and take over in a week. It\u2019s a national security concern.\n\nSummary: The tax subsidies first and foremost are far, far, far below 50%, the number isn\u2019t comparable. Other industries are subsidized in identical ways, but those subsidies have their own special names. The burning of fossil fuels absolutely has negative externalities but it has massive positive externalities as well which are often overlooked.\n\nI\u2019m sharing that just for a new perspective, not trying to start an argument or anything.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5777925848960876}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.85713130235672}, {"body": "This is a myth.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20876796543598175}, {"body": "Or when government subsidizes student education! \n\nOh wait... nvm", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5598090887069702}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34393778443336487}, {"body": "It bothers me so much.

So buying 100-150 points below the stock price at that time.\n\nFor what was probably a .70-.75 delta call at the time (and now .86 delta), she has an asset that performs pretty close to owning shares directly (i.e. stock replacement strategy), however it's costing her less capital.\n\nBased on current option pricing, you could buy almost three of the 700 calls (ATM minus 150) for 30k, whereas buying a hundred shares (without margin) would cost 85k.

Her break-even owning 3 call options vs 100 shares is probably close to 875 from my back-of-napkin calculations. In other words, if she holds to expiration and TSLA settles above 875, then she will get 3 times the return for every point above 875 than she would by holding shares equal to the same amount of capital spent on the call options.\n\nBasically as others have said in fewer words, it's a good conservative wealth conservation strategy.

{"title": "What Everyone is Getting Wrong About GME", "selftext": "WSB Controls GME Sentiment, not the Price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong read here but there is analogy using the Magic School bus so........yeah.\n\nTL:DR: at bottom.\n\nI've seen far too many people on this sub, Stinktwits, Tweeter, CNBC, WSJ, Barron's etc. incorrectly state that WSB is controlling GME.  We have not, nor will we ever be in control of GME.  Simply put, our \\~5% ownership isn't enough to push the price around.  As much as you retards, and the retard(s) on CNBC, and the retards on print media WANT everyone to believe it, its just not true so I wanted to clarify a few things going forward.\n\nFirst, the media, Shitron, and others are trying to paint WSB as a collective or a whole entity, and NOT as a group of individuals.  This claim is baseless, and has been mentioned here before but of course that won't stop them.  If in fact we were a collective, that would set a dangerous precedent and we would almost certainly be shut down.  Think of like Pirate Bay. If one person illegally uploads a movie that person is in violation of the law, but if 10000 people upload a couple seconds of said movie, and those pieces are stitched together it becomes a lot harder to make it illegal.\n\nThe story of GME began much like M. Burry's big short began - someone looked!  That person was r/DeepFuckingValue (and M. Burry, himself).  Let's use the Magic School Bus as an example. DFV is played by Ms. Frizzle. Here she comes around the bend in her little short bus on route to pick you mini autists up, but when she opens the door to the bus no one gets on!  Ms. Frizzle is not discouraged, so she wrangles you retards up and throws you on the bus.  Off you go on the adventure of your life, launching into the stratosphere to discover a new planet further than the Moon and Mars. You name this newly found planet Valhalla.  When you return you can't stop telling people about your trip!\n\nThis is where we get to my point.  We are in control of the SENTIMENT surrounding GME, not the price.   You little autists have seen valhalla already, and can't stop telling others about how magical it is. Soon enough, other autists want to ride the short bus out to Valhalla, and so they buy their tickets (stonks) and then they tell their friends etc etc.  Take Tesla for example (with a P/E of 1700), does that stop the ~~retards~~ geniuses from buying?\n\nThis is what we are doing to GME.  We didn't push our weight around as WSB and somehow, singlehandedly destroy the shorts.  No, retail just doesn't have that kind of power (hence why its B.S the media is pushing the narrative...LOL though they sure know how to make an autist blush).  WSB somehow, SOMEHOW edgeukated enough people on the GME story about how undervalued they were, financially healthy they were, how shorted the stock was, Lord Cohen et al, etc, and the story took off.\n\nYou see? We are controlling the SENTIMENT around GME which in turn, is controlling the price.  Lets continue this going forward because its what got us to where we are.  If we really want this squeeze to happen there is going to have to be conviction on behalf of the buyers.  So go out there and edgeukate more people on the stock that everyone missed (apart from you DFV (xoxo) and Burry).\n\nMake sure they know this ain't no pump and dump. Everyone gets caught up in the stonk price when they should be looking at market cap.  Sure, we hit the highest price last week, but not the highest  market cap GME has ever had. In reality, we've just recently corrected to the proper valuation GME should have been at all along (if it weren't for those greedy shorts!).\n\nSo next time you post about GME, make sure you remind people about the above points and the fact that  the squeeze hasn't squoze yet, and that RC and Reggie Fils Aime are now driving this short bus!\n\nYou keep the SENTIMENT high, the stonk price goes more uppies.\n\n(someone add a rocket emoji...or perhaps a school bus?)\n\nTL/DR:  WSB is controlling the SENTIMENT around GME, not the price.  \n\n\n\\*EDIT: Position:  557 glorious shares @ $20.21", "id": "l3xy7m", "created_utc": 1611488490.0, "score": 1789, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 290, "comments": [{"body": "Talk down to me more.

Let's face it, shorters have immense amount of capital compare to WSB, but they are in a hole they need to dig themselves out. In my head there are two possible broader strategies they could take:\n\n1. Use their shit ton of money (including margins based on other collaterals in their holdings) to double down on shorting, hoping to suppress the price long enough so enough paper hands exit with relative small gains while thinking they've made out like a bandit, eventually restore some stock liquidity in the market so they can cover at the lower price.\n2. Capitulate, but using their shit ton of money to manage the price curve so there wouldn't be any explosive price spikes as they cover.  \n\nI believe they've been using plan 1 for the last few weeks. Thus the little covering we've seen so far. There are reports on additional short interests being added in the past few weeks, which further backs up this theory. But due to our  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50  it didn't really pan out as they would've hoped.  Also this has the massive side effect of dragging down MMs with them due to large amount of call options purchase. Not only they threw MMs under the bus, but also further reduced stock liquidity as MMs need to deliver assignments.\n\nI think they might start to seriously consider plan 2. This is basically spending lots of money to avoid losing even more money.\n\nTo shorters, plan 1 might be a cheaper way to exit if it works out, but carries immense amount of risks. Also it hasn't worked that well so far so history is not on their side. Plan 2 is really, really expensive and needs to be very carefully executed to be worthwhile, but carries a slightly lower risk.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised they have a bunch of high IQ lvy leaguers and Asian quants they poached from MIT running all kinds of calculations on the risk profiles of these two strategies over the weekend, so they don't get sucked dry by a bunch of retards. \n\nComing up we might see explosive price action if they go with plan 1 but couldn't keep the lid on. Or continuous swing up and down if they act on plan 2. But as the stock liquidity dries up (on the premise that they can't create too many additional synthetic shares), even plan 2 has a pretty big risk of blowing up the price.\n\nTL;DR buy more shares and hold them to the moon.   \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c", "score": 567, "replies": [{"body": "Probably the most useful response to this question in this thread!!

This will cause MM and shorts to fight over what little liquidity there is or the shorts will be called and used to hedge.

Claiming to like gambling, but only \"when the professionals agree\" suggests you don't actually like gambling which leads me back to the absurdity of you not seeing and registering that there was practically a sure thing on GME two weeks ago.\n\nWhy would you think DFV should close his positions? Because he is already seeing a ton a profit?

Generally if there\u2019s such a huge short interest on a stock, it\u2019s not because some institution drew the ticker out of a hat.

I\u2019d rather make moves where the masses generally agree everything about it is awesome. \n\nAs far as DFV closing his positions-\n\nGee I dunno, because he\u2019s got like, $11 million dollars?  He could get out now and never have to worry about money the rest of his life.  He could take that money, invest it somewhere very conservative.  3% a year on $11 million is $330,000/year, forever.  I\u2019d call that a win and walk away.  Why risk losing that much money?  So he can have $20 million? \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference?

Maybe he has loftier ambitions that require more capital, or maybe he simply has a different perspective on when the top will arrive. I fail to see the point in trying to backseat drive DFV's bus because he saw it a year out while I was still questioning how much higher it could really go when it was at $30; dude clearly isn't stupid and he clearly sees value in holding so I don't know why I should throw my opinion into what he should do with his money.\n\nIn my mind, leverage tends to come from an advantageous asymmetry of information so while it's great to have that feeling of security that comes with everyone agreeing with you, it means you're working on a mostly even playing field as opposed to the case with GME where fundamentalists and Boomers can't see the picture as clearly as the more tech savvy generations.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.595116138458252}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5570127367973328}, {"body": "Retarded question here, but what exactly is the true value of gme?
