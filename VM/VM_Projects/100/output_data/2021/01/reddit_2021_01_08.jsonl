{"title": "Bubble protection", "selftext": "Hi everyone, by now I'm sure most of you think we're in a bubble. The only question is when, not if, it pops. The purpose of this thread is not to try and time it, but to figure out the best possible hedge that covers as many scenarios as possible. I'll be writing a few scenarios on how these next 1-2 years might go and the best hedge is of course the hedge which will print the most in as many scenarios as possible.\n\nLooking back at the '00 bubble, the pop started towards the end of March and stocks suffered a 20-30% correction in just 2 months. Then they started trading sideways for a few more months until September of the same year and from there on and the bubble completely burst and went down straight to hell, finally reaching a bottom some time in 2001 and 2002. Many stocks lost 70-90% of value and I'm talking big ones like CSCO. SPY itself lost almost 50%. Freaking SPY man, which is not composed of only tech stocks. Some stocks, like CSCO, reached a bottom in april of 2001 and then traded sideways, while others took a little longer. If you look at SPY, it only bottomed out in the summer/fall of 2002. This is what happened in the 2000s. Doesn't mean it will happen exactly the same way, but let's say this is our first potential scenario and that it plays out the same way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe following scenarios may play out over 01/2021 to 01/2023.\n\n**First scenario**\n\nMimicking the dot com bubble, the market has a correction, then stagnation and then a long bear market that lasts a year or more.\n\n**Second scenario**\n\nThe bubble continues to grow, with or without corrections. This is an important one, because this is just as likely, if not more, than the other scenarios. The best hedge should print in this scenario as well. This is why you can't just simply buy some tesla leap puts because, unless tesla pops some time in the next few months, those leap puts you bought won't be worth much. Try out the options profit calculator to see.\n\n**Third scenario**\n\nFlash crash, followed by stagnation. Imagine the market losing 50%+ or more in the course of 3 months before finding a bottom any time in the next 2 years. The closer to our date it happens, the more your puts will print. But if it happens towards the end of 2022, yours puts will probably be near worthless by then. So the hedge has to answer this scenario as well.\n\n**Bonus scenario**\n\nWe're straight flat for 2 years. Only play here is theta gang.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow there are a bunch of ways to hedge in a bull market. So let's proceed by elimination. ^(Note that this all assumes that our calls and shares were bought or puts were written at or near the top of the bubble. If you still got shares that you brought months or years ago, you'll have a much easier time to get out.)\n\nShorting: As a retailer, you'd have to have a death wish to short stocks in this market. I think it's obvious why, so this one's out.\n\nCash: Keeping a large amount of cash in your portfolio, 30-50% is not a bad idea on the surface. However consider this. If you look at the CSCO chart in the 2000s, it fell from 80$ to 55$ from March to May. Even assuming you use your cash to 'buy the dip' at the very bottom in April, CSCO never reached the same evaluation it had in March. From here you have 2 possibilities. You've kept your shares that you brought at the top and you averaged down at the bottom. You now exit at no loss or profit on the rebound. Or, you wait and hope the bubble goes back up. It never does and your portfolio is gone. So realistically the only way you'll get out of this bubble is by losing anywhere between 0 and 100% of your portfolio depending on skill, luck and patience.\n\nVXX calls: Not bad, but will fail the second scenario.\n\nShort term puts: This hedge is the most profitable one if we're going to be in the third scenario. But the third scenario has such a low probability of occurring due to what happened in March last year. Plus you have to time it and in this thread we're assuming we can't do that. Another thing you can do is buy short term puts every few weeks on overvalued stocks until the bubble pops. Then again, you'll lose a ton of money in the second scenario or if the bubble pops very late from now.\n\nLeap puts: This hedge would probably be the best one if bought in the right company.  Consider AMC from 2018 (or even 2016) to today. This stock went from 20$ to 2$ over the course of 2 years. When the covid crash came, AMC only accelerated going down. When the markets rebounded on stimuluses, this stock still kept going down. Just a few days ago it reached a new all time low. And this is no joke of a company. It's the largest movie theater chain in the world. This company's stock bled money for over 5 years. A leap put in a company like this one, that's projected to go down in all 3 scenarios, is the best hedge.\n\nLeap puts will however not bring you a lot of money if the bubble pops late or we enter in a drawn out bear market in which case you might even lose you money. That is why, given our lack of insider knowledge and inability to time the market and the risk that shorting brings, our only realistic way to hedge in this market is to buy leap puts on a failing company. A company that will go downwards whether the bubble pops or not, or whether it pops fast or slow. A company that's not something like NKLA. Because even though I strongly believe NKLA to be a huge pile of bs, the current EV euphoria might just be enough to make your puts worthless. So companies with 'potential' shouldn't be good candidates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess in the end, what I'm asking you, reddit people of higher intellect, is the following:\n\n1. How are you hedging in these conditions?\n2.

Unfortunately, I think the robotaxi army is still several years away. Now, I can\u2019t speak for Europe & Asia, but America is still early in the process of transforming its networks over to 5g.

The half that's not thought of as often is cash flow to investors. Pretty simple, when there is excess liquidity in the system you see a willingness to overpay for assets. Seven years ago I'd see PE firms buying middle market companies for 5-8.5x, five years ago it was 10x and now it's 10x+, atleast the space I look at.

Ferrous export price increases off the West Coast were driven by strong semi-finished steel import demand from China and higher steel production in Asia.\n\nA key global driver for the increase in West Coast ferrous export prices has been China's increasing steel demand and China's new ferrous scrap import standards, which have reclassified ferrous scrap as a recycled raw material. We expect this to create higher demand for global ferrous scrap.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. domestic prices were underpinned by similar trends. The latest U.S. economic data reflect durable goods orders, industrial production and housing starts rising in November. Ferrous prices have now reached their highest price points in a decade. December's global auto sales doubled from their April lows and were in line with pre-pandemic levels. Current auto inventories are at 10-year lows. Container shipping is experiencing its strongest demand in at least a decade and some steel order books stretch into March and even April.\u201d\n\nHIGHEST PRICE POINTS IN A DECADE - closing in on 2008 levels - THIS IS HUGE - also lining up going back to my original post to kick off this entire steel series of posts. \n\nCurrent auto inventories - 10 YEAR LOW\n\nWhat does that tell you?\n\nTells me that steel and more importantly steel stocks are going to \ud83d\ude80 further and further until there is relief. \n\nAs of now, I don\u2019t see that coming until Fall at the earliest. \n\nMore from the call:\n\n\u201cThe recent sharp increases in ferrous and nonferrous prices have been driven by low inventory levels after many quarters of destocking, followed by significantly higher steel mill and smelter buy plans and production levels. There are also many LONG TERM trends that support strong and sustainable ferrous and nonferrous scrap demand including the transition to lower carbon technologies, China's elimination of quotas for nonferrous scrap imports that meet its metal content standards and the prospect of China's reemergence as an importer in the global ferrous scrap market. In a world that is seeking decarbonization, we expect recycled scrap metal to be an increasingly important metals carbon solution and for demand to accelerate.\u201d\n\nCHINA. CHINA. CHINA. \n\nTheir need for steel is unquenchable at this point. \n\nThen you have the rest of the world - THAT ALSO NEEDS STEEL AND RAW MATERIALS. \n\nBack to the call:\n\n\u201cGlobal demand for recycled ferrous increased in the first quarter which was driven by continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus and concerns over tight supply. Our flexible operating platform, our logistics expertise and our global sales reach, all helped us to maximize the benefits from this heightened demand. We shipped 63% of our ferrous in the quarter to the export market and we sold the remainder into the domestic market. Our top total country destinations for ferrous exports were Bangladesh, Turkey and Vietnam.\u201d\n\nWait until China purchases start. \n\nI expect deals to be done soon and a new benchmark will be set. \n\nBack to earnings from the call:\n\n\u201cOur adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $40 million. This performance was up significantly from $28 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and was quadruple the adjusted EBITDA in the prior year quarter. The combination of improved market conditions and benefits from management initiatives led to an expansion of our operating margins.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA per ferrous ton reached $38 taking us to pre-pandemic levels last achieved in fiscal 2019. This also represented a sequential improvement of $11 per ferrous ton. Around half of that increase came from improved markets and the other half from actions we have taken. These included our commercial initiatives and productivity improvements which were enabled by our new One Schnitzer organization model and a benefit of $2 per ferrous ton from a sales contract settlement. Benefits in the quarter from average inventory accounting were approximately $2 per ton. This compared to a similar impact in the previous quarter and an adverse impact of $4 per ton in the first quarter of the prior year.\u201d\n\nBottom-line Schnitzer blew past all expectations, as I had predicted. \n\nPaper hands sold the news. \n\nHowever, the AH market popped up again. \n\nThis is a $50 stock in short order and has legs to reach $60. \n\nI think it reaches back into the low $40\u2019s next week and possibly hits blue sky $43+ mid next week. \n\nThe MOST IMPORTANT thing to take away from this call is that steel is reaching levels we have not seen in over a decade based on scrap and raw material costs.  \n\nThis will translate to higher steel prices = higher revenues = higher margins = higher EPS. \n\n2021 WILL BE A STEEL SUPER-CYCLE. \n\nTL,DR\n\nI like this to hit $50 soon. \n\nI took a gamble and bought $40 calls expiring next week when it bottomed out late today from its highs. \n\nI\u2019m betting on a bounce and then blue sky. \n\nGood luck and do your own research.", "id": "ksql7s", "created_utc": 1610064740.0, "score": 194, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "Vito, all joking aside,  are an amazing human being for this.

I talked to a ton of people, spent two weeks doing nonstop reading, am **narrowing the play to the Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR**), as well as some in ABB GE and SIEG. Please see an amended DD below. **This DD isn't TA.** It is a series of political, market, and energy trend facts/assumptions, within the technical realities of grid management. \n\n* **WARNING**: this post is long. By necessity, one has to flesh out linear chains of reasoning in long form. I'll give you the one-paragraph **TLDR** at the end. No rockets. \n* **Context:** This is a 10 bagger play but it'll take time, possibly 2-3 years. There aren't any options available for this.

The market isn't carrying the implications of known-trends to their logical conclusion (the material provider--Prysmian) and is currently undervaluing Prysmian Group. Imagine this as a chain of dominos. I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it's revenue over the next 10 years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is [12 years](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:~:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar). It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric. \n2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. [This](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf) **is a fantastic read--the \"high\" (EV adoption) scenario doesn't show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles**. The average American home uses \\~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. **For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that's almost a 100% increase.** By 2025, if \\~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We're already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve. \n   1. (2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)\n   2. (2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. **These people are wrong**. While night-charging will *assuage* total added generation capacity requirements, there isn't enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren't that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. **A ton of added capacity is needed.** \n3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. As of yesterday, /r/Energy had an [article](https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/) showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. **(1)** Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. **(2)** Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn't that green (big methane problems) and while it's cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don't believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward. \n4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don't look good for democrats, and if he doesn't have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he'll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He's not running in 2024, he's too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a 'Unifier'? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running. \n5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is \\*\\*ZERO\\*\\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause he's ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone 'Green New Deal' isn't happening and McConnell isn't going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is *NEEDED.* Everyone and their mother knows this. It's pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time. \n6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he'll help EV adoption, but that's pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left. \n7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. **If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.** \n\n[Solar Irradiance Map \\(2018\\)](https://preview.redd.it/uilz3fxoc0a61.jpg?width=5101&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25925051c0038ace93d3cd47392b88a231f1af0c)\n\n[Wind Power Map--Note the Great Lakes, Midwest, and NE Corridor Offshore](https://preview.redd.it/dwhto5huc0a61.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5b15711a5dbf1ee5454007d153d0504dad168a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However, the Grid currently isn't configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe \"local\" (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn't exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China's:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5cn24w2h0a61.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fcd18d57aea8a5ad24b080d9f5dc6e77e48d34a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Note all the Offshore Wind to the North Sea, and the connections between Renewable hot spots \\(Iceland, etc\\) to population centers](https://i.redd.it/hmijqzkxh0a61.gif)\n\n[This won't be surprising.

Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.** It's not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren't as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* (8) **Microgrids won't solve the issue.** Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn't an either-or situation. **The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)**. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --> population center is still needed. \n* (9) **The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).** Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as \"the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere\". This process will continue until we eventually have a 'Supergrid'--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids. \n   * If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit. \n* (10) **The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer**. **Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It's also a pure play.** It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian's 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They're almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58\n\n* (11) **45% of Prysmian's revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian's revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?** There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--> heightened demand --> green is cheap --> it needs to be hooked in --> regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren't unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nI do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don't think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world. \n\n\\------------------\n\nTL/DR:\n\n**EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional 'Supergrids' become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.** \n\nSorry no rockets.

It's also one of the only topics I'm not completely retarded in.  I work in the industry across all sectors of power generation, nuclear, coal, gas, hydro, some solar and spent a few years working on Siemens wind turbines. My degree is also in the field of power. Heres my devils advocate for why I'm not willing to tie money up in what I see as a super long term play that doesn't have a clear winner, yet.  Going with your point structure:\n\n1. EV's. Yes, you're correct. EV is the future whether you want it or not. No argument on this point.\n2. Yes, the the American grid is laughably dated when compared to other developed countries, namely China. Agreed, HVDC is the answer, Tesla was wrong and Edison was right in the Battle of the Currents. Just too early. However, the change to a grid that is connected with HVDC is such an extreme long play I can't fathom the amount of time money would be tied up in any one company. To change to a HVDC grid at this point is such a massive undertaking it really is nearly impossible for any retard on Reddit to grasp, let alone even people that work the industry. You're talking hundreds of billions of dollars and at least a decade or more to even crack the surface of changing at this point. It is ultra expensive to step voltage up in AC with traditional transformers, rectify it to DC and then swap the process at the other end. Our capitalist society just won't buy into the costs and even with Beijing Biden wanting to implement something bipartisan, they are planning on spending money like never seen before on a multitude of other things. No way I see this even getting off the ground in the next four years, \\*definitely\\*  not the next 2 years! Just aint happening, Buck!\n\n2a. California is stupid as fuck when it comes to energy. They literally can't even keep their lights on all year. It's hilarious. Gas aint going nowhere for a long time.\n\n2b. Yes, wind turbines (on land at least) produce most power at night time. This is currently not useful at all because it is during off peak time and most of the power is curtailed (ie wasted/not used). EV charging could tap into this, no argument there.\n\n3. Those new green numbers are pixy dust. It's a wazzy its a woozy, it doesn't matter.  You're talking \\*expected\\* numbers of \\*new\\* generation. 82+% of all electricity produced today is from non renewables. You know why that figure won't change drastically? BASELOAD power. Renewables today simply can not be trusted to provide baseload power. We are a long ways out from that changing.  Great point, most renewable sources are from deep red states, and even in the swing/purple states the resources are in the red part of the state. Huge opposition to more wind turbines all over those areas, and rightfully so. They do mess up the landscape, I've seen it. It will be no easy push to put even more (and you're going to need MUCH MUCH more wind turbines) in these areas. Good luck getting that to happen in 2-4 years, especially with what has happened with this election.\n\n4.  Bidens infrastructure bill. The liberals want to spend money in remarkable ways in every single area, even some we haven't thought about. There isn't enough money. They need to spend money on dumb shit like gender studies etc  to appease the crowd that voted them in. HVDC doesn't ring the bell of most blue haired lesbians.\n\n5. Not touching that\n\n6. See point #3. It will be very difficult to get these red states to play ball after this election. Expect massive push back to more fans and solar fields.\n\n7. See #3 and #6\n\n8. Agreed. Microgrids are supplementary at best.\n\n9. Good luck putting a bunch of wind turbines in the great lakes. I'm very familiar with those areas. You start fucking around with that water and you'll be in for a tough sell.\n\n10. Never heard of them. I'm retarded also.\n\nConclusion:  HVDC is the answer, yes. HVDC is also extremely expensive, like... stupidly expensive. Especially when nearly our entire grid is up and running with HVAC (which we have huge investments in already!). China is still relatively in its infancy stage in large portions of its land so it makes sense for them to go HVDC from the start now that the tech is (relatively) there. We were the pioneers of electricity back in the day because we are fucking awesome, we chose HVAC for reasons outside the scope of this DD. I see our country eventually gravitating towards making these changes but in no way do I see it happening anytime soon or at any exciting pace. Wind turbines and solar are already deployed in huge numbers throughout the country. They will never reign king in this traders lifetime save for some huge break through in storage technology.  The Biden admin is a mess with finances. They won't have the capital to do what your DD states and do all the other dumb shit as well.\n\nI like your DD... but this has to be a no from me dawg.

You are correct that it is expensive\u2026 But what is the way forward? Let us assume that 60 to 70% of added capacity is green. That has to be hooked in somehow, especially wind. I don\u2019t see any other way for this to happen. I get your point that it is incredibly expensive, but what is the alternative?\n\n2. Once these high-voltage networks begin to emerge around renewable notes, don\u2019t you think it will be compelling to take the logical next step and use them to connect population centers? Rather than spend the enormous amount of money to connect them out right, they will all be linked to the same nodes, like great lakes wind. Connect in these areas would decrease the amount of total storage needed, and allow for areas that don\u2019t want massive wind farms on the coast to take advantage of areas that may not be as populated, like northern Michigan.. \n\n3. Europe seems to be in a similar position to us. Similar to us, they developed their grid earlier on right? Yet... HVDC is seeing a Renaissance over there. this seems to be slightly inconsistent with your point. Is it simply that European democracies don\u2019t mind spending lots of money on infrastructure ?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1. I don't think there is an alternative. Your HVDC thoughts are correct. If I was a betting man, I think our three American grids will \\*eventually\\* be tied together with HVDC. One of the biggest advantages of HVDC is you can link to separate grids together that are operating at slightly different frequencies (60 HZ in our case) and not have massive explosions. HVDC major role in the near future would be connecting the 3 grids to make a more stable overall grid.\n2. In the near (5-10 years?) future, I see the connections from the on-shore farms being the same as today. We have thousands and thousands of wind turbines operating and linked in this manner currently, I just don't see a change coming for onshore turbines in the near future. Could be wrong, though. All turbines connected to a singular AC substation just like always. Are there line losses and other annoying features with AC transmission? Sure. However, major utilities are very \\*very\\* slow to adapt to new ideas and technologies. NextEra would probably be the first to try it.\n\n2a. Placing turbines too far away will suffer from the cost of running the HVDC lines hundreds of miles, like what would be necessary in northern MI to get to densely populated areas. Additionally, running new lines is an act of futility. Gaining new right of ways is nearly impossible today. You would have to run them down the existing transmission lines, which I doubt would be feasible.  However, HVDC can travel enormous distances and require much less space that it's 3 phase/3 wire AC counterparts so it's not impossible, just implausible in the near future \\*IMO\\*. If America begins to get serious about off shore wind turbines, your plan will probably come to fruition. HVAC has horrible losses when surrounded by water (see capacitance). If not, I see Americas biggest HVDC move connecting the grids(Texas is not going to be a willing player, they don't want to be interconnected because Texas reasons). It would be a much smaller piece of the pie than what you're hoping for.\n\n3. Europe is so segmented that HVDC really makes sense over there for the reasons stated above about connecting different grids together for stability. Coupled that with their huge push for wind turbines. Keep in mind wind power pretty much originated in the EU, Denmark specifically. It just an easier sell plus they don't have the energy resources we have here. EU is highly reliant on its (sometimes not so nice) neighbors for energy. This desire for energy independence has been a driving force to really throw money at off shore wind turbines(which are already deeply rooted in their society). America doesn't have that energy problem so it is a tougher sell. Natural gas is a phenomenal power source that is pretty dang clean and we have stupid amounts. Wind power just can't touch it in terms of reliability and ease of maintaining a stable grid. It's not so much the EU doesn't mind spending the money, its that they desperately need to stop relying on others for energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4 - add on - I think we are going to start seeing massive numbers of wind turbines being retired in the next 5-10 years. This could/will hurt the industry as we start realizing that wind turbines don't have the shelf life of power plants and dismantling them or doing major improvements will be very costly. We already have a problem with where to store all our old blades. See link below, from NPR of all places. Without massive government subsides, these turbines don't make money sense. Not that I see those subsidies going anywhere, especially now... it's a interesting point that the entire wind industry is propped up artificially by the government.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I try to answer these questions, I'm slowly starting to sway over and agree with putting some money at some of these companies.

{"title": "[Serious DD] Canoo/$GOEV and the potential Apple/Hyundai partnership", "selftext": "Tl;dr If Apple partners with Hyundai, it will most likely be based on the Canoo base platform. This is purely speculation, but grounded in real facts based on looking at the primary area of collaboration for Hyundai's EV partners, Canoo's founders' history with Apple and Canoo's investor presentation.\n\nLet's dive into the FACTS:\nHyundai is in early talks to develop self-driving electric vehicles with Apple [Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html). Hyundai also has a couple partnerships to co-develop EVs with Rimac, Arrival and Canoo\n\nFirst take note that in Apple's initial press release, they announced they would be focused on a \"personal, mass-market vehicle rather than a robotaxi or commercial vehicle\" [Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35036439/apple-car-2024/)\n\nFor this reason, Canoo is the most likely partner. I'll illustrate using a quote from a press release where it mentions the focus of the Canoo partnership is on small, cost-competitive EVs + PBVs (in other words, mass market vehicles), which is the market Apple is focused on. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)\n\"Canoo and Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company, will develop a new electric vehicle platform that\u2019s based on the one that powers Canoo\u2019s own vehicle, which was unveiled last year. This EV platform will power small, \u201ccost-competitive\u201d electric vehicles, as well as \u201cpurpose built vehicles,\u201d which would more closely resemble shuttles or even autonomous people-movers.\"\n\nThe reason it is much less likely to be with Arrival or Rimac is based on reading their partnership announcements with Hyundai as well.\n\nFrom Arrival article [Link](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/hyundai-and-kia-make-strategic-investment-in-arrival-to-co-develop-electric-commercial-vehicles-0000016387) : \"\u20ac100 million investment enables co-development of eco-friendly vans and other products for logistics, on-demand ride-hailing, and shuttle service companies.\" \nThe target area of the Arrival partnership is on commercial vehicles (delivery vans, shuttles) as opposed to consumer vehicles that Apple will likely target.\n\nFrom Rimac article [Link]( https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2772): \"Hyundai Motor Group and Rimac Automobili (Rimac) have announced a strategic partnership aimed to strengthen the Group\u2019s efforts to lead the high-performance electrified vehicle market and enhance its status as a game changer in Clean Mobility.\"\nThe target area of the Rimac partnership is high performance, sports concept vehicles also unlikely to be Apple's target market. \n\nAnother piece of potential evidence is from Canoo's investor presentation [Link](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_270955872.png). The picture mentions a project in progress with a Tech Strategic who is \"a player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems.\"\n\nThere is also plenty of history behind Apple and the Canoo founders to explain why this speculation is actually fairly reasonable thinking. In 2015, Apple was very close to using the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car [Link](https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/apple-bmw-i3-electric-car-173344/amp). This deal fell apart, but it shows that Apple was impressed by the BMW i team's EV platform. Fast forward 2 years and Canoo is the creation of those same former BMW i-Execs including Ulrich Kranz (former Head of BMW i) and Richard Kim (former Principal Exterior Designer of i3 production vehicle and i3 and i8 concepts at BMW).", "id": "ksvs7p", "created_utc": 1610082718.0, "score": 292, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "Got it.
