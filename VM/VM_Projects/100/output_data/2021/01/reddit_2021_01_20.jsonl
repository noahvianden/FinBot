Their technology will one day allow us to look at our genome and identify any markers that can potentially lead to genetic diseases. PACB is a gene sequencing company. From what I understand, they are competing with ILMN to be the next up and coming gene sequencing company. They claim their technology is capable of reading the full sequence of a gene in one go, whereas current technology is capable of reading multiple sequences of a chopped up gene and stich these reads up using software.

Gamma is useful because it's a shorthand to figure out buying behavior and selling behavior to hedge in price terms.\n\n2 - Gamma is the same anywhere, it's just usually irrelevant to price movements. Usually its just needed to hedge your positions. But accumulated gamma at a position causes synchronized hedging that causes predictable market movements.\n\n3 - Ramp is the presence of gamma making movement along a price range faster due to sychronized hedging. Gamma squeeze is when that happens.\n\n4 - It can actually. Also, when price starts moving fast, it attracts a momentum bid or ask that goes with it.\n\n5 - Dealer is an option dealer AKA market maker. Citadel, those kinds of firms.\n\n6 - Any time an option is created by a dealer, they will typically hedge. The side of the trade will determine the type of hedging. I believe the original contract has to be created by a dealer, but can be resold. \n\n7 - Gamma isn't really positive or negative. Gamma just means the change in delta on your option, and thus the change in price on your opinion. If dealers are short gamma, they buy on price rises, and sell on price declines.

On fundamentals alone the stock is undervalued by three or four fold, not even counting future thinking in regards to the new direction of the company. It's the exact same mistake that big investors made in shorting Tesla, they didn't consider the future value of having someone like Elon Musk (although these days I do think Tesla is completely over-evaluated even with future thinking). I see the same in Cohen, and once he begins rolling out his direction for GME, the stock will inevitably adjust to not just expected evaluations but future evaluations. Bears have to ignore ALL of the action going on behind the company's management adjustments and board adjustments to maintain their thesis of GME being a $5 to $20 stock.

This was never my thesis. I began investing at around $13 and $17 when Cohen showed signs of getting more involved. My personal value thesis has never changed, as I never invested before it was clear that Cohen was getting more involved. So I attribute a lot of future value to GME. Whether that should or should not be representative of a $40 stock price, who's to say. The fundamentals of the the current growth trajectory of the company do say so, and considering the console cycle, which is not just one year, but more in the 4+ year range, this is plenty of time to pivot from GME's original B&M business strategies. More than plenty, seeing how rapid Cohen was able to develop his business Chewy. So, I am not currently invested thinking that GME's current value is at $40 or higher, but rather that being invested, in general, is being invested at the beginning of a company that is bound to turn things around. \n\n>Without that solution, in action, working, I do believe this stock is not worth this kind of value\n\nWell absolutely. But I am certainly not investing for current value, but future value. This is why the stock is at $40, not because of investors seeing current value. If they do, they're retarded.\n\n>and need institutional support to hold this price level\n\nCohen is very likely to get this, and quickly, should he present any half-decent plan to turn GME into a business that does not depend on B&M exclusively, or on console cycles. Burry and Microsoft are invested and involved, respectively, which is a good sign if nothing else. As someone mentioned in a different post, Cohen went and visited 100+ venture capitalists in his mission to fund Chewy. I am sure they are sorely regretting their decision to pass him by, but they know him well now. Institutional support will flood GME, literally flood off the charts, once Cohen and crew can lay out their plan.

{"title": "Citron Research In A Nutshell. $GME holders read.", "selftext": "Who the fuck is **Citron Research**? Well here\u2019s a fairly precise not too technical guide as to who the fuck these roaches are, so that the average retard on r/wsb with IQ in the -ve range can understand. Listen, english isn\u2019t my first or my second language, i tried my best, suck it up if it ain\u2019t good enough.\n\n**Citron Research** is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr. **Andrew Left**. Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrew\u2019s a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b, in long he\u2019s a self proclaimed \u201c*activist short seller*\u201d. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, *her username checked out*. His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now, and apparently has 50 cases in the company\u2019s favor since 2001, do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel. Now, there\u2019s a lot of stock commentary websites, newsletters, tv shows and podcasts. Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy?  \n\nWhy has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed \u201c*activist*\u201d we\u2019re talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : \u201cHe can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.\u201d His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world\u2019s scrutiny.\n\nNow, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again \u201cAfter he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company\u2019s value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.\u201d Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn\u2019t go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). \n\nSERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$4,325** TODAY (Pre-Split price). If this wasn\u2019t enough wait to hear the companies in his \u201c*ambitious track record*\u201d. \n\nSince all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could\u2019ve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE. BUT WHAT ARE WE GONA DO? WE ARE GOING TO FUCKING HOLD TO MARS**\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. LATEST UPDATE received states that they chickened out of the livestream that was to be at 11:30AM EST. THEY NEED MORE TIME. THE SHORTS ARE SWEATING. THIS IS WORKING GUYS HOLD.\n\n\n**SCANDAL #1**. Here\u2019s a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing \u201cfalse and/or misleading claims\u201d about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He\u2019s on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. [Source](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years).\n\n**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo\u2019ing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b said they\u2019re LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE\u2019S **NO WAY** THEY\u2019RE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now. [Source](https://www.theafricareport.com/45712/jumia-short-seller-andrew-left-changes-his-mind-now-buying-the-shares/)\n\nNow these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r/wsb seems to be aware of this. Now i\u2019m pretty sure if you\u2019ve been active on the sub you\u2019ve seen the COLOSSAL failures this company has made. I\u2019ll attach it right here. [JUST GO AND SEE THIS ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A PROPER VIEW](https://imgur.com/a/QvKVC9V).\n\nApart from this, another IMPORTANT info would be that, the live stream where he claimed he is going to expose the top 5 reasons why he\u2019s GME short right now, would PROBABLY be live on his **TWITTER** (@CitronResearch). Hope to see everyone there and I CANNOT WAIT TO PROVE this self proclaimed ~~activist~~ WRONG.\n\nNOW RETARDS KEEP READING BECAUSE, this is not possible without everyone holding tight and buying more \ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e.

The stocks they short do go down only because boomer investors suck them off dry. Time for a revolution.

And it may help convince others on here to keep \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc4f for inevitable drops today.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45270177721977234}, {"body": "Actually pre-split Tesla is somewhere around $4000 now compared to his short entry at $177", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Just a quick correction. \n\n**TSLA is at $5000 today.**\n\nYou forgot the 5-1 stock split.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I can't tell if everyone on this sub are either people tricking new investors or just a bunch of genuine dumbasses trying to make everyone money", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The latter", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3281560242176056}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43048420548439026}, {"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
