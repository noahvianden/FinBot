And I certainly don't want to turn this into a pissing match, because I'm no expert on \"the future,' nor am I an expert on EV technology.\n\nWhat I do know is a couple of things. One is that most people, given the option, would probably prefer to not spend any more time at a convenience store than necessary, and maybe none at all if that were an option. And second, unlike gasoline which requires underground storage tanks at the point that it is dispense, electricity has no such limitation and can be dispensed anywhere.\n\nThose two facts open up a world of possibilities. Charging stations can be placed anywhere and certainly don't need to have a convenience store or similar type of business associated with the point of dispensation. Hotels, restaurants, even parking spaces along business streets in cities can become charging stations, potentially.\n\nIt's great if we can get cars to charge in 10 minutes (or even less!).  But, if we can get the range to be consistently over 400 miles  (I think Lucid Motors is even suggesting a range of 600 miles for their yet-to-be-released EV), then convenience stores COULD potentially be unnecessary. They could certainly decrease in number, as I suspect most people would prefer to recharge at other places.\n\nThe fact that you can recharge at home is going to certainly decrease the need for people to stop at convenience stores for most local travel. That alone will cause a significant drop in the amount of revenue for these places.  A high range vehicle combined with recharging stations at places like hotels, restaurants and other \"destination\" type places will decrease the need for them even more.\n\nI'm not predicting the total demise of convenience stores. On long trips, people will still want a place convenient to the highway exit ramp to stop, take a potty break and grab a quick snack; and if they can get a partial or full charge in the process, then that's good, too. What I am suggesting is that the convenience store in its current state/format and with the huge number of current locations may become something of a thing of the past.\n\nOf course, something we would both want to keep in mind is that ICE engines aren't going to totally disappear anytime soon, either; so there will still be a need for gasoline, and they will continue to be used for that.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "400 miles is 643.74 km", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good bot", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10454871505498886}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09666472673416138}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03904617205262184}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.04388120025396347}, {"body": "This is what I do know... peop are generally *lazy*, and out of necisstlity will opt for the whats most convenent for them.

So the people using the charging stations will be people who are traveling some distance from home.  Long trips or mid-range trips.  Anything less than 100 miles or so, you'll just wait until you get home.  More than that and you are probably traveling with a purpose.\n\nIf an EV has a range of 400+ miles (which is where they are heading), that's a full day drive. So, you'll drive until you reach a place where you either need a hotel room or at least a restaurant.  That's when you'll want to use the Charging station.  \n\nOf course, I can see charging stations at convenience stores for people that need to take a quick potty break and grab a snack, but that's not going to be for a full charge.  They'll get a quick 10 minute charge and then continue on.  Right now EVs are taking multiple hours for a full charge and 40 minutes or longer for an 80% charge.  That's more than I want to hang around a convenience store.

{"title": "NIO battery swapping station vs Tesla supercharger analysis", "selftext": "NIO battery swapping station vs Tesla supercharger (efficiency, space) \n\nNIO\u2019s 2nd generation battery swapping station:\n- holds 13 batteries\n- takes up four parking spaces \n- can swap 312x per day (5 mins/swap)\n\nTesla\u2019s supercharger:\n- takes up one parking space\n- takes 75 mins to 100% recharge (max: 19.2x/day)\n\nAssuming full capacity, in order for Tesla to fully recharge 312 batteries/day, Tesla would need 16.25 superchargers (16.25 parking spaces). \n\nEfficiency: NIO wins (5 mins vs 75 mins)\n\nSpace: NIO wins (4 parking spaces vs 16.25 parking spaces). This is especially important in crowded cities like Shanghai, NYC where land is expensive.  \n\nI don\u2019t have the cost of NIO stations and Tesla superchargers so I can\u2019t do a cost analysis.  I know the cost of 2nd generation stations is 1/2 the cost of first generation so cost is going down.  \n\nNIO is planning to double its swapping stations to 500 by the end of 2021.  Therefore, NIO would need 500 x 13 batteries = 6,500 batteries.  Assuming each battery cost $10,000...the total cost is $65m.  \n\nUnknown:  Can Tesla reduce recharging time? It is possible but due to safety and degradation issues, recharging time has not changed much over the years.\n\nUpdate:  I used 100% recharge for comparison purpose.  It takes a Tesla supercharger 40 minutes to recharge 80% of the original 85kWh battery.

We have no idea how and when short sellers will attempt to exit their position and there may not be a sudden large spike in price with all shorters trying to exit at once. Instead, shorts could be unwound slowly over a substantial time period, during which time the stock would steadily rise. Even a substantial rise sometime in the next few days may not be a sign of a short squeeze and could be followed by further increases in price.\n\nThe VW squeeze that is commonly referenced was a special case with Porsche acquiring 74% of VW and per German regulations, a German state permanently held 20%. [1] As an alternative example, consider TSLA, which cost short sellers $38 billion in 2020, despite the stock not having a dramatic short squeeze spike. [2]\n\nIt's totally reasonable to sell once the stock exceeds some target price, but I think that should be based on your opinion of the long term value of the stock. There's no guarantee that you'll be able to buy back more shares latter at a lower price as would correspond to VW-like squeeze.
