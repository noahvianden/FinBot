VMW has traded side ways for the last 52 weeks! (wtf)\n\nJust days ago AMD hit an all time high of $99, today it's at $90. \nI'm sure some of you remember the massive rocket ship \ud83d\ude80 SuBae gave us back when everyone was praying to her before their mother tucked them in at night. Well, it's time to start dreaming of Dr. Lisa Su again because the only place AMD is going IS UP until at least until 2024. While Intel are crying about getting hulk smashed by SuBae, AMD keeps stealing massive market share, and the corona has increased the need for computers so much that TSM (the foundry who makes the chips for AMD) are at max capacity and will be for several years. The only other company that can compete with TSM is Samsung who are also at max capacity. Meanwhile, Intel's fabs are several years behind.\n\nI know you guys don't like to read so here's the CliffsNotes version:\n\n* AMD growing at rocket speed\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n* 20% of server market by EOY (Currently at 10%, up from 1% 2 years ago)\n\n* Notebook market share growing by 50% (Lisa just announced this at CES a few days ago)\n\n* Most products are constantly sold out - just look at all the people crying over at r/AMD and all those people that still can't buy PS5's. \n\n* AMD powers both XBOX and PS. PS5 sales topped 3.4 million units in the first 4 weeks. Sony has had to increase production by 50%!\n\n* TSM are trying to build new fabs asap to increase production of CPU's - Today they reported a 23% increase in profits.\n\n* PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade.\n \n* The gaming PC market is set to grow 25% by 2024\n\n* Intel's competitive advantage (their own fabs) is so useless that they are trying to buy space at the already full TSM fab. \n\n* Intel are 2-3 years behind AMD. \n\n* r/intel = 205,452 users, r/amd = 765,440 (hmmmmmm)\n\n* Lisa Su always delivers the promised numbers every quarter \n\nOh yeah, and mad lad **CRAMER** [just told everyone to load up during this buying opportunity.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-shakeup-creates-buying-opportunity-in-amd-jim-cramer-says.html)\n\nRight now the boomers who don't understand the PC market are shorting AMD and buying up Intel just because it's the only name the recognise from the dinosaur age.

{"title": "WSB Declares Independence", "selftext": "**IN CONGRESS, JANUARY 14, 2021**\n\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one group of traders to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, a decent respect to the opinions of Mad Money and other boomers requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. \n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all autists are created *superior*, that they are endowed by Ryan Cohen and u/deepfuckingvalue with certain unalienable rights, that among these are gamma squeezes, yolos, and the pursuit of Tendies. That to secure these rights, subs are instituted amongst autists, deriving their reetard strength from the consent of Papas Musk, Karp, Cohen, and Cathy. That whenever Wall Street institutions and other boomers become destructive to these ends, it is the RIGHT of the reetards to alter or destroy them, and to institute new management of the market. \n\nThe history of the present market makers and whales is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute TYRANNY over WSB and the autistic everywhere. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. \n\n* Market elites have instituted day trading restrictions, harming our abilities to harness rapid moves of the market to our advantage \n* They have infiltrated our sub and kept among us in times of peace, lurkers and FUDders to spread discord \n* They have excited boomers against us, and have endeavored to bring upon reetards the merciless SEC savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all autistic savants, from god-king Musk, to the imprisoned Prince Shkreli\n* They have declared our sacred meme stocks \"casinos\" \n* They have deliberately lowered price targets when they lose the market advantage to harm retail\n* They have limited our abilities to lose our own money, by passing through edict accredited investor limits, putting pressure on Robinhood to halt options approval, and putting a false focus on rIsK mAnAgEmEnT departments\n* They have demonized retail traders for the volatility of the market, ignoring the true culprit of monetary debasement and failure to impose stress tests on the market and its participants\n* They have imposed taxes on us without our consent\n\nIn every stage of these ruthless and evil actions, we have petitioned Cramer and the hotties on MSNBC for redress in the most humble of terms. Our repeated petitions have only been met with repeated restrictions and condescension. \n\nNor have we been wanting in attentions to our Boomer \"brethren.\" We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their \"smart\" and \"learned\" government, brokers, and accountants to manipulate the market in favor of the connected and the whales. They did not listen. We warned them of paradigm shifts in AMD, Tesla, and Gamestop. THEY HAVE BEEN DEAF TO THE *SCREECHING REEEEES* OF AUTISTIC REASON. We must therefore hold them as we hold the whales and market makers, Enemies in trading, in after hours, friends. \n\nWall street can keep their price targets, their analysts, their rules, and their high frequency trading. They can keep their DCFs, their balance sheets, and their provincial focus on rEvEnUe and p/e ratios. Where WSB is going, we have no use for these archaic and backwards millstones, hung around the neck of wage-slave boomers like heavy stones. \n\nWe, therefore, THE UNITED REETARDS AND AUTISTS OF WALL STREET BETS, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the mother of all short squeezes, do, in the name of and by the authority granted by our green dildos, solemnly publish and declare, that these members are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT TRADERS, that we are absolved from all power and control from the big banks, Wall Street analysts, and boomer talking heads.

{"title": "GME - Short interest, dip (nope), Maths, Buying, FOMO \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc - We are better at being irrational than Melvin is at being solvent.", "selftext": "Rocket \ud83d\ude80 \nMoon \ud83c\udf19 \nSqueeze \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\n\nWe are so dumb, we\u2019re right about this.  If you\u2019ve read anything on this sub, you know we can be irrational.  \n\n\nIf you know anything about investing, you know the markets can be irrational longer than investors can remain solvent.  \n\n\nWell guys, we\u2019re the most irrational I\u2019ve ever seen.  And we\u2019re friggin good at it.  \n*Ain\u2019t no way anyone can out solvent our irrationality*\n\n\nBut if you don\u2019t believe me, here\u2019s some actually talking points:  \n\n\nGME is Not dipping.  The math just isn\u2019t there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It\u2019s now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  \n\n\nThis doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn\u2019t matter where they entered.  \n\n\nShort seller\u2019s peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let\u2019s do the maths. \n\n\nMost shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won\u2019t). \n\n\nNow any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  \n\n\nThis means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.06 a day to short it.  Doesn\u2019t sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 28 days (if they allow it compound), they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. \n\n\nKeep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can\u2019t wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well quite a few more dollars a share (from the interest they\u2019re going to accrue).  \n\n\nKeep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  \n\n\nKeep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That\u2019s more than are technically available.  \n\n\nKeep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen &amp; such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  \n\n\nOnce most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won\u2019t drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base &amp; support level should have been established.  \n\n\n*****\nThinking of FOMOing? You should be fine with shares.  Still could see upside of 50%+ \n*****\nI recommend buying shares, cause IV is crazy high and if MM somehow finds a way to eff with people, they will.  Sometimes they are smarter than me (but hey, that\u2019s their job, I\u2019m just an idiot). \n*****\n\n\nPositions: \n\n104 shares @ $20.15\nSold $22 call (much regret, didn\u2019t know squeeze would happen so soon, I\u2019m an idiot)\nBought $38c 1/15exp \nHope to add shares tomorrow morning &amp; maybe a call for next Friday.  But ... I have a high risk tolerance and have made a nice chunk, so if my calls go tits up, don\u2019t care. \n\n\n*****\nShameless plug for the next huge move: \nCash out half next week &amp; dump it in Apple calls (1/29 or 03/21) any strike, can\u2019t go wrong.  I have $200c, $160c, $135c, 75 shares.  \n*****\n\n\nTL;DR: \n50% upside for GME\n\n\nShorts have to cover in less than 25 days or they literally will lose more than they could ever gain from shorting.  \n\n\n45% interest payments on current share price hurts shorts.  \n\n\n20% of shares are tied up &amp; not able to be sold. \n\n\nShorters need to buy almost 200% of available shares in the next 3 weeks (assuming they want to cap their losses at 100%). \n\n\nNot too late to jump in with shares. \n\n\nDon\u2019t wait for a dip.\n\n\nEdit: interest maths - principle still holds", "id": "kxhlxc", "created_utc": 1610666637.0, "score": 411, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "We need to post more gain porn to encourage others to join us, we will be getting more traffic since Cranmer came on, let\u2019s show them we aren\u2019t playing around.

That\u2019s a bullish sign if you ask me.  \n\nIn addition to that, the inventory and channel checks seem to indicate a 40% increase in phone sales.\n\nIn addition to the increased sales, their margins appear to be higher too.\n\nIn addition to increased Q1 sales, we all got a stimulus (and should be getting another one) & every time there\u2019s a stimulus, people buy Apple products (look at apples increased sales during the last stimulus package - they beat forecasts).\n\nAnd with talk about an Apple Car, people are giddy about the stock altogether.\n\nSo when they confirm increased sales & increased outlook for the year (that\u2019s the big deal), Apple will shoot to $150 pretty quick.\n\nIn short, GME \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 lol", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "You sold me....
