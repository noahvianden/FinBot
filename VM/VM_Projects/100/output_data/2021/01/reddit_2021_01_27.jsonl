They know they have to incur serious losses. But they also know that 9/10 of you losers plan to sell at 1k and that all of you except the true believes of Our Lord DFV will panic sell to escape missing the squeeze.\n\nSooooo, the hedge funds start their buying BUT STOP near $1k. Then you morons all go \"hurr durr this measly 2x must be the squeeze hurr durr I don't know math let me exit with my $3 profit\" and it will cause the price to go down while hedge funds scoop up the discounted shares all the way down and live to laugh at us all\n\n#STOP ACTING LIKE THIS EVENT IS THE \ud83d\ude80 THAT YOU PAY 50 CENTS TO RIDE OUTSIDE OF WALMART\n\nI am not even THINKING about so much as YAWNING at my screen until we start approaching $2k. This is MUCH bigger than VW was and that itself was like a 5x event.

Most places that talk about investing should have introduced the idea of a diversified portfolio. Growth stocks are not usually defined by profitability, but by either their current growth and/or their growth potential. Two examples that I can think of \"at the moment\" would be MercadoLibre and Roku. Neither are profitable at the moment, but both are growing insanely fast (rapidly increasing revenue and sales). Both consequently have very high stock prices.\n\nMost growth stocks (particularly in the US exchanges) are in my opinion very frothy in price at the moment. But it is a good idea for a \"diversified portfolio\" to have some growth stocks (especially if you are younger, which means you can afford a higher risk appetite). You probably don't want the entire portfolio to be this -- it's good to hedge with value, blue chips, dividend stocks, etc. -- but a decent percentage is absolutely not a bad idea.\n\nA small amount of \"play money\" for YOLOs is also okay, but it has to be money you can absolutely afford to lose. Even at their frothy levels, it would honestly be difficult to see MercadoLibre or Roku (or many other growth stocks) lose 90%+ of their value; and with many growth stocks, even with the frothy prices, a long play has a large potential to be profitable.

In the late nineties those who sold their tech stocks fearing a bubble had to watch markets continue to climb higher as their portfolios underperformed \u2013 in some cases for years. Of course, eventually they were proven right while those who had been making a killing in tech stocks watched their portfolios drop 80-90% (and even more if they were leveraged).\n\nThe only thing that will ever matter are fundamentals, but that doesn't mean over periods of months and years that markets can't become significantly decoupled from economic realities. It also doesn't mean that there isn't money to be made during periods of market irrationally. In every bubble there are winners and losers, but it's often those who chase a bubble because of FOMO that get in too late and lose big.\n\nYou should see this as a challenge. As an investor you need to learn how to look at markets and call it on its BS. If you don't have the mental and emotional strength to buy stocks when everyone is panicking or sell / short them when markets are exuberant you probably don't have what it takes to outperform the market and you should probably just invest in an index fund. Again, the real winners of the $GME trade won't be those jumping in today, but the weirdos who brought $GME months ago when everyone thought they were mad. You need to try to be that guy.\n\nSomething else to remember is that it's okay to be wrong every now and then. It's far better to underperform the market and live to tell the tale than to outperform for a year or two only to lose everything. If you make 100% returns for 3 years in a row, then on the 4th year you lose 90%, you'll be down over that period. This is why I warn people about owning stocks like GME and TSLA which could drop more than 80% if they return to trading on their fundamentals. Basically no amount of upside is worth the risk of owning a stock like that IMO.\n\nAnyone who manages risk effectively and is trying to maximise for long-term returns should expect to significantly underperform during exuberant markets. Buffett is a good example of someone who always appears to be losing his touch during excessive bull markets.\n\nAt the end of the day you need to decide what you want to do. Getting rich slow is boring but with discipline is almost guaranteed. Getting rich quick is exciting, but can't be done without significant risk and most of the time it doesn't work.\n\nTo be clear though, I don't think markets are behaving that irrationally. There are pockets of extreme exuberance, but there is a lot of value to be found.

{"title": "GME - Blackrock increasing positions into GME may be part of an overall strategy by the Shorts - GME", "selftext": "Just saw this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5lor7/blackrock\\_inc\\_just\\_increased\\_their\\_stake\\_in\\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5lor7/blackrock_inc_just_increased_their_stake_in_gme/)\n\n[Blackrock increases positions in GME](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-001340/)\n\nHere's some observations for us autists on this. This is not as *bullish* as it seems. Why?\n\nWhen Passive funds get into a stock - there's evidence that they *usually* allow a significant portion of their position to be borrowed against (see below). By doing this, they extract returns from capital appreciation & interest from the Shorts. **For GME longs, this is bad in the sense that there is an increased amount of shares available to short.** \n\nIn my opinion, a big passive fund like Blackrock could care less about returns on 1 singular stock, so this brings up the question. **Why did Blackrock increase their positions?** \n\nProbably will get an answer like 'market cap increase led to increased size of tracked index, so we got in'. But this is some cookie cutter shit. What if they're working with the Shorts to increase borrowed supply? Funny how this happened in tandem with Melvin's capital infusion. \n\nIf someone less retarded than me were able to connect the dots, this looks like *fraud-ey* to me. Someone with more vested into GME should definitely look into this. This type of activity looks like the beginning of a wider onslaught by the Shorts ahead of this Friday's options expiry\n\nFor less autistic retards - index funds allowing their shares to borrowed, is in a weird way how they 'sell' their voting rights. **This actually happened to GME in the recent board meeting & it looks like the Shorts were trying to prevent Ryan Cohen & Co. from taking too many of the Board seats**:\n\n[See here for full post](https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2021/01/19/the-index-fund-dilemma-an-empirical-study-of-the-lending-voting-tradeoff/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cls-blue-sky-blog+%28CLS+Blue+Sky+Blog%29)\n\n>We examine funds\u2019 incentives through an empirical study of the lending-voting tradeoff after the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s 2019 guidance on funds\u2019 fiduciary duties. The guidance departed from prior practice by encouraging funds to take into account \u201copportunity costs\u201d of share lending when making their voting decisions. In the past, SEC staff guidance required that funds recall shares they loaned when material items were on the ballot to ensure that voting would occur. ...  \n>  \n>More share lending means less voting \u2013 regardless of whether the shares are borrowed in the end. Because shares can be borrowed at-will from the lending agent or broker, and then voted by the ultimate holder as of the record date, shares put on loan do not carry voting instructions. Hence, shares made available for loan but not borrowed are not voted \u2013 making share lending a significant contributor to non-voting. By one estimate, in 2010 alone, 60 billion shares went unvoted, with 15 billion shares on loan.  \n>  \n>**With no fiduciary constraint on share lending, corporate elections can have surprising results. Most notably, in June of 2020, a proxy fight at GameStop surprised the investor and corporate community when activists with only 7.3 percent of shares won board seats despite opposition from large institutional investors that collectively owned around 40 percent of shares. This was possible because nearly 40 percent of GameStop shares (nearly all the shares held by institutions) were on loan, most of which were presumably borrowed by short sellers and other investors with goals contrary to the funds and similar long-term investors.**\n\nGodspeed retards **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80** **GME \ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80**", "id": "l5z6op", "created_utc": 1611732799.0, "score": 235, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "At the bottom of your post you're supposed to tell me what to do and then I do it.", "score": 402, "replies": [{"body": "Moar hedge funds are going to be serving up delicious tendies for us to eat, so come with a big appetite & invite moar retards to this tendie dinner party", "score": 159, "replies": [{"body": "So \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c got it", "score": 59, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18497398495674133}, {"body": "I come for breakfast tomorrow", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2650289535522461}, {"body": "Me like tendies", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "me like this stonk", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36063408851623535}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45406824350357056}, {"body": "10k share price MINIMUM", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0322757214307785}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09896539151668549}, {"body": "ELI5?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You take your allowance and go to the store to buy a Hot Wheels.

Cramer - Give me a Pulitzer.", "selftext": "**Put on your tinfoil hat**\n\nMelvin Capital reduced GME to $4 and held it under their thumb for a YEAR. I thought they had unwound on Monday and I was wrong.  They have 5 fucking years of puts and shorts of this stock.\n\n**As Jim Cramer asked on CNBC just this week: Why didn't they just take their profit?  What was their goal? Bankrupt them?** Well Jim, I think they could have pushed that at any point between July 2019 and July 2020. So why hold it down for a year at their expense?  Do they fucking shop these companies out for takeovers?\n\nThere was a post earlier today about the largest individual shareholder - Donald Foss - [a self made billionaire who created his fortune financing used cars sales to underqualified buyers with pre-installed kill switches to ensure they paid their loans with brutal interest or faced next day repos and overpriced lawsuits](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/car-subprime-bubble-auto-loans-credit-acceptance-don-foss/) - now owns roughly 5% of Gamestop and that he looked like a \"jovial\" old man and must be pleased that his 5% purchase of Gamestop now worth $750million Dollars.  Some commented how it must have been a genius play or \"maybe he saw the DFV reddit posts\" or maybe he's just the luckiest boomer who decided to get into the Gaming Retail Space for Retirement Homes.  \n\nThis bugged the shit out of me to the point I should have been in bed 5 hours ago. Why the fuck would a \"billionaire\" 75yr old invest $14 Million in Gamestop on February 28, 2020 as a global pandemic was already unfolding and the impending economic impacts were already clear for anyone looking ahead?\n\nDonald Foss is still an insider, theres a pepe silvia trail.  In 2015, the CACC stock was heading down, quite frankly resembling a sustained short attack. It had just run into some legal trouble, so maybe it was a good target to short? Maybe one of the Scumbag-Asshole-Cohert Trading Firms was doing just that?\n\n[On October 23, 2014, roughly a month after Melvin Capital is started by Gabe Plotkin, Donald Foss sells 430,967 shares of CACC trading at $125.54 for $54million.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000120919114064903/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) \nGamestop was trading at $34.  \n\n[On December 31 2014 Donald Foss reports using 320,000 shares valued at $44.8 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555015000021/fosssc13g20141231.htm)\n\nIn the 3rd quarter of 2015, Melvin Capital buys puts on GME.

Data available to me and my will to keep typing is gone.  *Did Foss continue to liquidate CACC into August/Sept?*\n\nEveryone on the fucking planet knows where Gamestop is now.\n\nTODAY CACC MOVED *closely* IN LINE WITH GME ATTACKS.

Why wouldnt the guy that invested $14M thats now worth $750M talk to the media AT ALL? What the fuck does he want Gamestop for at 75 yrs old?!

{"title": "GME bulls: *Brace yourselves* for this inevitable (but necessary) temporary setback, and be ready to take full advantage!", "selftext": "Disclosure: I\u2019m very long GME since 15 (unfortunately mostly vertical debit spreads but I added a lot later at 50). \n\nI want everyone here to be ready for the hitch in the road that inevitably will occur. The board at GME *is*, without a doubt, going to dilute their shares. I\u2019m Certain of it. I\u2019d say the odds are it happens by the end of this week In fact. And I want to remind everyone that this is something we should expect and *desire* as investors in this company. Remember, We are in this company for the long haul. If the board doesn\u2019t approve a secondary offering, even I-as a bull-am going to think the company is making a huge mistake because this is the opportunity right here to eliminate debts and create a new slate. Making a secondary offering for even 5% of their shares is going to give them enough cash on hand to turn Gamestop into a brand new company. \n\nSo be prepared because this is the outline of what\u2019s going to ensue when it happens: \n\nShorts, who are getting fucked inside and out, are going to see this as \u201ctheir opportunity\u201d to finally get out of this shitshow. Citron and others have already made clear they think a dilution will kill the short squeeze entirely. *don\u2019t fall for it*. Remember, after this offering, You are no longer investing in Gamestop, but Gamestop 2.0; one not laden with millions in debt. And One strapped with enough cash to forge its own destiny. The stock is going to drop undoubtedly, but right after is where new bulls (and old) will come in to buy the dip and realize this changes the company fundamentally *for the better for years to come*. \n\nRemember, we are not out of our minds. Gamestop is only now trading at reasonable levels! It now has an enterprise value over sales of a humble 1.17. Their market cap is literally just beginning to approach their revenue so don\u2019t tell us it\u2019s overvalued. If Cohen can get everyone on board and take this company towards year over year revenue growth, we could be talking $1000-3000 levels a year out from now. All that has to change is the perception, and then we are talking huge EV/sales multiples. \n\nSide-note: Remember also that share prices are irrelevant. $3000 May seem crazy high, but GME doesn\u2019t have many shares outstanding. $3000 a share isn\u2019t a crazy number to obtain. Mercado Libre, for example, is $2000 a share because they don\u2019t have many shares outstanding. Don\u2019t be misled by share prices alone either or compare to other companies like Apple with a lot more shares outstanding. \n\nThis right here is the Battle of Thermopylae *Part Deux*. We are Sparta. And the shorts are Persia. Persia wins hands down almost anywhere with their vast array of resources and soldiers. But we\u2019ve picked a *perfect* home terf for the battle just like Sparta did: A stock with 140% short interest, Extremely small float, and a new vision. The bulls will win this out just as Sparta. This is fucking Gamestop. \n\nSo just remember, this amazing journey doesn\u2019t even begin until GME takes care of the elephant in the room by eliminating their debts through a secondary offering. And at last, our journey with Gamestop 2.0 shall finally begin!  \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude80 \n\nTLDR: a secondary offering is a necessary milestone GME bulls should look forward to.", "id": "l5ycjl", "created_utc": 1611729412.0, "score": 1337, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 344, "comments": [{"body": "So, a few things to clarify here. TLDR - there is no set date for the stock offering, and the offering will turn GME even more bullish\n\nA new stock offering was already discussed in the last earnings call, it's already on the table, and I think (I have to check) that the S-3 is already submitted. This already caused a dip at that time (go figure). Main point here is that the shelf offering is restricted to USD 100 M. \n\nFirst, by current values this will be peanuts, even if they were to do the offering NOW.  It's a mere half a million shares.\n\nSecond point, doing this would have them wipe out 20% of the total debt they have. Even more if they negotiate. This is extremely bullish in my opinion. Most times, yes, a dilution makes the stock drop a bit. But look at TSLA and their recent offerings. The stock didn't take a hit. It jumped up even.\n\nAnd third, I highly doubt they will do this so soon. So far management has kept totally mum about what is happening, and rightly so. Next earnings call is early March and I believe they will keep their mouths shut until then. Smart. And plenty of time for the stock to rise which will mean even less shares.\n\nOf course, I do expect news on that day, very possibly a bigger offering that allows them to completely wipe out debt.

Their pro supp for their ATM was filed the same day (December 8) and only covered $100 million in shares.  I assume they've already blown through that (AMC ran through theirs in 2.5 days).\n\nThey can file an additional pro supp at any time and it doesn't take long - honestly, there's no reason board approval, underwriting agreement, pro supp would take more than 24 hours, but they're not selling anything until they file another pro supp, so we'll know.\n\nTheir fiscal year ends 2/1, so they're not doing anything until they can release earnings anyway.
