{"title": "My prediciton on what will happen", "selftext": "TLDR: this will fade out and nothing will change at all.\n\n\\----\n\nFirst of all, I am by no means a financial expert or claim to be one. I am successful at doing stuff with my money (avg return / year of well over 15%) and think I can handle myself.\n\nI also am 45 years old and have seen a few things here and there.\n\nI was also something you could call \"an early adopter\" when it comes to the internet, social media, etc etc.\n\nMy predictions (or rather, opinions) are more or less based upon the latter two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here we go.\n\n**The current situation**\n\nFrom what I gathered, there\u00b4s different types of people involved. And I am solely talking about the retailers here. The side of the whole thing that THINK, they got all the leverage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **the Believers**\n\nthose make up the people that pake part because they believe they finally have some say , some kind of leverage, some kind of power to force real change. whether it is changes to market rules, legal oversight, changes of law... you name it. those people have real conviction and are willing to see it through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. the investors**\n\nthere might be overlap to group 1., yet these people have actual believe , not only in the message being sent, but the company as well. you can argue all you want, but the fact is that GME brought in new, extremely committed and experienced management and was / is in the phase of a corporate change. it might take them years and it might fail, but there is a chance they might pull it off. group 2 believes in this, hence the investment into it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. the traders**\n\nthey see this purely as a chance of having one of the best chance of high yield return of their lifetime (which is not wrong at all). they might also believe that they help the world become a better place to justify their behavior, which is also ok. yet they are mainly in for the gains. they are rather rational about the situation and simply wait for thee right moment. the only thing that sets them apart from 4, is their actual rational response to the situation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. the hyper.**\n\nthose people jump on the bandwagon simply because it is happening. the same people will spread their money around, buying AMC, doge or even silver right now. they lack the understanding or they lack interest and patience to really try to understand the situation at all.\n\nthey want clout, ganis, or- the best - they want both. some are even stupid enough to sell all they have, luquidate whatever available and pour everything into one stock, if the hype is big enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prediction**\n\n**group 4:**\n\ntrends change, sentiments and rationales change. they were never so easy to manipulate as well.\n\nmost people will get bored , or simply jump on the next bandwagon. this means, 4 will skip the train as soon as the holding battle simply takes too long for their attention span. if you do not have the cashflow to actively be involved in regards to buying more when the price warrants it, you got nothing to do but wait and be patient. which is a concept very hard to grasp when you are trying to keep up with ery single hypetrain out there.\n\nand since they all over sudden realize that they got all their assets into one thing thats not doing anything, they will simply pull out sooner rather than later.\n\nat one point in the normal market fluctuation they will set their limits lower than anticipated and just jump ship.\n\n**group 3**\n\nwill eventually do the same, just a little later, simply because they understand the situation better and have much smarter goals. they are in it for the returns. right now they might not be 100% sure what target that is, but they will form a decision really soon. remember, they were never in it for the long run...\n\n**group 2**  \nremember, they are in it for the long run anyways. but as said before, patient and REAL investors that see long term potential are kinda rare these days. and not enough are in it right now.\n\n**group 1:**\n\nthey are saying they will ride it out until the end. which is great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso what does all this mean:\n\npeople underestimate how markets work, what strings will and can be pulled. they overestimate patience and conviction.\n\nalso, people TOTALLY and utterly fail to understand the core principle of greed, which drives most of the groups mentioned here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nonce the price of each individual involved is reached, the cookie WILL start to crumble.\n\nfor some its 500, for most it might be 750, 1000 dollars.\n\nwho knows. but this is no situation that will be going on for weeks. this will fade out. simply because most people lose interest or see their chances of high returns dwindling. or they need their money for other investments. or they suddenly realize that putting all this money into something that doesnt pan out wasn\u00b4t so smart afterall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OVERALL**\n\nI sincerely hope changes will come- and they probably will.\n\nThe current situation clearly exposed how markets are worked and how they operate on a level of transparency, that only happened in 2008.\n\nso how did things change after 2008 ? now think about the ramifications of 2008 compared to this. now try to think - rationaly - how realistic it is that actual , FUNDAMENTAL changes are being established and put into action ?\n\ndo you really think they will make short sales illegal ? do you really think they will make naked sales illegal ? do you think they will make fundamental changes to what the SEC actually controls and how they do it ? seriously ?\n\nthe only thing that will come from this, MIGHT be:\n\n\\- better(harsher) regulations for retail trading platforms\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- harsher regulations regarding market manupilations through means of social media\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- a wealth tax for the super rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhy this ? because it is easy to sell to the public, build hype and support upon it. will it change anything ? of course not. Oh wait, yes it will. it will make it harder for retail traders. it will make it harder for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmore regulations for trade providers means more costs at providing services means no free trading apps anymore. hard to make a buck for trading apps when you cannot sell trade information of your customers to market makers anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwe already are being censored more and more. words are flagged, opinions are flagged, and sooner or later, forums, and whole platforms will be flagged. and then closed and called illegal. its already happening in regards to other platforms. Not that I really care or support anyone using sovial media for dusgusting and absurd poilitical reasons and opinions, but censoring and de-legalizing it is still censorship. thats not something that can be good any democracy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand a wealth tax for the super rich? that\u00b4s like revers trickle down ecomomics. instead of thinking when they have all their money it will trickle down, we just make sure they pay for it once they have it.\n\nit disregards the fact that simply ba having money, they also have the means to pay lawyers a few millions to find ways they do not have to pay even more millions to pay their taxes. its what\u00b4s already happening. this will not help the small , average Joe", "id": "l8l1h7", "created_utc": 1612011005.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 136, "comments": [{"body": "I have a feeling GME will cause a large correction on the market and that we\u2019ve seen the beginning of this correction the past few days..\n\nEither 1 of 2 scenarios play out in my head.. and by no means I\u2019m a financial expert but it\u2019s what logically makes sense to me..\n\n1.\tThe short squeeze happens, the stock shoots up to a few thousand dollars and bankrupts some hedge funds.. they\u2019re forced to liquidate all of their holdings including blue chip stocks, etc. causing downward pressure on the market.. this triggers people\u2019s stop losses, bearish sentiment, etc. causing a larger cascading effect\n2.\tthe hedge funds wait it out, they sell off their other holdings in blue chips, etc. to pay off the interest on the shorts and cover the losses of closing their older shorts and take out new shorts.. this goes on for a while causing downward pressure on the market.. this triggers people\u2019s stop losses, bearish sentiment, etc. causing a larger cascading effect", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "My only criticism to this would be the fed rates staying at 0-2%.

Fuck Robinhood.\n\nHey GME gang, I've been trying to figure why I'm feeling sour when I'm sitting here on a Friday, enjoying a 10 bagger on my GME plays and a celebratory tumbler of whiskey. It certainly has everything to do with Robinhood--those fuckers sold my $310 call expiring today at 11:09 a.m. PT with no notice, no questions, nothing (you might recognize 11:09 a.m. PT as basically the low point of the day; that option was worth about $10k at 3:55 today) and they sold it for a grand. Thanks, fuckers!\n\nBut no, that's not the reason I'm writing this post. I'm writing because I'm pissed off about the screenshot I stole from another post by u/tsukune_surprise. I'm sure we all know about the infamous ladder selling by now that hedge funds use to force down the price to artificial lows. What's eating me up is that, while they certainly employed this bullshit tactic before in our run from $20 to $300+ at present, the results have never been so dramatic as they were today and yesterday. You all know the reason--up until yesterday, WSB and our allies would buy back those shares right away, on the cheap. Now, of course, I'm guessing at least half of our people can't hardly do shit but watch it crash thanks to Robinhood and others who suspended buying in GME.\n\nYou can see it plainly in the level two data when ladder selling occurs. To put it bluntly, there are virtually **no buyers and only sellers**. We all know there's no shortage of demand for shares, but the price continues to drop. These fuckers are gaming the system to spite us and if we sit on our hands, there's nothing we can do about it.\n\nSo here's the rub: Get off your butt, pick up your phone, log onto your computer, do whatever you have to to #DumpRobinhood and get on a platform that actually supports its people. My portfolio transfer to **Fidelity** is happening as we speak and I hope I'm not the only one. Thanks for reading and stay angry at the powers that be.

I did a quick search on WSB and didn\u2019t see any hits actually talking about what is known as a \u201cquiet period\u201d or \u201cblackout\u201d for corporate stock trades in relation to insiders selling their company issues GME stock.\n\nYou NEED to know this to understand one of the big points that Citron made is complete BS in the short term (insiders creating liquidity for shorts).\n\nI\u2019m assuming that many WSBers have never received stock based compensation and may not know the general corporate governance rules around them that many (most/all?) companies impose on their insiders. Here\u2019s a quick education in that and a summary of what it (might) mean for GME.\n\nObligatory disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and I am long GME.\n\nFirst: what is stock based compensation?\n\nThis is exactly what it sounds like, when as part of your comp for being a good employee, you get some sort of stock with some sort of conditions attached. There are many different flavors of this that are important.\n\noptions - these give you the right to buy stock at some fixed price, known as a strike price, which may be significantly below than market value (good!). There are many different types of option (eg ISO, NQ), but at the end of the day most are a discount coupon for cheap below market stock values. These are common for preIPO companies. You\u2019ll see these in the world of SPACs, for example, as warrants.\n\nRSU: restricted stock units - these are literally shares, given almost like cash. More common for post IPO companies.\n\nPRSU: performance RSUs - usually tied to some job performance goal, such as hitting a certain amount of revenue or other measurable goal.\n\nAlmost all stock based compensation comes with conditions, such as complying with whatever is in the associated company stock/equity plan. These are usually things like time vesting, which simply means that you can\u2019t take stock and run but rather have to let it vest over a period of months/years.\n\nFrom the wallst perspective, stock comp is reported as an expense, so you\u2019ll see it in financial disclosures and investor presentations from time to time.\n\nSecond: how do companies ensure these incentives don\u2019t hurt them or other shareholders?\n\nThis is critically important. Besides making sure there are clear policies on vesting and such, companies need to make sure that insiders do not use their company granted stock to hurt themselves or other shareholders, by performing trades during times when the employees may have critical information that the public does not. \n\nThis is usually wrapped up in an insider trading policy.\n\nNow, when WSB usually thinks about insider trading, you may think some hot head exec tipping off their golf buddy that the stock is about to crash (or pop) and they should act accordingly. Yes, that\u2019s insider trading; however, there is a more mundane version which is insiders who might have a general idea if earnings are going to be good or bad and making trades of their own company stock to profit themselves.\n\nTo protect against that, companies will often place quiet periods / trading blackouts BEFORE THE END OF A QUARTER, often by weeks at a time, AND EXTEND THAT BLACKOUT THROUGH EARNINGS REPORT DAY.\n\nREAD: end of GME quarter is THIS MONTH, meaning it is incredibly likely that all GME issued stock owned by insiders is locked up under the corporate blackout.\n\nThis is almost certainly why you don\u2019t see RC or anyone else from GME saying anything right now, due to quiet period.\n\nIn practical terms, GME would likely partner with a trading platform to administer stock grants, such as E*TRADE (which is common). The stock admin at GME would communicate blackout dates to E*TRADE (in this example), and During these dates, all of the sell functions in that stock plan account would be disabled.\n\nREAD: GME insiders see their stock plan values going through the roof right now, and CAN NOT SELL because of corporate blackout. This means the shorts can\u2019t cover with insider liquidity like Citron said.\n\nSince these blackouts usually extend thru earnings, and that is weeks/month away, those shares would be unavailable to bail out the shorts for paper handed insiders.\n\nSUMMARY\nCitron said short squeeze can\u2019t happen when insiders are selling .... Insiders (very likely) can\u2019t sell because of end of quarter blackout. \n\nThis should be common knowledge for Citron and other shorts.

{"title": "The big scandal: Some explanations & why trading got halted.", "selftext": "Citadel & Point72 bailed out Melvin Capital which was the GME short selling bagholder, but it does not end here.\n\nThere are other short sellers. And these stocks, not just GME , but others too, became extremely volatile and on giant volume.\n\nSo first there is the issue of liquidated funds that do not have immediate cash.\n\nThey hold positions and would have to unwind them to get cash to cover their margin calls.\n\nMelvin Capital I read was down 30% and got bailed out, so they still have assets, just not liquid, no immediately available cash.\n\nTrust me, if they had a gun to their head they'd have immediately available cash, they'd manage.\n\nSecond, even after what happened in 2007-2009, financial institutions with systemic risk are not THAT capitalized.\n\nIt's not new and never gets solved: in 1987 NYSE specialists had to bed big banks to provide them with more cash or the whole world would collapse.\n\nAnd I think bureaucrats do not understand how this all works very well. No one does honestly. But bureaucrats are really clueless and under or overreact. Always.\n\nIt gets scary for the clearing firms when you have GME making $35 billion volume and going up 400% in 2 days, AMC making $20 billion and gap 300%, higher volumes than Apple and Amazon that are already higher than usual and on 100 times the volatility .\n\nInteractive Broker CEO was the most honest in my eyes and in an interview with CNBC said they halted trading to protect their clients, the clearing houses, the market, and themselves. He said if they had not done it the short squeeze would have kept \"going and going\", so regulators & brokers agreed to stop it all to \"stop the losses\".\n\nRobinhood decided to re-open trading and the CEO pretended he halted trading of the very volatile stocks as routine like \"oh didn't notice anything special was going on\" \ud83e\udd21.\n\nWebull CEO said in an interview their clearing house told them they could not take trades anymore. I think they use another entity than Robinhood does.\n\nNot sure why Robinhood halted buying (and not selling). There's really the need for an investigation here. I can't tell you what happened because we do not know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy 2 cents:\n\nShort sellers are still very strong on this stock, I think they might even have added, I don't know if they are friends with the clearing house but either way they (ch) get stuck in this game, and retail investors are understandably angry at getting blocked like this.\n\nBrokers don't have billions to my knowledge with which they can cover counterparty risk and they have no contractual obligation to do so and I mean they're not santa claus.\n\nMy personal opinion is short sellers refusing to liquidate and take the L is the source of all risks and problems (most of it might be options that they can just hold? Not sure how this gets counted in short interest).\n\nMaybe already the counterparty clearing firms got wiped clean, but regardless of this if the price skyrockets further and the bagholding shorts that refuse to close while they can end up being liquidated and margin called, it's truly over for the market. Everyone is going bankrupt, WSB crashed the world.\n\nThe counterparty providers risk is real, but I am not their accountant, I do not know how bad things are, and we don't know what actors (if any) are of good faith. It could be (it probably is) shorties refusing to take the L, putting the whole market at risk.\n\nI think they are really worried the price gets to 5000. From the Peterffy ( IBKR ) interview they really expected this. And it might still happen.\n\nLehman Brothers, James Cordier, Melvin, same story. They get greedy, they refuse to get out, they get rekt.\n\nAnd sometimes they get an unfair bailout, and are so deluded they actually think they got unlucky when they really messed up.\n\nTLDR: We didn't just screw over some poorly leveraged hedge funds.

{"title": "If/When GME offers stock, don't freak out.", "selftext": "Okay, autists, listen up. At some point, Gamestop is likely going to offer stock/rights/whatever to capitalize on their increased value. This is a good thing for the company, and for shareholders. \n\nFor the company, they can make a fairly small offering and gain a ton of money to bankroll future growth or their pivot to e-commerce. For the shareholders, it serves as a floor on the stock price. Consider, if the company offers 35MM shares at $300. That would give them $10.5 billion in their war chest, for 100M shares. This is immediately a bare minimum value of $100/share just in book value. Add in their enterprise value and even the bear case is $150. This would legitimately give them a bull case over $500/share. This would force shorts to cover, while leaving the short percent at ~60%. This would still be a massive squeeze and set up the company for the future.\n\nAlternately, the company could issue a rights offering, which is basically an option to buy. Each shareholder gets 1/2 a right, which can then be traded. If the rights are at $300/share, then they are worth the difference between that and share value. But also, shorts are then short a right as well, incentivizing them to cover, or else they'd have to also cover the right. This acts as a dividend and a share offering. It would *also* raise cash for the company and increase book value, especially if the company finds a broker to guarantee it, saying that they will exorcize any unexorcized rights.\n\nThis is one of the benefits of having a high stock price - the ability to raise funds. It's what has allowed tesla to grow as rapidly as it did. And it becomes synergistic. High stock price allows companies to raise money, which in turn helps push their price higher.\n\nEdit: TLDR GME to the moon!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "l8hpe6", "created_utc": 1611996984.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "Stop with this misinformation.

{"title": "Comcast is a Hidden Enemy in this Story", "selftext": "This entire time CNBC, owned by Comcast, has been pushing the hedge fund side without a second thought about honest hard working degenerates like us. These are the same people that colluded with Charter Communications back in the day, in what is fondly called \u201cthe Summer of Love\u201d. They\u2019ve been able to charge us monopoly prices by divvying out the map and deciding to only provide cable in certain areas of the map, so if you\u2019re in those areas you have one little choice. This allows them to make the price anything they way. Although we have Netflix and slightly more cable options, till this day our internet and broadband providers are 10x slower and 10x more expensive than countries like South Korea. They have no business telling us that we\u2019re doing is immoral or criminal!! Especially when we take down evil suits named Melvin *spits out of respect*.\n\nAll throughout this, CNBC seemed to be the main perpetrator of the hedge fund narrative because they are the worst of the worst and defend establishment assholes like themselves. There is nothing else to that. I worked there for a year and it was all psychopaths. Straight up. End of story.\n\nAnyway, I think we all hate Fox, CNN, OAN, and all that other BS but if you still take CNBC seriously, I hope this experience changes that for you. May they rot in hell.

PSLV can also launch small size satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).Some notable payloads launched by PSLV include India's first lunar probe Chandrayaan-1, India's first interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) and India's first space observatory, Astrosat.PSLV has gained credence as a leading provider of rideshare services for small satellites, due its numerous multi-satellite deployment campaigns with auxiliary payloads usually ride sharing along an Indian primary payload.

I am not taking it anymore ....... Seriously I am fucking done\n\nYesterday I started looking over everything I have sold the last 20 years. NVDA at 120 due to the Citron short, AAPL 90 pre split due to all the sell side analysis saying over extended, over priced, and the list just goes on and on. ISRG which was one of my favorites of all time I sold at 18. Now they limit the amount of shares I can buy in a company. I realize this has been talked about non stop on this sub, but I am going to actually start doing something about it.\n\nStarting on Monday I am going to liquidate my 401k and every other stock I have besides GME (500k). I don't care if this market moons or falls apart, but I want change. Change so these giant funds can't manipulate the market the way they want. Change so that the playing field is leveled and I am not going back until this happens. Maybe if enough people really start to pull out we can finally start sending a real message.\n\nIn regards to GME I like the stock, and going forward I want to buy more. If I die on this hill then so be it, but it's the last time I get manipulated.  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIn addition I have money going to brokerages that can't restrict what I buy. It will be there on Monday\n\nEdit 1: I am not cashing out my 401k to stick it into GME. I am cashing out and letting it sit in a money market for a while. Same with all my other accounts. No I am not going to withdraw my 401k just let it sit in a money market for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcn77x74lhe61.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=af1d201499d651ed091f0f5c568d075dc289bbb2\n\nPosition include GME, UNP, APPL, LMT, UNH and all sorts of 2030, 2040 funds in my 401k.

Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.\n\n\ud83d\udc33\ud83e\uddd0**Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily**, in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each. **Intitial research is often with barchart, but I always check for confirmation with Unusual Whales**\n\n[FB](https://i.imgur.com/A0R2dz2.jpg) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80: until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings\n\n[Unusual whales confirmation: look at this March call order](https://i.imgur.com/nQ6WcFN.jpg)\n\n[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/40VDFnM.jpg) \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80: consistent bullish call volume all week.

If you think you know what a good beat is, just wait for AMZN Christmas results\n\n[Ununsual Whales?: yep](https://i.imgur.com/3R6pPLI.jpg)\n\nBONUS: sporadic FDX call orders have come in. After an oversell for FDX recently, AMZN sympathy is plausible based on orders.\n\n[Unusual Whales spotted a sneaky FDX call order for 2/12](https://i.imgur.com/JX0HwyD.jpg)\n\n[INTC](https://i.imgur.com/F2SUHPy.jpg) \ud83d\ude80 : yes.

{"title": "As promised, here is my \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b DD. I am fully prepared for \ud83d\udc02\ud83c\udf46. Bring it.", "selftext": "**Okay genius, we\u2019ve heard the \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b saying crash imminent for years. Why should we listen?**\n\nTruth be told, you probably shouldn\u2019t. I am a contrarian style investor, and I missed the contrarian signal in March, and entered the uptrend again way too late. If you read my post history, you will see a lot of bad calls and terrible advice (with hindsight, that is). That is why this is not investment advice in any shape or form. I am just as retarded as the next guy. I think, however, I might contribute some things that might not be common knowledge on WSB, and I really miss the good old DD posts amid the whole wsb-goes-vigilante-activist-investor vibe.\n\n**Okay, I am retarded and can barely read. Give me some bullet points before I zone out?**\n\nMy main points:\n\n 1.\tThe main narrative is way too one sided, and everyone\u2019s a bull.\n\n a.\tRemember when everyone was a bear back in March? Yeah, contrarian indicators are a thing. I missed it then and lost most of my gains from the ride down trying to call a top for the \u201cbulltrap\u201d.\n\n b.\tUSD shorts and treasury shorts are insanely large (historic record highs a couple of weeks ago), betting on a huge inflation spike any time now\u2026\n\n c.\tMarket euphoria and bullishness is also insanely high \u2013 all the bears have gone into hibernation.\n\n 2.\tEveryone believes \u201cmoney printing\u201d and \u201cstimulus\u201d creates growth and inflation, even though there is no proof of this happening in Japan, Europe, the US or anywhere else for the last 13 years.\n\n\n 3.\tMagic crayons and market fundamentals agree that this rally has gotten way ahead of itself.\n\n a.\tThere is a massive RSI divergence between the top back in Feb 2020 and the 2021 top.\n\n  b.\tValuations are pricing in perfection for nearly every company for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Okay, genius. I\u2019ve heard it all before. Jay Powell has our back, bulls have nothing to fear.**\n\nDoes he, really? The Wall Street narrative is \u201cdon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d, and it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy ever since the (in)famous \u201cGreenspan put\u201d. How many of you actually paid attention back in Feb-March? Jpow didn\u2019t just fire one bazooka and made everything fine. He needed multiple tries, and for a while there, the market did NOT care one bit what he did to rates or what insane number he pulled out of his ass for Super-QE. When the bears had exhausted themselves and passive flows started saving the day, the narrative changed into \u201cFed saves the day, once again\u201d, and there was much rejoicing.\n\n**But QE is creating a wave of liquidity, \u201csloshing around\u201d, propping up stocks! The financial media told me so!**\n\nAs many of the less retarded members of this subreddit may have noticed by now, the financial media is not your friend, and they have no idea what they\u2019re talking about most of the time. It\u2019s all talking points they get from their favorite Wall Street or Fed sources. \n\nWhat if I told you the whole \u201cmoney printing\u201d thing was just a lie? Because it is, and demonstrably so. Sure, the Federal Reserve prints money. They print physical money. The US currently has about 1.5 trillion, or roughly 7% or the M2 Money stock (M2 is what the Fed tries to tell you is the actual amount of US dollars in circulation).\n\nSo, what is QE, if it\u2019s not money printing? QE is the central bank buying treasuries and other liquid assets from primary dealers. Do they pay for these with money? No. They credit the value in bank reserves, so the bank may lend against the value (which they already could when they held treasuries). So the entire world want US treasuries, one of the most liquid assets in the world, and one of the most popular assets for repo collateral. The primary dealers sell these assets to the central banks to secure their balance sheets and make room for\u2026 More treasuries. What happens to the bank reserves? They stay in the central bank, and can be used as a basis for lending.\n\nSo \u2013 the banks can lend a lot more then \u2013 that means they lend money to hedge funds and other investors, and the money is put into markets! The Fed saved us after all! QE really works!! Well, [this graph](https://imgur.com/mvy8m8A) doesn\u2019t really fit that narrative. The massive spike in 2020 is companies maxing out their revolving loans to brace for impact. Like in 2008, lending has been negative every month since the height of the crisis.\n\nOkay, so what if the Fed isn\u2019t really printing money. The government is clearly conjuring up money out of thin air and airdropping them to the people!\n\nWell, they certainly are increasing their debt and spending the money on \u201cstimulus\u201d. I think the word is fairly misleading though. Are you \u201cstimulating spending\u201d if you give a homeless guy $10? Because that, for me, is the equivalent of what the government is doing. They are trying to prevent a disaster, not trying to \u201cstimulate\u201d growth. The gap between where we would have been without covid19 and where we actually is, is a lot bigger than a measly couple of trillion.\n \nSome perspective on the \u201crecovery\u201d so far: https://imgur.com/OkJyOUi \n\nWhat the government is doing is trying to help people be a bit less miserable, not going out and boosting GDP to new heights. It sure doesn\u2019t seem like the money they are giving out is actually increasing consumer spending in either case: https://imgur.com/FsE9Tsv\n\n**But, but\u2026 Vaccines! Pent-up demand! Reflation! Dollar to zero!**\n\nVaccines are coming, and thank God for that. Is that really going to make the American economy explode (in a good way) though? It surely doesn\u2019t seem like it outside the stock market. Last summer everyone were talking about how amazing Q4 would be. In Q4 everyone were talking about how amazing 2021 would be. Now people are starting to realize that 2021 probably won\u2019t be so amazing after all, at least not until Q3-Q4. By the end of the summer, people will be talking about 2022. Noticed how nobody\u2019s talking about a V-shaped recovery anymore? A recovery would indicate that we got back to where we started, and even though we had \u201cinsane\u201d numbers of a quarter, we are nowhere near where we started back in February (which was already quite anemic compared to pre-2008 growth):\n\nhttps://imgur.com/OkJyOUi\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ROZuu7d\n\nLastly, about that pent-up demand. I fail to see it. Leisure makes up roughly 6% of GDP. Sure, people will start eating out again, they will go to amusement parks, they will get haircuts and pedicures, but will you make up for what you didn\u2019t spend on it last year? 4 haircuts a month? 5 trips to Disney World? Eating out 8 days a week? The money has already been spent on RVs, computers, consoles, home remodeling and kitchen appliances. If anything, people might be spending less on these things than they did before covid. Evidence also points to Americans becoming more frugal and saving more to weather the next storm. I think \u201creopening\u201d and vaccines will be a non-event.\n\n**Okay, I got this far. Why now? Why can\u2019t we get SPY 400? 500?**\n \nWarning. Magic crayons ahead. Consider yourself warned.\n\nThis is the S&P back in 2018:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/66Prpwa\n\nNotice how the RSI falls while the price increases? This is called divergence. It is considered a fairly reliable signal that something is amiss. The market made a new low, but the RSI didn\u2019t? Better sell your puts and consider buying calls. The market made a new high, but the RSI didn\u2019t? Vice versa. Some of you might happen what came next, but here is a picture:\n \nhttps://imgur.com/E0C005O\n\nOkay, not conviced? I get it. Here is the S&P early last year:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/vXuZaCQ\n\nI probably don\u2019t have to tell you what came next, but you can clearly see it on the final graph:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ASdHAtx\n\nNotice anything else? Exactly. The market is soaring once again. The RSI? Not so much. Make of it what you will.\nIf you look closely at the last picture, you will see that the S&P over the last week has gone from sitting comfortably on top of the 21 day moving average, to falling through. On Friday, we closed below the 50 day moving average. That was my cue for loading up \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b style. If we close above the 50d on Monday, I will cover and wait for another signal. I don\u2019t have the time to cover passive flows now, that will have to wait \u2013 what you need to know if you load up on short term puts, is to get rid of everything before Friday Feb 19.

There is an easy way to keep this up.\n\n**IF AT ANY POINT YOU FUCK UP AND SELL STOCK PUT DOWN A LOWER BUY ORDER AT THE SAME TIME**\n\nAs far as we know, hedges need to cover shorts at the < $320 range. If GME rockets to $1000 for example, and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000, immediately put down a buy order above $320. That way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands, it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up.\n\n**IF EVERYONE WHO SELLS PUTS A BUY ORDER AT A PRICE POINT THE STOCK CANNOT FALL BELOW THAT PRICE POINT**\n\nI have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month. Maybe you retards crash the world economy. Maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit. I don't think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $.

{"title": "Great DD from r/GME", "selftext": "Credit goes to u/QuiQSllver\n\nProbably the most important thing you can read regarding GME\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img qq1cm0figie61...*\n\nLogically it made sense that Robinhood was running out of capitol, until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements. \n\n**First we examine the brokerages finances**  \n \n\nTD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.\n\n(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.\n\nE-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \\+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )\n\nCharles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day. \n\neToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Next lets examine GME volume**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share, \n\n91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share, \n\nand finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .\n\nThis adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday\n\n31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday\n\n10.08 Billion Thursday\n\n**(Stick with me here)**\n\nNow remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with. \n\nNow compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**\n\n**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, \"They ran out of money\" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**\n\nNow you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for \"Admin cost\" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.\n\nKeep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you. \ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/robinhood-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/robinhood-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/robinhood-reports-more-monthly-trades-than-rivals-charles-schwab-e-trade-combined.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/robinhood-reports-more-monthly-trades-than-rivals-charles-schwab-e-trade-combined.html)\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191021005698/en/TD-Ameritrade-Reports-Strong-Fiscal-Year-2019-Earnings#:\\~:text=30%2C%202019%20include%20the%20following%3A&amp;text=Record%20net%20new%20client%20assets,10%20percent%20year%20over%20year](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191021005698/en/TD-Ameritrade-Reports-Strong-Fiscal-Year-2019-Earnings#:~:text=30%2C%202019%20include%20the%20following%3A&amp;text=Record%20net%20new%20client%20assets,10%20percent%20year%20over%20year)\n\n[https://cdn2.etrade.net/1/20072315520.0/aempros/content/dam/etrade/about-us/en\\_US/documents/investor-relations/investor-presentation/Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://cdn2.etrade.net/1/20072315520.0/aempros/content/dam/etrade/about-us/en_US/documents/investor-relations/investor-presentation/Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\n[https://www.aboutschwab.com/investor-relations#:\\~:text=The%20Charles%20Schwab%20Corporation%20](https://www.aboutschwab.com/investor-relations#:~:text=The%20Charles%20Schwab%20Corporation%20)(NYSE,%246.69%20trillion%20in%20client%20assets\n\n[https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/01/28/schwab-td-ameritrade-put-brakes-on-some-gamestop-trading/](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/01/28/schwab-td-ameritrade-put-brakes-on-some-gamestop-trading/)\n\n[https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/average\\_volume\\_30](https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/average_volume_30)\n\n[https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Average\\_daily\\_trading\\_volume\\_of\\_S\\_P\\_500\\_stocks\\_and\\_non-S\\_P\\_500\\_stocks\\_and\\_the\\_trading\\_volume\\_of\\_the\\_top\\_quintile\\_of\\_stocks\\_in\\_each\\_group\\_for\\_select\\_years\\_from\\_1960\\_to\\_2018\\_/12024972](https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Average_daily_trading_volume_of_S_P_500_stocks_and_non-S_P_500_stocks_and_the_trading_volume_of_the_top_quintile_of_stocks_in_each_group_for_select_years_from_1960_to_2018_/12024972)\n\nTLDR: These brokerages are full of bs and scared as fuck!\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\ud83d\udc8e\u270b\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd5c\n\nNot a financial advice!", "id": "l8wu5v", "created_utc": 1612043926.0, "score": 618, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "We cant read you fucking troglodyte wheres the tldr", "score": 318, "replies": [{"body": "**Get ready for $GME FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend.

Apparently they required brokers to put up 100% of the trade value, usually this value is something like 1-10%. I'm not going to bother looking up the numbers for Tesla (if they are even available), but that puts the amount of cash that the brokers need at 15.4B vs 34B needed for Wednesday, and we can assume that this value would have ballooned on Thursday if were not for the shutdown. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not exonerating any of the brokers, they are all culpable as fuck. IBKR basically admitted to coordinating this with all the players. It's very clear here that Robinhood is being set up as the fall guy, the real issue here is the very heart of the beast. Robinhood is simply a head of the hydra. The only way this changes long term is if Americans demand change in oversight and regulations.

{"title": "The next move: \ud83d\ude80PCG\ud83d\ude80 (Pacific Gas and Electric). Catalyst from Palantir's Foundry. \ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "Ok, this is my 4th time trying to post this... I'm not sure what I wrote that's triggering it to get flagged... but here we go again. \n\n*I'm not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice. This is my understanding and perception of PCG based on my experience and research. Go fuck yourself.*\n\n\n**INTRO**  \n\nDon't worry about jumping on this Monday, this will be a slow mover for a few weeks. Wait to cash out your GME positions after the squeeze climaxes into infinity! Then, put some of those profits aside into a safe 500% return from a utility company. It's always good to diversify.\n\n**TL:DR** \\- PCG is weighed down by liabilities from sparking a massive wild fire in 2018 that leveled a Nor Cal town in hours (billions in liabilities, over 100 dead). They are under massive public pressure and fear that another fire will spark due to their equipment coupled with drought conditions, price $55 -> $4 in weeks. Currently $11.40. SIGNED CONTRACT WITH PALANTIR! Going to be the safest utility in the state EOY. Half of the settlement to the fire victims were shares (pretty fk'd up, but it's something), let's make those shares worth $$$$$!\n\n**Why PCG? (Pacific Gas and Electric  a.k.a  PG&E)**\n\nPCG is one of the largest power companies in California, powering almost the entire northern half of the state. They have huge amounts of assets, land, equipment, etc that already justify the current price, but that's irrelevant because the company isn't going bankrupt. They had a MAJOR hit to the company in 2018. High winds and faulty electrical equipment lead to the most deadly wildfire in recent memory. The fire leveled a town within hours due to dry conditions and wind speed. PCG got blamed for the fire and strapped with billions in liabilities.   \n\n\nSince the fire, PCG has revamped it's safety protocols to prevent future events. But, the last 2 year have shown (as a California resident, with PG&E power) that PCG is very inefficient. The first year (2019) was mostly a shotgun approach... if conditions were dry and an area had high winds, they cut power to EVERY-FUCKING-WHERE. It's a huge pain in the ass, but it's protecting theirs.   \n\n\nThis last year, it got better. I spoke with a few people that work for the city I live in, and they said that they had to contact PCG directly to let them know there was no fire danger within the city limits. So in 2020 during a big wind event, there were fewer, more selective areas turned off. Yay, they're learning... but way too f'king slow.   \n\n\n**What does the company look like? Let's see the numbers.**  \n\n\nI'll be honest, they aren't incredible. They are carrying a lot of debt due to burning down a town. But, that doesn't mean the profits are bad, and they are improving! Current revenue has increased year-over-year, while debt has been decreasing and looks to be fully paid off under CURRENT operating. That's not accounting for Palantir streamlining the f'k out of their operation.  \n\n\nHere is the balance sheet (scroll down for the \"liabilities\" section to see debt): [Balance Sheet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PCG/financials/annual/balance-sheet)  \n\n\nAll things considered, they are still looking like a solid company, just with a heafty bill due to a random event.   \n\n\n**Accelerated recovery via PALANTIR!**\n\nTwo weeks ago, PCG announced a deal with Palantir to begin using their Foundry platform to help manage their power grid. This. is. HUGE. The biggest thing holding PCG back as a stock right now isn't it's balance sheet, it's the FEAR that another wildfire will come through and add another $10b debt to the company and drive them into bankruptcy.   \n\n\nThis is where Palantir's Foundry comes in. If you haven't had a chance to actually look at Palantir's software, check out the video from Demo Day 3-4 days ago. I tried to link it, but it keeps rejecting my post due to the YouTube link, so look for it on your own (fast forward to 8min for Foundry demo).  \n\n\nRemember how I said that PCG had to contact the city officials in my local town directly to find out what areas were in danger during high-wind events? That information would be available to a single person, in real time, from every area connected to Palantir. Compiling information like wind speed, identifying damaged equipment, isolating at-risk areas, and making real time decisions. THIS WOULD SAVE PCG MILLIONS. Right now they have to send people out to inspect lines IN PERSON (this takes hundreds of employees HOURS to complete), and they have to call city officials in EVERY CITY and ask them ALL what areas should be blacked-out or kept on depending on risk. Can you imagine the cost of that man-power? The time involved? This took a YEAR to see improvement... But what if that COULD have been done in days, or hours???   \n\n\nPalantir's Foundry has the ability to completely transform the safety of PCG. This will remove the \"fear\" of potential future fire event, since faulty lines, weather conditions, and overall communication between managers, techs, and field workers are all more connected, faster, and more accurate.   \n\n\n**Potential**  \n\n\nPCG's biggest problem has always been their ability to monitor their HUGE coverage area effectively. They are typically delayed to respond to problems, maintenance is usually only AFTER something goes wrong. Basically, the system is just too big and too antiquated.   \n\n\nThis is why the Palantir move is so major. PCG is the FIRST company to use Foundry. THE FUCKING FIRST. Any success from this is going to feed directly into the PLTR profit pool, because PCG becoming safe and efficient would be a GAME CHANGER. They have rode the \"we're you're only fucking choice, deal with it\" ticket too long, and after the 2018 disaster, it kicked them in the ass. This is their moment to actually pivot into a modern company. Value was $55 before the crash in 2018. It's worth at least that after Foundry gets rolling.   \n\n\n**Final note**  \n\n\nAfter the fires, half of the settlement to the fire victims were in shares. Fucking shares. Oh your house burned down? Our bad, here's part of the company... that's worth nothing now. FUCK YOU. I've been pissed the last 2 years about how the whole thing went down, but I get it, they can only do so much without going under in a situation like that. So, let's do our part. Let's push the price of the stock up enough that they can feel a little bit of comfort after losing everything. The company's worth more than it's valued, and far more with the adoption of Foundry. Let's send some tendies to the Paradise victims.   \n\n\n**Positions**\n\n500 shares PCG & 400 shares PLTR.  \nOptions: 5x PCG $11c, Jun 18 - 5x PCG $12c, June 18", "id": "l8yfff", "created_utc": 1612048396.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Appreciate the DD OP.

With Palantir, they would still cut power to danger areas, but will likely be able to be more precise (rather than shutting down dozens of grids just in case), locate and repair damage done more quickly, and restore power more efficiently.

If you live on the east  coast, the way power lines are run out here would seem shocking.  In  rural areas very little centralized planning was done, and grid layout  is essentially random.  They used to just tack lines directly to the  redwoods, or cedars in the sierra nevada.  They're slow rotting trees...  I am not exaggerating in the least bit, this is not an outlier  condition, it is the condition of the entirety of California north of  the city people.  No real attention paid to clearing and following  serviceable routes i.e. ROADS, just the shortest linear distance.  This  would be true for everywhere I have lived, Humboldt, Trinity, Mendo,  Nevada Co.  In my neighborhood, the lines cut directly from the main  road through the thick of the woods and  down 600ft of elevation -  crosses a creek - and goes back up 600ft of elevation to reach mine and a  dozen other properties.  Yes, there is a road, a dirt road but there is  one.  These lines were run within the last 3 years.  They will of  course, have to be replaced.\n\nThe  amount that needs to be invested to fix the grid here I should expect to  bankrupt any private utility.  But the reality is, they won't fix it at  all.  They'll just keep shutting off the power year after year, as  public sentiment hardens against them.\n\nThe  fire season out here is getting to be an emotionally heavy time.
