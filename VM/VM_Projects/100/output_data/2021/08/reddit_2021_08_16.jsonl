When Tesla was unique (there were no other EV companies) they were hard to compare, it took them years to start to earn money and then, when the EV industry became big enough, a lot of competiton came with better price cars, availability etc. Sure, Tesla will be the leading EV maker, but how long? The same question is for PLTR, if there is money, there will be competition (and possibly better/ cheaper? software) wich will try to steal as much market share as possible. If there is no money and the industry is not lucrative/big enough, there is I think no reason to value a company that high (or value higher than their intrinsic) . But Mr Market can be weird sometimes.

PLTR could drop to $5 and the only thing you\u2019ll see is a 100x multiple of FCF. \u201cStill overvalued\u201d youll say, but any individual or institution would pick up debt to buy at that price. \n\nYou cannot adequately value potential and for this reason you\u2019ll always be looking at stocks that are safe but have no potential to ever be truly dominant.

{"title": "Pubmatic Extended DD", "selftext": "Hey Retards, Autists, and Apes; I have spent the past week finding and researching the best play to make you as much money as possible while fucking over the shorts.\n\nPubmatic is an amazingly well run, undervalued company with the second highest short interest of any stock!\n\nI am so confident this will work that I have refused to sell any of my positions for at least 2 weeks! (besides positions that expire before then obviously)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. Intro\n2. About the Company\n3. Short Sellers\n4. Options\n5. Technical Analysis\n6. Conclusion\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**About the company:**\n\nPubmatic (PUBM) is a digital advertising company primarily focused on \u2018programmable advertising\u2019. They are essentially the middle-man between sellers of ad space, advertisers, and consumers. Traditional digital advertising has generally been done by teams of people on either end buying and selling ad space which is super slow and costly.\n\nWhat makes programmable advertising different (particularly Pubmatic) is the speed and efficiency it gets by having ad spaces grouped together into \u2018nodes\u2019 of similar content and having an algorithm decide which node an individual ad should run on.\n\nThis approach makes it so much simpler for people to sell ad space and for advertisers to reach consumers. With the vast amounts of data these algorithms get each day, they are becoming more and more effective over time at matching ads to nodes. The process of grouping ad space to nodes gives smaller advertisers a way to reach people and small creators a way to sell ad space effectively.\n\nWhat generally happens is publishers will use multiple of these platforms to buy/sell ad space so they can reach as many people as possible. Because of this, there is room for multiple companies to succeed and little risk that PUBM will fail\n\nThis area is poised for MASSIVE growth in the future as the internet grows and more advertising becomes digital and programmable. Programmable advertising spending has been rapidly increasing and is now over $155B per year!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41oburgtxph71.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9abdec777e8d0820dc1925fefdbb4156c743e4f\n\nPUBM is also perfectly positioned for the whole individual creator and contractor movement as their platform gives creators a way to monetize their websites\n\nPubmatic\u2019s approach has been yielding results with them garnering over 211 BILLION daily ad impressions and over 2 PETABYTES of data PER DAY! For context, that\u2019s 2,000,000 gigabytes of data processed daily\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financial Statements (based on Q2 data):**\n\n* $49.7M revenue (just in Q2)\n* 88% y/y revenue growth\n* $9.9M net income\n* Net income up %1419 y/y\n* Adjusted EBITDA of 18.6M\n* Ebitda up 278% y/y\n* Gross margin of 74%\n* 63 P/E\n* 0 debt\n\nThis is a company who is growing rapidly and, even at this rate of growth (88%), is profitable. Once most of the infrastructure is finished and algorithm processes are streamlined, this company will be even more profitable.\n\nPUBM has a 63 P/E, which for that rate of growth is outrageously low. A company growing at this rate should not be priced this low\n\nPUBM literally has ZERO debt and is taking market share away from competitors, while still trading at way lower multiples than most, if not all, of them\n\n[This was made before Q2 earnings, now it is even more grossly undervalued](https://preview.redd.it/pkv8tomvxph71.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf912e6384a8deb769230ce05f5b85f0c91b4e1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to this, Wall Street has underestimated this company by only assuming they will make around 38 cents/share this year.\n\nPubmatic has literally done half of that in the second quarter alone and beat estimates by 100%! Q4 has historically been much better for them then Q2 anyways so they should  reach at least 85 cents/share or so for 2021.\n\nThis leaves the stock room for growth as they consistently beat estimates causing analysts to  raise price targets\n\nThe only reason I could see why the stock is this low is shorts over shorting and causing FUD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Data Centers:**\n\nPubmatic has a global network of 8 data centers allowing it to give better transfer speeds, gather higher amounts of data, and be more secure\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yoo3ijzxph71.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=179d9d32ed55f6eb5b2020d916633d19ca3abd5e\n\nWhile many of its competitors have data centers and/or offices in China, PUBM doesn\u2019t. This means the Chinese tech crackdown will not affect Pubmatic in any way, while it may to their competitors\n\nAll of their data centers and most of their offices are in politically stable countries with a strong rule of law and a wide international reach\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Impacts of Covid:**\n\nCovid has transformed how both businesses and consumers produce and consume. It has forced all of us to change how we work and shop to be more online. By most estimates, covid transformed this space by over 5 YEARS\n\nPeople and businesses have found the internet to be much more convenient and productive in many situations. Online advertising will continue to grow as e-commerce and the internet in general grows too.\n\nPubmatic is benefiting heavily from this digital transformation in our economy\n\nIndependent work has also seen massive growth due to covid induced layoffs, unemployment checks, and improved technology. Pubmatic allows independent creators to monetize their work, so they will benefit from this movement too\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Management:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oon4s6o1yph71.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=142360d38cae17d7e5ad861c0a0ac5fe552837c8\n\nThe management team is solid and is boosted by their board members. Ashish Gupta is the person who really sticks out to me as he was key to Amazon\u2019s early-mid growth. From the interviews I have seen, Rajeev Goel seems smart and invested in the success of the company\n\nWith this kind of leadership, Pubmatic is positioned to secure more and more of this growing market\n\nPubmatic has a bright future ahead with some analysts predicting Y/Y growth above 35% up until 2025. They are in the right place at the right time\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Sellers:**\n\nDespite this company doing so well, short sellers have taken onto the stock and made it the second most shorted stock on the ENTIRE MARKET. The current short interest sits at around 37%, increasing M/M by 0.77% despite great Q2 earnings. Shorts haven't sold, they have doubled down!\n\nWhat makes this company especially primed for a short squeeze is the low liquidity due to the voting structure of shares\n\nThere are around 11M class A shares and 38M class B shares\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1422930/000162828020017283/pubmatic424b42020.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1422930/000162828020017283/pubmatic424b42020.htm)\n\nShares issued to investors pre-ipo are class B shares and get 10X the voting power of class A shares. The thing is that if an investor or institution sells their class B share and re-buys it, it instantly turns into a class A share which gives them way less power over the company\n\nThis voting structure incentivizes anyone holding a class B share to not sell, which leads to a lower liquidity in the stock. This causes buying and selling shares to have a higher impact on the stock's price, which means a bunch of retards buying in will send the price to the MOON!\n\nIf we take away the 77.5% of shares that are basically locked away, the short interest rises to around 177.5%! Realistically some of that 77.5% will still sell, but the point still holds.\n\nShorts are so fucked because of this, most insiders will NOT sell. That's why most of the shorts haven\u2019t covered even when the stock dipped into the $20s, because they physically can\u2019t without sending the stock to the MOOON!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Options:**\n\nSince options are a derivative of the underlying stock, they are generally forward looking.\n\nLooking at option markets is a great way to see market expectations on which way a stock will move. Market sentiment drives stocks, so a bullish options market goes a long way.\n\nEnough call options can also trigger a gamma squeeze. Market Makers are forced to purchase shares when calls they sold become closer to being ITM, which leads to a feedback loop further increasing the stock price\n\nPUBM has one of the most bullish options markets I have ever seen\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7shrnq3yph71.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0e119fed5f43a18f3372d04639fa2df3ac5e66\n\nThe call/put ratio is about 3, which is insanely bullish\n\nIf the stock price manages to get close to 40$, MM\u2019s will be forced to purchase up to 450,000 shares! On a low liquidity stock, that type of purchasing will send the stock to the MOON\n\nThe 35$ C options have high open interest and could end up pushing us up close enough to reach the 40$ option chain\n\nThis is before WSB has even gotten their grubby hands on it, I can imagine even more call options will be purchased\n\nWith the power of one options contract being worth 100 shares, I bet that WSB can manage to make this thing moon and force short sellers to cover\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nI am still new to TA\u2019s so take what I say with a grain of salt\n\nThe three key indicators I normally look at are the RSI, MACD, and the Aroon indicator\n\nThe RSI (AKA Relative Strength Index) tracks current vs historical strength or weakness of a stock based on closing prices. It is generally used to track the momentum of a stock. It also helps us know if a stock is overbought or oversold.\n\nIt is measured from 0 to 100. Generally overbought is any number above 70 and oversold is any number below 30\n\nHow it is calculated is average gains/average losses over a specific period of time. I normally use a 1 month time period to track this.\n\nThe MACD (AKA Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is based on the behavior of moving averages. The MACD indicator is great to track bullish/bearish trends\n\nThe Short term MACD line is generally calculated by subtracting a 26 period EMA (exponential moving average) from a 12 period EMA\n\nThe long term MACD line (aka the signal line) takes a 9 period EMA of the MACD line itself. The signal line is a more smoothed out version of the MACD line which allows people to see medium to long term trends easier. When the short term moving average is above the long term one, this signals an uptrend\n\nThe Aroon Indicator identifies trends in asset prices and the strength of that trend. It essentially measures the time between the highs and lows of an asset.\n\nA score above 50 indicates a bull trend and below 50 signifies bearish trends\n\nIt is calculated by tracking the past 25 market days and finding the number of days since the last high and low\n\nThis is then plugged into the Aroon formula:\n\nFor Aroon up\n\n(Number of periods - number of periods since highest high) / (number of periods) \\*100\n\nFor Aroon down\n\n(Number of periods - number of periods since lowest low) / (number of periods) \\*100\n\nNow that you understand the indicators, here is the chart of PUBM over the past 3 months:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc0z43f5yph71.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=198d097bf1196bee155a991a9917df69a363ced9\n\nThe RSI is 46.47, which is a little below average, meaning that according to the RSI, the stock is slightly oversold\n\nThe short term MACD line has crossed the long term MACD line signaling a slightly bullish momentum. The MACD has been measured in 12, 26, and 9 days\n\nThe Aroon indicator sits at around 30 but has had slight upward momentum recently. This signals a slight up-trend but still bearish sentiment\n\nThis TA shows a slightly oversold stock which is beginning to have upward momentum.  I am sure that with the right catalyst and/or a bunch of retards buying in, we can set new all time highs!\n\nEventually short sellers will be forced to close their positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to Profit:**\n\nPersonally I would recommend buying a mix of 25% 8/20, 50% 9/17, and 25% 10/15 call options all around $30-40 strike prices. Picking up some October calls also wouldn\u2019t hurt. 8/20\u2019s will be affected by theta decay a lot more than 9/17s, but they are cheaper so you can get better returns.\n\nIf you want to be safer, you could also pick up some shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Positions:**\n\n2 8/20 $30C, 9 8/20 $35C, 1 9/17 $30C, 5 9/17 $35C, 5 9/17 40$ C\n\n32 shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvb6fpq55qh71.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=45da27636866e1c87f51fd3cc2193c077cf74dd7\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "p5fq2n", "created_utc": 1629119316.0, "score": 600, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|654|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20303073525428772}, {"body": "This is a tough call.
