This means you should expect to see your account balance grow by about 8% give or take a few pct?  This isn't how it works.  That average is the CAGR - i.e. the growth rate your account would have to *consistently* match *every single year* without skipping a beat in order to achieve said end result. \n\nThe reality is that a typical year of B&H might be +20% or +30%, and then a +3% year, maybe followed by a -30% year and then another -10% year.  It's far more enlightening to take a look at some histograms of SP500 returns than it is to assume that as long as you get more than 8% each month you're doing well.  In order to achieve that consistent 24% CAGR you'd have to not only never experience drawdowns, but achieve your performance objective perfectly each and every time.\n\nWhat will actually happen here is that in good years you'll get 24% returns, but during a recession you might get -10% or -20%.  For illustration, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where you actually get 4 good years where it works as expected, and then 2 shitty years where you keep getting assigned and take the full drawdown of the underlying directly to your face:\n\n    1.24 * 1.24 * 1.24 * 1.24 * .90 * .80\n\nThe \"average\" returns you gain here would be:\n\n    root(1.24 * 1.24 * 1.24 * 1.24 * .90 * .80, 6) == 1.09270569406149083778\n\n9.27% CAGR.

{"title": "Do actively managed mutual funds beat the index? - Analyzing and benchmarking the performance over the last 20 years!", "selftext": "**Preamble:** Ahh, a tale as old as time. Two legions of believers destined to be eternally entwined in battle! On one side we have those who swear by the active fund managers and their superior returns. On the other, we have those who trust the good old index fund with all their life savings! \n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/zxm0u6tkyih71.gif)\n\nPick your sides. It\u2019s about time we put this argument to rest. \u00a0\n\n**Data**\n\nIt\u2019s one of those rare times where somebody else does all the legwork for your analysis. Almost all the data for this analysis is from the [2020 SPIVA U.S Scorecard report](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2020.pdf). SPIVA is a division of the S&P Global and has been considered as the de-facto scorekeeper in the active vs passive debate. They have produced a report every year since 2002. They have done all the dirty work of collecting and cleaning the data required for the analysis \\[1\\].\n\n**Analysis \\[2\\]**\n\nWe will be analyzing the following types of funds\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/lcpg77imyih71.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee23ec2dc2649efd35fa9de7ef9169699babd1c9)\n\nWe will be then calculating the following\n\na.\u00a0Percentage of funds underperforming the benchmark across time periods (1, 3, 5, 10 & 20 years)\n\nb.\u00a0Average fund performance (1, 3, 5, 10 & 20 years \u2013 Both Equal and Asset Weighted)\n\nThe above analysis should give us conclusive evidence on which approach is better both in the short as well as long term.\n\n**Results**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/fu5yzplnyih71.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6d150d0872d79fc49a5a5dcc942690abf3d015e)\n\nThe results are not pretty! Except for the lone one-year period for small-cap funds, most actively managed funds underperformed their corresponding index in all the other time frames across the different funds.\n\nAs we can see, these differences only become much more drastic over the long term. If you consider the Large-Cap Funds, over the last 20 years, 94% of the actively managed funds have underperformed S&P500.\n\nA similar story is repeated for Small and Mid-cap funds. We can conclude from here that it\u2019s very unlikely that the fund you choose today will be able to beat the corresponding index over the long run.\n\nBut this is just one aspect of performance. What if you consider the average returns produced by the actively managed funds? Would they beat the market returns \\[3\\]?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbriauooyih71.png?width=1029&format=png&auto=webp&s=3344a479ae1025f9bb0c584f565c492d21c0ca4e\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/1pmthyepyih71.png?width=1029&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b11e2681706fa6c9e983bba3d4ff8d0b985a9ca)\n\nIn both Asset and Equal weighted returns, the index funds have outperformed actively managed funds over the long run. The only place where we can say with some confidence that actively managed funds performed better is in small and mid-cap funds where returns from an actively managed fund were slightly better than the index. This again is applicable only for time periods which are lesser than five years and also you have to be diligent enough to pick the right fund at the beginning of your investment.\n\nThere are mainly two reasons I can think of why active funds are underperforming index funds\n\na.\u00a0\u00a0The fees active funds charge add up over the long run and the market is becoming more and more efficient. While 40-50 years back, there would have been a better chance of a fund manager finding an undervalued stock, the abundance of information makes it difficult to find the diamonds in the rough. This can also be seen in the fact that active funds have relatively better success in mid and small-cap funds where there is more scope for price discovery when compared to large-cap stocks.\n\nb.\u00a0\u00a0We underestimate the changes that can happen over 20 years. The fund manager, management team, and even the fund strategy can change after seeing multiple rallies and recessions over 2 decades. So, the fund you started with would be vastly different after 20 years.\n\nOne callout here is that while benchmarking against actively managed funds, SPIVA (S&P Global Subsidiary) pulled one over us!\n\n[ ](https://i.redd.it/uzde048vyih71.gif)\n\nThe benchmark is calculated with respect to the index return without considering the cost associated with investing in the index (while the actively managed fund returns are calculated after fees). While this is a very small amount (0.03% for Vanguard SP500 ETF) when compared to actively managed funds (0.7-2%), it might change our final results slightly. But I don\u2019t think it would in any way affect the overall results as the expense ratio is negligible for index funds.\n\n**Return Comparison considering fees**\n\nSince some of us would have a lingering question on the impact of the index fund fee, I did some calculations on the difference in return over 20 years if you invested in different funds. (The Index returns here are calculated after incorporating the fees \u2013 0.03%)\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/copkzpewyih71.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3391a7a830facdd40f9ecf7c797ac9200509d0b)\n\nThis should be the final nail in the coffin for actively managed funds as in all the scenarios of our analysis, just investing in a passive index provided significantly better return over the long run. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI am not saying that active funds are pointless. Different investors have different time horizons of investment. Active funds sometimes do tend to perform better than the index during significant market volatility. In these times, fund managers can be more selective (like converting the holdings to cash and then buying back at the bottom) whereas with index funds you will be replicating exactly what the market is going through.\n\nBut then again as we can see from our analysis, only <15% of funds \\[4\\] beat the market in the long run (20 years). As we can see from the trends, longer time periods only work against the active fund managers. The chances of the fund making the right decision year over year reduce which is why it\u2019s good to remember that past performance cannot be indicative of future returns.\n\nSo, to conclude, in almost all the cases, you would be better off just sticking to a passive index fund and letting it ride!\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The data provided by SPIVA is accounted for survivorship bias, compares similar funds to its benchmark rather than comparing all types to SP500, and has also split its returns into both asset and equal-weighted methods. A detailed explanation for each is given in their official scorecard.\n\n\\[2\\] This analysis would be limited to the data directly provided in the SPIVA report as they have not shared the raw data used in the analysis.\n\n\\[3\\] Even if 86% of all funds underperformed the market over the last 20 years, what if the rest 14% created so much alpha that on avg returns actively managed funds beat the market?\n\n\\[4\\] The chances of you picking the correct fund that will outperform the market in the next 20 years are very close to the chance of you predicting the correct number in a die throw!

How do you pick the index fund to invest into?\n\n>You don\u2019t know who the 6% are until they\u2019ve done it and the they might not do it again.\n\nIf you don't know which hedgefund to invest into, you also don't know which index fund to invest into.\n\nThe same rule applies to the different index funds. You don't know which one outperforms the truly passive strategy (investing global by market cap) and the fact that they have done in the past doesn't mean that they will do again in the future.\n\nSo by picking similar index funds you are obviously reaching the conslusion that index funds are better, because they have similar performance but lower fees. But the comparison leaves out the picking part, which is the part you pay the fees for.\n\nSo a more reasonable comparison would be to compare hedgefunds to a truly passive strategy - investing globally according to market cap. If you do this comparison, the comparison becomes way more in favor of hedgefunds.\n\nThe only conclusion a comparison with similar fund gives is that by doing what a hedgefund does (actively picking what to invest into) you save the fees.\n\nThis is why I suggested ignoring the fees in the comparison. Because this would let you analyize whether or not the performance difference goes beyond saving the fees by doing the work you pay the fees for yourself (which is implied by comparing to similar index funds).\n\nAlso OP leaves out three important aspects:\n\n1. Performance is useless as a measurement without measuring volatility. \n2. A good hedgefund will not stick to one strategy. A good hedgefund will invest into different areas, countries and sectors over it's lifetime. So the comparison to one subjectively selected similar index fund becomes even more skewed. \n3.

Many, many active funds aim to out perform \u201cX\u201d index and the data shows they fail to do so, after fees, over the long term. To your point if an investor was considering an activity managed fund that tracked global stocks - Janus Henderson Global Equity Fund that comes with a 0.85% TER - the evidence suggests he or she would have great returns by investing in a global equities tracker with a TER of 0.15% and get the same exposure but 5x cheaper. It does not matter to the investor if the manager, on paper, actually achieves their goal if the investor is still worse off!\n\n3. Your point about volatility. It\u2019s a metric, for sure. But it\u2019s importance is down to the investor and their risk tolerance. If reducing volatility was an issue the traditional thing to do would be to reduce equity exposure and increase bond exposure.
