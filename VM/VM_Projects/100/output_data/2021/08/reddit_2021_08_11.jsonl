Are they stoned?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---Promise or Non-sense?--- \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# INTC is beaten badly on the market.\n\nThe most demand for semiconductors is from business instead of gamers/ individuals. Intel has been losing their customers as they lost competition. \n\nOn the other hand, AMD gradually over the quarters, showing innovation with a cutting-edge chip and in other sectors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Buy Intel\u2019s dip instead of AMD or NVDA?\n\nIt\u2019s a big no for me. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Intel is far from dead or less competitive. Balance sheet is great and the new CEO looks pretty promising. \n\nHowever, the big question - Will INTC go back to their glory days?  \n\nNot gonna happen if they don\u2019t show any innovation. I\u2019m laying my hands off for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Don\u2019t panic if you have INTC, here\u2019s why.\n\nIf you already got some INTC on your hand, don\u2019t sell just yet. INTC is kind of overlooked due to how great NVDA and AMD did recently. However, if you do hold INTC, best case scenario INTC gets back on their feet and stomps AMD and NVDA. \n\nWorst case? \n\nThey stay like this for a couple more years. Nothing really bad would happen for a company with such cash in hand. If they use the cash the right way, many things could be achieved.  \n\nWhat do you guys think?

Others, it could be CPI (average consumers). \n\nArguably the best definition for someone specific in my opinion. inflation is the increase in the cost of the things they want relative to their income. So if my goals were to buy a medium sized home, a middle of the road car, have one kid, a good school for the kid, a college education for the kid or similar, etc and I wanted to work as a plumber or something somewhat common, then I would measure inflation as the rate of increase in cost in the assets I want, versus my projected salary growth, without me taking on significantly more or less risk. The difference in those two numbers, is my inflation, personally.\n\nCPI takes common assets, ignores reality, and then uses their costs to project and measure inflation/deflation.\n\nEver read the list of items on CPI and think \u201chmm no, I don\u2019t have or want those\u201d, many do.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your TED talk :) I agree with your points.

Historically, vehicle-based payment processes have been complex and leverage legacy banking primitives such as physical credit cards or multiple smartphone apps to communicate with each individual merchant and service provider.\n\nThis is a massive step and hopefully the first of a number of key pieces of news that could be used as potential catalysts for BB over the coming days.
