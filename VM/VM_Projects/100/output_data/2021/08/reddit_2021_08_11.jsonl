Are they stoned?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---Promise or Non-sense?--- \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# INTC is beaten badly on the market.\n\nThe most demand for semiconductors is from business instead of gamers/ individuals. Intel has been losing their customers as they lost competition. \n\nOn the other hand, AMD gradually over the quarters, showing innovation with a cutting-edge chip and in other sectors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Buy Intel\u2019s dip instead of AMD or NVDA?\n\nIt\u2019s a big no for me. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Intel is far from dead or less competitive. Balance sheet is great and the new CEO looks pretty promising. \n\nHowever, the big question - Will INTC go back to their glory days?  \n\nNot gonna happen if they don\u2019t show any innovation. I\u2019m laying my hands off for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Don\u2019t panic if you have INTC, here\u2019s why.\n\nIf you already got some INTC on your hand, don\u2019t sell just yet. INTC is kind of overlooked due to how great NVDA and AMD did recently. However, if you do hold INTC, best case scenario INTC gets back on their feet and stomps AMD and NVDA. \n\nWorst case? \n\nThey stay like this for a couple more years. Nothing really bad would happen for a company with such cash in hand. If they use the cash the right way, many things could be achieved.  \n\nWhat do you guys think?

Others, it could be CPI (average consumers). \n\nArguably the best definition for someone specific in my opinion. inflation is the increase in the cost of the things they want relative to their income. So if my goals were to buy a medium sized home, a middle of the road car, have one kid, a good school for the kid, a college education for the kid or similar, etc and I wanted to work as a plumber or something somewhat common, then I would measure inflation as the rate of increase in cost in the assets I want, versus my projected salary growth, without me taking on significantly more or less risk. The difference in those two numbers, is my inflation, personally.\n\nCPI takes common assets, ignores reality, and then uses their costs to project and measure inflation/deflation.\n\nEver read the list of items on CPI and think \u201chmm no, I don\u2019t have or want those\u201d, many do.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your TED talk :) I agree with your points.

Historically, vehicle-based payment processes have been complex and leverage legacy banking primitives such as physical credit cards or multiple smartphone apps to communicate with each individual merchant and service provider.\n\nThis is a massive step and hopefully the first of a number of key pieces of news that could be used as potential catalysts for BB over the coming days.

{"title": "A Beaten Down Dog that Will Make You Smile - $SDC DD", "selftext": "It's me again, bringing you your next ticket to the moon next to Jeff Bezos.\n\nToday's pick is a beaten-down stock, and looks like it's poised for a massive recovery. In this market, where everything seems to go up, there still remain opportunities and this stock is a prime example of that, I'm talking about $SDC, Smile Direct Club.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSDC essentially competes with Invisalign in braces. They make aligners to straighten your teeth, nothing too fancy. You can't use their products for the most complicated cases, but works great for milder cases. However, their pricing clearly undercuts traditional braces and reduce the cost of wearing traditional braces ($5'800 on average for braces to $1950)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSDC **dropped 25%** just yesterday after earnings. They reported\n\n* $174m or **62.7% growth** year over year\n* Net loss of $(55)m or an **improvement of 41.6%** year over year\n* Adjusted EBITDA of $(22)m, a **decrease of $2m** year over year\n* Diluted EPS of $(0.14), a **44% improvement** year over year\n\nThese numbers are great especially considering the extremely cheap valuation and all the headwinds the company faced last year. Most of the issues they faced are one-off expenses and the company is slowly going to get to profitability. Keep in mind that this isn't your typical Pump and Dump ultra high growth stock, this is a **value play.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn their earnings call they said that they were negatively impacted by a cyber attack in April, the lasting economic effects of COVID-19, and the slower scaling of international markets due to COVID. However, they are planning to relaunch in Germany and Spain this year and will resume focus on acquiring new customers. This is essentially a new chapter for their business, as they are going to be more aggressive on their customer acquisition and expansion into new markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's important to note that the long-term story for SDC is intact and looks very promising, as they turn their business around to avoid these short-term one-off issues. SDC has a vertically-integrated platform and a very unique way of operating that prevents any other competitors from stealing their business. This is crucial to their business and is what will eventually allow them to grow profitably.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort-sellers seem to have forgotten the long-term growth story of SDC and have just thrown away the stock, and this down move is unjustified, as the future is very bright for SDC. Analysts have all come out and downgraded the stock which pushed prices down even more. The company is expected to grow about 20% this year and 24% in 2022. For a value play, have you ever seen numbers like that, this is not your average boomer stock. I can clearly see a path where this company becomes profitable this year, as they really seem to have shifted focus on **growing profitability.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey could clearly receive a buy-out from Align technologies or another healthcare company. At this valuation, I think major health care companies, manufacturing companies are seriously doing due diligence on SDC. I would clearly see P&G or another conglomerate getting interested in SDC at these prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions:\n\n60x 5$ Calls\n\n10000 Shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: $SDC just got slammed on earnings yesterday and dropped 25% to $5. $SDC is a great value play at this cheap valuation. As they shift their focus towards profitability, the recovery to $10. Hop aboard with dirt-cheap calls.**\n\nEDIT: There seems to be some controversy among dentists about SDC products, please be careful and read u/TheFatOneKnows comment to learn more.

(Something other tech companies will not do) This may seem like a negative at first glance, but if you think about what government is, they\u2019re essentially working for the tax payer (assuming our government is working correctly) \n\nSecondly, to truly disrupt (in karps words) you need to be MUCH better than the status quo. Karp says you need to be 1% of the cost in 3% of the time or something like that. That should give you an idea of the difference we\u2019re talking. \n\nWhen large companies want to buy software, they often pay large sums of money up front, and get an \u201cok\u201d product way later. Palantir sells software differently, and they work well with clients to give them exactly what they need. \n\n\nIf you read Thiels book, you\u2019ll find before Palantir, there really wasn\u2019t a distinctive name in software data before Palantir.
