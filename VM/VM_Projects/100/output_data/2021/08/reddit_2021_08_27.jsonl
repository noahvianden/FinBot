AMD will be a $500 stock within the next few years. I'd go into AMD instead of NVDA because NVDA seems a little overbought right now.\n\nAnother option to consider is CRSR for gaming. A lot of people are ignoring the gaming boom that is--and will continue--to take place over the next few years. CRSR will be dominant.\n\nAlso, PLTR is a very good one. \n\nI'd say any software or technology company that isn't a scam is a good buy. PLTR has recently been listed publicly, but they've been in business for years and have very respected executives leading that company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIMO: PLTR will 10x and AMD will 10x at least within the next 10 years.
