If it is made public the gains could be breathtaking.\n\nPosition - 8500 shares long. 120 Call options.\n\nI am sure you have heard of Lordstown Motors Corporation. Now ask yourself why you know so much about a company who was trading at less than a $1 Billion Market Cap just a few days ago. The media, using a narrative that Nathan Anderson of Hindenberg Research assembled, made sure to tell you the company was a fraud. Well, it turns out they seem to have had an agenda to try to kill the company in the crib and much of Anderson\u2019s claims have been widely discredited. For instance, Anderson claimed that the company was 4 years away from bringing a product to market and in just weeks after that was published started their Beta program. The company plans on producing vehicles for final testing and to bring them to market early in the first quarter of 2021. Production is rumored to begin the final week of September and should be targeted as a major catalyst as many retail investors don\u2019t even realize the company has an actual product.\n\nAs Doubling Dollars pointed out earlier on Seeking Alpha, the company has a number of organizations that seem to want to put roadblocks in the way. Donald Trump famously championed the company and staged a photo opp in front of the White House last fall. Mike Pence was there at the product launch last summer which gained headlines but his visit was frowned upon by detractors from Democrats and members of the LGBTQ community. So, there are some political headwinds. The United Auto Workers, National Automobile Association of America, Ford Motor Company, and Rivian backer Amazon seemed to want to give LMC a quick death after a coordinated campaign to discredit their company and their product.\n\nSo what could possibly save a company with so many bigger organizations wanting to see it\u2019s quick death. One of the wealthiest people in the world who could be hiding in the shadows and very well could turn Lordstown from hero to zero on Wall Street. On Thursday, the Ohio company hired Daniel Ninivaggi as their CEO. The first thing that jumps out to anyone looking at his resume shows he has been the right hand man of Carl Icahn for years. Ninivaggi was the CEO of the Ichan Enterprises from 2000-2004 and then CEO of Ichan Automotive from 2017-2019. His most recent work for Ichan was as board member of Hertz which he stepped down from in July. The Hertz connection pops out at you as a Lordstown investor as the strategic business model of the company is to sell to fleets so the new CEO very well could be bringing some massive sales along with him from his connections.\n\nUpon the Ninivaggi hiring the stock shot up over 40% before paring some gains and settling down for a 15% gain which it held Friday. The heavy short interest kept the lid on the run but the sky's the limit to the upside. If Ichan discloses a position this could be similar to his Herbalife play which forced rival Bill Ackman, who was short the stock, to throw in the towel after losing $500 million. Like Lordstown, Herbalife was smeared in the media and under investigation by the SEC. They walked away with a minor penalty and their company is worth $6 Billion today. Icahn was of course President Trump\u2019s Financial Advisor during his time in office so there are political advantages to make the company a viable success story if Trump decides to run in 2024.\n\nThere is a true bull case without Icahn\u2019s presence as well. The company has affirmed strong demand in their signature product the Endurance which they seek to produce 30,000 vehicles thru 2022 which translates to $1.7 Billion in forward revenue. The problem is they are cash poor but with Ninivaggi\u2019s connections odds are they will be able to do a capital raise without diluting shareholders and could get a loan on their former GM plant they own outright. In SEC filings, GM had valued the plant at $2 billion and left all robotics intact and invested in the PIPE of LMC and own about 5% of the company. GM want them to succeed to sell them batteries in their new Ultium plant that is across the street, sell them parts, and one can speculate that GM very well could use them as a supplier of parts in their own EVs that will be released in the coming years. The Lordstown complex the company owns is the third automobile largest auto plant in the United States.\n\nAt a market cap of $1.15 billion and trading at $6.50 a share there isn\u2019t much downside risk at all with tremendous upside. Rivian, who still haven\u2019t released a product after forming their business in 2009, filed with the SEC for a $80 Billion IPO Friday to show how low the valuation actually is despite the companies both entering the market at the same time. Would you rather own 1 share of a company who has links to Jeff Bezos or 80 shares of a company that now seems linked to the legendary Carl Icahn. I know where my money is at, and I hope you hop along the RIDE as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Endurance Starts Production In Less Than 4 Weeks](https://preview.redd.it/10ae938l5bk71.jpg?width=301&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dca45fb0e53afc76e673662955562e91b97673c)", "id": "pdwc9x", "created_utc": 1630247650.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "The dark side clouds everything.

Simply put, higher interest rates suck money out of the stock market.  Why? Because treasuries and many investment grade bonds (AAA) are less risky than most stocks (lower risk of principal loss and guaranteed return) so investors are more inclined to move into them as rates go higher.  The stock market historically produces a 6-8% return every year, and a bond hypothetically paying 4% is attractive under those circumstances.  The opposite is also true.  With today\u2019s around 1% return on a ten year treasury, investors will make the logical choice and switch into stocks for capital growth and dividends (or go for other things like real estate, crypto, and other hard assets like collectibles). \n\nThe Fed has a direct impact on interest rates by 1) monthly purchases of MBS and Treasuries (overall higher bids at auction due to Fed bidding means lower interest rates); and 2) total control over the Fed Funds rate which is the interest paid to member banks with assets parked at the Fed.  \n\nSecond, holding all other things constant, when interest rates are low, companies are more profitable because their debt service is lower (on variable loans or callable bonds). If they don\u2019t have debt, they can create debt at lower prices to expand operations, or buy back stock (increasing EPS).  Of course, the opposite effect is true with higher rates.  \n\nThird, with lower rates the USD will experience a devaluation (holding everything else constant).  However, versus other currencies, the devaluation is not as impactful when other countries\u2019 Central Banks are doing the same thing regarding low rates.  Nonetheless, domestically, the devaluation of one\u2019s currency does have real effects.  It leads to price inflation.\n\nForth, some companies can pass on inflation better than others depending on the elasticity of demand.  Compare the ability of a restaurant to pass on inflation of a burger to customers versus a utility company or a medical provider charging for electricity or a necessary medical procedure.  With some goods and services, we just need them, and inflation is passed on with little customer push back or loss of demand \u2014 think the price of gas.  So, some companies can pass on their inflationary inputs and others can\u2019t. \n\nIn summary, yes, I agree that the Fed\u2019s ability to control interest rates controls the stock market\u2019s trajectory.  That\u2019s why everyone says \u201cdon\u2019t fight the Fed.\u201d  But, as explained above, it\u2019s more complicated.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "\\>Is this really all there is to the market?\n\nNo. There can be a lot more.

In 2018 they raised rates 4 times, and caused a market crash that was probably only alleviated by the Fed cutting rates 3 times in 2019 (pre-Covid) back to 1.50-1.75%. I think the writing is on the wall; either we have low rates forever, or we get a crash if they raise them high enough.\n\nI also wouldn't say QE has anything to do with inflation. As I said before, this has been going on for over a decade, and hyperinflation has not materialized. Yes, it's supposed to increase the money supply and encourage lending by banks, and borrowing by individuals, but this isn't a guarantee. From what we've seen over the past decade, the inflation has instead gone into investments, primarily housing and the stock market. Those are the assets I would call hyperinflationary.\n\nWhat I would've been worried about is the direct economic stimulus we saw, which is different from QE. These were the $1000 checks mailed out to everyone in the US. Well, it seems most people either used that pay down debt, saved it, or once again, invested it. Either way they didn't spend that money in an inflationary way, i.e. buying groceries. Or maybe they did, but either way that's not a recurring source of income for individuals. Transitory is a good word for that kind of income.\n\nA big factor in price increases we've seen are just from supply constraints. Last year, when the economy was being shut down by covid restrictions, a lot of production and shipping capacity was taken offline. Then we reopened, and suddenly there was nowhere near enough supply to meet the renewed demand. Look at the commodity boom we had for a few months. But of course, supply will catch up with demand (and already has, commodities are way down since earlier), so this is why I agree inflation is transitory.\n\nAlso when you're looking at a YoY inflation figure of 5% or whatever it is, it's good to keep in mind we're starting from a very low 2020 base level. A lot of prices tanked last year--look at oil. Now it's back to pre-covid price and everyone's losing their minds over inflation.

There will come a time where even 0% interest rates are not enough to keep the debt bubble going. There may even come a time where it's not about tapering QE, but increasing QE over time, and increasing how much it's increased by over time. And eventually that becomes the new normal, until hyperinflation. So you calculate now that hyperinflation isn't coming yet, and maybe you're right. But inflation is getting worse already, and I see it continuing this way.\n\nThe prices of store goods and food and commodities aren't everything for inflation.

An extended recession is preferable to hyperinflation, though painful\n\nI agree with you completely, the right move would've been to not cut rates after the market started correcting in 2018. It was healthy, we needed to get the economy and market off the drug of low rates. But as it turns out, the government didn't have the political appetite to stomach a prolonged recession in 2018, and the QE inflated bubble has only gotten ~~worse~~ much worse since then. You want to be at the helm when it goes down and people see their retirement portfolios and house value crash by 50-80%? Nobody has any stomach to bear responsibility for something like this, so they just continue inflating the bubble and when it bursts they'll blame it on retail investors' greed and tell us we had it coming. Or maybe not. The Fed is giving us hints they'll start tapering bond purchases, and maybe even an interest rate hike.

Shorter DTE means less time to recover from a trade that goes against you and you have less buffer (lower premium) to absorb any shock.\n\nBut there is also the psychology/bias part:\n\n1. Reducing DTE (for me) means that my mindset is tilting more towards \"risk off\" mode. This causes me to put on less trades, lower my deltas, and close trades faster\n2. Mentally, I find it easier to do this with weeklies - with monthlies, my bias is to do more trades, increase deltas, keep trades open longer, which is exactly what I wish to avoid.\n3. Its harder to close a monthly when you see the premium you're leaving on the table, even if in absolute terms, you may be making more $$$ than on your weekly.\n\nIt's as though the right data (longer DTE is less risky) will bring out the wrong temperament (you get greedier when you actually want to be more conservative).\n\nI realize the contradictions here.

{"title": "How can the market crash when future crashes are priced in? Also a look into the rise of passive investing.", "selftext": "So already as of March 2021, [passive funds have gained a majority share of the U.S. fund market](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/passive-likely-overtakes-active-by-2026-earlier-if-bear-market/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si6thz5vr6k71.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=39e138185ca3c645ff34418253624af42530ec89\n\nThis means that passive funds that track the S&P 500 and other diverse markets are now larger in market share than actively managed funds in domestic markets. This graph also shows the massive growth in fund market share by passive funds compared to active funds over the last 6 years.\n\nThis growth I think is being caused by widespread support for index investing. Nearly every news article, informational paper, and online forum are all repeating the same message of investing into passive growth funds/ETFs and just holding them no matter what happens, even during large downturns. Historical data supports this and many well known investing figures also share this message. Even most new investors it seems after small losses from active trading or trying to time the market are converted to this philosophy.\n\nWhich leads me to the question: how does it ever go down here? People are being indoctrinated to keep holding during every crash and even buy dips with excess money. Historically selling at the bottom is the worst possible situation and everyone seems to know this. The rise in 401k usage and passive tax advantaged funds with penalties for withdrawing from the market also supports this. So if retail investors make up [77% of the market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17), who is left that actually sells their equities?\n\nI guess market makers with HFT bots are the only answer. These bots will attempt to sell at the instant sign of bad news in order to try to shake out weak hands, start a crash, and buy at the bottom. The recent March 2020 crash is an example of how this sell then buy cycle is getting shorter and shorter as less retail gets shaken off. The more market confidence grows and the more people hold through the dips, the shorter and less severe these crashes get.\n\nI also ate crayons for breakfast so do others have better insights into how crashes happen?\n\nPositions:\n\nTQQQ Jan 20 2023 70c\n\nTL;DR: This post marks the top, inverse accordingly.", "id": "pdl5mm", "created_utc": 1630196565.0, "score": 724, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 307, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 day ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.030482925474643707}, {"body": "I bought $10k of Schwab 1000 index fund 23 years ago.
