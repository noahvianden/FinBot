{"title": "The Biggest Misconception about Investing", "selftext": "I posted this the other day on r/StockMarket and r/ValueInvesting got wonderful responses so I thought I\u2019d share it here too.  \n\n\nFar too many people misunderstand what investing is all about \u2014 and they pay dearly for it. I am writing this article to inform readers what investing is \u2014 and, more importantly, what it isn't.\n\n## Key points:\n\n* Many everyday investors make investment decisions without understanding what they're investing in.\n* Investing isn't buying an asset hoping the price will go up. It's buying an asset that can \"print\" more of the currency you used to buy it in the first place for it and collecting it. Kind of like building and upgrading gold mines in Clash of clans.\n* Investing in individual companies is well worth it if you adopt the right mindset. The earnings automatically come to you, you have competent and intelligent people making money for you, and you are taxed less than your income!\n\n## Investment guidance is fragmented and confusing.\n\nThe investing space is highly fragmented, filled with a dubious amount of noise & misinformation, and can be confusing. But investing at its core is straightforward. You can accumulate a lifetime of wealth with the proper knowledge and framework.\n\n## What is investing?\n\nInvesting is the act of foregoing a dollar today to get more dollars tomorrow, plain and simple. It is an informed decision on the premise that the asset you're investing in will produce valuable goods and services that will one day exceed what you paid for to acquire the asset.\u00a0\n\nThis principle applies to all sorts of investments \u2014 stocks, property, bonds, a cornfield, etc. Regardless of the asset, investing remains the same throughout. In the context of stocks, this is reflected in their earnings, precisely \"owner's earnings,\" i.e., how much the company will earn for the duration of your investment.\n\n## What investing is not\n\nInvesting is not buying an asset in hopes that someone else will buy it for more than you paid. In the context of stocks, investing has nothing to do with its price moving up and down. Banking on someone more\u00a0[foolish](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiVroao_K3yAhVb7nMBHUtJAmEQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fg%2Fgreaterfooltheory.asp&usg=AOvVaw1LHhubcsWAa0-XwEi5S6MT)\u00a0to buy subpar and unproductive assets from you is speculative and unsustainable. This is gambling, not investing \u2014 a guaranteed way to lose money.\n\nLikewise, statements such as \"the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up\" or \"Amazon reported sales growth of 40%, so the stock is a buy\" are worthless. This is wishful thinking and is lazy. Companies make money because they produce goods and services people are willing to pay for and have structural advantages that make them preferable to their competitors and earn more.\n\nMost people think like this, which is why 90% of retail investors lose money.\n\n## Become a landlord (or a gamer)\n\nTo become a good investor, you must think like a landlord. What I mean by this is just like a landlord keeps track and collects his rent every month, you must track and total the earnings of your shares. Understand where they come from and ignore how much your shares have gone up or down. When the value of your property falls 10%, you don't sell it. You look at your rents and whether or not your rent has also been negatively affected. The same applies to stocks.\n\nAnd the best part? You don't have to do any work such as maintaining, marketing, and selling your property as long as you do proper research. Your earnings are automatically reported; you don't have to collect them, or worry if people pay late. If Apple sold an iPhone, and a percentage of that money goes to you, why would you not invest in it?\n\nIf you are a gamer like me and play any resource-building game, then investing is taking the time to upgrade your resource collectors so they can generate more than what you paid to upgrade it one day.\n\n\"Buy a stock the way you would buy a house. Understand and like it such that you'd be content to own it in the absence of any market.\"\n\n*Some of you might think you should track dividends because dividends are what you're receiving. This is misguided. You must track the totality of earnings as some earnings will be retained to reinvest in the business and grow future earnings. This figure is known as Owner's earnings \u2014 a figure that is not standardized or reported but can be calculated relatively easily \u2014 more on this next time.*\n\n## Many people speculate, few invest.\n\nInvesting is pretty simple to understand but challenging to execute. The first step to becoming a good investor is to start thinking like one and stop speculating altogether. Statistically and anecdotally speaking, most retail investors fall into the speculative camp.\u00a0\n\nThis, by the way, extends to \"long-term investors\" who, in their best intentions, invest in companies in industries they believe to be the \"future\" but aren't able to pinpoint the earnings and returns of the companies they're investing in. If you're not going to track your returns, the money you are earning/accumulating as a shareholder every quarter, and your subsequent yield, then do not invest in individual stocks. Doing so is not investing! It is merely wishful thinking clouded by euphoria and misguided beliefs.\n\nInstead, invest in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500 every month, do not touch it and let your money compound over time. It will provide satisfactory returns, much better returns than most investment vehicles.\n\nHowever, I would urge you to consider investing in individual companies. It is well worth it (this\u00a0[chart](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-investing-returns-a-breakdown-by-numbers-51582633800)\u00a0says it all\\].)\n\n*Also, if any of you can suggest which other subs could benefit from this post, please let me know.

{"title": "Meet the next Upstart -> Blend Labs, Inc. (BLND)", "selftext": "TLDR:\nBLND is one of the fastest-growing fintech SaaS companies, which can trade at 30-40-50x+ NTM revenue. They will report their first ER on 8/19. \n\nNow $18.40, PT $30+ \n\nBackground:\nBLND is a fintech saas for banks, focused on consumer credit. They help financial institutions better compete with companies like RKT, and focus on providing a frictionless experience for consumers. \n\nCEO and co-founder, Nima Ghamsari, started the company in 2012 with the vision of bringing \u201csimplicity and transparency to financial services\u201d by making the process of applying for a mortgage or opening an account as easy as buying something online.\n\nProducts:\nToday, BLND offers a suite of products for their financial services customers to modernize the consumer banking journeys for mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, vehicle loans, personal loans, credit cards, and deposit accounts. This list showcases their successful track record of applying their technology to multiple use cases and speed of GTM. The company started with mortgages and was able to GTM for home equity loans in 2018, for vehicle loans and deposit accounts in 2019, credit cards and personal loans in 2020, and already has set its heights on other areas that it can use their technology.\n\nAdditionally, BLND now has over 45 direct technology integrations, and that includes with customer relationship management platforms, loan origination platforms, banking products, pricing engines, product engines, as well as there's actually more than 1,200 realtors, 24 insurance agents, 900 settlement agents, and 29 data providers that are all providing information back to Blend Labs. They believe that those numbers are going to continue to grow, and if so, that can create a virtuous cycle that really builds this company's competitive advantage (flywheel effect).\n\nCustomers and Performance:\nThey are used by 31 of the top 100 U.S. financial firms, 24 of the top 100 non-mortgage bank lenders, and overall, they have 291 customers, including the likes of Opendoor. \n1. Process more than $5B in loan volume per day on average\n2. Ended 2020 with 291 total customers, used by 31 of the top 100 U.S. financial firms and 24 of the top 100 non-mortgage bank lenders\n3. Saw banking transaction volume growth of 190% YoY% with 2020 dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 162%. (This DBNRR is Twilio, Snowflake, Zoom levels)\n4. Saw revenue growth of 90% YoY, $50.7M -&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; 96M\n5. Non-GAAP gross margin was 66% last quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was (73)% last quarter, up from (127)% in Q1\u201920.\n6. 18 customers paid more than $1M a year, comprising 53% of 2020 revenue ($50.1M). By dividing the $50.1M of 2020 revenue attributable to those customers by 18, it shows those customers pay $2.8M annually on average.\n7. Revenue from their largest customer, which they disclose as \u201cCustomer A\u201d, was $12.5M or 13% of total revenue in 2020. By subtracting that $12.5M of revenue from the $50.1M of revenue mentioned above and dividing that figure by 17, it shows that customers paying over $1M, excluding the single largest customer, pay ~$2.3M annually on average.\n8. As of March 31, 2021, Blend\u2019s product portfolio consisted of 7 primary software products, and 61% of customers were using two or more products or marketplaces.\n\nAcquisition: \nBlend made a large acquisition of a company called Title365, a title insurance agency, in March-2021 for $422.1M. Title365 did $212.1M of revenue in 2020. Title365 will be integrated with our software platform, which enables financial services firms to automate title commitments and streamline communication with consumers and settlement teams. The transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of this year. \n\nCompetitors:\nInclude Black Knight, Ice Mortgage Technology, nCino, Qualia\n\nAdditional info:\nBLND IPO'd on 7/15 at $18 per share, raising $335 million after subtracting fees. They will report their first ER on 8/19. \nTheir lockup expires 1/12/22 (so no unexpected dumping in the next couple months at minimum). \n\nPosition:\n1,000 shares at $18.06 cost average\n\nSource:\n1. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001855747/000119312521194971/d162671ds1.htm\n2. https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=1164602-98089\n3. https://www.meritechcapital.com/blog/blend-ipo-s-1-breakdown\n4. https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/05/blend-and-the-simplification-of-consumer-finance/\n\n\nNot financial advice.\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy ER projection, price closes above $20 on Thursday and shoots up to $25+ AH.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nMute response to ER numbers so far, dropped from $19.79 to $17.95. Maybe we\u2019ll have to wait for another ER. Let\u2019s see how the call goes. \n\nAdded 1,000 more shares at $18.15 to make my new total position 2,000 shares at $18.12 average cost.\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nWrong on market reaction to ER. Very disappointed in the executive team as it seemed that they either did not prep enough or the call was not a priority for them. Also the decisions to not disclose and breakdown certain data around revenue, pipeline, gross profit is concerning\u2026in addition to not offering any closing remarks \ud83e\udd28.\n\nI still remain bullish on the market, products, and customers, but have tempered expectations on timing. Thought this would receive much more love from the markets but the CC did not particularly instill confidence. \n\nHolding long, waiting for the next ER. Will cut under $16 if it gets there.\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nGlad to see this recover next day. $18 seems to be a magnet. If this was truly bad then it\u2019d be dumping even more but it\u2019s getting bought up as of 7 am PT. Holding long!\n\nEDIT 5:\n\nWas wrong on this. Cut at $16 for loss. Will be looking for the next play.
