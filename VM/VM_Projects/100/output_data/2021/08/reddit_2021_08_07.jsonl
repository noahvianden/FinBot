{"title": "Charting the Jobs number: Almost a quarter were government jobs", "selftext": " This article first appeared on SchiffGold.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe BLS provides an employment picture of the US on the first Friday of every month. It estimates how many jobs were added or subtracted by sector. While some of the assumptions may be controversial (e.g.\u00a0[the birth death model](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm)) and job numbers are prone to revisions, it remains the most widely anticipated statistic each month by the financial markets. Inflation is now coming in at a close second.\n\nConsidering its popularity, the job numbers are heavily analyzed by many sources. This article tries to use visuals and historical data to provide greater insight and perspective.\n\nRecent Trends\n\nThe latest jobs number showed an increase of 943k jobs, above expectations by 100k. Unfortunately, 240k gains came from government employment which are non-productive jobs and weigh on the economy. As shown below, 943k is above the recent trend, and the largest monthly gain since August 2020. Leisure and Hospitality continue to show the biggest gains, which is not surprising considering the massive layoffs they saw early in the pandemic and that unemployment benefits have recently been removed in some states. The unemployment rate ticked down from 5.9% to 5.4%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 1: Change by sector](https://preview.redd.it/l0qgvuf7vxf71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb73671f483c02e3694b8e4d2ceaacfc935b8f6)\n\n \n\nThis next chart compares the current month with the trailing 12 month average. A few key takeaways:\n\n* Government was well above average. 240k added vs -2k avg\n* Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Health nearly doubled the TTM average\n* Construction, Professional Business, and Trade/Transport/Utilities were all below TTM average\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 2: Current vs TTM](https://preview.redd.it/5qgkztc9vxf71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e5460384532f457c80fbe3e7272ac776c494561)\n\n \n\nThe table below gives a much more detailed breakdown of the numbers and the entire labor force. Some key takeaways:\n\n* Government job increases were dominated by local governments (+230k) vs 18k in Federal and -8k at the State level\n* Leisure and Hospitality have seen the biggest 12 month rebound, averaging 196k a month. This has accelerated in recent months to 364k likely a result of expiring unemployment benefits as stated above.  \n\n   * Even with these gains, it is still down 7.7% from where it was 3 years ago\n* Mining and Logging is still down 14.6% but the recent recovery has doubled from 3.7k TTM vs 6k in the current period.\n* Trade, Transportation, and Utilities is the largest sector (27k) but growth in jobs slowed in the recent period to 47k down from a TTM avg of 97k\n* In aggregate the job market is still 1.5% smaller than it was 3 years ago\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 3: Labor Market Detail](https://preview.redd.it/vyh2bi3bvxf71.png?width=2895&format=png&auto=webp&s=71720ab4b68996af92184a32d9bf10f792e6560f)\n\n REVISIONS\n\nAs mentioned, this data is subject to revisions as new data becomes available. While the headline release gets a ton of market attention, the revisions get far less. The table below shows the impact of the revisions over different time periods. Please note this is as of the prior month since the most recent month has not seen any revisions. Important items to note:\n\n* The recent three month period has been revised up by 48.7k a month\n* The biggest upward revisions were seen in Leisure/Hospitality and Trade/Transportation\n* Over the last year, revisions have been positive of nearly 40k a month or about 500k in aggregate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure: 4 Revisions ](https://preview.redd.it/666vu0zevxf71.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=337e43cc744c312e389ed75e8b2df3648591ad3e)\n\n**Historical Perspective**\n\nThe chart below shows data going back to 1955. As the labor force has grown in total aggregate numbers, the recessions along the way have caused dips in the general trend. The Covid recession can be seen as the greatest job market loss since 1955. The chart also shows how much work the labor market still requires to regain the employment level seen prior to Covid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 5: Historical Labor Market](https://preview.redd.it/j67frizqvxf71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=27b3c3d771fd476182a4a02435b78fa00ebde0ed)\n\n The distribution of the workforce has changes significantly over the last 65+ years. Although the unemployment rate has been sharply falling over the last year (chart above), the labor force participation (61.7%) is still well below 18 months ago (63.2%) and much lower than the 66% pre financial crisis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 6: Labor Market Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/z8w78aqsvxf71.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dbacffe28d36080d9ede10fa9465917528113e6)\n\n \n\nThe stock market is hyper focused on the labor market because the Fed uses the data as one of its primary drivers for monetary policy. Although jobs data is seen as a lagging indicator, a strong labor market would more likely result in a tighter Fed. Weak job numbers allow the Fed to be more accommodating in monetary policy. This will result in more quantitative easing, growing [the fed balance sheet](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/fed-balance-sheet-july-2021-143b-added/). Additionally, fiscal support may be stronger in a weak labor market coupled with falling tax revenues. This could put more strain on [the federal budget](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/us-budget-deficit-analysis-june-2021/) which will only increases the [total debt outstanding](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/us-debt-analysis-june-2021/).\n\nWhile the market may anticipate tighter monetary policy and less fiscal support in a strong labor market, [the Fed is painted into a corner](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) and cannot scale back the monetary stimulus without devastating the economy.", "id": "oztfe7", "created_utc": 1628343545.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|64|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obufn3/the_fed_in_a_box_part_2_they_cannot_end/) \n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16078908741474152}, {"body": "This is more doomer bullshit trying to sell gold and silver.\n\nThe fact these are state and local government jobs, as opposed to federal, is VERY reassuring.

Many sectors of the private economy are also deeply uncompetitive and aren't properly regulated to maximise competition.\n\nThe idea is that due to competitive pressures, there are fewer private bullshit jobs than government bullshit jobs, and private firms that have too much bullshit will be forced to scale back the bullshit or go bust.

There were many funds back in 2000 focused on innovation, just like ARK. Nearly all of them dissolved after losing 80-90+% in a single year after spectacular gains the year before. When you invested in these funds, you were supposedly \"gaining broad exposure to the sector.\" So one way of investing in tech (the Nasdaq) lead to great success over 20 years (mostly because of companies that didn't exist back then), while another (most tech-focused ETFs) lead to bankruptcy.\n\nI don't disagree that buying and holding the Nasdaq was a bad investment--I mean, you can't argue with the numbers. But the valuations for most of the tech companies that existed back in 2000 were not justified, given that most of them went bankrupt just a few years later. If you hadn't bought the Nasdaq, but instead had bought all of the stocks themselves and held, that would have been a bad investment.
