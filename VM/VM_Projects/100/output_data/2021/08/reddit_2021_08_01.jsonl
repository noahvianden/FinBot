I've never done much with ITM options outside of buying them for leverage using LEAPS.\n\nHere's my thesis:\n\nI want to make an outsized bet that there will be some black swan event soon that could send the market toppling, or that inflation will start to get out of control fast and JPOW will do a 180 and go Paul Vlocker on this party and brutally murder the bull.\n\nIn the event of raising interest rates or a sudden and severe downturn, I suspect zombie companies will start to blow up left and right. The HYG ETF is comprised of junk bonds, many of which are companies I would consider teetering, especially if we have a rapid onset recession or rapid interest rate increases.\n\nI was looking into selling ITM call credit spreads as a way to short the fund, with limited loss potential and without having to payout the dividend, pay borrow fees, or margin interest like I would if I was directly short.\n\nLooking at specifically selling the $70c and buying the $88c for as close to $18 a spread as I can get. Experation can be variable but I'm looking for in the next 6 months.\n\nLet's say I'm able to sell this spread for $17.95 and I sell 1000 of them. That's $1,795,000 in premium collected. If HYG collapses below $70c before expiration most of the intrinsic value will evaporate and I can close anywhere between break even and a $ million + payday. If I'm wrong I lose $0.05 ($5 per contract) per spread plus commission costs. ($5000 + $1300). So for a max loss of $6300 I could potentially make up to $1.7 million by shorting junk bonds when everyone is uncertain of the future.\n\nThe only risk I see is if I get assigned early, I'll have to exercise my long leg early to cover the short created on my assigned short call. Even in this case I only lose $5 per contract that gets assigned early on me.\n\nThe other \"risk\" I see is there's no way I can get filled that close to the risk free rate. ($18 a spread between $70c and $88c) maybe I'll have to adjust to $17.90 in which case max loss is $11,300. Or $17.85 where max loss is $16300.\n\nSo long as I can get reasonably close it seems like an absolute insane payout for just taking on early assignment risk.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nAm I really that likely to get assigned early on my short $70c leg?\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.", "id": "ovm8dq", "created_utc": 1627794727.0, "score": 181, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "Step 1: manage to get a good fill.  \nStep 2: manage to get a good fill.  \nStep 3: repeat step 1 & 2  \nTLDR; Doubt you'll get >=17.85 credit per spread", "score": 118, "replies": [{"body": "I see you factored $1300 commision into your calculation.\n\nBefore you place your trade, consider calling your brokerage to negotiate your 0.65 commision down.

Meanwhile I don't see companies like intel's mobile eye or waymo holding big hour long recruitment drive presentations where they try and get smart people to come work for them by getting technical about their self driving tech.

{"title": "There is a risk I'm overlooking and I'm asking for your help to find it. I think I found free money and don't want to be the next 1r0nyman.", "selftext": "I've traded options for a couple years, mostly using theta decay strategies (the wheel, sometimes OTM spreads) and rarely buying far OTM calls and puts as lottery ticket plays. I've never done much with ITM options outside of buying them for leverage using LEAPS.\n\nHere's my thesis:\n\nI want to make an outsized bet that there will be some black swan event soon that could send the market toppling, or that inflation will start to get out of control fast and JPOW will do a 180 and go Paul Vlocker on this party and brutally murder the bull.\n\nIn the event of raising interest rates or a sudden and severe downturn, I suspect zombie companies will start to blow up left and right. The HYG ETF is comprised of junk bonds, many of which are companies I would consider teetering, especially if we have a rapid onset recession or rapid interest rate increases.\n\nI was looking into selling ITM call credit spreads as a way to short the fund, with limited loss potential and without having to payout the dividend, pay borrow fees, or margin interest like I would if I was directly short.\n\nLooking at specifically selling the $70c and buying the $88c for as close to $18 a spread as I can get. Experation can be variable but I'm looking for in the next 6 months.\n\nLet's say I'm able to sell this spread for $17.95 and I sell 1000 of them. That's $1,795,000 in premium collected. If HYG collapses below $70c before expiration most of the intrinsic value will evaporate and I can close anywhere between break even and a $ million + payday. If I'm wrong I lose $0.05 ($5 per contract) per spread plus commission costs. ($5000 + $1300). So for a max loss of $6300 I could potentially make up to $1.7 million by shorting junk bonds when everyone is uncertain of the future.\n\nThe only risk I see is if I get assigned early, I'll have to exercise my long leg early to cover the short created on my assigned short call. Even in this case I only lose $5 per contract that gets assigned early on me.\n\nThe other \"risk\" I see is there's no way I can get filled that close to the risk free rate. ($18 a spread between $70c and $88c) maybe I'll have to adjust to $17.90 in which case max loss is $11,300. Or $17.85 where max loss is $16300.\n\nSo long as I can get reasonably close it seems like an absolute insane payout for just taking on early assignment risk.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nAm I really that likely to get assigned early on my short $70c leg?\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.", "id": "ovmgi3", "created_utc": 1627795797.0, "score": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|119|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.024733826518058777}, {"body": "If you short a deep ITM call with no option value then you will 100% be assigned right before the next ex-div date.

{"title": "What's really going on with inflation?", "selftext": "In June 2021 inflation increased **5.4%** compared to June 2020 ([official release](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we look at who were the main contributors of inflation, we see that *Used Cars & Trucks* increased **10%** from March to April, **7.3%** from April to May and **10.5%** from May to June. The weight of *Used Cars & Trucks* in the CPI is 3.166% (see Relative Importance column [here](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm)), which means that in the last three months, **0.96%** of the CPI increase was due to an increase in prices of *Used Cars & Trucks*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue seems to be the global semiconductor shortage, that is slowing the production of Cars in the US and worldwide (for example: [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-16/record-used-car-prices-can-t-keep-buyers-away)). I'm however wondering if this is true (or fully true). If we look at the price increase for new cars, we can see that the price increase is \"just\" 5.3% compared to last year. Why would used cars prices increase 45% in one year while the new cars prices increased just by 5.3%? If there is a global shortage, shouldn't the prices of new cars also skyrocket?\n\n[\\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/hvkpfvznvqe71.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=080f3e70cbe2109e47b0eb14fd703204be09cd8f)\n\nI also checked the how prices of electronic devices (such as smartphones, PCs, etc.) changed in the last year. In the image below you can see their prices deceased by 17.8%. So if there is a global shortage of chips that slowed down the production of cars and therefore increased the price of used cars, why price of electronic devices didn't increase accordingly?\n\n[\\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/h5gkptzrvqe71.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce4268562d01db3fe0d270a7a62c29ef5e58fcc)\n\nFinally, if we look at how the cost of renting cars and trucks increased over the last year, we see it increased by a whopping 87.7%, of which 45% just in the last 3 months.\n\n[\\(The first column is the weight in CPI, the second column is the YoY price change\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dy59zcnuvqe71.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad878d60d821705920a83cf078bd476084d2fc41)\n\nSo my theory is that partially the increase is due to the semiconductor shortage, but most of the recent increase in used and cars prices, is the fact that due to re-opening economy people are traveling more and therefore renting more cars. As [this article](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/europe-car-rental-carmageddon-cmd/index.html) mentions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Essentially, car hire companies tend to order their fleets about two or three months in advance, at the start of the year -- and, having been stung with the low demand last year, they hedged their bets this year.*\n\n*In fact, Sixt confirmed to CNN that its latest figures show that for Q1 of 2021, it had 93,200 cars across its global network. That compares to 130,900 in Q1 of 2020, and 129,200 for the same period in 2019. That's a 29% decrease in vehicles, year on year.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at how the increases in car prices happened, the increase is mostly happened in the last 3 months, with the coming of summer, while before the increases were minimal, while the global semiconductor shortage was well known already in Q4-2020. So should we expect this increase in Used Cars & Trucks to vanish by the end of the summer?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd be happy to hear your thoughts.", "id": "ovruu7", "created_utc": 1627823482.0, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|10|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08002717047929764}, {"body": "And people keep ignoring the shipping crisis happening world wide right now\u2026\u2026\ud83d\udc3b", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "Is that why my fentanyl... wait, no, I mean teddy bear... is still stuck in customs?", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": ">Our border patrol agents are being overwhelmed by the 4th straight month of more than 170,000 apprehensions, have seized enough fentanyl this year to kill the entire U.S. population three times over.\n\nSource: My representative's weekly newsletter.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Didnt have this problem with Trump.

Media loves to call it a shortage but it\u2019s only partly true. In regular times, all companies that require semi conductors (car manufacturers, phone manufacturers, laptop manufacturers, etc) place an order with the semi conductors manufacturers and their order gets added to the queue. They usually wait for a few months/a year to get their order as the manufacturer moves up the queue and completes orders. During normal times, the wait time is predictable and is accounted for when companies place in their orders. They will usually place orders to receive semi conductors in 6 months time, but will place orders every month so they will always receive a batch every month\n\nWhen Covid hit, the car manufacturers all thought that demand for new cars would crater for the next few years. So what did they do? They canceled all their pending orders in the queue. When demand fell for a few months and then sharply rebounded, they scrambled to place new orders but now all of them were at the back of the queue, behind all the other industries that didn\u2019t cancel their orders like the laptop and phone manufacturers. So now they have all these semi conductors orders but they\u2019re at the back of the line, behind everyone else. \n\nSo yes, there have been some production delays in semiconductors in general and yes, there have been some shipping delays but the major problem for car manufacturers is that they fucked themselves royally in March/April 2020 and canceled all their pending orders for chips that were supposed to be shipped to them from Oct 2020 until now. The back log of semi conductors for the car industry is so large now that it will be some time before we see prices going down (read at least 2022).\n\nLook at the other industries. The phone manufacturers are having to deal with the decreased supply and the shipping delays but they are not jacking up prices like crazy, used iPhones aren\u2019t shooting up in price.

If there is a global shortage, shouldn't the prices of newcars also skyrocket?\"\n\nThe prices for new cars in germany didnt change at all, but you will get less discount if you buy new ones (that are on stock). Whilst the used car market skyrocketed (at least by our standards). The ADAC (one of the biggest institutions that track lots of stuff from the automotive branch) just released a paper that issued used cars have increased by around 2.700\u20ac compared to last year, the average price for a used car was \\~22.700\u20ac, so its a 10%+ increase.\n\nI work in a wholesale dealershop with huge discounts anyways, so our prices didnt got effected at all. But friends in the industry, who work at retail dealerships, told me that the discounts on new cars decreased by 3-4%.\n\nSo, at least for the german market, I can confirm that used cars increased much more in price that new cars actually did. Between june, july, august, the automotive market usually dries up, so I dont expect any movement at all. If there is any movement in a direction ,it will be at end of the year. But as long Mercedes unofficialy confirms (realistic) 1,5 years delivery time for a GLB, Skoda 1,3 years for the Kodiaq and VW 1,5 years for the ID3 - I dont see a drop in price for used cars in the near future.\n\nI heard about price corrections on top of MSRP (like market value correction costs or something), that's simply not possible in the EU, because its against the law. In Fact, a MSRP is only interesting for people who want to buy the car for a company, because its the base value to calculate the taxes for using the car in your company. \n\nThe prices in europe only change due to the discount of the MSRP, depending on the manufacturer a usual discount is between 5-15% off MSRP.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6738231778144836}, {"body": "Chip shortages far more pronounced for new vehicles.

I was literally feeding you guys free plays every day, so y\u2019all have no excuses for finishing out the week red. **$SBUX netted us maximum gain on our spreads (125%), $FB netted maximum gain on our spreads (100%), and $PINS netted us 65% on our strangles and 355% on our binary options!** Three for three again this week, with no plans of slowing down! We\u2019ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, so there\u2019s no shortage of opportunities to make some money. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Wednesday AH has a load favorable trades.** $ROKU, $FSLY, $ETSY, $LMND, $BNGO all have an average move of over 10%, and are all set to report on Wednesday. If you\u2019re looking to gamble, I would personally roll the dice on one of these companies since they have the highest likelihood of providing us with a profitable moonshot which will greatly offset the IV crush we\u2019ll experience. Since they\u2019re reporting Wednesday after hours, the options for them will be *incredibly cheap* because they will only have one day left before they expire, and theta will have made them close to worthless. **Cheap options, huge potential moves.** What\u2019s there not to love? The best part is, many of these options are priced inefficiently. At the time of writing, $ROKU has a projected move of 8% but often moves double that. The same goes for $FSLY. These ratios will only get better for us throughout the week as theta does its thing. I\u2019ll likely throw on a couple of straddles right before close on Wednesday.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.**  Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you\u2019re bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we\u2019ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, IV will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [**here.**](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Avoid $BABA and $NKLA like the plague.** Both companies are getting hammered due to outside circumstances, meaning that earnings will have very little to no impact on their overall stock prices. $BABA is getting smacked around by the Chinese government, and $NKLA is facing round 8 or 9 of fraud charges. I have no stake in either company, nor do I ever plan to, but I know some idiots will inevitably try buying the dip thinking they\u2019re Warren Buffet. Do not play $NKLA or $BABA this week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, I haven\u2019t had much time to review any extra trades given that I\u2019ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got a wild week ahead! Lots of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies across many different sectors are set to report, meaning we\u2019ve got some huge opportunities to generate some serious alpha. If you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WFvWUJb_E02c7xBqPN92uxmvUjvKC4noNDRJLXGNfUo/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment!
