Probably not viable for the US since most highways are managed by the state and this would require federal level standardization, but I could see countries in the EU using a system like this. \n\nAnother alternative solution would be to use aluminum air primary cell batteries,  then replace the batteries instead of recharging them. Would require standard sized batteries but a large trucking fleet could do that. Much less weight and greater density since you only need the aluminum and the electrolyte.
