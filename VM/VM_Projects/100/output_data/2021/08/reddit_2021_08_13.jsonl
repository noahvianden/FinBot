Yes Apple will be worth much more in the future in the years to come, but that doesn't help if your account value drops 20% and your calls only covered a 2% drop.)  So diversify.

This is before they do any business.\n\nOk their revenue was up from $9.89 million to $18.4 million and they will get an additional $11 million in Q3 from Inner spirit, whatever assets Inner spirit owns will be added to this pile and their lending revenues from their latest two deals. $25,000,000 @ 5% APR and $103,000,000 @ 11.9% APR combined this is another $4.5 million per quarter in revenue. So Q3 revenue so far is at $33.9 million or estimated annual Revenue $135.6 million (to be reported Q3 2022, based on what\u2019s already in the books and assuming no growth).\n\n$135.6 \\* 10  = fair market value of that revenue of about $1.3 billion (CAD) converted to USD =  $1.083B or another $0.53 per share \n\n$0.53 + $0.52 = $1.05 USD per share in hard assets and without growth that they are currently earning in today\u2019s markets and it doesn\u2019t include INSHFs assets or deploying the remaining $450M committed to lending (at 5% is another 22,500,000 in Revenue or at 11.9% is $53,550,000) multiply this times 10 and fair market rate for that revenue = $226M to $535.5M or another 11.1 to 26.4 cents per share.\n\n$1.05+ $0.1875 (midpoint of 11.1 and 26.4) = $1.2375 per share estimated value before adding any assets INSHF may have.\n\nTLDR: If share price is below $1.2375 then you are buying at a steal based on income they can reliably capture today and in the near future. This is prior to any growth that may be available. That means the $0.78 price AH closed at today 8-12-2021 is 58.65%  lower than fair market value. Literally you just have to buy and wait for the market to figure this out to gain 50% without even thinking. If a squeeze happens you can potentially net more gains. If not well profit is profit. Also, this doesn;t even account for potential growth if USA legalizes.\n\nFull disclosure, unless it squeezes I will be buying more tomorrow. I\u2019m a stupid ape, not a financial advisor.
