{"title": "Some notes on S&P historical returns", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not a mathematician (and the last math class I took was 10 years ago), financial analyst, nor historian. I could be off base, correct me if so. I am working off of [this](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns), which doesn't factor in dividend reinvestment, and [this](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/returns), which does.\n\nEdit: Further disclaimer: It is not my intent to provide any sense of compounded growth or projections/predictions of future returns. All figures provided are purely for the sake of comparison.\n\n---\n\nThe mean return of the S&P from 1928 to 2020 is 7.78% without DRIP, and 11.89% with DRIP.\n\nHowever, factored into the mean are:\n\n2008 housing crisis crash (-38.49%/-37%)\n\n2002 dotcom/September 11th crash (-23.37%/-22.1%)\n\n2000 dotcom crash (-10.14%/-9.1% in 2000 and -13.04%/-11.89% in 2001)\n\n1973 fuel crisis crash (-17.37%/-14.66% in 1973 and -29.72%/-26.47% in 1974)\n\n1946-1948 postwar bear market (-11.87%/-8.07%, 0%/+5.71%, and -.64%/+5.5%, respectively)\n\n1939-1941 early war bear market (-5.45%/-0.41%, -15.29%/--9.78%, -17.86%/-11.59% respectively)\n\n1937 recession (-38.59%/-35.03%)\n\n1929-1932 Great Crash (-11.91%/-8.42%, -28.48%/-24.9%, -47.07%/-43.34%, -15.15%/-8.19% respectively).\n\n\nAs well as the 14 other years in which there was a bear market, correction, or returns were slightly negative or flat, for a total of 31 years of negative-or-no returns over the last 93 (i.e. 1 in 3).\n\nThis means there needs to exist sufficiently high returns in order to offset these numbers and still arrive at the 7.78%/11.89% mean.\n\n---\n\nWhen looking at averages, it's often better to look at the median - the middlemost number in a set - as it isn't getting skewed by outliers.\n\nWith every negative year in consideration, the median return comes out to 10.79% without DRIP and 14.31% with.\n\nHowever, if we only look at years with positive return, the median is 16.87% without drip and 20.05% with.\n\nThis means, since the median is the number in the middle, that half of all years have returns higher than these medians.\n\n---\n\nLet's look at the year that follows each crash:\n\n1933: 46.59%/53.99%\n\n1938: 25.21%/31.12%\n\n1975: 31.55%/37.2%\n\n1989: 27.25%/31.69%\n\n2003: 26.38%/28.68%\n\n2009: 23.45%/26.46%\n\nEvery single year after a year in which there was a crash has had a return substantially greater than the median *positive* return.\n\n---\n\nAt the beginning of this year, the S&P 500 was at 3700.65. Yesterday, August 19 2021, it was 4405.8, a 19.055% YTD return before DRIP.\n\nThis means, SPX has returned approximately 2.12%, non-compounded, per month. If it were to continue at exactly the same rate, it would close the year with a return of 25.41% before DRIP.\n\nIf this were to be the case, it would be the 20th highest pre-DRIP return over the last 93 years - barely in the top twenty percent - and still lower than all but one other post-crash year (that year itself being the start of the current bull run).\n\n---\n\nLast year's returns, from January 1 to December 31, were 16.26%/18.4%. While there was vigorous recovery from the covid crash - from a low of 2304.92 to 3756.07 EOY, an increase of nearly 63% - it is worth noting that other crashes have been precipitated by some sort of major economic crisis; energy, housing, etc. The most comparable crash to last year's, to my mind, is Black Monday 1987, which is [believed to have been caused at least in part by a computer error](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042115/what-caused-black-monday-stock-market-crash-1987.asp#:~:text=The%20%22Black%20Monday%22%20stock%20market,as%20well%20as%20investor%20panic.), and also recovered relatively quickly.\n\n---\n\nThe bull run we've been in since 2009 is not even the longest in history. From 1982 to 1999, or even 1994 if we want to avoid anything that could be reasonably described as part of the dotcom bubble, only two years - 1990 and 1994 - were negative or flat, at -6.56%/-3.1% and -1.54%/+1.32% respectively.\n\nCompare to the current bull run, in which three years have been negative or flat: 2011 at 0.00%/+2.11%, 2015 at -0.73%/+1.38%, and 2018 at -6.24%/-4.38%.\n\nLet's compare mean returns:\n\n1982-1994: 11.21%/15.44%\n\n1982-1999: 15.41%/19.12%\n\n2009-2020: 13.15%/15.53%\n\nAnd median returns:\n\n1982-1994: 12.40%/16.61%\n\n1982-1999: 16.02%/21.295%\n\n2009-2020: 13.10%/15.53%\n\nAn overall comparable performance in which the respective positive median isn't even always outperformed.\n\n---\n\nOf the top 10 years of S&P returns, only one year in the current bull run- 2013 - is in the top ten, and only three other years - 1975, 1995, and 1997 - have occurred in the last 60 years, the next most recent being 1958.\n\nThe top 5 returns by year are:\n\n1933:\t46.59%/53.99%\n\n1954:\t45.02%/52.62%\n\n1935:\t41.37%/47.67%\n\n1928:       37.88%/43.61%\n\n1958:\t38.06%/43.36%\n\nEven the lowest of which is substantially higher than the highest years (2013 and 2019) in the last 10.\n\nWhile average p/e is perhaps higher than in periods before, this is probably reflective of a shift from value into growth due to the rapid rate at which technology is improving.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**:\n\nWe live in relatively unprecedented times: technology has never advanced so quickly, people have never lived so long, the world population has never been so high, economies have never been so globalized, and emerging markets are becoming more developed. **It makes sense that we're in a period of robust expansion.** \n\nThis is not to say this bull run can't or won't ever end, or that there won't even be hiccups, but good years aren't a bad thing, they aren't necessarily a portent of bad times to come, and the last couple of years haven't even been *extraordinarily* good (thus far), at least if we're working based off of historical returns.", "id": "p85y6w", "created_utc": 1629468547.0, "score": 419, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "Good post, love the analysis.

This is certainly an experiment, and a minority (although not necessarily fringe) of economists believe that we may in fact be \"due\" for a correction \n\nEconomist and central banker William White talks about it here: [Ultra-Easy Monetary Policy and the Law of Unintended Consequences](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjEuPDZusDyAhVwRUEAHYqFBogQFnoECAMQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2RnvpT2PuFVPBdG3wJHi-C)\n\nI'd also like to note that many of the same things you're saying \"this time is different\", \"good years are good\", etc. are typical before every collapse, first and foremost the Global Financial Crisis which was the worst in human history.\n\nWhat does that mean for us investors?  Well, it probably doesn't mean you should pull out entirely and try to time the market.  That's because you can't reliably predict when a crisis will happen, and as your analysis shows, the numbers themselves don't really tell the story (although other warning signs might).  Also, you'd be foolish to miss out on the gains while you're waiting.\n\nThat said, I do believe it's always wise to be prudent. The attitude of \"good years are good\" lends itself to excessive risk taking and an underappreciation of the underlying complexity and uncertainties of the stock market and economy. This is exactly what we saw in 2008, and a lot of people got burned. Fortunately for us stock investors, however, the Fed managed to get things back under control and pumping.  Even so, William White mentions (and provides data) that with time monetary policy becomes increasingly less and less effective with increasing possibility of the occurrence of unnintended consequences. \n\nIn summary, then, despite what your analysis shows, while it is most prudent to stay in the market, it is never prudent to be caught with your pants down.

Not negative _growth_ but where the investment is actually worth less than nothing \u2026 which didn't happen.  What makes sense is geometric mean of the scale factors, not of the growth percentages.\n\nI can give an example \u2026 you've been talking about annual growth rates, so suppose we have 5 years: +15%, +10%, -30%, +25%, +12%.

Another way of saying that is `c\u2075`=1.2397, which we can recognize as the five-year scale factor.  So in this example, the representative annual scale factor is 1.0439106, so the representative annual growth is +4.39106%.  A scale factor of 1.0439106 for 5 years in a row gives you the same end state ($100\u2192$123.97) as the varying sequence above, so it can be used to summarize the effect of a year in the sequence.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the growth rates would be their sum divided by 5, or 6.4%, and the arithmetic mean of their scale factors would naturally be 1.064 \u2026 but I don't know of a calculation that could be used in.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Gotcha, thank you for taking the time to explain it to me.
