{"title": "Opinion: Value Investors are cultish and snobbish in general", "selftext": "Listing out my gripe here. I met a few value investors recently and I can't help but feel that they have this 'high and mighty' or 'know-it-all' aura that I find revolting. I shared with them that I used to be deep in TSLA (I sold them all off at 500% gain), and now in NVDA (got them way before split) and few other growth stocks popular in many of the investing subreddits, and all they did was scoff and then proceed to talk down on my approach. They even tried 'coaching' me on investing, to which I agreed because I believe that there's always knowledge that I can attained, however, it felt like a cell group meeting where they feed each other with confirmation biases.\n\nI personally hold some value stocks myself and I understand the need to look long-term when it comes to investing. But honestly, what's wrong with riding on some growth stocks for short-term gains? I genuinely feel that they are annoyed that basic investors like me are making some decent returns while they are still stuck with their marginal returns due to their stubborn philosophy in investing, and trying to read too deep in annual and financial reports. Where else for me, I get all the info I need from the simple metrics provided by Morningstar, reading financial news and of course awesome subreddit communities like this.\n\nAnyone else have similar experiences dealing with value investors?\n\nPS.

All of my analysis is based on TA but I've learned you can slide some TA forecasts in a bit better if you first throw out some fundamental guesses to support the analysis. So here goes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Billionaires leaving the planet... WTF? \n* Goldman giving buy signals... WTF? \n* If the billionaires piss off the aliens, we're all fucked! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not the focus of this post, but it's worth pointing out a volatile asset automod does not like is starting to smell suspiciously like a bull trap around 45,000. I can't say what it is, but this is the weekend and it's trading. If you can't work it out, it was never meant to be. I mention this because if there's going to be SPX crash it's likely to see more speculative things warning us the market is heading risk off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter there's been a big pullback in a trend drawing fib extensions from high to low gives very useful levels to watch if price goes back up. When we do this from the March drop it's clear to see these levels were pretty relevant to the market. With most other parts of the chart being free-flowing but these being choppy decision points. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4ds28rgh2g71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=888abde10e1d91133674c14b6a3306884d179124\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I know most of you don't give a fuck about 161s, but that's probably because you don't know about the fucking weird sketchy shit that happens around 161s. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is it in the Nasdaq of 2000 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wb8ta9ewi2g71.png?width=1439&format=png&auto=webp&s=f10405ebe3cde5cd81d345a16ad5b8b9a627e00a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a 161 of the 2007 high. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9na8us97i2g71.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=7487a185e9e5519266900dad0329d57940072afe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere it is in 2020 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7omcvshi2g71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=39448d528d00c095f5e897a5439820364903e369\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis does not happen in every crash, but if you look at every crash (In all different types of assets) and analyse the percentage of times this happens it comes out to be \"More than you'd fucking expect%\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight back to the Depression. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfgsbeumj2g71.png?width=1447&format=png&auto=webp&s=45cf8bb3fe0d38c39439ca06c5528f3ce00bf0cc\n\nYeah! I'm that fucking guy.  But that shit is true. In market tops over 100 years of charting history when prices have gotten to 161 levels of previous large pullbacks this has become a critical inflection point for the direction of the future trend. If the market is unable to hold above these levels the next bearish breakouts turn into much stronger drops. \n\nThe 161 level is an inflection point, not a certain death zone.  So if the SPX can hold above here I do think it then will probably continue to have nice upward trending properties. And I suppose that could happen. But it's not like they're leaving the fucking planet for nothing. They know something we don't. \n\nWhen a market makes a big break of these 161 levels it is usually with news.  Big news. Unexpected news. Maybe the aliens shutting off the internet or something. IDK. But watch out for news and a sharp break of the 161 (4,140 price level).
