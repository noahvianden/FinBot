If you're looking to completely bypass having an IRA and just want to open a brokerage account thinking you'll hit it big investing in individual stocks, well, you're not.

By competitors stealing market share and cutting into Tesla's sales?\n\nOK. Let's put aside the facts that no company has announced any models that compare favourably with a directly competing Telsa model on price/performance, and that no company plans to approach Tesla's current EV production capacity anytime soon.\n\nLet's assume that Tesla's share of the global BEV market will fall drastically from the 25% it owns today. \n\nBEVs [are only about 4% of the global car market](https://www.jato.com/q1-2021-ev-global-sales-at-the-same-level-as-2017-full-year-figures/) today. They will become ~100% of the global car market by 2030 or 2040, depending on whose estimates you believe.\n\nThat means BEV sales will grow from ~2.5 million per year to ~100 million+ per year in 2030 and keep growing. If TSLA loses 80% of its market share by then (down to 5% of the global market), its unit sales will still grow from 500,000 per year to 5 million.\n\nThat's 10x growth even *if* competition wipes out Tesla's market share.\n\nIn reality, competition won't dent Tesla's growth, because production is the primary constraint in the BEV market. \n\n[This chart](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7tB-bVXsAEvofO?format=jpg&name=large) illustrates the global demand curve for EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.\n\nTesla and every other carmaker will be able to sell every half-decent EV they can build, and still only meet a fraction of the demand for EVs over the next decade+.\n\nChevy will keep selling every Bolt it makes, even though nobody actually wants a Chevy Bolt.\n\nUnfortunately for traditional carmakers, their EV sales won't make up for the much greater losses in their ICE sales. They have so much capital tied up in their declining ICE production, they'll struggle to build enough EV production capacity to stay afloat.  \n\nTesla is aiming to build 20 million cars per year by 2030, and the primary limiting factor will be battery supply. It's planning to build or source 3 TWh of batteries per year by then. \n\nVolkswagen aims to overtake Tesla as the world's biggest EV maker, but it [only plans to use 300 GWh of batteries by 2030](https://driving.ca/auto-news/news/volkswagen-hikes-battery-cell-demand-in-aggressive-ev-expansion).\n\nHow is VW going to beat Tesla's EV sales with 1/10th the battery supply?\n\nHow is competition going to be a problem for Tesla if demand far outstrips supply for everyone? \n \n------------\n\n**Side note on ARK's holdings allocations**\n\nWhy are you criticizing ARK for making TSLA its largest position as it outperforms its other holdings?\n\nDon't you want your largest position to be one if its best?

Can you say inflation?\n\nPersonal savings was $1.97 trillion in the second quarter, compared with $4.07 trillion (revised) in the first quarter of 2021\n\nThe personal saving rate\u2014personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income\u2014was DOWN 10.9 percent in the second quarter, which was already DOWN 20.8 percent in the first quarter.\n\nThis means Americans have lost $3 TRILLION in savings Q2 2021 ALONE.\n\nWhere does it go? Banks and lenders?\n\nInflation seems to be the only thing that's going up this quarter.\n\n\"The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 5.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent (revised) in the first quarter...   The PCE price index increased 6.4 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent in the 1st quarter.\n\nhttps://www.bea.gov/news/2021/gross-domestic-product-second-quarter-2021-advance-estimate-and-annual-update\n\n5/1/2021 Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, on GDP and the Economy for Q1 2021\n\nThe acceleration in real GDP growth reflects artificial economic strength.\n\nThe GDP is primarily based in the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as government assistance payments were distributed to households and businesses. An acceleration in consumer spending and upturns in federal as well as state and local government spending more than accounted for the acceleration in real GDP.\n\nThese were partly offset by downturns in private inventory investment and exports and by decelerations in residential fixed investment and nonresidential fixed investment. Imports slowed.\n\nThe US Economy by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis says;\n\n\"The acceleration in consumer spending reflected an upturn in spending on goods and an acceleration in spending on services.\n\nWithin goods, all components of both durable and nondurable goods contributed to the upturn. The leading contributors were upturns in spending on motor vehicles and parts as well as on food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption.\n\nWithin services, the leading contributors to the acceleration were upturns in spending on food services and accommodations and on transportation services.\n\nAn upturn in federal government spending was the second largest contributor to the acceleration in real GDP. The upturn primarily reflected an upturn in nondefense spending on intermediate goods and services purchased by government. In the first quarter, the processing and administration of Paycheck Protection Program loan applications by banks on behalf of the federal government added approximately $13.2 billion ($52.6 billion at an annual rate) to nondefense services. Federal government purchases of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution to the public contributed to the upturn in nondefense goods.\n\nThe upturn in state and local government spending reflected an upturn in consumption expenditures, led by compensation of employees, that was partly offset by a downturn in gross investment, led by a downturn in structures.\n\nThe downturn in private inventory investment was led by a larger decrease in retail trade and a downturn in manufacturing. Within retail trade, the largest contributor was a larger decrease in inventory investment by motor vehicle dealers. Within manufacturing, there were downturns in both durable and nondurable goods manufacturing inventory investment.\n\nThe downturn in exports reflected downturns in both goods (led by a deceleration in industrial supplies and a downturn in foods, feeds, and beverages) and services (led by a deceleration in transport and a downturn in royalties and license fees).\n\nResidential fixed investment slowed, largely reflecting a slowdown in new residential structures, notably single-family units, and a downturn in brokers' commissions.\n\nNonresidential fixed investment slowed, reflecting a slowdown in investment in equipment that was partly offset by a smaller decrease in investment in structures. Investment in intellectual property products grew at about the same rate as in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe slowdown in equipment investment was more than accounted for by a slowdown in transportation equipment that was partly offset by an acceleration in information processing equipment.\n\nThe smaller decrease in structures was more than accounted for by a smaller decrease in investment in industrial structures.\n\nImports slowed. As a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, imports contributed to the acceleration in first-quarter GDP. The main contributor was a downturn in automotive vehicles, engines, and parts\"\n\nCan you say they're taking our jobs overseas?

Inflation rises in 2021 to its highest rate since 2008 as increases in the supply of goods and services lag behind increases in the demand for them. By 2022, supply adjusts more quickly, and inflation falls but remains above its prepandemic rate through 2025. As the economy continues to expand over the forecast period, the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes rises, reaching 2.7 percent in 2025 and 3.5 percent in 2031\u2014still low by historical standards.\"\n\nBut unemployment hasn't decreased at all.\n\n7/21/2021 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released report states, \"The national unemployment rate, 5.9 percent, was little changed over the month\"\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/unemployment-rates-lower-in-49-states-and-dc-from-june-2020-to-june-2021.htm\n\n...\n\nPart 3 of 4\n\nThe Debt Ceiling Dillema\n\n\"A two-year deal to suspend the debt ceiling lapsed at midnight (7/31/21) following inaction from Congress and President Biden to give the U.S. more borrowing authority. The Treasury Department will now begin taking what it refers to as \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debt.\"\n\n\"Republican leaders have told Democrats that there can be no bipartisan debt ceiling agreement without a slate of debt reduction measures targeting the roughly $28 trillion national debt. Several GOP lawmakers have floated a deal similar to the 2011 Budget Control Act, which ended a debt ceiling standoff shortly before the U.S. suffered its first ever credit downgrade.\"\n\nCBO says, \"the Treasury would probably run out of cash sometime in the first quarter of the next fiscal year (which begins on October 1, 2021, most likely in October or November, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.\n\nThe timing and size of revenue collections and outlays over the coming months could differ noticeably from CBO's projections. Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, either earlier or later than CBO projects.\n\nYellen has also said uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic and the federal government's fiscal response has made it harder to pin down exactly how long the U.S. to avoid a default.\"\n\nYellen stated that the default could happen as soon as early September.\n\nThis means we could see the US Treasury's ability to pay almost all bills completely crippled well before or after Congress' return to duty as they just began a 6 week vacation on 7/31/21.\n\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/finance/565745-missed-debt-ceiling-deadline-kicks-off-high-stakes-fight\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-29/the-federal-debt-limit-political-drama%3f_amp=true\n\nOur GDP is a complete farce that was being held up by stimulus payments, government covid spending, Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Agreements of Treasury Bills to the tune of now over $1 Trillion per day, imports and exports are down huge while sea ports are more severely congested than ever before as are airline cargo carriers.

See screenshot for explanation of subsection 22 losses description.\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/\n\nAll of the 11 Tables provided shows an increase of losses.\n\nThe only table pictured is TABLE 2 showing an increase of $1.54 Trillion in unrealized losses in the form of derivatives, securities, swaps, etc...\n\nOn Table 2 (of 11) alone, their RESIDUAL Assets (less liabilities) <minus expenses> increased only $40 Billion compared to the $1.54 Trillion increase in losses.\n\nSo even though they had huge increases in revenue (covid stimulus), the net gain was hugely diminished by the losses in these sectors.\n\n6/28/2021\n\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency released report stated that 4 large banks held 89 percent of the total banking industry notional amount of derivatives, a total of 1,385 insured U.S. commercial banks and savings associations held derivatives at the end of first quarter 2021.\n\nAdditionally,\n\nderivative contracts remained concentrated in interest rate products, which represented 72.7 percent of total derivative notional amounts.\n\nthe percentage of centrally cleared derivatives transactions increased quarter-over-quarter to 38.2 percent in first quarter 2021.\n\nhttps://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities/index-quarterly-report-on-bank-trading-and-derivatives-activities.html\n\nIn 2011, gridlocked House Republicans and the Obama White House came within days of a drop-dead default over the debt ceiling. The S&P 500 fell for five days in a row leading up to the weekend that lawmakers finally struck a deal. Over 4% of the entire stock market was lost in those 5 days.\n\nTLDR; \nI plan to invest heavily in stonks who's beta runs inverse to the market, such as good old movie and game stonks because when the market goes down, they'll come up. Sadly, many Americans will lose their homes, businesses, savings, 401ks, likely more so than in 2008. There's no TLDR for what is posted above. Read it, or don't, I don't care. \n\n-- I'm currently \"banned\" as I didn't know what position screenshots meant when I join. Awaiting moderator reply.

Used to code in Assembly Language too at one point.\n\nI knew at some point Ryzen chips started gaining attention. Almost all articles were citing it as groundbreaking and 1st time nearing Intel's performance. I started with $1000 bucks when AMd was at $2, Sold at $4. Then again entered when AMD was at $6 and sold at $9.\n\nMeanwhile I used to recommend this stock to my Boss, Friends, Relatives, Almost everyone and most laughed off at me. Yea life sucks. Anyways in 2017 when AMD was at $13-$14 I gathered majority of my savings, Took some margin and got 4500 shares (Almost $50K).\n\nI havnt sold a single share and sitting on almost $500K. \n\nThere were crashes like the Oct to Dec 2018 selloff when AMD dropped to $9 and I had a margin call, had to immediately transfer funds to avoid selloff.
