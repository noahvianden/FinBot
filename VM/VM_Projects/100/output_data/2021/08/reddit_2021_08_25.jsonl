Their architecture is a step beyond Nvidia's GPU based stuff, but Nvidia is pretty entrenched now.\n\nThat makes Nvidia the incumbent, and the new pure NN oriented architectures the would-be disruptors. So it's one of those stories. In particular: A pure NN oriented architecture doesn't seem like it would be able to map to the other things Nvidias stack does, which leaves Nvidia with three choices:\n\n1. Stick with their own stuff (the original Intel play)\n2. Bet on both old and new stuff (the Itanium Intel play)\n3. Ditch the old stuff entirely and jump to the new stuff (the Apple 6502 -> 68k, 68k -> PPC, PPC -> Intel, Intel -> ARM play(s))\n\nWe all love a good disruption story, but in reality we hardly ever hear about the failed attempts. Time will tell. But it will probably tell rather quickly.\n\nI think it's encouraging that Tesla is doing what they are doing. They have an internal need for this so they are their own business case, and you know, if they can do it, many other AI oriented companies can. The big story these days (that you for some reason hardly hear of) is that designing very specific silicon for your workload is becoming a viable option for many companies for lots of reasons. Apple and Tesla are just some of the first movers here.\n\nNB: This does not in any way mean that Tesla will sell the D1 hardware to others. They may cloud-rent it out, but I expect they will be best served here by working with a partner (like Azure).\n\nAlso: For all the fancy words that were said about the D1 at the AI day, it seem to me that it's actually a fairly SIMPLE design, from an architectural point of view. It's almost like a repeat of the old RISC vs. CISC days.\n\nFor those who weren't around for that. There was a sudden realization that by doing away with a bunch of complexity in CPU design and focusing only on the core workloads, you could actually build a CPU that beat the crap out of the state of the art. A BUNCH of companies that used to use off-the-shelf CPUs built their own, and some that had their own classical archs abandoned them for the new wave. Among the former were Acorn (6502 -> ARM) and Sun (68K -> SPARC). Among the latter were DEC (VAX -> Alpha). The major chip makers tried to hedge their bets (several times). In the end Intel stuck with their guns, and Motorola bet the farm on Power PC.\n\nToday all major CPU architectures are kind of a hybrid between RISC and CISC, so perhaps that will be the final outcome of this AI war?\n\nEDIT: Notably, [Jim Keller](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16762/an-anandtech-interview-with-jim-keller-laziest-person-at-tesla) worked at DEC during the RISC days, then took his experience to AMD, designed the HW3 chip and most likely had a LOT of influence, perhaps even input, on the D1. I would be super super interested in hearing his thought on the D1.\n\nEDIT2: [Apparently so did Ganesh, who is lead on Dojo](https://twitter.com/MatthewRideout/status/1428704323261943810)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl", "intc", "nvda", "amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.275375634431839}, {"body": "Followed a Model 3 dual motor part of the way home today.

Looking at the chart below, it is only a matter of time before SPY decides to dump its pants. I'm not saying a recession type of drop, but at least a small correction. My target would be the blue zone marked below, but I would expect at least a retest of 400 at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otk9bws3bej71.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=e308ef6d7b168dcf9c1d3bb4c94c8d4ec80c5d7d\n\nNow on to our memes. BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little.

Stock price is almost meaningless. You need stock price times shares outstanding, or the market cap. BABA market cap is 466B and AMZN market cap is 1.67T according to google. \n\nThat means BABA is worth 1/3.5 of AMZN not 1/20th\n\nGoogle search also tells me that BABA\u2019s 2020 operating income is 12.9B and that of AMZN is 22.9B. Suggesting AMZN brings in twice as much profit as BABA. (This is a second of google search so don\u2019t kill me if these aren\u2019t accurate)\n\nInvestors may also see more growth potential in AMZN, especially since it has had more growth than BABA over the past 3 years, percent-wise. And, AMZN has a more diversified business than BABA and, in my opinion, a more innovative one. AMZN\u2019s AWS is an especially valuable business, with insane growth potential.\n\nBased on that 30 seconds of googling AMZN being worth 3.5 times as much as BABA is more than reasonable. IMO it could be worth even 5 times as much as BABA.\n\nEDIT: Oh, also, buying shares of Chinese companies in the US, even if they\u2019re listed in the US, like BABA, has inherent risks.

You can imagine what kind of mindset he has when you take a non-technical bean counter who runs the finances for the company and becomes the CEO of a tech company. He had heavy incentives in his contract iirc that would give him a huge payday if he increased the stock by a certain amount and it held for a month. He accomplished that and the stock plummeted hard afterward. He just prolonged our slow decline. \n\nMy org isn't in the CPU business but we work with the fab in New Mexico. A lot of my coworkers transferred internally from the Oregon/Arizona site as well. My understanding is that these fabs are on old node technology and they're pretty much only staying alive through some business within Intel like mine. We can't risk the down time in the case they're upgraded, so the best option is to build a new fab which Pat is already going. Obviously that's going to take years, but when they do and if the yield on their chips is high, I'm going to be bullish on INTC.\n\nFor those that don't know, Intel designs and manufactures their own chips, whereas companies like AMD, Apple, Nvidia all go through TSMC. This means Intel has a huge advantage in terms of cost cutting since they do everything themselves (although Intel is going through TSMC for some production). \n\nI have a lot of RSUs that I've just been holding onto over the years but I will admit it would have benefited me a ton had I just sold it and invested it elsewhere.

The mobile industry has been headed that way for years. \n\nIntel solution has been to stay with their old architecture rather than redesigning, and developing more power efficient x86 chips. This is the case with their Core2Duo Mobile line. These however come at the expense of processing power. The advantage is that there is a lot more native compatibility for apps in operating systems that does not require software emulation. Software emulation eats up processing power, but Apple\u2019s new Rosetta 2 software emulation looks extremely promising. \n\nCompetitors such as Apple/TSMC and Qualcomm have been optimizing this energy use/processor power curve for years. If I recall correctly TSMC latest process uses 3 nm transistors, while Intel is locked on 5 or 6 nm process. Smaller transistors essentially means more processor power/clock speed in the same size package. \n\nIf Moore\u2019s Law holds true, then the number of transistors on a given circuit will double every two years, essentially doubling processing power. It\u2019s a more complicated concept, but you get the idea. Short of Intel having a secret project in their pocket, I think the train has left without them. \n\nTL;DR: Even if their fundamentals and technicals look alright, Intel is peddling an outdated product that is quickly being passed by competitors. \n\nLook up ARM vs x86 on Wikipedia and look at the dates introduced for the original standards and then the current 64 bit version.

That was inevitable.\n\nOn top of that, it's kind of welcomed. Intel was the only data center chip in the game at all for years, ever since AMD just completely boned themselves out of that market a long time ago.\n\nSo you have all these companies around the world that only have one source for their chips; Intel, and those companies absolutely hate that. If AMD came out with a chip that was worse in performance and cost more, AAPL AMZN etc would still buy it just to have that second option. They do not like Intel having a grip on things.\n\nAs you may know, Intel are working to become a Foundry and make chips for other players in the market.

Autonomous driving is pretty hard, Google can barely get Waymo to work, Uber pretty much closed their autonomous driving unit, Lyft sold theirs...

Insofar as there being any hope of a recovery, the same could be asked of any company not running on all cylinders. It's not as if Intel is the only laggard company out there. If you are familiar with their product line, their plan ahead, and believe they have a way forward, then you have your investment thesis. And like any idea or plan, it may or may not pan out in the end. I personally think that Intel has drawn the ire of new retail investors as they have neither the momentum (as you indicate) nor the swagger that AMD and NVDA bring to the table. And it's standard these days for market dregs to put out the occasional hit piece on punching bags like Intel--see this article, for instance: [U.S. near deal for Nvidia supercomputer as it waits for delayed Intel machine](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-near-deal-nvidia-supercomputer-190754396.html), which beneath the headline and the typical punishment despite market-scale supply chain problems essentially says that the Intel machine will, in the end, be the better performing machine against AMD and NVDA for HPC purposes:\n>The $500 million contract called for Intel and partners to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance, or the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second. Now, the first exascale computer in the United States will likely be a different machine at a different lab - Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee - built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co with chips from AMD expected to be delivered later this year. The Polaris machine at Argonne will not be as powerful as the Intel machine, the sources said. Based on Nvidia's A100 chips and AMD's Rome and Milan chips, the Polaris computer will be able to make some exaflop calculations but mostly work at slower speeds.\n\nI think Intel has a legitimate shot at building on what they have, and it is valued cheaply compared to peers on the belief of others that it doesn't. Even as a laggard in cutting-edge design, it enjoys regular business with the US government and provides HPC services and infrastructure. Outside of Gen-Z'ers and Millennials, I doubt the flair of AMD or NVDA will cut through the sticker shock when Intel components will do work just fine. To put it simply, I think rumors of Intel's demise have been greatly exaggerated. Top insiders at [Intel](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/semiconductors/nasdaq-intc/intel/news/who-has-been-buying-intel-corporation-nasdaqintc-shares) seem to be either holding or buying more of their own stock, save for tax/bill purposes. That runs counter to both [AMD](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-amd-insider-buying-and-selling-2021-08-2-3/) and [NVDA](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-nvda-insider-buying-and-selling-2021-08-2-3/), where there has been almost entirely insider sales since Q2 2019. It's clear that Intel insiders think their stock can be bought cheaply in the assumption of future appreciation, while its competitors are cashing in on their own holdings while the sun is shining brighter than ever.

Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of court, Blackberry got a positive judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users.\n\nOnly the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail.\n\nJohn Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech company and can't disclose more.\n\nI strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. (This might be huge as Salesforce bought Slack). Blackberry also gets free advertising on FB Instagram.\n\nPatent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing.\n\nFacebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM\n\nMark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.\n\nJohn Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares.\n\n**IVY Connected Car (IoT Internet of Things) + Amazon Partnership**\n\nAs we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY.\n\nIvy benefits the whole value-chain\n\n* IVY enables automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. AKA feed OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable.\n* The developers won\u2019t need specialized or automotive software skills.\n\nModern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.\n\n* The consumer (driver) gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data\n\nData is the new Gold/Oil\n\nBB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.\n\nIn a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy \u201cBy the way this project, we\u2019ve been working with Amazon has taken us probably about 2 years - we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, obviously not as elaborative as today..\u201d.\n\nHe goes on to say that this creates a recurring data business for BB. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckinsey & Co report  ([https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/unlocking-the-full-life-cycle-value-from-connected-car-data#)) connected cars (the new iPhone) will allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.\n\nChen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:\n\n1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the \u201cplumbing\u201d or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)\n2.

TSLA is a stock with high expectations, so without the hype, it's pretty hard to make it move. Also, there is a low possibility of a stock split and just that news alone can cause it to rocket, maybe once it reaches $1000/share, but im speculating later this year or next year.
