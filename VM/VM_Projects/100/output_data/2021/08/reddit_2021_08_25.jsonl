Their architecture is a step beyond Nvidia's GPU based stuff, but Nvidia is pretty entrenched now.\n\nThat makes Nvidia the incumbent, and the new pure NN oriented architectures the would-be disruptors. So it's one of those stories. In particular: A pure NN oriented architecture doesn't seem like it would be able to map to the other things Nvidias stack does, which leaves Nvidia with three choices:\n\n1. Stick with their own stuff (the original Intel play)\n2. Bet on both old and new stuff (the Itanium Intel play)\n3. Ditch the old stuff entirely and jump to the new stuff (the Apple 6502 -> 68k, 68k -> PPC, PPC -> Intel, Intel -> ARM play(s))\n\nWe all love a good disruption story, but in reality we hardly ever hear about the failed attempts. Time will tell. But it will probably tell rather quickly.\n\nI think it's encouraging that Tesla is doing what they are doing. They have an internal need for this so they are their own business case, and you know, if they can do it, many other AI oriented companies can. The big story these days (that you for some reason hardly hear of) is that designing very specific silicon for your workload is becoming a viable option for many companies for lots of reasons. Apple and Tesla are just some of the first movers here.\n\nNB: This does not in any way mean that Tesla will sell the D1 hardware to others. They may cloud-rent it out, but I expect they will be best served here by working with a partner (like Azure).\n\nAlso: For all the fancy words that were said about the D1 at the AI day, it seem to me that it's actually a fairly SIMPLE design, from an architectural point of view. It's almost like a repeat of the old RISC vs. CISC days.\n\nFor those who weren't around for that. There was a sudden realization that by doing away with a bunch of complexity in CPU design and focusing only on the core workloads, you could actually build a CPU that beat the crap out of the state of the art. A BUNCH of companies that used to use off-the-shelf CPUs built their own, and some that had their own classical archs abandoned them for the new wave. Among the former were Acorn (6502 -> ARM) and Sun (68K -> SPARC). Among the latter were DEC (VAX -> Alpha). The major chip makers tried to hedge their bets (several times). In the end Intel stuck with their guns, and Motorola bet the farm on Power PC.\n\nToday all major CPU architectures are kind of a hybrid between RISC and CISC, so perhaps that will be the final outcome of this AI war?\n\nEDIT: Notably, [Jim Keller](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16762/an-anandtech-interview-with-jim-keller-laziest-person-at-tesla) worked at DEC during the RISC days, then took his experience to AMD, designed the HW3 chip and most likely had a LOT of influence, perhaps even input, on the D1. I would be super super interested in hearing his thought on the D1.\n\nEDIT2: [Apparently so did Ganesh, who is lead on Dojo](https://twitter.com/MatthewRideout/status/1428704323261943810)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl", "intc", "nvda", "amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.275375634431839}, {"body": "Followed a Model 3 dual motor part of the way home today.

Looking at the chart below, it is only a matter of time before SPY decides to dump its pants. I'm not saying a recession type of drop, but at least a small correction. My target would be the blue zone marked below, but I would expect at least a retest of 400 at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otk9bws3bej71.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=e308ef6d7b168dcf9c1d3bb4c94c8d4ec80c5d7d\n\nNow on to our memes. BB (Blackberry for all you newbs), has been patiently consolidating, waiting for an outflow from boomer equities back into the memes. If you have been paying attention the past few months, you notice that any time the market starts to fall, the memes start to pop a little.
