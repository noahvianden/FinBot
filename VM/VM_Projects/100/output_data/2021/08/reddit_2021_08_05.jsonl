{"title": "$10-20 Stocks kids would be interested in?", "selftext": "Since bank savings accounts pay squat (and in particular nothing, in my son's UTMA savings), I've set up a UTMA brokerage account for him (he's in grade school). I use this to teach him about finances and the basic principles of the market, and he has fun following the progress of his companies. We require him to invest half of any money he receives from gifts/allowances, etc.\n\nHis birthday is coming up and part of what I plan to do is give him a number of shares corresponding to his age in his brokerage account as part of his gifts. (edit: I specifically mean that if he's turning X years old, I plan to get him X whole shares of said company).\n\nThe way we work his account, the company should matter to him and be relatable to a kid, so, for example, he has DIS, as he can relate to the notion of the amusement parks, the movies (inclusive of Star Wars), and Disney+ of course. RBLX fits the bill, etc.  But those are too expensive per share for what I am trying to do for these purposes...I am looking for suggestions more for companies that might resonate with kids that are currently trading in the $10-20 range per share, so if you have any ideas for me to look into, please share.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: Thanks all for the suggestions! A few have questioned why not fractional shares, or why insist on buying the same number shares as his age. This is just a fun aspect of it that I think he'll enjoy. And no matter how capable I may be of doing so, i'm not giving a sub-10-year old a $500-1000+ birthday present, lol! (i.e., that's why $50-100+ per share companies are out for this particular exercise).  He has other investments and accounts for his benefit that I manage aside from this, so this isn't by any means the significant balance of the investment strategy for him. This is just a bit more  for fun and for an educational interaction. I'll probably do this incrementally each year for him.
