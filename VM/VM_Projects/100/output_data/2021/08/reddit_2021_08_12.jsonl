You\u2019re smart enough and open minded enough to know indexing has value.

Index until you save up and emergency fund. Then practice selling covered calls against an index (if you don\u2019t have $40k to do it with SPY, use SPYG [~60/sh] or SPYV [~35/sh]) until you get really good at it. \n\nThis is mostly safe (if you believe Bogle) and will teach you patience, and make you value the stock you have more (which will make you trade safer). \n\nIf you have the patience to, keep doing that until the premiums cover some of your monthly expenses (assuming not too high if you are making around 50k).\n\nOnce you have a good chunk, then start wheeling if you are still into individual stocks. Don\u2019t use margin, only sell cash secured puts or covered calls. \n\nIf that\u2019s going well, then start buying options, and only buy options with premiums you made selling options. It will keep you safer, and should minimize any major losses. The heuristic will also keep you from over allocating into assets that go to zero. If you really are a baller at buying calls, just use those profits to buy more. If not, wait until you generate more covered call profits to gamble more.\n\nOverall it boils down to patience and restraint. \n\nHope that helps.

They consider it one of the most definitive signals of a bull market and, therefore, a strong buy signal. However, there are also analysts who question the validity of the Cross pattern.

It would actually stop running if the call volume was mostly hedging. E.g. They sell you a call at a .2 delta, then with that premium they buy 4 calls at the .05 delta and pocket and difference in premium. As the price increases the calls they're long in increase their delta beyond what their short call increases by. Now they have to sell shares to remain delta neutral and that increases selling pressure and tends to dampen price increases.

CLOV's been a theta paradise for the past month+... Same thing happened to TLRY and AMC. The minute the price goes up, expect the sell parade, and the gamma squeeze potential here is being over-estimated because there's a presumption of significant naked call positions when in truth the institutions already have very high ownership, the current fee is only 2.2% to borrow, and all of those thetagang calls being sold are the basis for much of the call sell volume. There'll be some trades, but the shorts actually have lots of room to keep the price trading under $10, and the bagholders exiting will create a conflicting current, forcing an equal pressure to cover borrowed shares getting called in while at the same time only resulting in an equal volume trade, meaning a net 0 on price pressure.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43933218717575073}, {"body": "Volume Closer to 8 1/2X ;-)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31382203102111816}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32951903343200684}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04150183126330376}, {"body": "Can\u2019t wait to see the classic \u201cerected green penis with ballsack\u201d $CLOV \ud83c\udf19", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09718186408281326}, {"body": "im all in on clov i caught the falling knife on this one rare for me but i guess you cant win every one my brake even is 12.05 so im in for the ride i hope it does moooooon!!!!!!!!![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote). they all come around if you just wait!!!!!", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": ">they all come around if you just wait!!!!!\n\nYou're in for a rude surprise at some point.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22547954320907593}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1679615080356598}, {"body": "Golden.
