Its RSI is approaching 90. Moderna went from $235 to $365.\n\nI understand they delivered wonders for humanity with effective COVID vaccines, but the magnitude of the surge is highly unusual. \n\n1) Delta - The variant is not exactly news at this point. The world has already gone through 3 major waves. This wave isn\u2019t expected to be as bad as last winter\u2019s, when BioN stock actually fell from $130 to $85 between early Dec 2020 & early Jan 2021.\n\n2) Earnings - Since Pfizer reported earnings last week, BioN has run up another 25% since then. (They split vaccine revenues 50-50.) A large earnings beat should be more than priced in already.\n\n3) Total Addressable Market\n\n3a) Government deals - BioN & Moderna raised their vaccine prices in the latest EU contract. But this has been known for some time. The US government might push back against similar price increases.\n\n3b) Booster shots - CDC has said booster shots are likely NOT needed for fully-vaccinated, otherwise healthy adults. Without recurring revenue, they would appear to be priced too richly (Moderna >20 forward P/E) for a largely one-time, even if multi-year, windfall.\n\nThere will also be political pushback against hoarding boosters for wealthy countries if most of the developing world hasn\u2019t yet received their initial doses.\n\n3c) Future products - No doubt both companies gained brand value from their covid vaccine, but future products are still years down the road.\n\n4) Short interest - neither stock has unusually high short interest (<1% BioN, <4% Moderna) so it doesn\u2019t appear to be a squeeze.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt both stocks can be worth $1,000+ by the end of this decade if they deliver other successful drugs.

{"title": "Way to acquire AMD stocks at 25% discount!", "selftext": "# TLDR: If you like free money - buy XLNX and wait.\n\nFor context, AMD announced Xilinx acquisition in october last year: [https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing)\n\nThe acquisition is an all-stock deal, which means for every Xilinx stock you will get exactly 1.7234 of AMD stock after the merger is completed. The merger is planned to be completed by the end of the year, and it has been reiterated during 2 of the previous earning calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is there to gain?\n\nAMD stock is trading today at $112. Xilinx today is trading at $146. This means a ratio of 1.30 instead of 1.7234. Buying Xilinx you are buying AMD stocks for $85 after merger happens. This is 30% upside of free monies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is there to lose?\n\nIf AMD/XILINX deal doesn't go through, XLNX will most likely jump straight back to pre-merger announcement territory, it will probably end up around $110-$115.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What could stop the merger from happening?\n\nThere are several regulators that have to approve merger. Most of the important ones already did:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status)\n\nHowever it hasn't been approved by China yet: [https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/](https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/)\n\nThe moment China approves the deal, Xilinx stock will jump very close to 1.7234 multiple of AMD (and possibly drag AMD down a bit, however merger approval is *good news* for AMD as well).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What are the chances China does not approve of the deal?\n\nOf course it's a gamble with high US-China tensions, but let's take a look at some facts. In 2019 Chinese antitrust committee reviewed 465 deals. It approved all of them (!!).\n\n[https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57)\n\nIn 2020 they reviewed 458 deals. Out of all of them, they rejected a single one (DouYu merger with Huya, both Chinese companies).\n\n[https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/](https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/)\n\nThis means only one rejection out of 923 deals!\n\nNvidia purchased Mellanox in 2020 and it was conditionally approved through China. This is equivalent of AMD/XLNX deal. AMD owns ATI, which was started by Chinese Canadians. Both Xilinx and AMD are US based. They already have heavy business connections with China. I'm not bold enough to estimate the odds, but the facts suggest they're quite high!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# If this is such a good deal, why is nobody else buying XLNX?\n\nThey were, but had to cover their shorts! The most common way to play XLNX/AMD merger is to go short AMD and long XLNX, and that's what most investors did. However, with recent magnificient AMD run up after Q2 earnings call they were forced to cover their short positions as they became too expensive to hold till the merger. And I have proof that prices were closely correlated until very recently, let's take a look at this XLNX/AMD ratio graph: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio)\n\nUp until very recently the deal was oscilating within 1.5-1.6 area and after recent AMD run up it's been lagging strongly behind. Unless there's some hidden factor major investors know about but not common folks, this is literally the best time in history to buy XLNX to convert into AMD after the merger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: XLNX leaps, XLNX stock, AMD stock", "id": "oxf19e", "created_utc": 1628031113.0, "score": 195, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|92|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07334328442811966}, {"body": "Wasn\u2019t this pushed big for Tlry and aphira?
