Its RSI is approaching 90. Moderna went from $235 to $365.\n\nI understand they delivered wonders for humanity with effective COVID vaccines, but the magnitude of the surge is highly unusual. \n\n1) Delta - The variant is not exactly news at this point. The world has already gone through 3 major waves. This wave isn\u2019t expected to be as bad as last winter\u2019s, when BioN stock actually fell from $130 to $85 between early Dec 2020 & early Jan 2021.\n\n2) Earnings - Since Pfizer reported earnings last week, BioN has run up another 25% since then. (They split vaccine revenues 50-50.) A large earnings beat should be more than priced in already.\n\n3) Total Addressable Market\n\n3a) Government deals - BioN & Moderna raised their vaccine prices in the latest EU contract. But this has been known for some time. The US government might push back against similar price increases.\n\n3b) Booster shots - CDC has said booster shots are likely NOT needed for fully-vaccinated, otherwise healthy adults. Without recurring revenue, they would appear to be priced too richly (Moderna >20 forward P/E) for a largely one-time, even if multi-year, windfall.\n\nThere will also be political pushback against hoarding boosters for wealthy countries if most of the developing world hasn\u2019t yet received their initial doses.\n\n3c) Future products - No doubt both companies gained brand value from their covid vaccine, but future products are still years down the road.\n\n4) Short interest - neither stock has unusually high short interest (<1% BioN, <4% Moderna) so it doesn\u2019t appear to be a squeeze.\n\nI don\u2019t doubt both stocks can be worth $1,000+ by the end of this decade if they deliver other successful drugs.

{"title": "Way to acquire AMD stocks at 25% discount!", "selftext": "# TLDR: If you like free money - buy XLNX and wait.\n\nFor context, AMD announced Xilinx acquisition in october last year: [https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-27-amd-to-acquire-xilinx-creating-the-industry-s-high-performance-computing)\n\nThe acquisition is an all-stock deal, which means for every Xilinx stock you will get exactly 1.7234 of AMD stock after the merger is completed. The merger is planned to be completed by the end of the year, and it has been reiterated during 2 of the previous earning calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is there to gain?\n\nAMD stock is trading today at $112. Xilinx today is trading at $146. This means a ratio of 1.30 instead of 1.7234. Buying Xilinx you are buying AMD stocks for $85 after merger happens. This is 30% upside of free monies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What is there to lose?\n\nIf AMD/XILINX deal doesn't go through, XLNX will most likely jump straight back to pre-merger announcement territory, it will probably end up around $110-$115.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What could stop the merger from happening?\n\nThere are several regulators that have to approve merger. Most of the important ones already did:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status)\n\nHowever it hasn't been approved by China yet: [https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/](https://www.enterpriseai.news/2021/07/01/with-approvals-in-from-the-ec-and-the-uk-amds-35b-acquisition-of-xilinx-now-up-to-china/)\n\nThe moment China approves the deal, Xilinx stock will jump very close to 1.7234 multiple of AMD (and possibly drag AMD down a bit, however merger approval is *good news* for AMD as well).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What are the chances China does not approve of the deal?\n\nOf course it's a gamble with high US-China tensions, but let's take a look at some facts. In 2019 Chinese antitrust committee reviewed 465 deals. It approved all of them (!!).\n\n[https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1421064d-d8f4-4591-963c-d0d65999ff57)\n\nIn 2020 they reviewed 458 deals. Out of all of them, they rejected a single one (DouYu merger with Huya, both Chinese companies).\n\n[https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/](https://www.gibsondunn.com/antitrust-in-china-2020-year-in-review/)\n\nThis means only one rejection out of 923 deals!\n\nNvidia purchased Mellanox in 2020 and it was conditionally approved through China. This is equivalent of AMD/XLNX deal. AMD owns ATI, which was started by Chinese Canadians. Both Xilinx and AMD are US based. They already have heavy business connections with China. I'm not bold enough to estimate the odds, but the facts suggest they're quite high!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# If this is such a good deal, why is nobody else buying XLNX?\n\nThey were, but had to cover their shorts! The most common way to play XLNX/AMD merger is to go short AMD and long XLNX, and that's what most investors did. However, with recent magnificient AMD run up after Q2 earnings call they were forced to cover their short positions as they became too expensive to hold till the merger. And I have proof that prices were closely correlated until very recently, let's take a look at this XLNX/AMD ratio graph: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio)\n\nUp until very recently the deal was oscilating within 1.5-1.6 area and after recent AMD run up it's been lagging strongly behind. Unless there's some hidden factor major investors know about but not common folks, this is literally the best time in history to buy XLNX to convert into AMD after the merger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: XLNX leaps, XLNX stock, AMD stock", "id": "oxf19e", "created_utc": 1628031113.0, "score": 195, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|92|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07334328442811966}, {"body": "Wasn\u2019t this pushed big for Tlry and aphira?

I think square buying AfterPay helps to fill the credit card shaped hole in their lineup and could be built into the cash card. Maybe you go into the app and say the next purchase will be using BNPL, then it instantly splits the payment in 4. This could be useful for some people.  \nThis could also be beneficial for square's cash registers because it subsidizes the transaction fees that square will receive. They front the money to the merchant who pays square a transaction fee using a debit card which I assume square gets some sort of transaction fee from. This also sucks money back into the checking accounts of square users which square can gain interest from or obtain fees for instant transfers to the user's bank account.

You, like everyone else, is wondering if the power is going to go out while your tendies are still cooking in the microwave by the great depression 2.  Do you sense a disturbance in the force?  Millions of voices crying out as the door hits their ass on the way out?  Well my fellow retard, you just clicked on a Slut\\_Spoiler shitpost discussion, and it's too late now.  The synthesizer is riffing and you have to wait at least until Rick Astley starts singing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been searching for a while online how I can live that \"not much but honest life\" of a dairy farmer that milks the government.  I was raised to be a contributing member of society and still trying to break the habit.  You probably noticed I bolded text in the first paragraph.  It's important to note that this moratorium only affects those with less than 99k in gross income or twice that for a family.  Further, to be eligble for that, you have to show you have been actively seeking employment.  Wow, 99k gross income!  That's a lotta fucking people! and everyone with a friend named Reggie can verify, committing fraud by showing that you are actively looking for employment is easy to do.  Almost as easy as making an ineligible resume on a napkin. This is the classic unemployment benefits hustle.\n\nOne time I got a resume from a guy.  It was an e-mail.  Said  \"I am electrician\".  That was it.  That was this guys Resume, Cover Letter, and Curriculum Vitae, but his Modus Operandi was being able to show the unemployment office that he had contacted us and put his best foot forward to get a job.  Well, that's another month of making more money than you would get working (California).  According to the GOV, he has made an effort to get employment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, there are a few more bylaws in there to protect you.  The wording is very lose.  \"If you **may** become homeless or be forced to live in a more crowded space\" you are eligible for the federal program.  Not sure how they plan on enforcing that, but it's beside the point.  As long as you aren't being violent or destructive you can't be kicked out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis word \"may\" is a problem for me.  As in:  \"You **may** have an enormous back rent bill when the moratorium terminates.  If so, you **may** want to consider using the federal aid to help\".  Even after not paying rent for months and getting unemployment, the federal government still has programs to help those in need.  There isn't going to be a crisis. there isn't going to be global crash in the housing market.  There is going to be a bunch of people on vacation getting called back to reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let's throw out some scenarios.  Scenario Alpha: What we have is tennant A who hasn't paid his rent for a year and 4 months, and we have tennant B across the street who has done the same thing.  How much money have they saved? to just put a rent number out there (I'll use $1,000) and multiplying it by 16 months is going to give you an impressive cushion: $16,000.  These guys making 99k and under, with $16,000 savings aren't worried about being kicked out, because they are just going to move across the street.  Tennant A and Tennant B will do an apartment swap, the landlords gets fucked over and the crisis is averted.  The landlords of these tennants just want someone to come in who will pay, and guess who's been building up a nice nest egg?  Obviously, these tennants have to leave.  The bridge is burned.  Would you let some guy who's been pennyfarthing about with your money stay?  At a certain point, this shit gets personal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenario Omega: Landlord finally is able to remove his tennant.  He jumps for joy that he can start collecting rent again from an actively employed tennant.  The last guy leaves, looks for a house, and puts down a down payment.  Thanks to his savings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing to think about is that this is giving people OPPURTUNITY.  They are out of work, everywhere is hiring.  Always wanted to live in New York? the Governor is begging for people to come and get mugged.  Want to go to anywhere in the US and start your life over?  It's totally possible when there aren't any strings attached to you like job and rent, and you can afford the cost of starting over.\n\nFinally, I think that the real DD will be in the comments, which is a common theme with you animals.  As for me, I've paid rent this whole time LIKE AN IDIOT.  However, being honest is kind of the only thing that helps me sleep at night.  That and not jeopardizing the roof over my head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr invest in $UHAL.  I'm sure business will be booming even more than it already has.\n\n\ud83c\udfb6We're no strangers to love\ud83c\udfb6", "id": "owsrma", "created_utc": 1627953868.0, "score": 230, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 329, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|28|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|3260|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11409008502960205}, {"body": "Lol you think these people who haven't been paying rent have been saving it?!?!?", "score": 362, "replies": [{"body": "Gambling on FD's and investing in coke and hookers", "score": 81, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21071423590183258}, {"body": "Don't listen to anyone.
