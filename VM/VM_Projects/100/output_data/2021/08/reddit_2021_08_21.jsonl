That would've been healthy, and it seemed like it tried to every day.  If you made money this week, well done, because I definitely got trapped.  Microsoft just kept popping, along with the rest of big tech except for AMZN.  The fact that every dip was bought up like nothing(especially Monday, what the fuck was that shit) means were probably going higher.  But big tech, the linchpin of the financial world right now, is stretched pretty thin with the exception of AMZN.

Let's say your 2023 AAPL leaps have a 155 breakeven and aaple crashes and stays at 50$. \n\nIf you'd bought 100 shares of AAPL at $150 today, you'd be down $10 000. \n\nIf you'd bought the leap at a strike of 80, probably for $7500ish in premium, you'd likewise be down only $7500 (your premium). Hence, your downside is capped compared to shares.\n\nHowever if AAPL hit 200 bucks/share (up $50/share), your shares would be up $5k in capital gains, which means you had 33% return on your 15k capital (ROIC). \n\nYour leaps on the other hand, would be up $4.5k (90% delta movement). This means you gained $4.5k  on a capital outlay of $7.5 k which is a massive 60% return on invested capital. \n\nIn other words, the leap has actually protected your downside, while massively levering your upside.

SKLZ is just a vehicle.\n\n\n\n***THE TRADE :** YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS:\n\nNever before have mega-corporations, mutual funds, private equity firms, had **so much dry powder available to be deployed** (AKA tons of cash on their balance sheets), **in an inflationary environment** that makes keeping money parked on the balance sheets unattractive, pushing their managers to seek options to use the money (such as retained earnings) and not keep it in dollars while they devalue. \n\nBecause mega-corporations, mutual funds, private equity firms are sit on tons of cash **It is reasonable to expect that some will choose to add some kind of hedge against inflation to their balance sheets**, such as buying gold, or digital assets as we have seen in recent examples. ***However, these options are considerably more volatile than the dollar, and many boards of directors do not appreciate the idea of \u200b\u200bsubjecting their retained earnings to high volatility. But instead seek to buy, merge or takeover others smaller companies***  (See the discussion on this topic by Sosnoff and Ratigan, in the second half of their latest podcast [https://youtu.be/eTfFEq8hOMg](https://youtu.be/eTfFEq8hOMg). For those of you who don't know who they are, stop reading right now, and please look for them, and then come back)\n\n\n**That is why I consider it inevitable that acquisitions of smaller companies will increase,** *and im supported by data* *(M&A typical accelerates toward Q3 and Q4: See Price Waterhouse Coopers report* on that [*https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/deals/trends.html*](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/deals/trends.html)*),* **as way to manage balance sheets overloaded with cash,** *in order to maintain growth in an inflationary environment and prevent devaluation of retained earnings.*\n\nAs a consequence of this **The plan is to find a good probable acquisition target soon enough and ride the momentum up using in the money calls with 45 or more days to go.**\n\n\n**IN SEARCH FOR THE TRADING VEHICLE:**\n\nWithin this universe of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) we must be clear that the first companies to be subject to acquisitions will be those that can have **high growth, low debt, and generate profits**. This is where SKILLZ comes in, ticker $ SKLZ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE TRIGGER TO START THE POSITION: WHY DID I CHOOSE SKLZ ?** THE RUMOR:\n\n*CTNF RUMOR OF SKLZ BEING TARGETED FOR TAKEOVER.*\n\nWhat attracted my attention most powerfully to SKLZ was that  CTFN  published a rumor reported by Sarah Cohen that SKLZ is being watched to be acquired by competitors in a takeover. (See who she is in this thread [https://twitter.com/Gilberto\\_TFC/status/1428795628973400074?s=20](https://twitter.com/Gilberto_TFC/status/1428795628973400074?s=20))\n\nCTFN is a team of journalists and analysts trained in merger processes, with sources in industry, finance, regulatory bodies, and the legal profession. They uncover leading-edge stories, risks, and opportunities associated with M&A and more.\n\nIn takeovers scenarios, **the trade is to buy the target** and sell the one doing the takeover. We dont know who the interested party is yet, but we do know SKLZ has a profile good enough to be on the crosshair of many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The trading vehicle merits: WHY SKILLZ ($SKLZ)**\n\n* Analyst consensus $18.00\n* Price at the moment: 10.5\n* $ SKLZ has 0 debt.
