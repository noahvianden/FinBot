{"title": "AMD Options Calls Mistakes/ Lessons Learned", "selftext": "Hoping to get some insight around my AMD option calls and future strategies for success. I'm pretty new to options trading and have mostly focused on trading options targeted around earnings. \n\nI had been holding AMD for quite some time and decided to purchase call options about a week and a half before their earnings announcement. I bought several contracts ITM with a Sept,18 expiry I believe, the strike price was $93 or $94. Typically when I'm buying options leading up to earnings I am not holding through earnings and will sell a day or two before earnings are released. I've read many times to never hold through earnings and sell your contracts as IV will crush your profitability.  I usually will sell my underlying stock too leading up to earnings because i typically see a pull back and dip in the stock even if the numbers are great, such as Apple the last few quarters. I'll then buy back in a few days after earnings if I'm feeling bullish on the stock. I sold my options the day before AMD earnings up around 30% as well as the underlying stock.  I've then watched in disbelief as the stock has gone parabolic and hit 5 all time highs in the matter of days. If i would have held these contracts through earnings how how would the IV have effected the contract value with the stock shooting up at the same time? Should you not always sell leading up to earnings? Maybe this is just an outlier situation? I never saw a single price target for AMD above $100 at least not for this year. I'm really trying to get a better handle on how i can understand when my contracts are at or near their highest value, and when to exit, is there any indicators  that would help to time these better? Also, is the earnings call options strategy applicable broadly, or does it come down to a case by case scenario?

AMD, has had five down quarters in the last 13 (I miss-typed that number in the original response to OP) but the scale on the plus side is very large compared to the negative side.

Do you think that is true of AAPL? FB? NFLX? SNAP? SHOP? MSFT? AMD? Because it is not. I know because I have played earnings strangles or more than a decade in stocks like this. The strangle pays off about 45% of the time, but the payouts when a tail event hits is disproportionate to the losses - like AAPL a year ago when they announced their stock split during earnings - that has a 5X payoff which bested TSLA the week before, which had a 4X payoff. \n\nAs I've said on this sub probably a dozen times before, IV crush has almost no relevance in stocks that are big candidates for tail events, and that certainly includes AMD.\n\nOP's example was not even of an extreme AMD event! The last AMD earnings report was tepid, barely profitable for a strangle. \n\nOP was asking about a long-term hold and, of course, any advice to sell that was terrible advice.

Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "What other semi-conductor stocks do you recommend -", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15750040113925934}], "tickers": ["intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "On the most basic level, there are two answers:\n\n1. Not everything is about options, greeks, IV, etc.\n2. \"Implied volatility\" is bullshit.\n\nStarting with #2, obviously an options trader needs to understand and monitor IV. What I mean by \"bullshit\" is that IV isn't some sort of objective output of mathematics & statistics, it's a measure of market demand. A high IV just means there's a lot of interest in the option. Consider AMD August 06 options: a week ago the ATM IV was 2.55%/day, today it's 5.25%. It's the opposite of the typical \"IV crush\" as options get closer to expiry. The same is going on with MRNA. These are indeed outliers.\n\nSo what do we do about these? For most trading, you just keep them in mind as outlier risks. (They are, for example, the reason we don't all just constantly sell a thousand OTM spreads that have a 0.05 risk/reward, because the few times they go against you, they destroy you. The big option sellers have enormous mathematical models to create hedges to avoid that, and they still make mistakes.) If you want to occasionally play bets on huge swings in price with a tiny amount of your portfolio, that's fine, just be prepared to usually lose.\n\nOn #1, there were indeed targets this high. On July 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari set a target of $111.00. On July 20, before earnings, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay set a target of $120.00. Immediately post-earnings, before the run-up, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann set a target of $150. Did you listen to these? LOL, probably not, and neither did I, because usually these targets are, at best, a guidepost for the next year, not some sort of short-term bet, so we skim the consensus number and that's that.\n\nA run-up this high was in the cards: on the day of earnings, AMD was trading at a P/E of 32.51, P/S of 8.34, EV/EBITDA of 37.39. All of these were near or at bottom for the past six months, and far lower than averages for the past year, past few years, etc. Maybe that's what attracted you to AMD in the first place. It sure attracted me, and so I've been playing AMD, though I missed this particular jump. If these kinds of numbers were a guarantee of a huge stock movement in the near future then we'd all be loading up INTC. And maybe INTC does pop in the future, that's not a crazy play, lots of hedge funds are doing it.\n\nBut here's the thing: 99.9% of the time, stocks with all these same signals do *not* suddenly jump up in price, and if you could regularly predict when that would happen, if you could even get it right a mere 10% of the time, you'd soon be a billionaire. The reality is, dumping your money into something on the hopes of a sudden change in price is no different from a WSB YOLO, even if we options traders dress it up in complicated math.

A bet on earnings for a tech stock like AMD is a bet on a tail event, and if that event transpires, if you have a strangle one of the legs is at or near one delta and the other leg is worthless (if the expiry is near-term). If at one delta, then you should not care what the \"IV\" is. The IV that has fallen is the IV that is at or near the money, but you don't care about that, because of the tail event, you are very far away from the money and highly profitable.\n\nAMD has a history of robust tail events. In the models that I use to track and trade earnings I calculate the size of the earnings reaction as a log growth percentage and compare it to the Implied Daily Volatility of the 90 days prior to the day of research, and I call that ratio XSigma. So if a stock has a movement that is two times the scale of recently-estimated 90-day implied daily volatility, that is a 2-XSigma move. A rough rule of thumb is that any any move beyond 2 XSigma will offer a profit to an earnings strangle placed before market close on the day of earnings. Of their last 11 quarterly earnings reports, the report triggered a tail event (above 2XSigma) on 7 of those reports. (The last one was pretty much break-even for a strangle at almost exactly 2XSigma). Of the last 13 quarterly earnings reports from AMD, only ONE, the Jan 26, 21 report, triggered a negative response at -2XSigma. \n\nAnyone selling before SNAP's report this quarter would feel far worse than you. SNAP closed at around 62.50 on Wed July 22 just minutes before their earnings report, and the Friday expiry options were trading at about 4-sigma. A 62.50 Call was pegged at 2.79 at 12:17:51 with an estimated daily implied volatility of 0.1176, which was 4 times recent 90-day historical volatility. At market open at 6:37:13 the day after earnings SNAP was at 77.57 and the call had a selling peg of 15.47. (The 61.50 Put, originally priced at 2.58, was worthless). \n\nSo what was the after-earnings IV of the call that went from $2.79 per share to $15.47 per share overnight? I guess we don't really care, do we? \n\nFinally, these price targets and the \"expected prices\" based upon options that get published are largely worthless. They assume away tail events and tail events are everything in earnings releases, at least for big tech stocks.\n\nIf you were worried about your long-standing position in AMD, you could have hedged that with some cheap throw-away $80 or $82 puts.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Very insightful argument and I appreciate you dispelling the pervasive myths of IV crush.\n\nI humbly would like to employ your methodology of calculating log percentage growth of earnings reaction with 90 day volatility.\n\nIf possible, could you break down the process with examples , of course if you are ok in sharing your strategy \n\nThanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.548922598361969}], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "IV will not crush your earnings unless you're buying spreads and long expirations.

Apollo Group (NASDAQ: APOL) is due to announce earnings after the close of trading on March 27. On February 26, a trader might have considered buying a long straddle or a long strangle in order to be positioned if the stock reacted strongly one way or the other in the run up into the earnings announcement. In this case, APOL was trading at $65.60 a share. The trader could have bought one contract each of the April 70 call at $5 and the April 60 put at $4.40. The total cost to enter this trade would be the cost of the two premiums, or $940. This represents the total risk on the trade. However, the likelihood of experiencing the maximum loss is zero because this trade will be exited before the earnings announcement and thus well before the April options expire.\r  \n\n\nExample Trade 2: Stock Earnings Release (Non- directional Trade)\r  \nDetermine the Magnitude of Post Earnings move with Straddles\r  \nAnalyzing options to make earnings predictions is to attempt to determine the magnitude of the anticipated move after the earnings announcement. Since most options appreciate in value when volatility increases, implied volatility can tell us when the market is anticipating a big move to the upside or downside. Luckily, straddles are designed to take advantage of implied volatility, so we can use them to calculate an exact magnitude.\r  \n\r  \nStraddles represent an options strategy that involves purchasing call and put options with the same strike price and expiration date. By purchasing an at-the-money straddle, options traders are positioning themselves to profit from an increase or decrease in the stock price. Therefore, looking at the price of the at-the-money straddle can tell us the magnitude of this implied volatility.\r  \n\n\nPractice Trade: Google\r  \nPrior to  the earnings announcement we purchase one at-the-money Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) call option for $1,200 per contract and one at-the-money GOOG put option for $1,670 per contract, then the cost of the at-the-money straddle will be $2,870 plus any commissions paid. With GOOG's underlying shares trading at $575.50 per share, this means that we can expect a move of approximately 5% or $2,870 / ($575.50 x 100): $2,870 / 57,550 = 0.0498%.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6792182326316833}, {"body": "Sometimes the best thing to do is to trade around a core position.

{"title": "$EDU: say what you will about Chinese stocks, but $EDU has no business trading at NEGATIVE $600m EV", "selftext": "EDIT: since you de-gens can't even read the first paragraph, this has NOTHING to do with China macro or the Chinese equity asset class. It's just a basic but rare market inefficiency. It's god damn accounting: $4b net cash shell trading at $3.4b. Save your expert opinions on the CCP's next move in education policy for the Hinge date who's gonna ghost you by tomorrow AM.\n\nRead on if your attention span is >5 seconds and IQ is above 12\n\n# Summary\n\nVery simple negative EV trade, these don't come up often and are hard to find, but [historically have been consistently lucrative](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/07/10/returns-on-negative-enterprise-value-stocks-money-for-nothing/), especially in a name as liquid as $EDU traded on the NASDAQ:\n\n* Price: $2.00 (8/3/21 morning)\n* Shares out: 1.7b\n* Cash + Equiv: $6b\n* Gross Debt: $2b\n* Negligible minority interest and prefs\n\n**That's $3.4b market cap and $4b in net cash = -$600m EV**\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* 10,000 shares EDU\n* 80 EDU call options (WSB doesn't let you say which exact contract but \\~4,000 total delta)\n* 5,000 shares HKG:9901 (same company but HK listing)\n\n# Thesis\n\nObviously mispriced asset. Say what you will about China stonks, Chinese education stonks, VIEs, yadda yadda that's all irrelevant: cash is cash. You're paying $3.4b for a $4b net cash shell on the balance sheet, regardless of what the company actually does. That doesn't make sense because it doesn't. In my 5+ years I've only personally stumbled upon 2 cases like this: $EVE.LN and $LK (yup, that LK). Literally any \"not absolute shitstorm\" news would make this pop WAY more than just the $4b of net cash on the balance sheet, which is available to you at $3.4b for no reason other than people are selling into shit-tier China sentiment they read on Twitter without ever taking an Accounting 101 class (see comments for this unfolding live).\n\nSo let's see what is behind the EDU covers, and learn from what happened to both LK and EVE when they went into negative EV land.\n\n# $EDU situation\n\nFundamentals don't really matter for this trade (it's just a mispricing trade), but anyway: New Oriental Education (EDU) is a Chinese company that has 7 business lines, the largest of which (75% of their $4b revenue) is private tutoring. Unless you live under a rock you'd know for-profit private tutoring has recently been banned in China because of several reasons (won't go into detail but mostly around cost of education, ethics, widening wealth gap, low birth rate).\n\nNone of the above is really that important. Here's what important:\n\n1. **87% of EDU ownership is institutional, and most of that is US institutions.**This is important because common shareholders are less likely to get completely screwed because of poor geo-political optics. EDU isn't the only Chinese edu co getting railed right now and this shareholder structure is not uncommon for VIEs and ADRs. Despite what American news tells you, American and Chinese LPs are both balls deep in each other and both care oh so very much about optics, particularly in high finance, so it's unlikely common equity gets TOTALLY screwed over.\n2. **25% of EDU's $4b of revenue is still legal.**Keep in mind tutoring is only 75% of EDU's $4b run rate revenue that's been outlawed, the other 25% (language, admissions consulting, school tours etc.) is still perfectly legal meaning you have a company that can make $1b revenue trading at negative EV...\n3. **EDU has a TON of residual assets.**69k employees, 10.6m student enrollments, 118\u00a0schools, 1,625 learning centers, 11\u00a0bookstores. They could start a god damn Nike factory or the biggest car wash on Earth tomorrow with assets like that. Point is, whatever this $4b cash shell becomes, it's not worth -$600m, or even remotely close to $0 for that matter.\n\nSo it's clear that EDU is not worth $0, much less negative $600m. What can happen from here on? [Here's the only study from the CFA Institute (albeit from 2013) I could find on negative EV trading performance](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2013/07/10/returns-on-negative-enterprise-value-stocks-money-for-nothing/):\n\n>**The average 1-year return of 2,613 negative EV opportunities over 40 years was 50.4%.**\n\nLooking good so far. But let's look to 2 recent examples I've traded through first hand for guidance:\n\n# $LK (up 15x from negative EV)\n\nNow trading OTC as $LKNCY. This is the best comparable out there imo: Luckin Coffee, a Chinese fraud that got exposed, got sold to negative EV at a low of $0.95 in May 2020, traded up to high of $15.65 (up 17x) and today on 8/3/2021 trades at $14 (up 15x in 15 months).\n\nCompare to EDU: a perfectly non-fraudulent Chinese co that got its main business regulated away, leaving a ton of residual assets and the ability to generate $1b of legal revenue, also in negative EV land.\n\n# $EVE.LN (up 6x from negative EV)\n\nEve Sleep. British mattress shitco trading on the AIM, the single worst exchange in the universe. Traded to lows of 1.15 GBP in May 2020 due to COVID and grazed negative EV land. It then promptly re-rated to 6 GBP (up 5x) by September 2020 and peaked at 7 GBP (up 6x) in February 2021. Still trading at 3.30 GBP today.\n\nCompare to EDU: NASDAQ listed with 70m average daily volume, also in negative EV land.\n\n# The $EDU trade\n\nSo what can happen to EDU? As exhaustively as I can brainstorm, I think the possible scenarios are\n\n1. Pivot to another biz with the same assets\n2. Spin off the tutoring biz\n3. Go private via buyout/merger\n4. De-list to OTC\n\nThe most logical valuation for all of these would be based off the remaining $1b of legal revenue, which should yield at the very very VERY least a billion or two or EV, which is \\~$3.50 per share. Again, at the VERY LEAST. Which is at least 50-60% upside from here with honestly, without sounding facetious, negligible downside risk--the cash on the balance sheet is literally worth more than what $EDU is trading at.\n\nIf you use LK and EVE as precedents then you're looking at 14x and 5x within a year. And if you use  linked study from the CFA Institute, negative EV trades average 50% return within one year.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt's a cash shell worth $4b trading at $3.4b. Doesn't matter what you think of China or what the CCP will do, it's mispriced.\n\nDYODD.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* 10,000 shares EDU\n* 80 EDU call options (WSB doesn't let you say which exact contract but \\~4,000 total delta)\n* 5,000 shares HKG:9901 (same company but HK listing)", "id": "oxhnsr", "created_utc": 1628039681.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|4 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxhnsr/edu_say_what_you_will_about_chinese_stocks_but/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33135417103767395}, {"body": "Has cash reserves more than what it's trading at.

This stands in stark contradistinction to the deliberative, telegraphed, and gradual process that marks US and European lawmaking and regulation, where statutes like the US' Administrative Procedures Act (APA) mandate public comment and interactive dialogue in regulated industries. The CCP's willingness to act in such a way is deliberate: the party moves swiftly and without warning not only to implement its goals as expeditiously as possible, but also to remind people--and especially foreign and US investors--who is in charge.

{"title": "AMD: Arbitragers are Closing out Short Positions", "selftext": "This is not financial advice and I don't know this for sure, I'm just looking at the charts.If you've been following me, I've been advocating AMD for a long time and put a $50k yolo down on the stock. Those that listened to me, grats. We made some serious tendies.\n\n[Arbitrage Action](https://preview.redd.it/bkzslisbxcf71.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8fe3569cb5f82703ec96b26ad0d7801787595b8)\n\nRight now, I believe Arbitragers are being forced to close out their short positions with AMD due to liquidity risk.\n\nI explain Arbitrage in more detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\\_an\\_explanation\\_on\\_merger\\_arbitrage\\_and\\_how\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)\n\nBasically, in this all-stock fixed ratio acquisition, the arbitrage play is to short AMD and buy Xilinx, then close positions when the deal is closed. However, they're not able to get to that point because AMD is up so much. Which means they have to close AMD short positions now and sell Xilinx to cover the costs. At least, that's what it seems is happening based on the charts. This is great for us AMD holders because it's driving the price higher. But I just wanted to impart some wrinkles on your smooth brain.\n\nTLDR: The more AMD goes up, the more Arbitragers need to close out short positions, which causes AMD to keep going up. Which I listed as my best-case to-the-moon scenario in my Arbitrage Explanation post.\n\nPositions: 300 Shares of AMD with various call options expiring from now through next year.", "id": "oxurnp", "created_utc": 1628089977.0, "score": 253, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|72|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd_increasing_production_by_20_in_q2_buy_before/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m77z8o/amd_to_jump_50_soon_to_120_and_heres_why/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79506/amd_to_jump_50_soon_to_120_and_heres_why/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the_amd_boom_is_still_coming_heres_why/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0k22g/amd_this_is_why_its_down_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0jp09/why_is_amd_down_today_827m_short_shares_at_85/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nws042/amd_will_rocket_after_the_xilinx_acquisition_is/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6011769771575928}, {"body": "Doesn\u2019t this mean there\u2019s some serious value in Xilinx subject only to whatever chance China cockblocks the deal?", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "yup, with amd at \\~120 xlnx would be worth \\~200 but is only trading at \\~140 rn", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Indicating there is solid worry the deal won't go through.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "spread is now saying 30% chances of it succeeding.
