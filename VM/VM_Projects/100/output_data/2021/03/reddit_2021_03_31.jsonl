{"title": "Due Diligence Post: AAPL", "selftext": " So AAPL stock has been pretty ugly. BUT, I have hope.. \n\nAAPL looks like it's coming up to its 200 SMA of 117.29.. So its got further to fall here. However, in the past it's jumped up from its 200 SMA pretty reliably as far as I can tell. I'm going to wait until it falls there and start\u00a0looking at buying opportunities.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbeozgedz9q61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f896d6f83f9f4c1c1eac0432c44c151479588bf\n\nI'm using a tool to project the expected move up or down.

Checking my projections tool, I see 6/18/2021 105 Call and 120 Calls might be great picks. I'll be watching these when SMA breaks 200. Going into both calls means we'll be looking at about 94% profit by expiry if the market is at 15%.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c2293wkz9q61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cb6ecc37f44074892d326dc940488e5eabcc653\n\nHowever, if you think it'll go \u201315% instead, or if we start seeing Apple drop past 200 for too long, we might want to look into puts. 6/18/2021 135 Put looks like it'll do the job in this scenario.

{"title": "Why does it seem like selling at a loss is absolutely not an option on here? I would like to grant you the power the sell... IN THE RED!", "selftext": "I'll admit, I'm a pessimistic person by default. I also can become insanely optimistic to the point that my family would like to get me a room at the local hospital. As we all know the stock market is a game of emotions. I think we mistakenly believe that selling for a loss is a form of weakness or defeat. Or we might fear we can't live with ourselves if it goes up again without us owning it. I see new traders that get down double digit percentage points and start calculating how many months they will have to hold to get their money back. \n\nWhen my trade starts going sour I decide to cut my losses and move on. Sometimes I regret it and sometimes I'm really happy I did.\n\nA few things to remember.\n\n\n1. \"Honest\" DD on a speculative company is extremely hard to come by. Usually you only see what they want you to see until the earnings report comes out. Just because your DD tells you hold forever doesn't mean it'll work out. Even if you read the whole internet.\n\n\n2. Even a great company can be purchased at the wrong time. Wait for a pull back. Be patient. Even as Amazon hits all time highs you still should wait for an entry point. It's not that you'll \"lose money\" over the long term, it's just that you can get stuck trading sideways for months. If you buy high you can get stuck in the red for months. Watch the RSI (relative strength index) for a value in the 30s or 40s before jumping in at least. \n\n\n3. Dollar cost averaging isn't just a fad. It makes a ton of sense. Buy half of your position so that you can buy another half later if the stock drops significantly (relative to you) below your purchase price. If it doesn't dip further then good for you. Buy your other half on a pullback above your cost basis or be content with the half position.\n\n\n4. Always have an exit strategy when you purchase the stock. Even if your exit strategy is \"hold it until I retire.\" Don't purchase a stock without an exit strategy. That exit strategy should include a maximum loss amount along with a potential gains amount. Stick a stop loss (or have a dca price target) at your max loss. Once the stock gets above your gain goal stick a stop loss at that level. Let it keep running if it will or sell if it doesn't. Minimizing losses is more important than people give it credit for in this sub. \n\n\n5. Did the reason that you purchased the stock change? If so, SELL IT. If you bought the stock because you believed something would happen and it doesn't, sell it. Whether it's a loss, or gain, or break even. Your emotions will get the best of you if the reason for buying the stock is no longer valid. You won't be able to hold through the dips or recognize if you should take profits when you should. \n\n\n6. Diversification. It's easier to hold red when you have green along side of it. Buy stocks in other sectors. As we've all seen first hand this year, money moves around more than it comes out of the market. Rebalance your portfolio from time to time. Choose a sector you don't have money in and find a stock you like. Or choose an ETF.\n\n\n7. Easy money gained is easy money loss. The quicker your stock moved up the quicker your stock can go down. Don't be scared to take profits! You will NEVER time the top right. \n\n\n8. You can't win them all. Self explanatory. \n\n\nEven with all that in mind, luck is involved. Nobody knows what will happen with any given stock so expect the unexpected. Having money stuck on a trade moving sideways for 12 months is worse than taking the loss and putting it elsewhere in my opinion. \n\nI started this post with intentions of a quick reminder that it's ok to sell for a loss sometimes and it became some sort of \"tips\" to remember post from another amateur trader on the internet.

U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change. He is proposing a $174 billion investment to win the EV market. His plan will enable automakers to spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts, retool factories to compete globally, and support American workers to make batteries and EVs. It will give consumers point of sale rebates and tax incentives to buy American-made EVs, while ensuring that these vehicles are affordable for all families and manufactured by workers with good jobs. It will establish grant and incentive programs for state and local governments and the private sector to build a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030, while promoting strong labor, training, and installation standards. His plan also will replace 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrify at least 20 percent of our yellow school bus fleet through a new Clean Buses for Kids Program at the Environmental Protection Agency, with support from the Department of Energy. These investments will set us on a path to 100 percent clean buses, while ensuring that the American workforce is trained to operate and maintain this 21st century infrastructure.
