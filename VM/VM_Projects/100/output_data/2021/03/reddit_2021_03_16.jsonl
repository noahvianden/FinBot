So let\u2019s do another example where I decided not to sell shares and factor in company growth. \n\nYou own 10,000 shares of company 1, and you receive $10,000 in dividends. On the Ex-Date your share\u2019s value drop by $1 to $9 per share. Your share price appreciated by $1 (now it\u2019s back at $10 a share) between the ex and payment date, so now your portfolio is worth $100,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash before taxes. \n\nI own 10,000 shares of company 2. Since our companies grow at the same rate, my share price also grows to $11. Now my portfolio is worth $110,000 in stock. I have no tax liability. \n\nFor you to come out ahead of me, you\u2019d either have to change the ratios at which your company is traded at, or eliminate taxes. \n\nHere\u2019s a non stock related example that may help, it\u2019s not a perfect example but hopefully it\u2019ll make more sense: \n\nSay you have a $100 Bill.

This is why people say \u201cbefore taxes and fees....so long as $1=$1, then there is no basis to prefer dividends over selling shares.\u201d \n\nThe reason why this is hard to visualize is because no two companies are exactly the same. This makes it easy to assume this phenomenon is non existent because you cannot see our company example above. But what you can see is how analysts drop the share price by the amount of the dividend on the ex-date because they know \u201cso long as $1=$1 then the company devalued itself by the amount of the dividend.\u201d Which then I go back to the Costco special dividend example last year.

Not a substantially large enough number that it would affect markets, which gets back to my original point about what you said, when you talked about \u2018this half\u2019 not being sold into America anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s not a half, not even close, so you\u2019re placating yourself when you think like that. It\u2019s a dwindling number, and not nearly impactful enough to impact the markets, because most people surprisingly aren\u2019t that stupid.\n\nWhat are the chances that you, with the avatar of the Jewish elite stereotype typically found in hateful places, have trouble finding a place on reddit?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So 300% of elglible voters voting is not concerning at all?

Yeah, because of the massive numbers of mail-in ballots, counting centers were working overnighters. 4am dumps aren\u2019t concerning at all, because they\u2019re dealing with massive volumes of ballots so they open and organize them and then process them as quickly as possible.\n\nThere was nothing abnormal about the percentages of votes cast in urban areas, and even in suburban areas almost nationwide there was a shift of votes toward Biden. I guess the Dems cheated in virtually every medium-sized city\u2019s metro area nationwide.\n\nLook, if you want to believe in bullshit, go for it. If you\u2019re ever interested in seeing how ridiculous the voter fraud claims are (and why they\u2019ve all fallen apart and continue to do so), just pull up county voter data and compare it to 2016.

Because it\u2019s all bullshit from carefully manipulated narratives that assume the people reading it are either too lazy/gullible to do their own research or too uninformed as to how counting works and which phases are monitored versus which aren\u2019t.\n\nVotes aren\u2019t kept in envelopes the entire time, nor are they required to do so. It varies state by state, but you\u2019re woefully underestimating how tedious it would be to open and repackage them along with exactly how counting works.

A year ago, and even 6 months ago, a big part of my justification for buying Softbank was the gap in the market cap and the value of the underlying assets. But today with billions in share buybacks (originally scheduled to end this month) and Alibaba declining they're probably approaching a fair price for the assets, keep in mind they didn't dip nearly as much as the rest of tech stocks the last month or so. \n\nI think to buy at these prices you have to feel positively about a number of different assets. The first and biggest is Alibaba. The second is ARM which is part of a pending deal with Nvidia which would see Softbank get an 8% or so stake in Nvidia if it goes through, there's a reasonable chance it falls through and personally I think it's fine either way. The third is the Vision Fund projects as a whole. The original Vision Fund is 30% stockholder money with somewhat mixed results, the 2nd is entirely stockholder money that's done well, between the 2 there are about 140 investments with the recent success stories being Doordash and Coupang. IMO those are the 3 big ones that have more upside/downside. \n\nThen you've got the \"strategic holdings\" of Softbank Corps (telecom in Japan) which I think they mostly hold onto for the dividends, though they sold a chunk of it the last year. Some chunk remaining of Tmobil, which they sold most of their stake of once Sprint started merging with them. Yahoo Japan, which is the preferred search engine and email service for the Japanese language (powered by Google ironically). Northstar which is part of a \"liquidity management strategy\", a subsidiary in the Caymans where they park excess cash after selling assets in publicly traded tech stocks (and options). And the Latin America Fund which is smaller scale investment than the vision fund (managed by a different guy as well) with about 130 last I knew investments in tech companies through the region. \n\nGoing forward I think we'll continue to see the trend of the last year or so, which is whittling down more of the bigger assets to cycle into more venture fund money, and I think that's really where the upside of the stock is. They make a lot of bets but many of them have big enough upside to actually matter for investors. Softbank just gives you substantial exposure to the venture capital market that you can't get exposure to through any other stock. Also it gives you an excuse to watch Masa's bizarre earnings reports. \n\nThere are also 4 SPACs associated with Softbank people, 3 being publicly traded now that haven't announced a merger target yet.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2338905781507492}, {"body": "Does anyone think I should sell VIAC?

{"title": "US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis)", "selftext": "**General Overview**\n\n*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.\n\n**The Market:**\n\n* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it\u2019s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It\u2019s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn\u2019t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn\u2019t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. \n\n* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. \n\n\n**US Cannabis as an investor:**\n\n* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. \n \n* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed \u201cMultistate Operators\u201d or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.\n\n* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. \n\n\n**Haven\u2019t we already missed the boat?**\n\n* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. \n\n* It\u2019s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. \n\n\n**Canada vs USA** \n\n* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. \n\n* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. \n\n* Compared against Canada\u2019s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California\u2019s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. \n\n* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It\u2019s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. \n\n* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. \n\n* These states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.\n\n\n* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.\n\n\n\n**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**\n\n* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:\n\n* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)\n\n* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)\n\n* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.\n\n\n\n**Who are these US cannabis companies?**\n\nI have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. \n\n**Curaleaf:** \n\n* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.\n* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.\n* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY\n* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY\n* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA\n* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. \n\n**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**\n\n* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. \n* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.\n* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.\n* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019\n* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin\n\n\n**The bear cases**\n\n***It\u2019s just a plant, can\u2019t people just grow it at home?***\n\n* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren\u2019t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It\u2019s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. \n\n***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***\n\n* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.\n\n* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there\u2019s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. \n\n* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I\u2019d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.\n\n* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. \n\n\n\n**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**\n\n* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.\n\n* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.\n \n* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:\n\n* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.\n\n* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill\u2019s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. \n\n* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. \n\n* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. \n\n* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. \n\n\n\n**My Strategy:**\n\n* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it\u2019s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. \n\n\n* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. \n\n\n**Discloser:**\n\n*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future.

{"title": "RKT Triple Witching 3/19", "selftext": "**Hello friends,**\n\nIn the past few weeks I was have been trying to get positioned into RKT. I have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks.\n\nWell lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term.\n\nIn the short term I see a lot of upside potential with 100% return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this Friday 3/19 which is very possible with all the indicators I will cover in this post.\n\nShort Interest is up:\n\nTodays Volume was a bit lower than the Daily Average: **15M Volume**\n\nThe stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.\n\nRKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT)\n\n**Shorts still in the game:**\n\nAs of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000, 6% fee.\n\nDuring the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').\n\nCheck out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).\n\nSo the float is about 100 million shares making it 2-2.5 billion. However the company is 50 billion\n\nIn other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.\n\nAlso remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.\n\nDTCC Rule\n\n**Housing data comes out March 17th:**\n\nThis will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.\n\n1. Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.\n2. Employment is strengthening.\n3. Economy is re-bounding.\n4. Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.\n5. Low rates continue.\n\n**Open Call Options:**\n\nLook at the open call options of RKT for Friday March 19th, 49,856 contracts at $28.89!!! We are currently at $26.44!!! If we hit that strike by Friday, we could have a huge Gamma Squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well, at the same day!\n\nRKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers.\n\n**Stimulus + Triple Witching:**\n\nStimulus checks hit the banks **March 17th.** This is a major catalyst for the entire market as a whole but the trending stocks on reddit will accumulate a good portion of those stimulus checks IMO.\n\nTriple witching:\n\nIf you did not know about this hang on to your seats\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp)\n\nThese Hedge funds are so good at doubling down.\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)\n\nRKT Trending on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) :\n\n**Long Term:**\n\nHousing Market on the Move and Mortgage Companies are going to be on Fire!\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/the-housing-sales-boom-that-never-ends-already-wiped-out-all-the-short-sellers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/the-housing-sales-boom-that-never-ends-already-wiped-out-all-the-short-sellers)\n\n[https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/03/15/opinion/canadas-housing-market-fire-and-headed-disaster](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/03/15/opinion/canadas-housing-market-fire-and-headed-disaster)\n\n[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/24/hot-us-housing-market-new-home-sales-hit-3-month-high](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/24/hot-us-housing-market-new-home-sales-hit-3-month-high)\n\n[https://www.tampabay.com/news/real-estate/2021/02/25/the-florida-housing-market-is-booming-is-a-crash-ahead/](https://www.tampabay.com/news/real-estate/2021/02/25/the-florida-housing-market-is-booming-is-a-crash-ahead/)\n\n[https://www.realtor.com/research/jan-2021-hottest-housing-markets/](https://www.realtor.com/research/jan-2021-hottest-housing-markets/)\n\nThe housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links....

{"title": "RKT The Rocket Companys: Cheap and Hated", "selftext": "RKT ipo'd at $19 back in August.  The Gilford family spent 35 year building them into the largest mortgage orginator in the world.  They survived every downturn even the '07 Mortgagepocolypse, each time growing and taking share.\n\nThey didn't need no cash, they came public to establish themselves in the public market and begin planning for the some day when death taxes require the family to settle up with the irs.\n\nThe Gilfords built a $50 Billion company from scratch, its a story right up there with Buffet and Bezos but this family gets no respect.   They should.  \n\nThe biz:\n\nBanks make loans, sometimes they make the mortgage thing to apes who have \"civilized\" and live in house things.  I sleep in the woods and swing from trees, but many of my so called 'evolved' cousins like this house living bullshit.  Well banks only have a handful of people in house who loan house mortages (i know weird).  They rely on these fly by night boiler rooms who send emails and call you unexpectedly, you think its about your car warranty or solar but this is that other sales call about Refi-Cash-Out into a Fixed Fully Ammortizing 30 year or buying a rental with a 5/1 ARM Fixed-Floating with rolled in closing costs.  \n\nIts really a bunch of bullshit, mortgages, roofs, solar panels.  I like bananas, but I like this stonk called RKT.  \n\nMorgages are hard, they want paperworks, bank statements, adp payroll slips.  The business comes in waves.  When rates are cheap and banks full of new dollar tokens given to them by  JPOW, there is a long line of house living apes trying to mortage their paychecks from 30 years on so they can install a pool or move to a neighborhood with a country club.  So the banks call on these boiler rooms to make all the paper mortgage calls happen.\n\nThese 'orginiators' are typically like circus pop up tent companies.  They hire a bunch of unemployed used car saleman and maniacs froms the sober house to call the leads and take the applications.  They hire Amanda and Britney who couldn't succeed as beauticians to do the document reviews and processing.  Simply put its the cast of heros you used to see on episodes of COPS where the call was a 'domestic.'  \n\nBut the Gilfords had a vision: build software that runs on devices that make it so easy to apply, qualify and process a mortgage that even Rodney with 5 days outa rehab and Britney 'I told your ass to send me that already' couldn't screw it up and the customer gets their house money fast and easy right from the app on their handheld glowing glass screen.\n\nHedge funds don't understand how good this software is.  No one else bothered to build it because bankers are not creative, they live by screwing others.  And the other circus freaks pushing mortgages are in it for next week commish check so they can coke and hookers.  \n\nStonk is at $26\n\nThe Hedges shorted 40 mil shares on a 115 mil float.  And index fund already bought 11 mil shares (invesco).   The original fund managers who bought the ipo sold it out during the last blast up to $43.  They sold, bc they saw morgage rates go up a 1/2 point and figured the circus is over and all these pop up freak show mortgage boiler rooms are going under.  They didn't bother to look at rkt.  They have a 90% repeat business rate: meaning 9/10 customers who do a mortgage with rocket, will use rocket if they do another.  typicall number in bankin is 1 or 2 out of 10.  RKT app is number 1 in the catagory, and as Mamma Cathy Wood teached me smooth ape brain: innovation is a winner take all game.  \n\nRKT builds back better each downturn, and every mortgage boom brings in startup circus creeps that don't know how to code, analyst customer data (data science) and deliver good service.  Why should they? they believe its a churn and burn business.  They are running flee market stores, RKT is runnnin and Amazon of mortgages and now getting into car and personal loans\n\nThey don't take credit risk, they lend for banks and investor pools.  they \"service\" the loan which means they bill and collect.  so when rates fluctuate they have to adjust the holding value of the collection rights up or down any quarter.  Hedgefunds predict that higher rates mean they take a write down.  But thats just paper bullshit.  the collection rights always are profitable, they just have to 'discount' them when banks same interest is worth more.  Hedgefunds look for quick profits, not revolutionary businesses that make lives better.\n\nThey missed tsla, apple, amzn and countless others the same way.  RKT is no diff.\n\nThe company minted coin in 2020, about $4.50/share in profit.  Thats a PE of like 6.  Now no one thinks they will make that in '21.  2020 was the best mortgage year ever, people sat at home, watched netflix and bought and refinanced houses.  They also learned to use their phones and their computers for the first time ever.  They can now work and do businness on them, before they didn't, but covid make them overcome their fear and forced all the boomers to use their phone to get a mortgage.   the secular story of waiting for the apes who know how to use an app to move out of mom's basement to buy a house is over.  The boomers learned to use apps and now, all businesses will suceed or fail based on the quality of the app experience.  Did i mention RKTs apps are all number 1 or near in their catagories and great reveiws.  \n\nBeing number 1 and having great reviews in the app store makes it game over.  Its winner take all.  RKT will clean up in the down turn.  they will earn less with less business and higher rates but the long term earnings power of this company is $2-3/share and growing every downturn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CEO of RKT: This Guy Fucks!](https://preview.redd.it/9wt6lcae0bn61.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=97969bbe977a7211c3477c7aedc7ccfb19175aa7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bet my account the stonk would go up over 28.89 this friday b/c i YOLO'd the mother fucking FDs.", "id": "m5z8j4", "created_utc": 1615862890.0, "score": 325, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "I have a shit ton of calls for Friday, it's either I'm buying a new motorcycle or I'm gonna be homeless no in-between.", "score": 81, "replies": [{"body": "You have Wendy's, they are hiring if the trade goes wrong.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "nah man, my gig is BEHIND the wendys.  $20 for a special", "score": 19, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44332095980644226}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12155865877866745}, {"body": "This is the way bro, i sold some 25.89 puts to fund some of the calls.  so i get fucked even more if it drops.

{"title": "Please Help Me Calculate Fair GME Price (post-squeeze)", "selftext": "I would like to form my own conclusion as to what GME stock price should realistically settle at, after all the dust settles.\n\nI'm calculating the expected market cap of a company (like Gamestop), post-pivot.\n\nPlease let me know if I make any mistakes in calculating, that is why I am posting this, for feedback.\n\n# Here is my work so far...\n\nThe expected size of the gaming industry toward the end of 2021: $**200B**\n\nIF GameStop manages to capture just 1-2% of **this** market, that's **$2** to **$4B earnings. Not to mention the other industries GameStop will be involved in.**\n\n*(source:* [*https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/gross-profit*](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/gross-profit)*)*\n\n# What PE would GameStop realistically trade at?\n\nWell, if we check related sector averages, we will find:\n\n\\- E-Commerce (Online Retail) PE 129.05, Exp growth **20.17%**\n\n\\- Retail (Distributor) PE 21.91, Exp growth **10%**\n\n\\- Software (Entertainment), PE 109.44, Exp growth **19.72%**\n\n\\- Gaming Industry, PE 27, Exp growth **12%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI place a very conservatives estimate of PE at **30**, based on the weight and distribution of probable revenue streams, rounding down to remain conservative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*(source:*[*http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\\~adamodar/New\\_Home\\_Page/datafile/pedata.html*](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html)*)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's low-ball **this** average and go with **25 PE**, to be very safe.\n\nSo..\n\n25 PE \\* 2B = **50B** market cap, at a conservative low-end.\n\n25 PE \\* 4B = **100B** market cap, at a conservative high-end.\n\nCurrently, at $216/share, its sitting at roughly **14.5B** market cap.\n\nIn order to reach the expected **market cap of 50-100B**, the share price would need to increase by 3.4x to 6.9x the current stock price, assuming the number of outstanding shares remains constant.\n\nfor a conservative low-end, I get: 216.80 \\* 3.4 = **$737**\n\nfor a conservative high-end, I get: 216.80 \\* 6.9 = **$1495**\n\n**Given the current situation and demand for GME shares, is it reasonable to assume the fair market value of a GME share is** ***at least*** **$700??**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This is my legitimate attempt at finding a realistic share value.**\n\nPlease let me know if I have made any mistakes,  I am fairly new to investing, so any advice would be appreciated. thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nobligatory: \ud83e\udd8d\ud83c\udf4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf18\ud83e\ude90\ud83c\udf0c\n\n\\*Update- Thanks for the responses and discussion so far, I realize have not taken into consideration that in-game microtransactions/Asia-Pacific account for a large majority of the current gaming industry.\n\nI also did not properly account for the radical, possibly disruptive, changes GameStop can have on the Gaming Industry as a whole, and the RC vision of digital-first.\n\nAlso, its likely they won't be confined to just one industry either. PC parts and a Streaming Service are certainly possible.\n\nI recommend everyone go back and read (or \"you tube\") the letter RC sent GME back in November to refresh your memories on the vision of this company, in order to fairly evaluate it.\n\n...and I totally fucked up and used the 2019 Gross profit, instead of Net. Will recalculate later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Final Update\\*\\*\n\nAnyways, if anyone's interested I figured the **most** **conservative value I would value Gamestop** would be **$291.85** (factors in the post-hype post-squeeze).\n\nThis predicates on my theory they can generate 1b net profit in the first 1-2 Years, given the unprecedented demand and I believe streaming will play a vital role, like Twitch. Essentially I see them as the potential \"Amazon of Gaming\", having their hands across multiple sectors.\n\nI predict they won't just ease into the market, they will DISRUPT it.\n\nOther competitors playing around in the gaming industry won't be able to compete, there will be massive return from retail investors, whether they previously gamers or not.\n\nOpportunities:\n\n\\-**Hit the ground Running with strategic locations, (In-store Streamed Events??)**\n\n\\-H**yper-growth ecommerce shift**\n\n\\-**Gaming PCs in higher demand.**\n\n\\-C**apture microtransaction market by,**\n\n\\-Large audience shift to Gamestop brand **over** competitors, for same products.\n\n\\-Resurgence of audience demanding of new Gaming Content and Live INTERACTION!!\n\nSo, **at least 1B annual revenue in next 1 to 2 yrs,**\n\nand a, *very conservative*, **30 PE (based on related industry averages weighted by profit estimates by sector).**\n\n...then I gave the whole \"successful rebrand\" thing an **82% chance** of happening (lol idk, take it or leave it).\n\nSo yeah, **$291.85**, super conservative, this would be my floor essentially.\n\nRealistically, I am calculating that GME price should **naturally** hover anywhere from $300-$500, (much potential, wide range) assuming constant number of shares, ofc.\n\n\\*not investment advice, just looking for possible \"fundamentally sound\" number most people, including boomers, would probably accept. \ud83d\ude80", "id": "m5zooc", "created_utc": 1615864376.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "So buy more GME on the dips.

{"title": "Citadel Regulatory Breaches \u2013 Know thy enemy DD", "selftext": "Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don\u2019t matter.\n\nI hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? \n\n**Wrong**. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic \u2018oh no I got caught\u2019 fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business.\n\nMy aim is to help apes, in that bu knowing their history of breaches, this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. \n\nI hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches.\n\nThese disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I\u2019ve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let\u2019s dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows.\n\nAs always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions.\n\nCitadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. *There are big boys with more than Citadel mind.*\n\nBlackrock\u2019s total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error).\n\nCitadel\u2019s? **$33,425,568** for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number.\n\nWhilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the **staggering relative difference between the 2**.\n\nLet\u2019s see my highlight reel of the top 10.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - **$22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine & a Cease and Desist/Injuction**\n\nSummary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide \u2018best execution\u2019 for their clients two of their algorithms did **not**, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn\u2019t in this period. These algorithms have allegedly been discontinued.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#2 - Case SEC FILE NO 3-18915, 12/10/2018 - **$3,500,000:  Monetary Fine & Cease and Desist/Injunction**\n\nSummary: From November 2012 \u2013 August 2016, Citadel failed to report complete and accurate data on around 80 million trades despite multiple requests from the SEC, which undermines the SEC\u2019s potential ability to properly regulate and protect consumers.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#3 Case 2010023518001, 10/19/2016 - **$1,000,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**\n\nSummary: Citadel had an algo strategy, which traded a very high concentration of securities orders just prior to market open, impacting the proper pricing of securities. In addition, this algo strategy had a complete lack of oversight from someone with any qualifications. Their supervision was criticized.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#4 Case 2016051085001, 10/27/2020 - **$180,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**\n\nSummary: Between September 2015 and July 2016, Citadel had a self-described \u2018system issue\u2019 which resulted in a failure to properly mark short positions in accordance with new rules. *once again*, supervisory issues.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#5 Case STAR NO. 20180580176 / FILE NO. USRI-8731, 02/28/2020 - **$10,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**\n\nSummary: Citadel security **failed to close out fails to deliver**.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#6 Case 20190500001, 02/07/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**\n\nSummary: Citadel improperly cancelled 231 Market-on-Close orders relating to a single basket of securities and, I've heard this before, *once again* failed to properly supervise their systems.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#7 Case 20180590083, 01/23/2020 - **$15,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**\n\nSummary: Citadel **allowed best prices and execution of trades during a circuit breaker event** and you guessed it, **once again** lacked proper supervisory procedures. I\u2019m getting the impression this is intentional so they can just deliberately say \u2018oh X didn\u2019t know, they\u2019re not trained!\u2019 as a bullshit fallback for a billion dollar company.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#8 Case 2016-07-1306, 09/29/2017 - **$80,000 Sanction: Censure& Monetary Fine**\n\nSummary: Through July 2014 and September 2016, Citadel failed to grant priority to the national best bid for securities and **once  a fucking gain, failed to implement proper supervisory procedures**. This best bid shit is *not* the first of its kind, and it's where Citadel makes their $$$.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#9 Case 20080157728-01, 09/03/2015 - **$200,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**\n\nSummary: From February 2006 \u2013 August 2009, Citadel delayed execution for orders over 10,000 shares on penny stocks; From February 2006 \u2013 February 2009, Citadel deleted its e-mail communications (**suspect as fuuuuuck**); and ONCE AGAIN, **their supervisory procedures were deficient**.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#10 Case 2010022334502, 06/16/2014 - **$800,000 Sanction: Censure & Monetary Fine**\n\nSummary: On 24 occasions, through March 18, 2010 to February 28, 2014 Citadel **manipulated an exchange exploit to cancel orders**; in April 2010, **used an out-dated software to allow exchanges to create them an erroneous short position**; in August 2011, updated their software to cause an order sending and cancellation loop; On December 13, 2012, used inaccurate market data to **capitalise on limit orders**; and finally, sent millions of orders to the exchanges **without execution and removed a limit imposed on Citadel which prevented them from making 200 orders per second**.\n\nFuck me.\n\n \n\nSo what does this tell us?\n\n \n\nFrom #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it\u2019ll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit.\n\nFrom #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?).\n\nFrom #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves.\n\nFrom #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions.\n\nFrom #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver.\n\nFrom #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders.\n\nFrom #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves.\n\nFrom #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (*cough, Robinhood, cough*).\n\nFrom #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM.\n\nFrom #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn\u2019t give a **fuck about market manipulation.**\n\nTLDR: Citadel doesn\u2019t give a fuck about anyone or anything else other than itself, and it WILL do everything it can to prevent the MOASS as their continuous and systematic breaches of the rules proves.\n\nKnow thy enemy apes, **expect fuckery from here on out**.", "id": "m6iptw", "created_utc": 1615926886.0, "score": 621, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "SEC needs new management, tools, and a spiked bat with \"Daddy's 'lil slugger\" written on it.", "score": 162, "replies": [{"body": "Replace the whole SEC with the top tier DD guys and you will have a fucking killing machine", "score": 80, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3998986780643463}, {"body": "I'm with you", "score": 34, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09422927349805832}, {"body": "True.

{"title": "$RKT shot down by shorts...", "selftext": "Team RKT reporting in. We were humming along this week quite nicely with all signs pointing to a strong gamma ramp that would push the price well beyond $30, cause massive buying and likely push even higher than last time. \n\nHowever, a hedge fund(Melvin, is that you?) or other big player with heavy puts or sold calls against RKT didn't want that to happen.\n\nThis afternoon there was a 400k share (~$10M) short bet. That likely trigged stop limits and de-hedging by market makers causing the price to drop even further. It was timed during low volume for maximum effect(wiping out the bid side). It was meant to control the price. There was also heavy put activity today holding it back(possibly by the same entity). Shorts are trying to take back control before the 03/19 expiry happens.\n\nThe 03/19 expiry has huge open interest, especially at the $28.89 level. If Rocket had continued the 3% daily from Monday, we'd have hit $28.99 on Friday(and likely sooner as the gamma ramp kicked in). This short bet today was pure manipulation. Timed for maximum effect to ensure RKT doesn't have time to recover before Friday.\n\nThe gamma squeeze is still possible, but not without heavy retail buy-in. If RKT breaks $27 for a sustained time period with the $25.89 and $26.89 open interest going in the money, breaking the $29 barrier that would kick-off a gamma squeeze becomes a real possibility.\n\nI truly believe RKT is worth far more than it's trading at. I like this stock.\n\nPosition: Shares and about 150 calls at various strikes from $23.89 to $32.89 overall position size ~$10k after today's drop.

{"title": "RKT Catalyst coming at the right time before the Triple Witching 3/19.", "selftext": "**Hello friends,**\n\nIn the past few weeks I was have been trying to get positioned into RKT. I have been eyeing this thing for months and finally was able to grab a position today after all the chaos the past few weeks.\n\nWell lets dive deep into some analysis why this could be huge short term and long term.\n\nIn the short term I see a lot of upside potential with 100% return or more if we can trigger the gamma squeeze this Friday 3/19 which is very possible with all the indicators I will cover in this post.\n\nShort Interest is up:\n\nTodays Volume was a bit lower than the Daily Average: **15M Volume**\n\nThe stock is starting to be put on short-selling restricted lists which means shorts are over-risked and brokerages know this.\n\nRKT has a relatively small float with high short interest. It won't take a lot to light the match. The options interest for next week also allows for a big gamma squeeze if the price hits $29 for a sustained period. We're at $25... It's not a lot to ask for.\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKT)\n\n**Shorts still in the game:**\n\nAs of March 13th 20.8M shares are still short, representing $537,000,000, 6% fee.\n\nDuring the mini-squeeze only about 1/3 of shorts left, and many re-shorted (data convoluted on this and you know how easy it is for them to 'opps under report').\n\nCheck out the strike of $30 with 48,889 contracts. On a float of only 100,000,000 (a little bigger than gme) that represents 4,888,900 shares just there (usually MMs will buy 50% or so as it approaches ITM).\n\nSo the float is about 100 million shares making it 2-2.5 billion. However the company is 50 billion\n\nIn other words if this gets to $29 it will just keep going up until the highest strike - So above $65 likely.\n\nAlso remember we have the DTCC new rule coming soon, we don't know the date yet but that's making the shorts piss their pants as they would have less liquidity to fight with. They really want to shake out all the retail money at the cheapest price THIS WEEK.\n\n[DTCC Rule](https://preview.redd.it/sy0i9annvgn61.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f92e73f2ada0b0483aef46f515cd3c8494ca5b7)\n\n**Housing data comes out March 17th:**\n\nThis will show what we all already know, housing market is on FIRE.\n\n1. Housing prices are rising: This motivates new construction, home renovations and people to sell at a profit.\n2. Employment is strengthening.\n3. Economy is re-bounding.\n4. Work From Home: people want more space, are migrating from cities and condos to houses in the suburbs.\n5. Low rates continue.\n\n**Open Call Options:**\n\nLook at the open call options of RKT for Friday March 19th, 49,856 contracts at $28.89!!! We are currently at $26.44!!! If we hit that strike by Friday, we could have a huge Gamma Squeeze which would lead to other short squeezes on higher strike prices as well, at the same day!\n\nRKT CEO says their share price at $43 is OK but they are still not being fairly valued to peers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6ldqdcvvgn61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b31c64985c5fc5c45a3c236a93d36a1ec39ce603\n\n**Stimulus + Triple Witching:**\n\nStimulus checks hit the banks **March 17th.** This is a major catalyst for the entire market as a whole but the trending stocks on reddit will accumulate a good portion of those stimulus checks IMO.\n\nTriple witching:\n\nTriple witching is the quarterly expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index option contracts all on the same day.\n\nTriple witching happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.\n\nTriple witching days, particularly the final hour of trading preceding the closing bell\u2014called the \"triple witching hour\"\u2014can result in escalated trading activity and volatility as traders close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions.\n\nIf you did not know about this hang on to your seats\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp)\n\nThese Hedge funds are so good at doubling down.\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RKT)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rkt)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRKT Trending on r/wallstreetbets :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9oex72zwvgn61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b91fc5ca43eb6d47f3ecf0b9d7639bb52ee34779\n\n**Long Term:**\n\nHousing Market on the Move and Mortgage Companies are going to be on Fire!\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/the-housing-sales-boom-that-never-ends-already-wiped-out-all-the-short-sellers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/the-housing-sales-boom-that-never-ends-already-wiped-out-all-the-short-sellers)\n\n[https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/03/15/opinion/canadas-housing-market-fire-and-headed-disaster](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/03/15/opinion/canadas-housing-market-fire-and-headed-disaster)\n\n[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/24/hot-us-housing-market-new-home-sales-hit-3-month-high](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/2/24/hot-us-housing-market-new-home-sales-hit-3-month-high)\n\n[https://www.tampabay.com/news/real-estate/2021/02/25/the-florida-housing-market-is-booming-is-a-crash-ahead/](https://www.tampabay.com/news/real-estate/2021/02/25/the-florida-housing-market-is-booming-is-a-crash-ahead/)\n\n[https://www.realtor.com/research/jan-2021-hottest-housing-markets/](https://www.realtor.com/research/jan-2021-hottest-housing-markets/)\n\nThe housing market is absolutely on fire and if you click all these links....
