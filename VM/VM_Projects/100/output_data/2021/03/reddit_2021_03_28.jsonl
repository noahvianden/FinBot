TSLA is not doing this (the Model Y has newer/better features than the model X).  I agree with this approach.\n\nI've not met an actual TSLA owner that is pissed off because of the delay in FSD.  Infact, I've know more people w/o FSD than with.  That's great for TSLA.  By the time FSD gains traction, there will be a ton of vehicles w/o FSD hitting the used market.  All TSLA needs to do is adding FSD to those vehicles and turn them around for a 5-10k extra profit.\n\nThe current US electrical grid is not suitable for large scale EV adoption.  To level out the demand, whole house battery/solar system is needed, TSLA definitely has a horse in this race.\n\nChina is a very important market and TSLA is the AAPL of the Chinese EV market.  Sure there are tons of local brands phone with more features at a lesser price,  the iPhone still has great profit from the Chinese market.  Tesla will be the same - a #1 choice among the richer part of the population.  EU EVs will also share this richer population but w/o the benefit of a local factory.\n\nOther smaller EV companies are just noise.  Things only get serious when AAPL and Toyota enter the market.\n\nTSLA is also a b-i-t-c-o-i-n holding company.  While many people may thing it's a negative,  I think it's a good thing for the company.  it's not much different from McDonald is as much as real estate company as a fast food company.  It sets the low for the company values.\n\n\nMost people would agree that last month TSLA has seen very significant drop.  Look at the data,  it's more than $10/week.  However I also lower my cost basis by $8-$10/week selling CC while waiting for the chip shortage to lift and the cyber truck to roll out.  Now if TSLA drops down to the $500 then I won't be able to sell CC at my original purchase price and may have to hold.  I'll worry about that when the time comes.\n\nIf you can't effort to get 100 shares of TSLA, it's not a stock for you.  The ability to get high premium consistently is the key during the chip shortage period - \"get paid while you wait\" should the slogan for owning TSLA stock.\n\nWhen TSLA hit 380 during the battery day week,  some people wanted to wait for 350 to get in.  They've been waiting ever since.  To be fair,  I bought a bunch of shares at 380 just to have them called away quickly after at 450.  The shares that I held got sold at the limit order of $695 not too long after that.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This!

Wall Street banks ditch $19 billion of stocks in \u2018unprecedented\u2019 block trade selloff \u2013 media", "selftext": "Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly sold $19 billion worth of shares in Chinese tech and US media companies. Traders are now wondering what caused the unusually massive move and whether it will continue next week.\n\nGoldman Sachs alone liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, Bloomberg reported citing the investment bank\u2019s email to clients. The first batch, that included $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, was sold before the market opened on Friday. Later that day, the bank reportedly managed the sale of $3.9 billion worth of shares in American media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery, as well some other companies, such as Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu.\u00a0\n\nAnother US investment bank involved in the block trades, which are believed to have wiped $35 billion off affected firms\u2019 valuations in just one day, was Morgan Stanley. The investment bank offered two batches of shares worth $4 billion each on Friday, according to the Financial Times.\u00a0\nWhile block trades, when sellers are looking for buyers for large volumes of securities at a price sometimes negotiated privately between the two parties, are a common thing, the scale of Friday\u2019s moves raised eyebrows.\u00a0\n\nContinue...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen something of this magnitude in my 25-year career,\u201d\u00a0portfolio manager at Swiss-based Bellevue Asset Management AG, Michel Keusch, told Bloomberg.\u00a0\nSenior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, Oliver Pursche, called the move\u00a0\u201chighly unusual,\u201d\u00a0adding that the market participants are now wondering if another wave of block trades could hit the market on Monday and Tuesday, causing wild price swings in the affected stocks.\nAnother issue is the unclear nature of those trades. Goldman Sachs explained the sales with\u00a0\u201cforced deleveraging,\u201d\u00a0the Financial Times wrote citing people with knowledge of the matter. The outlet also said that the move could indicate that a big hedge fund or family office faced some serious problems.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, CNBC reported the selling pressure in some US media and Chinese stocks was linked to the forced liquidation of positions held by family investment office Archegos Capital Management. The lack of details about the move makes the situation worrisome, Pursche said, as investors don\u2019t know\u00a0\u201cwhether this was the liquidation of just one fund or more than a fund, or whether it was a fund liquidation to begin with and the reason behind it.\u201d", "id": "mf5os6", "created_utc": 1616953160.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "From CNBC: \u201cThe selloff in the Chinese internet ADRs and US media shares was in part due to the \"forced liquidation of positions\" held by Archegos Capital Management, CNBC reported, citing a source familiar with the situation.\u201d", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "Ding ding.", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07923554629087448}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6633661985397339}, {"body": "An Asian hedge fund company got margin called that was over leveraged.

Either you go full vertical integration like Apple iOS/Tesla with an end-to-end consumer hardware+software product, or you go full horizontal integration as an outsider by unifying multiple hardware OEMs under the same software platform and rely on an alternative business model like Google Android+Google Mobile Services (and hopefully Blackberry QNX + IVY). \n\nThose that decide to go alone in an attempt to build a vertically integrated consumer product but could not quite reach the level of \"polished premium-ness\" to compete with the likes of Apple/Tesla will eventually die-off or join the horizontal integration group (see Nokia and Blackberry phones). \n\nThe first-mover to start horizontal integration is likely to succeed if all its plans are well executed. The follower will have a much harder time competing with the first-mover even though it might have an equally-capable or even better platform (see Windows Phone).\n\nIVY is currently a first-of-its-kind platform, so it has a major headstart.

AKA $GOEV AKA they-better-fucking-deliver-on-earnings-or-i-am-out-a-bunch-of-fucking-money (#11 Weekend Schitzo Edition)", "selftext": "Good Afternoon[,](https://u.teknik.io/IGI7Y.jpg)\n\nYou should put on **Dreamer\u2019s Wake** by **Rival Consoles**.  It's good, smooth and you can just listen to Untravel next which should help you follow us down the rabbit hole of schitzo speculation\n\n**God Damnit there is so much to talk about today** that it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. Earnings are tommorow 3/29 after market.  I think the usual disclaimer is that this is not financial advice and that you should make your own decisions like a big boy and girl is great place to start.\n\n**Positions** \\- 4/16 15$ and 17.5 and 30$ calls.\n\n***Takes a hit of Copium***\n\n**Price is not an indicator of value.** ^((said in the kind of voice that keeps the smoke in.))\n\nUseful is to...***cough*** perhaps recap... ***cough cough***  the last week of price action as being something that was difficult to swallow as shares of GOEV began to approximate the cost of admission to your mom\u2019s discount crotch circus but thank god we didn\u2019t get that low. (By the way the quality of that spectacle really went down during her \"Groupon Phase\".)  The only consolation is that [GOEV accrued the most significant amount of short interest](https://u.teknik.io/KgmjB.png) in a small amount of time that I have ever seen.  If you can stomach the price drop and GOEV does return to the ring we are in a much better tactical position than we ever have been.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|3/29|3/26|3/25|3/24|3/23|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/lvt8k.png)|[Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/MJvuS.png)|[ortex](https://u.teknik.io/4xFPV.png)|[ortex](https://u.teknik.io/DoYr7.png)|[Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/T3e3A.png)|\n|**DTC** 2.3|**DTC** 2.69|**DTC**  2.74|**DTC** 2.21|**DTC** 1.87|\n|**SI** 17.1 (-3M)|**SI** 20.1 M(-.5M)|**SI** 20.6M(+3M)|**SI** 17.02M(+2.6M|14.473M(+770k)|\n\n**So Schizo Friday started** when u/FI_not_RE posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/mdztz0/canoos_potential_partnership_with_rgbsi) about RGBSI hiring for different positions related to auto manufacturing specifically related to Canoo.  RGBSI is an engineering consulting agency which has helped manufacturers achieve goals with production lines and quality control among other things.  Looking at their website suggests they have experience in the arena that would benefit canoo to do small micro factories.\n\n**How does the Rubber Meet the Road?**\n\nMicro factories has been something that Tony has been harping on for ages.  /u/Planereflection of the Canoo Leak fame did some digging and found that Divergent 3D is in Torrance California and is headquartered [4 miles away.](https://u.teknik.io/JITxs.PNG)  I am sure many of the same employees frequent the same bathhouses and upvote each other\u2019s FetLife profiles but their company is in line to deliver on the micro factory end.  /u/planereflection found [this linked in article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/philosophy-anti-gigafactory-kevin-czinger/) and also the Youtube video of Jay Leno driving their car.  It seems like their CEO and Tony would get a long and probably ran into each other at a trump rall\u2026 I mean football game.\n\nSo we took a break and /u/Basket_Fragrant discussed some of his TA, gave out some reading recommendations and weighed in on [Papa Manpreet\u2019s views](https://twitter.com/manpreet_mba09/status/1375519164509478912?s=20) of the coming price action.  And things were pretty cool\n\nBut suddenly cn0110 busts in and says \u201cHave you seen that Kia is dropping their EGMP reveal Tuesday?!?!!\u201d.  **I swear to you loyal readers you have never seen such a schitzo reaction in the chat as to what followed.**  Literally worse than a thunderstorm around Arkham during the 4th of July people were pulling crazy shit out of their gluteal weeds and flinging it against the walls.   We were all getting so high on Hopium that Canoo was going to be responsible for Kia's entire EV platform and that we were going to announce IP in that vehicle and gain money per sale and that Q4 was so profitable Aquila will announce a dividend of 1000 dollars per share and strippers were going to deliver your Canoo on subscription and stick around to party.\n\nThis continued for some time until fan favorite /u/MisterInvicta boots down the door with a loop stick in one hand, weighted blanket in the other and proceeds to tard wrangle everyone to the ground with his sensible interjections of \u201cVehicles take years to develop Canoo and Hyundai have only been working together for a short time\u201d and \u201cTheir electric skateboard design looks nothing like canoo\u2019s\u201d.  I swear it was like the orderly looked up from his newspaper at the asylum and said \u201cGod dammit not again\u201d.\n\n**But the real takeaway would be if Canoo would partner with Kia to build the skateboards and partner with Divergent 3d to do the custom Top Hats.**  This would be the big tiddy event.  In fact I am suspicious about the inability for people to own a \u201cSedan\u201d like Canoo car this smells kind of like a \u201cnon-compete clause\u201d.  This makes more sense than Magna which charged Fisker 6% of their company for just ONE VEHICLE and there is 0 ways that Tony would accept this and probably told Magna to get fucked so there is a pretty big hole here to fill where the manufacturing will come from.\n\nMoreover, the partnership between Hyundai and Canoo will be under scrutiny at this earnings.  Fortunately in the updated S-1 there is a clause \u201c\"*The agreement provides for the co-development of a platform for a small segment electric vehicle for which the intellectual property developed will be jointly owned by us and Hyundai Motor Group. The agreement provides that it may be terminated for convenience by either party; however, certain provisions, including with respect to the joint-ownership of intellectual property, survive any such termination*.\"  I am not sure which way this will fall but I can imagine that it is favorable to Canoo.\n\n**So the 3/30 E-GMP reveal was dropped via news on 3/16.  This also correlates to the date that Canoo dropped its own earnings date on 3/29.  They both separately released news on the same day.  Think about that for a second.**\n\n**Next Week we will go from Earnings to Kia E-GMP reveal to Biden Infrastructure plan which will hopefully discuss EV tax breaks especially for businesses.  We might be having a big week here guys.**\n\n**TLDR** \\- Canoo is in a partnership with hyundai/Kia to produce their E-GMP platform.  This IP basically allows a shared tech skateboard. **(not schitzo)** Kia could produce the skateboards for themselves and send the throwback trim to Canoo who utilizes micro factory tech to produce customizable Top Hats provided by Divergent 3D whose CEO said the same thing that Tony said regarding additive manufacturing techniques at scale. **(this is the Schizto Part)**  There are jobs that were recently posted to the internet by RGBSI that would fit with a micro factory approach. **(Not Schitzo)**  BB provides the sensors and software integration to the finished product. **(Not Schitzo)** Tony scheduled earnings right before Kia revealed to the world a working car that his company participated in so he can discuss it. They both dropped the news at the same time.  **(Not Schitzo)**\n\n**None of this is priced in and when it is will make everyone rich as fuck. Then tony says they are working with Uber for subscription model or Walmart Orders for MPDV  and I get to shitpost from Jupiter.**\n\n**P.S** \\- Given the current situation with Goldman Sachs block orders there might be a sense of delayed covering of short positions.  This coupled with the futures spiking rather green on Friday and all the above mentioned news.  We could see a really good week ahead.\n\n**P.S.S** there are some more articles being written by the great minds as we speak. I will link them here when they are up.\n\n**Edit 1** \\- Canoo Has Bantz! they just dropped a video of the truck driving on their Instagram and called it \"Coming in hot\",  Ride Bros where the flames Ride Bros? where's the flames?\n\n# Previous WSB Editions\n\n1.

Long term I can understand their thinking, but there are some huge questions. Who will be their manufacturing partner and what will that deal look like? Since they now want to handle manufacturing themselves long term, how much is it going to cost to build a factory and how long will that take? If they don\u2019t already have a manufacturing partner, are they going to be able to stay on track for delivering vehicles in 2022? They didn\u2019t even get into how the chip shortage is currently affecting them, so how likely are delays in the production schedule? Yes, they have a decent amount of cash on hand, but if they\u2019re going to eventually take on manufacturing themselves won\u2019t they need to raise more capital? Since they got rid of their engineering services, when will they be taking in revenue? Talking about strong demand for the MPDV in Europe made me nervous. That\u2019s a 2023 vehicle, and without knowing what their manufacturing deal is, it\u2019s fair to ask if they can build and deliver vehicles to Europe at scale to meet demand. They talked about interest from TNCs, but the statements were extremely vague, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the interest was that strong when they can\u2019t meaningfully say when they can start production. My feeling was Tony\u2019s focus was more on the pickup and the MPDV. The lifestyle vehicle is supposed to be their first release. That makes me feel like there isn\u2019t much demand for it at this point in time (the website primarily highlights the truck and MPDV as well). \n\nThe executive turn over and lack of communication to investors are also huge red flags. My take away from investor relations not communicating is they don\u2019t fucking know what to say because there isn\u2019t a concrete plan in place. It could also be why Tony was telling investors to call him directly. It\u2019s easier for Tony to spin things if he\u2019s the one handling the communication. \n\nUntil their manufacturing partnership is announced this is fucked.

{"title": "[$AMRS] \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf15 THE ULTIMATE DD \ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf15 DEEP LONG-TERM VALUE WITH MASSIVE NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS", "selftext": "*NOTE: NOTHING IN THIS POST IS FINANCIAL ADVICE*\n\n**EDIT: TLDR of TDLR:**\n\nHuge near-term catalysts for $AMRS. Large deals getting announced this week. Stock going to the moon. **Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nAmyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS\u2019s proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&D to advance their platform, both the company\u2019s technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS\u2019s upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs\n\n***The play \u2013 buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20***\n\n**MY POSITIONS:**\n\nI believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.\n\n[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)\n\n**BACKGROUND:**\n\nI was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn\u2019t have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company\u2019s potential both over the short and long term\n\n**$AMRS BUSINESS:**\n\nThis business is complicated, but I\u2019ll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance. Within Health & Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor & Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)\n\n$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model\n\nIn the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner\u2019s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)\n\nIn the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently [made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics), though this is in its early stages\n\n$AMRS\u2019s consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/0i2sigct5up61.png?width=1693&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5adddb33f2fba374819bb1a7978567d539de69d)\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/elg9yw6i7up61.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6aa48fdd57967c48d2474a2db7975fde4f63e98)\n\n**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**\n\nNo doubt, $AMRS\u2019s progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon\n\n[John Doerr Ownership \\/ Other Investments](https://preview.redd.it/zq3bts856up61.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ac19937f3e728e1761e8b26a513ce6b35f0138)\n\n**SHORT INTEREST:**\n\nAs shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS\u2019s tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock\n\n[Source: FactSet](https://preview.redd.it/zaj7ak6l6up61.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee15407674b13c2d45207fde230d9654f18f54ff)\n\n**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**\n\nBeginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**\n\nThe first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**\n\nHere is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)\n\nThe CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)\n\nTo those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the \"efficient market\" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nThese strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more\n\n***The play: $AMRS shares + April 16 calls with strikes $20 and above***\n\nGood luck and godspeed", "id": "mfc86c", "created_utc": 1616972468.0, "score": 1296, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 588, "comments": [{"body": "Ok buying this because i love ASMR videos", "score": 592, "replies": [{"body": "This is the quintessential WSB comment", "score": 195, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.010309293866157532}, {"body": "ASMR, should I google this at work?", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Actually safe for work.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Well, sometimes.", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Anime onee-chan licks your ears intensifies", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15603777766227722}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16988541185855865}, {"body": "It\u2019s weird.

Trial and error has led AMRS to where it is today.\n\nWhen a company doesn't generate sufficient cash flow to cover its operations, the only way to stay alive is raise new money, diluting existing shareholders. The strategic transactions they will announcing this week validate that they've finally found a business model that is sustainable and generates enough cash that they can operate their business without issuing significant dilutive equity. This is so important. Sure, it is possible, even likely that they will raise some new equity going forwards, many companies do this, but management has confirmed that the days of significant dilution are over thanks to the new transactions (as well as the cash generated from their high-margin consumer brand portfolio)", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the response!
