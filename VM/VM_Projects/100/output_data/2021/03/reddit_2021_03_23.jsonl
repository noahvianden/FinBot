{"title": "THE QQQ continues to trade in the same range for the past 10 out of 11 sessions ... sell premium", "selftext": "03/25 Made final entry below with unrealized gains in the time line thread and that will conclude this post.\n\n03/24 5:34pm .. THIS POST WAS INTENDED TO SHOW a trade idea that you can make some coin in a sideways market with little capital risked.  The enthusiasm and comments to help point me in the right direction have been overwhelming. What a great community! This went so well and I learnt so much. Doubt I ever need to post again. Hopefully some of you can post your trades for the week and we can all learn more from each other. It's a community and I can really feel it!\n\nThe market continues to prove it can be very violent and tricky with moves but the end result is the same. Continuing in a sideways move which benefits the sale of OPTIONS outside the range. Also, I'm selling options that expire FRIDAY on names that have high probability set ups and are near or well above MAXPAIN for Friday.  Another great day.\n\n[QQQ DAILY ... I hava IRON CONDOR that expires FRIDAY and took out positions selling BEAR CALL SPREADS .. NTNX AA TSLA ETSY QQQ .. and cashed out the following BEAR SPREADS 1\\/2 of TSLA, ALL AMC & RCL](https://preview.redd.it/np573eyt6uo61.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6469cb0ef4f88818b8a3bca7270b9093b5fa2ba)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT .. SOMEONE ASKED FOR MY STRIKES ON THE IRON CONDOR ...\n\nBuy 322 Call -- early in the trading day YESTERDAY\n\nSell 320 Call\n\nEDIT .. Doubled the above position when QQQ was at $320.60 as I saw the tape was weak for a move above resistance.\n\nBuy 308 Put -- 44 minutes in\n\nSell 310 Put\n\nEDIT .. Doubled this position when QQQ was at $320.20\n\nEDIT 03-24 .. Took three $323-$324 Bearish Call spreads Yesterday when the QQQ was just under $321 ... I have this IRON CONDOR but I'm certainly net bearish. If I get more bearish I will position for gains to the downside. I could have made much more just shorting ETSY but capping gains also means limiting losses. Stocks can gap up, so shorting is more risky than this imo. The play I'm making here is to gain some profits with any move other than a big breakout above QQQ 321. Capping my risk in this sideways chop.  Stops are in, emotions are out.  Not even logged into my account today. Just going to let it all ride.\n\n03-24 Just read, DOW RALLIES for re.opening hopes... Or is it because of this? [DIA Open Interest, Volume and Max Pain (maximum-pain.com)](http://maximum-pain.com/options/dia)  .. Interesting times.\n\n03-24 Took a break to watch the closing bell. QQQ$313.25 really needs to hold based on my short term charts. So many stocks in a nose dive. If only I took a naked ITM put on ETSY lol.  I'm just too conservative right now. If we stay below $313.25 for too long I'll remove the bottom side of the Condor for a small loss and protect from taking away more profits .. See what the morning brings. Maybe we get something to calm the market, maybe the Fed Market Pump team steps in. Who knows. But, I'm net bearish so another winning week looks almost guaranteed. GME has easily cut through every support. Good luck trying to figure out where that one stops.\n\n03-24 4:15pm E. ... Logged into account.  Got stopped out of the BULL PUT bottom half of this Condor. I got out of one yesterday at -30 and today at -59   +$364 on the day. So, I'm no longer counting on the bottom of this range to hold; But, still think some miracle will hold it up. So, everyone can stop posting that I'm taking too much risk and stops don't work :)\n\nFINAL update... 03-25 8:35am .. closed my AA position and with the price action and getting stopped out of the lower section of this condor I remain bearish.  I'm now a net buyer of premium. These two trades made this A.M.  Next WEEK Expiry: Bought 301 and sold 284 QQQ Put (03-31 $1.12dr) ... Sold $40 and bought $43 NIO Call (04-01 $0.58cr) .. Both bearish trades.  Still trading small until we get confirmation of direction from this range bound QQQ. My account shows $578 unrealized and $31 realized gains at this time. So, if this remains the same as these positions expire worthless and my account is credited ... It will be a $1,500 week without being married to the screen. With IB , Stops do work with Liquid Options like QQQ ... On less than Liquid options I can not suggest trusting them due to slippage and spreads as suggested by many of the comments. Trading more liquid options allows you to have some freedom from your trading software should you take on trades like this. However, they should not be 100% counted. If I use them, it is for smaller positions. For me, larger positions require close monitoring when trading weekly options. Hope this has been helpful to some that are new to trading options. For those of you that are better traders than I. From the comments, it seems we have a few. Please do make some posts or your trade ideas so the community can grow stronger. Trading digits on a screen can get lonely sometimes especially if you are unsure how to proceed with a risk/reward strategy that suits your account. This concludes this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, most my Bear Call spreads are $2 - $5. This is a low value strat. Not much money put in here. I'm not saying to go \"all in\" with the QQQ going sideways. A lot of you are saying Ima gonna blows up. However, I can't blows up even if everything goes 100% wrong. I'm fully hedged and have stops.\n\nBoring gains but gains with lower risk: Mon +$205, Tues +$408 , Weds +$370 ... This is the first time this year that I've traded this strategy as the right set up has not presented itself until now. My other trades outside the Condor are pretty text book for me on a weekly basis.\n\n[I'm not going to retire early but I'm not risking a lot in this chop as we all know that a trend lasts as long as it lasts .. stay safe.  I took profits on a couple. Once we break out of the range I will trade larger again.](https://preview.redd.it/3twawbu6uuo61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4b02cf30d4d1873ed942e89ed19d33234047aae)", "id": "mbnxu3", "created_utc": 1616531149.0, "score": 322, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 203, "comments": [{"body": "Ranges last till they don\u2019t", "score": 315, "replies": [{"body": "It works until it doesn't.

If you exercise your right to purchase shares of the stock (100 shares for each option contract), the seller of the call will automatically have 100 shares called away from their account.\n\nIf you own the stock already (like in a covered call position), your stock will be called away. If you do not own the stock, you will now be assigned -100 shares of stock per option contract. If you do not have enough buying power to short the stock, you will be forced to close the position immediately by your broker and will be charged an assignment fee (on top of regular commission rates). This varies between brokerages.\n\nGenerally, an option will likely be exercised if it\u2019s in the option owner\u2019s best interest to do so, meaning if it\u2019s advantageous from a price standpoint for the owner to take a position in the underlying security at the strike price rather than at the prevailing price in the open market. After the close on expiration day, ITM options are automatically exercised or assigned, whereas OTM options are not, and typically expire worthless.\n\nWhen trading options, you are either buying options or selling options. Pretty general. What isn\u2019t general are the types of orders. Short long is that if you\u2019re merely looking to trade options then you should focus on two key phrases:  \u2018Buy to Open\u2019 - which opens your options position, and \u2018Sell to Close\u2019, which closes out the position. After STC completes, you are no longer responsible for anything having to do with the options contract. \n\nIf an option is close to its EXDIV date, then close it out, otherwise your odds of assignment are much higher. If the option is close to EXPIRY, then close it out. \n\nMy general rules:  \n-Don\u2019t hold positions overnight\n-Only buy/sell, do not start writing unless you have the underlying and want to sell premium\n-large cap narrow bid/ask -> liquidity\n-I tend to stick to \u2018round trip\u2019 trades in one day\n-my positions are manageable in accordance with my risk\n-my positions are short in time duration\n\nI follow those rules above after I\u2019ve assessed and controlled for risk as best I could, and it works for me.

Options have 2 parts to their value, intrinsic and extrinsic.  Intrinsic value is simply \\`strike price \\* 100\\`.  The rest is extrinsic value.  Extrinsic is the premium you and the seller are agreeing to exchange for the right/obligation of the contract.  As you get closer to expiration theta decays extrinsic value making the option worth less over time.  So, if your goal is short term money makers then yeah, unless you are holding a longer expiration option or you're very confident in the underlying stock price's movement it can hurt you to hold.\n\nConcrete example.\n\nXYZ $200 Call for $1.05.

{"title": "Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, another generational bull market has begun - The ultimate silver DD. $PSLV $SILJ", "selftext": "I\u2019ve already posted DDs on silver in WallStreetBets a couple times, but I decided to come to r/StockMarket this time because WSB is completely focused on GME at the moment. \n\nNote this is not a post to tell you sell your GME. I\u2019m personally still long GME.\n\nIn fact I hope I GME hits $1000 after earnings, I salute you fellow Apes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSilver however, is the market I have done the most research for, and why I am writing this DD. \n\nThis post is quite long so here\u2019s the **TLDR if you are lazy:** Buy PSLV and get ready to ride the silver rocketship. Alternatively, purchase 1000oz bars of silver at premiums under 5% to ride the rocket.\n\nQuick Bullets:\n\n* Silver will rise dramatically due to a fundamentals-based rally in industrial and monetary demand\n* A short squeeze in silver is on the precipice of occurring, and could add gasoline to a bonfire, current short interest is 513%\n* SLV is a scam, if you own it then sell and purchase PSLV (and the same goes for GLD, you can buy PHYS instead)\n* The banks that run the silver market have been labeled \u2018criminal enterprises\u2019 by the DOJ, for metals price manipulation, and these are the same banks entrusted with SLV/SIVR\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are two types of bull markets in silver.  One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand.  The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze.  Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets. \n\n**I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.** \n\nSo what are these \u2018smoke alarms\u2019 I mentioned? \n\nI recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle. \n\nI ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced \u2018smoke\u2019.  \n\nThe components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.\n\nLets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP.  More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5yh58ntwguo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da878286af614bfa216734371b1b9c257726612\n\nWhen this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply. \n\nOne thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at.  Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the \u2018valuation\u2019 level of silver.  \n\nEnter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a \u2018smoke alarm\u2019 that is the signal to start buying.  In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.  \n\nBelow, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP). \n\nMore specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))\n\nBelow you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6tfe4kvguo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=64a5e124ddf99608ab11470b0492fa9642553df2\n\nI want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.  \n\nSince 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.  \n\nThe first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high).  Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater).  Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested.  Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation).  This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.\n\nThe second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011.  Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a \u2018lost decade\u2019 for equities.  The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period.  Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation).  There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market. \n\nOver the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples.  And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms.  Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse.  Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77j9noo9huo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c794b8d8b8e339ebeac5757add7cf7492a8949a\n\nI in no way think this is coming to the United States.  I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse.  Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn\u2019t necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade. \n\nBack to SMOEC though:\n\nThe third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91.  Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade\u2019s massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs).  Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021.  Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver\u2019s SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver.  Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations.  (LN scale because silver is nature\u2019s money, so it just felt right)\n\nThe yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ifpvs0nhuo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b93f28cee346f858fcb50edb3ce1981faf010cf\n\n**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out.  And there\u2019s really no reason it must stop there.**  \n\nThe recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement MMT related policies with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue.  This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring.  Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more).  The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended.  What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ziw7ob5phuo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d02a7db92e2325c8ae8c5ab7450f6c682d04d90\n\nThis inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates.  And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyp2056qhuo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa926d50b73015ff6106b64c546d79c60369ec6\n\nInflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant.  They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed.  As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don\u2019t see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it\u2019s rumored the upcoming \u2018infrastructure\u2019 bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.\n\nThis is the trap that the fed finds itself in.  Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation\u2019s debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high.  So they won\u2019t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself.  They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high).  So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can\u2019t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation?  The value of the dollar.  We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform). \n\nThe other problem with the fed\u2019s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment.  In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies.  Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation. \n\nRobotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job.  The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years.  At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now.  This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too.  Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well.  There\u2019s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well.  Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting.  The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates. \n\nOn top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don\u2019t need 2 accounting departments after all).  How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable.  Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well. \n\nThe fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors).  **The fed\u2019s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they\u2019ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.**  And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need?  And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It\u2019s a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver. \n\nAnd guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input?  Silver. Silver\u2019s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable.  So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further. \n\nOne might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It\u2019s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lh1uc7shuo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e7173278d6cf25987cf42ca93fd64caeed499c2\n\nThe spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don\u2019t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn\u2019t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren\u2019t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon.  The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation. \n\nDuring these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren\u2019t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer.  I can guarantee most people don\u2019t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any.  The move back into having even a small precious metals allocation it is what drives silver up by 30x or more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow it is time to dive deeper into the other contributor to the silver bull market, **the short squeeze.**  \n\nThere are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a \u2018green\u2019 commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver. \n\nLets dig into the silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself. \n\nSilver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity.  So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and \u2018roll\u2019 them over to a future date.  Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn\u2019t exist, then the market wouldn\u2019t be a true market for silver.  Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndustrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don\u2019t typically do it through the futures market.  They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass.  They only do it if they really have to.  Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery.  Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market. \n\nMost shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver.  The COMEX has an inventory of \u2018registered\u2019 silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight.  But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers. \n\nSo how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently? \n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3o4eda0zhuo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=5212d0ec99fa8fadc3e87d7d97da0327f9bd9a06\n\nAfter adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered.  This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find. \n\nEven more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis. \n\nNote: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0zbsru0iuo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5619336c219421bc93c10be859dd581814fdb7\n\nAs you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic.  While silver doesn\u2019t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze.  The 2001-2011 rally didn\u2019t involve a short squeeze for example, so it \u2018only\u2019 caused silver to rise 10x.  In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.  \n\nIn fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wd4lwgqkuo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf26d8204bc0817457ebe56a6354ba7ede4ad8e\n\nAs you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the \u2018eligible\u2019 category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered.  It is called \u2018eligible\u2019 because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven\u2019t taken it out of the warehouse.  It is technically eligible become \u2018registered\u2019 if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell. \n\nThe current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort.  And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American.  If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX.  That\u2019s how tight this market is. \n\nRight now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check.  If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher. \n\nAnd lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract\u2019s open interest is trending at a record high level:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knr5kwz7iuo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07edc45ea6d245cb58ff972cc93b847861d6c6e\n\nIt looks almost unreal.  And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves.  That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf93niaaiuo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4835e10de33e28790f7c588858c883df25f44949\n\n12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year\u2019s February totals by a multiple of 4x.  Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.  \n\nApril\u2019s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces.  20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.   \n\nHere\u2019s what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qehkardiuo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeeaccab17039c03f9b8214dabfce7dea377ea18\n\nSo just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)?  Well let\u2019s look at the next active delivery month of May:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lgflbrhiuo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=a84d4fe485a9a5a0cafeb7e6d8a40f99a88049a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3u861k0juo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee4cc550f8b790a913f7ce073ae9afe8e6f5230\n\nIf a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%.  Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.  \n\nNo long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares \u2018force majeure\u2019 and defaults on its delivery obligations.  This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won\u2019t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic.  As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.  \n\nOf course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough.  Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.  \n\nThere were always shares of GME available to purchase, it\u2019s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders.  The GME short squeeze may indeed return, because in this situation it\u2019s millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can\u2019t force them to sell. \n\nIn the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that\u2019s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, [they forced them to sell](https://www.businessinsider.com/hunt-brothers-trying-to-corner-silver-market-2016-5).  The difference this time is that it\u2019s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing silver.  There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there\u2019s no basis to stop the squeeze.  \n\nThe regulators literally pulled a \u2018GameStop\u2019 on the silver market.  Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a \u2018silver\u2019.  The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it\u2019s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it\u2019s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each.  There is no cornering the market going on.  This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them.  They\u2019ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion.  Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors. \n\nSo what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played? \n\n**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.** \u2013 Unless their bluff is truly called, and short squeeze occurs. Which means that the paper supply (contract silver that exists in the form of short futures contracts) has to be bought back at far higher prices to prevent further margin calls and possible insolvency. \n\nWhen the silver squeeze began in late January, there was a flurry of media interviews and articles by experts who claimed that a retail driven short squeeze just isn\u2019t possible.  Why were they so confident? Because the banks have owned this game since futures began trading, and retail buyers don\u2019t purchase 1000oz bars, they tend to purchase 1oz coins.\n\nThese small unit coins and bars are produced by mints both public and private.  These mints take 1000oz bars and use them to produce smaller silver bars and coins, but there is a limit to their production capacity. In normal times a mint might produce 5 million ounces a year, and in a time like today when demand is surging maybe they run the machines 24 hours a day and pump that production up to 10 million ounces in a year.  Does this add to demand for 1000oz bars? Yes, but the amount that it can add is capped at the production capacity of the mints.  Beyond the amount production can be ramped up, demand simply pushes premiums for these small units of silver higher, rather than the price of silver itself.  The large banks who are short 1000oz bars know that demand from this channel is capped, and thus they feel perfectly safe remaining in, or even increasing their short positions when retail coin and bar demand surges. \n\nOnce small unit silver premiums soar, the next place retail investors start to place money is in silver ETFs, primarily the SLV ETF.  This is where the real fucking over of retail silver investors starts. \n\nJeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,\n\n\u201cIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.\u201d \u2013 Jeff Currie of Goldman\n\nThis was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault.  They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it\u2019s the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX.  Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all.  So how is the ETF shorting silver?\n\nThey aren\u2019t.  The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs.  Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors.  He truly meant what he said. \n\nWhat is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF. \n\nBut no real open market purchases of silver are occurring.  Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows.  **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.**  When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange.  As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price.  It\u2019s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits.  Here\u2019s a diagram to help you sort it out: \n\n \n\n[Reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/b8patrd4juo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=733303b57df19c5133ea50432dc6068640b543a0)\n\nAn even more clear admission that SLV doesn\u2019t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future.  What does this even mean?  Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn\u2019t participate in the real silver market, that\u2019s actually not the case.  What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market.  They will not purchase silver to accumulate additional inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong.  **Purchasing SLV is the best way for a silver investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.** \n\nThe real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn\u2019t actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange.  SLV doesn\u2019t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural. \n\nFor example, when millions of people buy Tesla stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise. \n\nWhen millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.\n\nBut when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker. \n\nSo how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows?  Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the \u2018bank participation report\u2019 which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.\n\nThe chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF.  The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market.  The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021.  I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks\u2019 net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vydektr6juo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=a68f0678d992f1c30c33a84436034dbabe133f8d\n\nIt is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions.  What\u2019s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze. \n\nOne other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It\u2019s likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before the squeeze happens. \n\nFor further evidence of this theme of, \u201cIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall\u201d look no further than the deliveries data itself,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9jxmp28juo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bfcaa15c404d6e9be8425ea739265c17282b82\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that as long as investors didn\u2019t actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed and uptick, the price would begin to fall once again.  This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery.  Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need? \n\nBut just like the graph of the bank net short position, you\u2019ll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries.  **The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.**  \n\nAnd lest you think I\u2019m reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igxaamq4luo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a66830bff69ec316cb2c49b5fb2de495777b608\n\nFor JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.  Silver is the best candidate for this to occur. \n\nSLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets.  Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?\n\nAnd let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulkem3jbjuo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f30331fc8817bf081ce4b4fdf316a51765f1396\n\nFurther exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn\u2019t required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur.  I\u2019m not saying the silver isn\u2019t there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence? \n\nSo what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?  \n\nWell, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery).  Further, Sprott buys its silver directly, it doesn\u2019t have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace.  And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.  This is what is starting to happen right now.  And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks.  Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.  \n\nEven a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.  \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend at least some allocation to physical silver through PSLV, and actual physical bars and coins (when premiums come down to earth) as soon as possible. If you are a large player and can take delivery on the COMEX that is easily the cheapest and best route to get exposure as well. \n\n**Alternate plays with more risk and potential reward include silver miners, silver miner ETFs, and call options on these silver stocks.** \n\n**Whatever you do, don\u2019t buy any silver ETFs that aren\u2019t PSLV.** \n\nSilver is about to ride a rocket to the moon, the banks will get what they deserve, screw the suits, retail investors deserve to win for once, whether its silver or GME.  It\u2019s time the banks played by the rules of the system like the rest of us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimers:  I am long PSLV and other silver plays.

When most people will want it is the time to trade it for either wads of cash, or - in case of calamity/hyperinflation, straight up barter for goods. It's a no-lose situation.\n\nHowever, premiums are already high due to a shortage in these products which is only set to get worse, so if you are a chicken (seriously premiums at THESE bargain prices don't matter):\n\nNo.2 buy: $PSLV - Eric Sprott's Physical Backed ETF. When it trades at a premium, they add shares, and thus silver to the vault. The difference with SLV is, silver doesn't leave, and they ONLY add shares if they can secure the physical to back it - they have virtually no unallocated silver. Their storage is also with the Canadian royal mint rather then JP Morgan, so more trustworthy, and they are audited. Price tracks the futures price, so compared to the premiums on coins (which reflect the REAL silver price - whether it's by metal shortage or production capacity shortage, products still are in short supply, with no guarantee they'll resupply before the industrial users panic), it's pretty much at a heavy discount currently.\n\nWhere to buy: Brokers that offer it. Can't give advice there, that'll depend on locale. But most should. Personally (The Netherlands) i use DeGiro where it's under the ETFs with the rest of em.\n\nThe reason you'd buy physical over PSLV is because of taking profits - should you do so during hyperinflation, you can only sell PSLV into the open market and take \\*cash\\* profits - which then rapidly start losing value, so it requires immediate reinvestment of some kind. \n\nBut this is more of a long term view at this point. Mostly predicated on the idea that, when you wanna rotate out of PSLV for real silver - you'll be doing it for the same reason most people will want physical, and it'll be unobtainable by then at any price, so you will want to have some physical before that moment in time, price be damned. \n\nI'd advise anyone with large amounts to buy some physical but mostly put it into PSLV anyway though.

SLV is not a fraud, it gives you a claim on silver held in a vault by a highly solvent counter-party, one that's bigger and safer than Sprott. \n\nYour argument is that buying SLV is counterproductive for pumping silver prices because you induce the counterparty to short an equal amount of silver to offset your long position. \n\nI am dubious of this.

Why would JPM decide to take a risky and dumb short silver just because retail decides to go long?\n\nSimilarly, you overstate the case for PSLV.

First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                \n \nNext is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about \"other \" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  \n\nNext is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           \n\nNext is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           \n\nNext is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. \n\nNext is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. \n\nNow I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               \n \nNext is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. \n\nLastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

{"title": "Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine?", "selftext": "Hi guys!\n\nToday I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.\n\n**Business**\n\nMicrosoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.\n\nTheir operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!\n\n**Productivity and Business Processes**\n\nThis segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics. \n\nOffice saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.\n\nLinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people. \n\nThink about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.\n\nFinally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.\n\n**Intelligent Cloud** \n\nThis is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon! \n\nIf you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.\n\n**Personal Computing**\n\nThis segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines. \n\nI don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.\n\n**Business TL;DR**\n\nFuture growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.\n\n**Revenues**\n\nMicrosoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft. \n\nSwitching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent. \n\n**Margins**\n\nMicrosoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.\n\n**Assets/Liabilities**\n\n||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|\n\nMicrosoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.\n\n**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**\n\nAs of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends and has netted shareholders billions. \n\n**Price Ratios/Other**\n\n|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|\"Good Value\" for Sector|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|\n|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|\n|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|\n|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|\n|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\\>25%|\n|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|\n|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|\n\n**PE Ratio**\n\nI said a \"good\" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.\n\n**P/B Ratio**\n\nI said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.\n\n**P/S Ratio**\n\nI thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.\n\n**P/FCF Ratio**\n\nI identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x. \n\n**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**\n\nMicrosoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.\n\nApple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.\n\nGoogle: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years. \n\nAmazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.\n\nOverall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.\n\n**Moderate DCF Valuation**\n\nAssuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).\n\n**Bull Case**\n\nIn my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).\n\nI think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.\n\n**Bear Case**\n\nDon't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!\n\nIn this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).\n\nI find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.\n\n**Risks**\n\n1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.\n2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.\n3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.\n4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.\n\n**Conclusion/TL;DR**\n\nWhile Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.", "id": "mbjr24", "created_utc": 1616520059.0, "score": 174, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Bought in at $23.

Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax Studios was just made official and brings in a significant selection of AAA intellectual property. Zenimax seems to be the capstone on a buying spree of studios over the last two years. It seems like Xbox has already positioned itself to give Playstation a run for its money in the near future. \n\n\n-----\n\nDisclaimer: I have no financial position in Microsoft.

It is then follows by a more In-depth description of the discussed risk factor. \n\n> A \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.\n\n>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\n\n>A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.\n\nThis entire section is nothing more than a description of a short squeeze. \n\nAnd a short squeeze is simply upward price pressure when demand from short covering outweighs supply. That\u2019s all they\u2019re saying. Supply and demand change all the time; it\u2019s what determines the market price. Hence, when demand outweighs supply the price increases. \n\nDemand is how many people are trying to buy. Supply is how many people are trying to sell. \n\nSo when the 10k says\n\n> To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. \n\nIt\u2019s just stating if demand exceeds supply, price will go up. Or, short positions will pay a premium. \n\nIt is not saying \u201cif short interest is >= 100%, you\u2019ll pay a premium\u201d because you can pay a premium at 1%-99% short interest too. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t say \u201ctotal, or aggregate, shares available for purchase on the open market\u201d. \n\nAnd if they were referring to total shares available, or the stock float, how would \u201cadditional shares become available\u201d\n\n> To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock **until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing.** This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d\n\nYou said yourself, a short squeeze does not require 100% short interest. It only requires demand outweigh supply. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all they\u2019re describing. As evidenced by the final sentences only two Sentences later\n\n> To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.

I\u2019m sure the SEC would have a problem with them saying \u201chey everyone, come look at how much naked short selling is occurring on our stock!\u201d That would be no bueno!\n\nAlso, one way that additional shares of their stock would become available is a large portion of their board is planning on leaving and has already left.

Interestingly, the process of purifying recycled wastewater into UPW tends to be more efficient given the company conducting it knows its exact makeup, while imported water could have any number of unknown impurities[xi]. The payback period on recycling plants can be as low as 6-12 months given the aforementioned UPW purification efficiency, avoidance of heavy metals disposal fees, the salable copper recovered as a part of the process, and the lower water input costs[xii] [xiii].\u00a0 Given these and other initiatives, TSMC\u2019s process water recycling rate is close to 90% in some fabs.

These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.  \n>  \n>Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel\u2019s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86\u00a0microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.  \n>  \n>As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel\u2019s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers.  \n>  \n>Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel\u2019s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.  \n>  \n>Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel\u2019s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nEdit: I can answer this though\n\n*How do they plan to take back their market share from AMD?*\n\nFundamentally, this company has TONS of cash\u2014**7 times** than AMD.

positions I believe:\n- The prominent 'put cluster ladder' every $50 strike that would enhance downside volatility would previously increase every day until Friday - with only Friday showing roll-over. This week most of the 'put ladder' was missing, there was only a bigger cluster at $500, which eroded by about 10% yesterday. I.e. the bearish \"put ladder\" setup is almost entirely gone from the options open interest.\n- My hypothesis is that pushers of the bear raid used & piggybacked on the TSLAQ 'shitput LEAPs' expiring on quadruple witching day to create a bear narrative. Now that 90% of those shitputs expired worthless, the narrative is much weaker.\n- Yesterday there was an uncharacteristically large increase in bullish call option interest, from 126k contracts to 170k contracts - and this happened during elevated volatility, signaling significantly bullish bets.\n- There's three large 'call clusters' at $700, $800 and $850 of 13k, 12k and 19k contracts. Should TSLA break through the $700 resistance (under favorable macro conditions) these big clusters would enhance the move.\n- The in-the-money put clusters at higher prices are almost entirely missing this week, which IMO suggests that the hedge funds pushing the TSLA bear raid took their profits during the move from $800s to the $600s. The large increase in call options might in part be due to them flipping their direction.\n- Delta balance is around $690: the options space didn't have time to adjust to the move down to ~$670 yesterday shortly before the close.\n\nThis is a pretty bullish setup for this week, all other things equal.

A lot of broken TSLAQ dreams from 2019 and 2020.\n\nThis created the perfect backdrop for a little bear raid: a 'put ladder' at $750, $700, $650, $600, $550, $500, $450, $400, $350, $300, $250, $200, $150, $100, $50 - with 15-20k contracts open at every step of the ladder.\n\nThis created relatively strong delta hedging feedback loops once TSLA reached lower and lower levels - and kept alive the bearish narrative that there's no stop: $400, then $300 of this obviously over-priced crap stock ... etc.\n\nThe other advantage of this strategy is that these shorts didn't show up the short interest. The official short interest is ~6% of the TSLA float - but the real one was more like 15%, which is a very high level for a stock with such a narrow float.\n\nIt all reached a crescendo with the \\#RIPElon fake news campaign on social media two weeks ago, on the day TSLA reached the low of $540. That was a well-organized campaign well beyond the capabilities of the usual TSLAQ trolling.\n\nMaybe the same hedge funds riding the coattails of the GME pump-and-dump campaign were behind this too? \ud83e\udd14 We'll never know.\n\nAnyway, my observation above is that they don't appear to be present this week with nearly so strong signatures anymore - so more natural trading forces around TSLA will set its price IMO.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Huh, how very interesting! thanks!

Not only can they produce any molecule they want, but they can scale the molecules to commercial 200,000 liter fermentation tanks. Ok cool, so they can make molecules, big deal, what does this actually mean? Well this is where it gets interesting. These molecules that they are creating, are disrupting and replacing traditional molecules that are harvested from plants or produced from fossil fuels. Some of these ingredients include, Reb M, (replacing sugar and stevia), Vanillin (replacing vanilla flavor), Squalane (replacing Squalane which is used in lotions/skin care products), CBG (replacing CBD because it is more effective). This is just a few in the 18 molecules they have in the current pipeline.\n\nOk cool, so they can replace traditional molecules/ingredients, big deal? But thing is, it IS a big deal. Amyris is able to replace these traditional molecules because they are able to do it at a cheaper cost because they use sugar cane waste from sugar cane plantations, they are able to do it at large commercial scale, and they are able to produce the molecules even purer than traditional means.\n\n This industry is in its infancy still but bioengineering bacteria hosts to produce chemistry is the future of the materials industry, especially as resources become more scarce and demand for sustainable ingredients/molecules increase. The company currently produces 3-4 molecules each year at scale (industrial fermentation tanks) and has 12 molecules currently being produced and sold. Not to mention (450) molecules in the pipeline ready to take to market when the time is right.\n \nWhat they are doing is extremely smart right now. They are creating their own consumer brands and using the ingredients that they bioengineer to sell to the consumer for super high markup. They are able to make 50-60% gross profit margin on these products... This is an insane amount of profit on sale.. They already have 3 consumer brands and are launching 5 more this year. They plan to get each brand to a billion dollar valuated company...\n\nNow, here is where it gets interesting. They are using the profits from the consumer brand sales to fund the growth into the ingredient sales business... This is huge because this will allow them to build more manufacturing facilities to be able to produce more chemicals for more companies willing to sell them. These other companies have to pay Amyris for the ingredients out right, pay them royalties, OR license out the molecules (kind of like a software license). It's kind of like how tesla started. They started with extremely expensive electric sports car, had to sell a bunch of these at a high markup so they could afford to grow and build mass market vehicles for the everyday person.\n\nOh yeah and did I mention that Amyris is the only one of it's biotech peers that will be profitable this year and be able to self fund all of it's growth going forward?\n\nThis company is disrupting the chemical materials industry and IS THE FUTURE of the synthetic biology industrial revolution.\n\nIf you want to learn more about this company there are a few great videos that explain what the company is doing.

Think about customer service. Think about who the customer is.\n\nWalk into gamestop. Walk into Pet Smart. Walk into Best Buy. Walk into Target. Ask yourself what could be better and why things are the way they are. Could we do better?\n\nWhen you\u2019ve mastered customer service, willingness to pay increases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9muytpqzpoo61.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef5ee3353d240709a49a6a3faafeb7986a5ac1b8\n\n# Purpose\n\nDisclaimer: Don\u2019t use this DD to confirm your bias as a means to make silly choices. Use it as an opportunity to learn you dingus!\n\nSome of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.\n\nWSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n* How do we compare social media? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n* What really is customer service? **(You are here)**\n* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern DD in Revision Mode)**\n* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Google DD in Progress)**\n* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**\n* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? **(You are here)**\n* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# First Phase: Real Estate\n\nWalk into Best Buy. They do some things right, and they do some things wrong. Want into the gaming section of Target. Notice the activity levels in the region, but think critically of the real-estate afforded to it. How does it affect your experience?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8\n\nUltimately, a floor design is a subset of customer service and sale intentions. A location that sells furniture and diet pills may not service customers the same way a place that sells gaming culture (stream, cosplay) and gaming devices products. GameStop will predictably close down smaller shops, while expanding the size of others to produce an alternative service. Gamestop will no longer be a convenience store aisle, but rather an area for culture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf\n\nThe reason for this is clear. Gaming is **BIG** where many players will win. Gaming expands multiple culture vectors. Movies, cosplay events, entertainment parks, meta-verses, sold out arenas, cafes, midnight releases and home development. If you have an industry where people WILL wait in line, you have a goldmine of an industry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfg1hnt9voo61.jpg?width=573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc610af0af2faa9d17217a1836ac0ffd2991f271\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl15qmicvoo61.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57fb1c160657525a45861611f5a8b335aa6544a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Second Phase: Customer Service\n\nYou as a dear millennial, or parent of a millennial, understand that gaming is larger than life, and that experience will never fundamentally change. Ryan Cohen understands this. It is the core of an American market, much like Chewey\u2019s targeting of pets. What Ryan cohen seeks is to breech the American household rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon or Target. Ultimately, Cohen is a proud student of Jeff Bezos. This is a stated fact by himself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkbo52yswoo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd04ea2474c5e72666b9ca5f01cd2d96d590bbc6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a1qcru48po61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8fec7d952782ffd663b399dd72361576d86fb9b\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n\\- What if a parent wants to buy a high-grade computer setup for their child? Is it reasonable to assume that a 54-year old mother will understand the differences between AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards?\n\n\\- What services can Gamestop capture to produce economic value for streamers, cosplay, and e-sports consumers?\n\n\\- What products exist beyond Corsair, Logitech, and other big-name products? Do small manufacturers produce good value products that customers may love?\n\n\u2013 Can things like Legos, Roblox, Minecraft, and Nintendo find themselves in the same space?\n\n\\- Is it possible to have GameStop create integrations with services like Unity, Steam, Roblox, and other digital services? How rapidly could GameStop capitalize on successes like Among Us or other sectors like child-gaming?\n\n\\- Can GameStop capture bigger sports and sports-betting markets?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33q7ksn7voo61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4042e97ce8df20e5be17824c532d1e3dfb2eace\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Summary\n\nDespite GameStop being in a meme state, it was quite obvious that the organization was undervalued relative to the larger American or global gaming market. The company stagnated and had a weak formula for success in a rapidly evolving retail sector. I personally believe that Gamestop has the potential to sustain beyond 20-30B market cap if it operates and succeeds strategically. The first step was to have leadership that understands the larger-than-life nature of technology and culture, which it has achieved. The next step is transforming the companies space to properly service its customers and products. The final step is to overhaul the customer service to increase engagement, satisfaction, and to put the \u201ccustom\u201d in customer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhm3ea7h2po61.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ccf471f1e8269b636349fce6ac57bd81ee77872\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Naruto: Believe It!](https://preview.redd.it/0himvwbl8po61.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b8b60a889c0debf8c37c69b5cddc1517c0c53df)\n\n[https://media.nichegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/09182715/Reggie-GameStop-03-09-2020.jpg](https://media.nichegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/09182715/Reggie-GameStop-03-09-2020.jpg)", "id": "mb585a", "created_utc": 1616469163.0, "score": 2068, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 225, "comments": [{"body": "I recently shopped at gamestop, went in there with a blank slate and I am not much of a gamer. \n\nWhat I love:\n\n.

{"title": "How to Keep Your Newly Minted Title of Millionaire (2nd Edition)", "selftext": "*Preface: I previously posted this using my main account on WallStreetBets. However, since people in my life know my main account, I have decided to delete it in accordance to Part 1; Chapter 1:* ***Don't tell anyone****. That being said, I still wanted to help out as many of my friends here that I can, so I'm uploading this again on my alternative account. In the process, I have taken all of the feedback that I received in the first post, and have created the ultimate compilation of DD resources for your new financial life as a Millionaire. I hope this helps out my brothers and sisters here!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.\n\n\"Millionaire\".\n\nCongratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Your thoughts are racing as you realize all that you can do with this newfound wealth. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? And now I can go on that luxury vacation to that resort I always wanted to go to! But, slowly, there may be this other feeling that washes over you.\n\nFear.\n\nSlowly, you feel a wrinkle form on your brain, as you begin to realize how big of a responsibility this truly is, and how unique of an opportunity this is. You know that you may only have this shot once, and don't want to screw it up. Well, if this community has shown us anything over these past 4 months or so, it's that knowledge is power! So fear not, my friends! For in the paragraphs ahead lie your survival guide for the next 6 months!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"What do you mean, a 'survival guide'?\"*\n\nThis guide will be broken into 3 parts. The first section contains life advice as for how to socially, and mentally handle these unprecedented funds. The second part **does not contain financial advice**, but rather the resources to do your own research, and figure out a financial plan that would benefit you the most. The reason being is that it would be irresponsible for me to tell you what to do with your money. Beyond that, every person here has a different story. Some folks may have a partner and 3 kids, while others my still be living at home. Instead, I would like to give you all the tools to build a successful life using these new funds. The third section goes over where to go from here now that you've built a solid foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Ok, I understand what's in this guide, but why now? Why not after a squeeze?\"*\n\nGreat question! I considered posting it after a squeeze on a particular stock, but I realized that some everyday folks have already won big on well placed call options. If I can give at least one person pause to reflect, and help someone avoid making a huge mistake with their windfall...that would be enough. I'm by no means an expert, I'm just trying to look out for the people here.\n\nSo, without further ado, let us begin.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 1 - Social and Emotional Survival\n\nChapter 1\n\nProtecting it from everyone else\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...\n\n**DON'T.**\n\n**TELL.**\n\n**ANYONE.**\n\nThis is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. At least in the beginning. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well, first, people are going to find it harder to relate to you. Snide remarks such as, \u201clook at Moneybags over here\u201d, \u201cmust be nice\u201d, or \u201cremember the little guy\u201d, may weed their ways into the conversations people have with you. You\u2019ll see your relationships slowly change as people no longer relate to some of the things going on in your life. (Not everyone in your life is going to be worried about finding a tax advisor that specializes in the wealthy!)\n\nOn top of that, they\u2019re gonna smell money, and many of them may want a cut.\n\nThey're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they want to start this unusual business venture, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not know the emotional and relationship damage they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.\n\nBy that point, you\u2019ve lost. You\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place. You may have to be the bad guy and say, \u201cno\u201d. And some of those relationships may quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or the alternative is that you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.\n\nThere's also the concern of your safety. People who are lottery winners are found to be much more likely to be a victim of kidnapping, blackmail and murder. That's not to say you can't live an upper middle class lifestyle, but be careful with how flashy and open you are with your earnings.\n\nTo put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. Eventually, you may find people that you trust, and can let them in on the secret. But you can\u2019t take back your words once you say them. Be very careful with who knows.\n\n*Money talks, but wealth whispers.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nProtecting it from expenses\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.\n\n*\"Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!\"* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million after taxes, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! And while this may sound like a lot, it won't go nearly as far as you might think. Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a *source of income.* I'll go over the details in Part 2; Chapter2, but for now, an easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.\n\nSo, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life if you don't want to. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.\n\nMeanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to the poverty line. You're a millionaire. You don't deserve that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nProtecting it from yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per Chapter 1. But I implore, please **don't buy anything right now.**\n\nYes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners. Roughly 35% of them go *bankrupt within 10 years of winning!* Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 2 - Economic Survival\n\nChapter 1\n\nTaxes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoughly 40% of earnings over $500K is going to go to the federal government. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective \"*ouch*\" from everyone reading.\n\nThat's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!\n\nWith that said, since you are a millionaire, you have the resources to retain the services of a CPA who specializes in the wealthy and ultra-wealthy. And I would highly advise doing your research and getting the best one you can find, as otherwise you may be overpaying by the thousands! Also, in compliance with Chapter 1; Part 1, please do not go to a family friend, or even someone in your area. If you can travel (or in the case of COVID, WebEx/Zoom) to a CPA out of your area, even better! Find someone based on quality, not convenience!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nDebt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any debt in your life, now would be the time to review that. Any high interest debt such as credit cards, car loans, personal loans, student loans, etc. I would advise paying off immediately. Otherwise, those interest rates will bleed you dry, and take away from your profits, and your attempt to be financially independent.\n\nNow, if you have a mortgage, this would be at your discretion. Some people advise paying off the house with the rest of the debt if you have the available capital to do so. This way it removes the last payment from your life. However, the alternative school of thought is that your money is going to earn more money in an investment than it will save in the interest when you pay the house off immediately. This again will be at your discretion. If you're planning on proceeding with FIRE (more details in Chapter 3), my personal recommendation would be to pay off the mortgage up front, so that you aren't putting a strain on your new income source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nFIRE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFIRE, or Financial Independence Retire Early is a movement that has been gaining traction as of late, with the goal of making retirees out of 20-40 year olds. As mentioned above, the equation is simple. You take your net worth, and figure out what is 4% of it. So if you have $2 million dollars, 4% of that is $80,000. That means that you can live off $80,000 a year for the rest of your life without changing a thing, and be financially independent.\n\nNow, how exactly does this work? Well in the 90's, a man named Bill Bengen figured out that the worst case scenario for a rate of return from typical stock market investments year-over-year was 7%. So that means in theory, you can retire on your earnings and never touch the principle. Now, you can adjust this number as you see fit depending on your returns or any other streams of income, however for people trying to retire in their 20's, I would advise staying conservative with the 4% since this money needs to last you a lifetime. The other 3% is there to build the principle and protect it from inflation, which increases by 2%-3% annually.\n\nThis would be the standard FIRE. However, there are 4 other types of FIRE:\n\n* **Lean FIRE** \\- Living on less than you make, roughly $40,000 a year\n* **Fat FIRE** \\- Living a retirement of luxury, roughly between $100,000-$120,000 (double the standard household income in your area)\n* **Barista FIRE** \\- Using the same principles as above, but you are picking up a part time job or a gig job that you enjoy. This will supplement some of the money that you take out of your investments.\n* **Coast FIRE** \\- This last version is similar to Barista FIRE, however you use the power of compound interest to become financially independent later. You continue to work now, while your investments grow in the background. You don't need to add another cent to retirement as they will grow in the markets, however you are not financially independent today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nInvestments\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I proceed, this is once again, NOT financial advice. Now, with that disclaimer out of the way...\n\nI believe the smartest thing you can do would be to invest in appreciating assets, rather than buy depreciating assets such as cars. These come in many forms (which I will cover below), but what ties them together is that they are all a source of income. Your money on it's own isn't generating additional money. But you are also in a unique position of not having to work for your money. *It's time to make your money work for you.*\n\n**Stock Market** \\- One of the most common sources of passive income is the stock market. For the sake of your financial future, I would not put most of your portfolio into single stocks. While I'm not saying avoid single stocks all together, I wouldn't invest more than 10% of your net worth into them. Any more than that carries the risk of severely crippling your retirement portfolio. Boring ETF's, bonds and mutual funds may be a safer play. I am obligated to advise you to do your research before making any decisions on what to invest in.\n\n**Real Estate** \\- Another popular investment is Real Estate. This comes in may forms, from flipping houses, to becoming a real estate agent, or buying rental properties. The benefits to the real estate market is that you are left with something. A hedge fund isn't able to come along and short your house into the ground. Your house is yours. If the stock market crashes, or a company goes under, you're at a loss. It's easier to ride out the waves with real estate. With it though, comes more work. You are now a landlord, and have to mange the properties, and find new tenants as the old ones move out. It's not as passive of an income as the Stock Market.\n\n**Businesses** \\- \"Small business is the backbone of our economy.\" While it seems to be every politicians catchphrase, they're not wrong. Small businesses are extremely important to the success of our nation, and you now have the capital to make your own. If you have something that you're really passionate about, I would fully endorse you going out and either buying a business, or building your own business for your passion from the ground up! However, this is much, much more work than the passive investments of the stock market.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 3 - What Comes Next?\n\nChapter 1\n\nSpending\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, so you've made it this far. Now, we're going to take all that we've learned, and form an action plan. First, the spending. Make sure you build a budget for your spending and track what leaves your accounts. Just because you're wealthy doesn't mean we can get sloppy! Remember, we're trying to keep you a millionaire! When it comes to spending, don't overextend yourself. If you want a life of financial independence, you will need to discipline yourself and stay within your means. This money has to last a lifetime after all! I would also advise that any further day trading that you do comes out of the annual funds available for spending (as calculated by the 4% rule). This way, if you make a risky options play, or a stock flounders, it won't hurt you long term! And remember, hold less than 10% of your net worth in single stocks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nBuilding a cabinet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if what I've said so far isn't resonating with you, and you would rather be walked through these major financial decisions, then I would advise assembling a committee that can help you through this. Whether you choose to rely on them for the short term as you get your feet wet, or the long term to ensure someone keeps you in check, will again be at your discretion. But before I proceed with my recommended positions for your financial committee, I will remind you that time is money. If you put the time in to learn the principles of personal finances, then it will save you a lot of money in the long term. That said, some people just want to set the money aside and forget about it, and that's ok too! For a fully staffed committee, I would recommend a financial advisor, a tax advisor/CPA, a real estate advisor (should you want to enter real estate), an attorney, and an insurance advisor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nGiving\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now that you have a solid financial foundation to stand on, one that will be passed onto your kids, and possibly even your grandkids, we can begin to make the world a better place. You can now begin to give. Now, giving is a broad term in this sense. It can range anywhere from giving the valet a generous tip to park your shiny car, to donating $2500 to your local food bank just before Thanksgiving. But just like with spending, you want to make sure you don't overextend yourself. If you are a responsible steward with your money, you can ensure that you can help many more people for years to come. To do so, I would advise taking the money not out of your principle, but rather on your annually allotted funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 4\n\nSources for you to perform your own Due Diligence\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this chapter, I have included some good sources to begin your own due diligence. While I don't necessarily agree with everything that they all say, it's up to you to find what works best for you!\n\n[How to survive winning the lottery - Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the_happiest_5word_sentence_you_could_hear/chb4v05/) \\- An extremely detailed Reddit post describing how to survive winning the lottery.\n\n*Graham Stephan - YouTube* *:* Graham Stephan is a self-made millionaire who achieved financial independence in his 20's. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)\n\n*Dave Ramsey Show - YouTube* *:* A religious millionaire who hosts a radio show revolving around teaching people how to get out of debt and take control of their personal finances to become (and stay) millionaires. (Automod does not allow YouTube links, so you will need to search for this channel independently)\n\n[https://investedwallet.com/types-of-fire-in-finance/](https://investedwallet.com/types-of-fire-in-finance/) \\- A resource for a more detailed description of FIRE.\n\n[Windfall - r/personalfinance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) \\- Lots of good resources on advice for people who receive windfalls.\n\n\\-----\n\nSo there you have it. A starter guide on how to survive your first few months as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes regarding money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...\n\nTo close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America, where Steve is told, ***\"The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse.\"***\n\nMoney is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you're happy now, you'll be even happier. If you're snobby now, you'll become even snobbier. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of all those decisions.\n\nAnd if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.\n\nOh who am I kidding.

{"title": "Why is Rolls Royce PLC so undervalued?", "selftext": "First and foremost, I want to clarify that Rolls Royce PLC is a **separate** company from Rolls Royce Motors Ltd.\n\nRolls Royce PLC is the division that handles manufacturing of Turbofans for large passenger and freight planes and operates under the ticker $LSE:RR, but I am talking about their US traded ADR, $RYCEY in this post.\n\nI was looking into it and saw on their financials they average about $5-6 billion in revenue per quarter. Now the pandemic definitely hurt their numbers but according to market watch they\u2019re still completely on track.\n\nTheir total debt actually shrunk last quarter from 41b to 34b, liabilities from 16b to 13b, and their total accounts receivable only shrunk by a small margin in comparison.\n\nThey charge clients on a per-mile-flown basis so these numbers tell me that even during the pandemic they were still resilient enough to make close to their average revenue. Their inventory continues to fluctuate at a healthy rate.\n\nThey laid off 1,400 employees in November of last year and just culled another 9,000 employees from their global workforce. These kinds of cuts can be good or bad. If their revenue was much much worse I would easily conclude the more likely scenario is they are failing and flailing, but with their revenue still on-par with pre covid returns, it seems highly possible that this is a smart practice of \u201ctrimming the fat\u201d from their corporation. Many jobs can be replaced with new online tools (SaaS) and other means of automation. I think Rolls Royce has finally realized this and is preparing for an overhaul on every level.\n\nWhile this company is not an airline, it is still the second largest turbofan manufacturer in the world rivaled only by GE. Pre-pandemic shares of $RYCEY were trading at $10+, now down to $1.50 despite Rolls Royce\u2019s earnings not being as heavily impacted as some other companies like American Airlines, Boeing, and others we\u2019ve seen make a decent recovery from the pandemic\u2019s toll. I feel like this stock is being neglected for multiple reasons, of which I\u2019m sure some people wrongly think it\u2019s associated to the company that makes $500,000 cars that not many people own.\n\nGlad to hear your opinions and I hope I\u2019m missing something, if so - please let me know why people seem to hate this stock so much!", "id": "mbmovt", "created_utc": 1616527830.0, "score": 127, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "They fix and sell plane engines. \n2020 was not a good year for that.

Most people took quite a financial hit and so you also need their finances in decent shape to afford flights\n\nAlso the fleet not disappearing is more a problem for roles Royce as airlines may be able to get by without replacing older aircraft but just continueing with their smaller fleet.\n\nAnother thing I think you are too optimistic about is electric engines. Batteries are the big problem, at the moment they are still very heavy, not a great help for cars but they don't have to have the lift to counter that weight. \n\nThat also ignores issues around the early stages of electric aircraft engines such as getting these whole new designs considered safe, the aircraft design time and safety, infrastructure changes required getting implemented, retooling, and time it takes to get order for the electric aircraft. I think even if roles Royce were to come out with a working electric plane engine you are looking at at least 5 years for it to begin to be sold.\n\nOne thing I think you need to look at is the airline financial situation, they are not good. They are deep in debt just from the pandemic, they need to pay it down before they can start expanding their fleets, especially if the debt is at a higher interest rate. \n\nJust to be clear I'm not saying that they'll go bust or anything but that their EPS will be dropping for a while, they may have to downsize and your money will for now likely not be doing much short and maybe to the medium term", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7286094427108765}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4791133999824524}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.030075227841734886}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.045758455991744995}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.045758455991744995}, {"body": "No1s going to acknowledge the \u201ctake my wife to dinner and make her boyfriend do the dishes\u201d?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I mean at least he aspires to something.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10487145930528641}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16363796591758728}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0809892788529396}, {"body": "Their competitors also do a whole lot more than turbo-fan turbo-jet and turbo-prop engines. \n\nThey are very well branched into other markets which rolls Royce isn\u2019t as far as I know.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19635358452796936}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4419898986816406}, {"body": "I had 770 shares at $1.49 and it\u2019s been chilling around $1.60 the last couple of weeks.

Also, check out the performance of the Defense division in our otherwise bleak FY2020 results.\n\nIf the Civil aero market starts recovering well and RR can get into 2022 in good enough shape to restructure debt, I think there's going to be substantial upward movement.

The most likely and common cause of these engine failures is improper maintenance, not the manufacturing. It also doesn\u2019t help that the engine is inherently the most vulnerable part on the plane (hence the redundancy in design).\n\n3. That sounds like an airline issue not a manufacturing issue\n\n4.

Everything adds up. They will go back up in my (non financial advice) opinion but I think it's going to be slow. Also factor in how bad the market overall is doing, that's a big part. IMO because of the short squeeze happening with GME & AMC and possibly others.
