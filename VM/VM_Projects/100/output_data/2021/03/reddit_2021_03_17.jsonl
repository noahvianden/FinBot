He talks America needing software(pure software/AI) that is the best to AVOID conflict in order to stay ahead of America's adversaries. Basically he's claiming Palantir Technologies to be S class disruptive Tech that can lead future innovations for America.\n\nKarp would rather put his focus on having the company put its \"best foot forward\" for the sake of protecting America and its private and public interests.\n\nHe was asked in the middle of the interview \"How would he entice new commercial customers?\"\n\nHe then starts talking about the how Foundry and Gotham are unique technically speaking ( claims his tech is 5 years ahead of everyone else low key), and the way they do business is unique.  For example he explains that Palantir  in the commercial space, Foundry is a Finished product as opposed to other ERP systems that require you to do an entire IT installation that can take months.  Foundry can be installed as a whole stack in a few days!  That difference is how Karp and Palantir thinks Software companies will sell their products.  He mentions that typically ERP systems entice customers with Jargon that promises to deliver instead of providing a product that stands out from the rest.  He truly believes Palantir is in a class of its own.   He actually believes despite having Elite tech that he provides for the biggest companies in the word, he thinks that Palantir can provide a ton of value to smaller to medium companies by offering superior ERP Software transforming their business to save them millions of dollars.\n\nThey talk little bit about PLTRs partnerships including 3M, BP, IBM, and AWS.  They talk about how IBM and AWS were thought to be rival companies to Palantir but instead decided to join forces because those companies understand how difficult it is to build what Palantir built with Foundry and Gotham.\n\nHE LIKES THE RETAIL INVESTORS, he HATES the \"INVESTORS\" who buy and sell the stock who don't have any clue about the company or its Tech.\n\nHe can't on camera \"PUMP\" the stock, so he just talks about how he's more focused on building the Company for the long-term.\n\nTLDR\n\nSo about an hour talking about how superior the tech( Foundry/Gotham) is compared to any other software company's tech and how Karps ideological view of supporting America and its western values by providing Superiority and Complexity in order to stay ahead of its adversaries.\n\nFoundry is 5 years ahead of any other ERP software in the market.

For example I live in an Eastern European EU country and renewable energy already compromises a sizeable chunk of the total power generated in my country. And it is only going to get better. Nowadays renewable energy is competitive with fossil fuels for power generation even without subsidies and it is expected to become cheaper which combined with the developments in energy storage will make it the preferred power source.\n* Electric vehicles are much, much more efficient that ICE vehicles. As result even when the power grid they are charging uses electricity generated from fossil fuels, the emissions equivalent is still better than most ICE cars. If I recall correctly, even under the worst case scenario (power generated exclusively from coal powered plants with no measures implemented to filter out harmful emissions) they still are comparable to an ICE car with \\~40-50 mpg fuel economy.\n* Even if the electric grid was sourced almost entirely from fossil fuel plants, the economy of scale and efficiency is still a huge factor - with ICE cars you practically have millions of miniature power plants, whereas with battery powered electric vehicles you have several big power plants, generating power for the electric grid and all vehicles charging off of it. You can imagine which is more efficient.\n* It is much, much easier to implement measures to clean the emissions of power plants since they are few in numbers. Moreover, if a country wants to continue to use its fossil fuel power plants, it can upgrade them to be compliant with tighter emission requirements by installing various emission filtration systems. On the other hand it would be impossible to retroactively install better fuel emissions systems on older vehicles - if a vehicle was compliant to EURO 4 for example, you cannot easily convert it to EURO 6.\n* The emissions released by ICE vehicles are located within the cities, while power plants are generally located outside of populated neighborhoods or outside of cities altogether. This doesn't matter to the environment but is an important factor for people as it has huge implications for health and quality of life. This is particularly important to Europe due to our high reliance on diesel cars and the particularly harmful emissions diesel engines release, compared to petrol engines (fine particulates and NO2).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5615072250366211}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6191285252571106}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Volkswagen has entered the room...", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.042171843349933624}, {"body": "Hold on.

That culture won't grow as fast as it did while we were all locked up in our homes, but that culture is also now more interwoven into our daily lives than ever before. Look at how many people use or watch Twitch. Think about how popular video games are in broader culture, with movies being made out of the top franchises. I think people are underestimating how popular all of this will remain, even after the pandemic subsides. And CRSR is perfectly suited to take advantage of all this with their industry-leading products. Also, it doesn't hurt that they make gobs of money, already.\n\nNo, CRSR is not a blue-chip stock \u2014 which I own lots of, the majority of my portfolio \u2014 but it legitimately has the chance to double or triple in the next few years, if the bull thesis is correct.

And on all accounts, I would think the same if I hadn't started looking into this further. There's one too many correlations to suggest that the true short-percentage is much higher than whatever FINRA/FINTEL is saying these days. For one, synthetic shorts are not counted towards the float. Even today in the GME hearing naked shorting was discussed as a big problem. Additional, many have noticed ETFs that contain GME being shorted in high volumes: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m5v1xy/i_think_its_quite_evident_they_shorted_gme/)\n\nEvidently, short-sellers are able to short the ETFs, and then immediately cover all non-GME shares, effectively shorting GME without the short-interest data showing up in reports such as FINRA. \n\nIf you have been following GME closely, there was a large dip from 340 down to 180 recently. The dip correlated with a huge number of shares being taken off iBorrowDesk, as well as just about every single media outlet reporting within minutes that GME dropping out of the sky. Suspicious, but not concrete evidence, yes. \n\nIf this isn't enough, there is also Citadel's long history of being fined for illegally misreporting short data. See link [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/)\n\nRecently, it was also realized the GME (since February) has had a negative beta value of -2.09 (or lower). If you are not familiar, this means that GME is negatively correlated with the overall stock market. If the stock market goes down 10%, GME goes up 20%. If the market goes up 10%, GME goes down 20%, which is just a prediction model. I'd encourage you to look it up if you're not familiar. Again, these seems correlated, but not fully concrete. There has been very consistent data showing these opposite reactions when the market does poorly and GME does well.\n\n>and institutions aren't putting their money behind the stock after seeing it's insane volatility\n\n**This statement is very incorrect, surprisingly**. GME is going up *predominately* because of institutional buying. Get this, Fintel is reporting 136% institutional ownership of GME shares. See link [here](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme). But how is that possible?\n\nSee, this is the killer out of all the things that might be considered speculative, but not concrete. You can't get 136% ownership without a whole lot of naked shorts (synthetic shares) out there. And institutions are not selling. Just check SEC 13D/G forms.\n\nIf the whole shebang was over, why would institutions not sell right now? GME is at an insane price, around 200 something right now.\n\nThis is the killer of all the theories that all the shorts are covered. At the very least, there's a whole lot of naked shorts out there, and a big problem with the share distribution and ownership of GME\n\nSo let's say it does squeeze like last time, and RH gets shut down. Or how about all the brokers? Well, RH claimed to have a liquidity issue, and frankly, they may have been right, but for all the wrong reasons of a poorly run brokerage. There's some outlandish theories out there that I won't entertain you with, but the fact of the matter is that the difference this time is that institutions are leading the charge into the short squeeze. Just look at the 13D/G forms and you'll see this is a hedge firm vs hedge firm + other institutions battle. They're going to have more influence and power than a bunch of idiots on the internet.\n\nThe main reason the government has not stepped in is probably due to both ignorance of the true nature of the situation, as well as the inability to fix the problem. The problem really has to deal with debts. A short is a debt, so if there is a bunch of shorts out there, closing down GME or something does not solve the debt issue. The brokerages are still on the hook to get their loans back.\n\nWhere I might agree is whether a short-squeeze could actually cause enough deleveraging to cause a sizeable dip, and then cause a market crash based on panic.

{"title": "Now is a great opportunity to go long $TLT", "selftext": "As the title indicates, I believe now is a great time to start building a position in the twenty-year Treasury ETF, ticker $TLT.\n\nThis is not a revolutionary idea--probably because I am not a financial advisor, and my thoughts on capital markets should not be misconstrued as investment advice. I am, however, a businessman. As a businessman, I have experience doing business things. It might therefore be pertinent for you all to consider my thesis, for academic purposes at the least.\n\nThe last month or two have been, hm, shall I say humorous. Gracefully, I held my tongue as the entire market flipped out about rising treasury yields. Why was I calm amid sharp equity selloffs, rocketing yields, and talk of damaging inflation?\n\nBecause a) we've heard this story too many times before, b) not mutually exclusive from a), Jerome kept on trying and trying to tell everyone that rates wouldn't rise for the foreseeable future, and c) this inflation story has not only been bandied about like folklore, but furthermore, all the while, *we've failed to even reach minimum inflation targets*.\n\nToday, we finally heard from our great Teacher, JPow, who reminded the kids that the rules still apply. And what are the rules? Keep printing money and keep rates rock bottom low.\n\nI do not for one moment buy that the unprecedented printing of money, in the face of an unprecedented halt of the entire economy, will cause problematic inflation. Also, in the end, Treasuries are not absolutely tied to the Fed's overnight rate; the demand for Treasuries is what decides the price and therefore yield of said Treasuries. We've just seen one of the biggest selloffs in Treasuries since 2018 (and the very early days of last Feb./March, until the bond ETFs regained sanity and there was a flight to safety). I don't see yields rising more, becoming totally detached from the Fed rate.\n\nFor thirty years, bonds have raged bull-wise. I don't see that ending when money is cheap as ever. \n\nIf anything, I see markets settling on cyclical, strong balance sheet equities. Even that, however, is a stretch for me. FANGMAN is about as cheap as it's been in a while. Facebook is ridiculously cheap. Amazon doubled earnings expectations recently and wasn't even rewarded for it. Semiconductors are brimming with demand. Financials are on fire. Airlines and cruises and live events and etc. etc. are preparing to come back with a vengeance. People are buying Bitcoin as if it were gold circa 1849 for Christ's sakes. We're just entering the biotech and clean energy age, even if it's still fledgling and speculative.\n\nMoreover, we've just finished off a HUGE Treasuries selloff. It's not about where we are now, but where we were relative to recently, and with rates still near zero and the economy ready to explode, I simply don't see a reason to seek shelter; bonds will remain strong as a speculative device, as it is in all bull markets. (Bond prices don't rise because your grandma bought you a couple 20-year Bills so you could make $500 dollars when you turned 21. They rise because institutional investors are trading them.) We'd have to see a serious extension of the recent selloff to justify the velocity of Treasury yields--which have already slowed significantly since the latest growth/tech correction. **Oh yeah, and the Fed is still buying Treasuries...Lots and lots of the every day all day from sunrise to sunset and maybe still in the night when no one is looking.** \n\nFor a while now, institutional investors have been short $TLT (lots of put buying as well). Last August, I held the same thesis, didn't have the confidence to follow through, and shed a single tear for each day that passed as a phenomenal opportunity passed me by. Rates had nowhere to go but back up. Especially mortgage rates had gotten out of control. But this is exactly the overextension I was looking for. This is, potentially, an equally profitable opportunity on the upside.\n\nThe beauty of this trade is, you can also use this as a mechanism to hold cash for future buying opportunities, keeping it low risk. For example, say you park 10% or so in $TLT. Say it continues dropping for a bit longer. You can sell calls, collect the dividend, and keep your basis down until it turns around again. And if it stays flat, fine, either take the premiums or collect the small interest.\n\nIf you're speculating, I think calls are a decent play but not quite yet. Premiums are high as a result of the recent selloff. Personally I think shares are the way to go until IV drops as things stabilize.\n\nI'm going to start building a position slowly as it continues dropping--about 1-2% as a nice foundation, then about .2-.5% every week or two after that. Then, when it begins to flatten out and reverse, start buying more aggressively and discontinue my short call program, until I reach about 10% of my portfolio. I'll then keep it at 10% moving forward, rebalancing when opportunities arise or more cash comes in from the 'ole 9-5.

Given that the Fed is not extending this exemption, or implementing ycc, and that we are about to see a massive wave of customer deposits, if banks have been dumping treasuries because of SLR, then we are *almost certainly* going to see them dump a *massive* amount of treasuries to come into compliance with SLR in the near future.

If the fact that the Fed is buying treasuries is bullish and will cause yields to go lower, then why have yields been getting higher for the last 3 months?

I was just finishing another 12 hour shift, and I was butt ass tired. I drove out of downtown to the warehouse district where I could calm my nerves and collect myself away from the hustle and bustle, crack heads, homeless and all the weirdos than san francisco has to offer. I was living in the hertz rental at the time to avoid pay bay area rent, and was making plans for what I wanted to do that night. Just my luck, I saw a bumping party down the street and made a plan to leave the car there, go to the party and crash in the car once done with the party. I get to the party and its like a 40 dollar cover charge, fuck, whatever I paid it, this better be good is what I thought to myself. I get inside, full of chicks, my lucky day. But this wasn't a normally good ratio this was the best ratio I had ever seen, Like 10 chicks for every dude, but something was off. No girl was looking at me or checking me out, weird. I know what your thinking, couldn't you tell they were lesbian? no, they were completely not the stereotypical lesbians. They were all young beautiful girls. I put 2 and 2 together and was like dam this is a lesbian club. I go up to one of the girls and ask, where are all the straight girls at, she take my joke seriously, and I just brush it off and go to the dance floor. I'm really fucked up at this point. next thing I know these two short, weak feminine dudes come up to and tell me I have to go, I'm like dam that bitch must have ratted me out as I saw her standing next to them. So they were trying to pull and tug me out of the club ( I am so glad, I kept my wits about me and did not strike or punch them). They eventually get me out and the police are outside, they tell me not to come back, and I ask them for my money back, they say no. I walk around the block, I think to myself fuck this I paid 40 to get in, I'm getting my moneys worth, I want to get with one of those hot lesbian chicks.

It owns and operates a diverse portfolio of companies around the world in numerous business sectors. **To summarize it is the Chinese Amazon (AMZN) and does all sorts of things.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38seuif3pin61.png?width=311&format=png&auto=webp&s=22d1c7f5d1fa624f44a716d564138fae5820cc8e\n\n**Alibaba is a great company with great growth prospects but you don't need me to tell you that just look at the numbers.**\n\n \\-Alibaba\u2019s e-revenue for 2020 was $41.7 billion\n\n\\- The latest available info shows that the Alibaba Group held 55.9% of the Chinese ecommerce market\n\n\\- In Q3 2020, the percentage of profits that Alibaba generated just from commerce in China was 62%. \n\n\\- Alibaba\u2019s GMV on Singles\u2019 Day in 2020 reached $74.1 billion.\n\n\\-**THE PE RATIO IS 24 FOR FUCKS SAKE for a super growth company**\n\nWith a five-year annualized\u00a0 earnings growth rate of 29% and a sales growth rate of 47%, it's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. It's been a big winner since its IPO in September 2014.\n\nExpectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, and the company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.\n\nThe company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.\n\nAlibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba's **cloud-computing business** is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.\n\nAlibaba also sees dollar signs in food delivery. In 2018, it merged its food delivery service Ele.me with its lifestyle app Koubei to better compete with Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Meituan.\n\nSales at Alibaba's digital media and entertainment unit are also rising. The unit includes Alibaba's video streaming platform Youku, along with its music streaming service, Xiami. Alibaba also has a licensing agreement with Walt Disney (DIS) unit Buena Vista International, giving it access to a large amount of Disney content.\n\n**Why buy Alibaba right now? They have got butt fucked raw the past few months by the Chinese government? Most recently the Chinese government told Alibaba to dump their media assets.**  \n\nThe risk is simple, will the Chinese government continue to make investors uneasy and weigh on Alibaba. They just told them to dump their media assets.... which weirdly enough would be bullish.  An analyst at Morgan Stanley made the case that it would be a positive for Alibaba to do so, as it would improve its margins and provide it with more capital. Their media assets lose them money. The analyst reiterated the firm's overweight rating and $320 price target. **It has only been negative news lately and you must buy when others are fearful.** \n\nI am a capitalist loving spitfuck, I am no commie. If you want capitalism to thrive throw some money into this strong fundamental company.\n\n**What is the play and why now?**\n\n**May 21 240 Calls** \n\nThe stock has gotten wrecked and has showed stabilization. This is a great opportunity to enter in and ride it to tendie town. Worst case scenario it breaks 220 support and you eat the losses. Best case scenario it skyrockets leading up to earnings in May and you cash out for great gains. It will by no means be an easy diamond hands. This stock moves very crazily, I am currently down 9% on my calls. But when IV picks back up and it skyrockets we will be driving lambos. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nOn my etrade research all the analysts have price targets of 285+, average target of 325, and highest being 395. And those guys get paid a lot more than I do to do research.\n\nCannot go tits up. \n\nLets ride this.", "id": "m6sv8z", "created_utc": 1615957946.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "when is china gonna pull out of BABA's asshole?\n\ntoo much buttfucking going on right now.", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "As long as leadership stays, the Chinese government will always be fucking BaBa in the ass.

{"title": "AMD to Jump 50% Soon to $120 and Here's Why", "selftext": " AMD is trading around $80 right now, it's down about 16% from peak. It's movements are following the NASDAQ right now, meaning money managers are not trading AMD directly, they're just trading the entire NASDAQ. But they will be trading AMD soon and they will be buying. Here's why.\n\nDr. Lisa Su says they expect to grow 37% this year. She's always conservative on the numbers, more like 40% is realistic. Compared to Intel which is expecting 0% growth for 2021. Intel is being forced to slash prices to be competitive with AMD, which means reduced margins. Then they need to invest heavily in R&D to catch up to AMD. They also said they'll be using TSMC to make 3nm chips for them to help them catch up. Intel is a competitor to TSMC, so don't expect them to get any discounts. All of this leads to higher operating costs and further reduced margins. AMD will also be using the same 3nm from TSMC so don't expect Intel to pull away with a victory when the time comes (not for another 2 years), they're merely trying to catch up while they work on their own fab problems. It's possible that since AMD has such a lead, Intel may not catch up for the foreseeable future, >3 years. Remember AMD has a 100B market cap, Intel is 268B.\n\nAMD holds 7% of the datacenter market, that number is about to skyrocket as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Tencent are going all-in on AMD powered servers. The datacenter is where the margins are the highest, this is what will make AMD serious cash, not their consumer products. And this is also where they have the most market share to gain, if they do it right, which they are.\n\nCramer on why he wants to buy more AMD stock:  \n[https://www.thestreet.com/video/why-jim-cramer-feels-bullish-about-amd](https://www.thestreet.com/video/why-jim-cramer-feels-bullish-about-amd)  \nLinus on why AMD EPYC is now multiple generations ahead of Intel's datacenter products:  \nOn youtube /watch?v=xKj5sMVsMf8 (can't post youtube links on WB)  \nLisa Su on why the chip shortage is good for AMD and that they are ramping up supply to meet the new demand:  \nOn youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc\n\nCurrent Price Target is $106 with a high of $161. My price target is $120. AMD stock history shows the stock tends to stay flat for months followed by a large jump within a 10 day period. I expect this to happen again. When will AMD jump? I don't know, but I expect it to happen within the next 3 months.\n\nLast year I turned $1k into $87k with LOGI, I am now putting $50k into AMD, across stocks (350 shares) and several call options with expirations from April 2021 to June 2022.", "id": "m79506", "created_utc": 1616011120.0, "score": 407, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 160, "comments": [{"body": "AMD has been a great investment opportunity for a while now and they're really putting a lot of pressure on Intel, and to a lesser extent Nvidia.
