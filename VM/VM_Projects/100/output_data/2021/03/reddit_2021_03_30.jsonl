After all who would ever be on the losing side of a trade if they knew what they were truly risking?\n\nOn a serious note though if you looked historically at the dates of meetings and economic forums relative to the performance of most index securities there's little or no change unless the state of the economy is in question. While people are aware of it there's generally no significant impact even within 24 hours regardless of the message seeing as mixed messages have been given for the past 10 years on the bull run being good or bad. I mean it's interesting stuff to dive into but it certainly isn't what I would consider a driver of market behavior nor is it a key function of pricing per se. Usually it's just what happens due to these events, i.e. inflation and monetary policy, but that takes a long time to take hold generally speaking as well.\n\n> I mean if anything it could just show you're hanging out with a group of people who are just as clueless about the economy. It does not speak to any objective fact and the fact that it's employed as an attempt at a rebuttal speak volumes. The fact is that the market does move as a whole in reaction to these events - **see March 17 as an extreme example**, specifically the 2 pm candle as Powell releases his statement - and people can strategize around them as they do earnings. Whether you or others in your circle know about it is immaterial.\n\nBut we're not talking examples. We are talking norms. Hence, \"most\". The reality is that others in my circle knowing about them isn't indicative of the validity of your ideas so much as it is to prod at the idea of their validity on the whole; you can ask most people when the earnings are for their favorite stock and they'll know the ballpark but the general reality is that most investors ( II's too ) probably aren't on the up-and-up on every agenda on these meetings that happen something around 8-10 times a year.\n\nIf it were an intense event on the whole you'd see 8 - 10 shifts over time almost every year and you don't.

But that also means you don't actually understand where the risk *is*. A simple example: You are holding SPY, it's $400, it loses 12% in a day, so you've lost 48 per share so 4,800.00 per lot of 100. Your CC I promise you did not cover even 10% of that and that's pretty much ATM and when you gear up to sell your next CC you're basically going to not cover anything again. CC's are as risk free as a limit sell order would be because that's never where the risk lies. The risk lies in holding the risky asset, never in trying to get rid of it, so I'm not actually impressed that you came to that conclusion. That conclusion should have been obvious on the front. \n\n>All investments are bad if they go down, I'm saying some are better than others.\n\nWell let's play this out.\n\nSPY. Same scenario, it was down 12%, and I am on the other side of your CC. You collected from me $300 let's say, great, and I paid $300, okay, you are now down $4800 - 300 = $4,500.00 and I am ... actually just fine. I see that it went down and said to myself, \"wow, that sucks\" and find something else with my money so I've not only not paid for the stock itself but I am not holding a bag and I couldn't care less what happens from then on to this thing. \n\nInverse scenario with puts, it's still down 12%, you sold my a promise that you'd buy it if it fell as little as 3%, this cost me $400 but it fell as I was worried it would do and you will be paying me $388.00 per share, catching the falling knives at $352.00. Well, golly, thanks! I will take my loss of $1,600 ( 12/share + 400 put ) over your loss of $3200, ( (388 - 352)*100 - 400  ) any day. \n\nYou know what though? Most weeks you take my money. That's absolutely true; it seems like a no brainer to be on the selling side of insurance but the problem is that when things go wrong and insurance is invoked it's usually catastrophic enough to wipe out weeks of gains. I mean I think a few people who do insurance (Acutaries? Accountants?) hang around here so find one and ask them why the copulas matter and how come you pay so freakin' much for insurance.\n\nSelling options is nothing more than playing to high tail risk; lots of risk of loss for usually menial levels of gain.\n\nE: Just in case you missed it the long call scenario carries no risk.

First, you don't lose your entire portfolio if you exercise that put, it just converts away from SPY into cash. Very, very different than actually losing the portfolio and blowing up. \n\nOn the other hand if you are holding this bag and it was traded as normal within rational parameters you're not 9% OTM, you're maybe 2% otm, so you just got a really heavy bag to hold that obviously you couldn't foresee how it would play out. And it didn't \"get better\" right after the 16th. The fact that it ended up with that liquidation and dropping that much meant that it was rough for a while there.\n\nWorse yet if you were there on February 14th or so you'd be in pretty much the same situation, the SPY rarely drops even more than 3% in a day so one way or the other you'd find yourself holding a bag that, for about a month and a half, would get really, really heavy. Hopefully you're not long any other risky assets because you're going to get margined. Now of course because this is historically accurate and not make-believe this happened to a lot of people and a lot of firms. You can look up any number of cases where going under was a real problem because almost everything fell at the same time and solvency and the ability to meet margin on any underlying bets pretty much failed.\n\n>You're talking about how massively risky selling options are and saying you'd be fine losing your entire investment, it's facetious and makes no sense.\n\nYou've said four incorrect things thus far while also stating that the inverse would be irrational and it makes me think you're *extremely* new. You didn't even seem to know how far and how jagged the fall for SPY was last year. I'm not saying you don't have a right to an opinion but I don't think your opinion is informed just based on what you're saying.\n\n>E: selling puts and selling covered calls is in no way \"infinite risk\". It's completely defined..\n\nThat is 100% incorrect. A lot of people mistake the ability to cover an event as a definition of that event, it's incorrect, if you sold a CSP on SPY and got assigned during a downfall you're stuck with the daggers in your chest; your portfolio is officially red, period, because that's what you decided to catch. You won't be caught with a margin call but that doesn't actually make this any less risky; you have no idea how far the daggers can actually fall. You can sell a CSP on a security that's 5% OTM and it can fall 50% EOD on Friday and you get assigned. And of course we have the wisdom to close all of these early *but* that's exactly why those wise points exist; this stuff does happen. And when it does you're stuck.\n\nOn the same front CCs seem like the play of the week because they are fancy limit orders so you can't possibly lose money in them but it's the same scenario in reverse; if you're holding the risky asset (the stock) setting limit orders doesn't do you any good against falling prices *and* what you don't know is when or how much something can rise rapidly and suddenly. The inverse to this is that you bought something at a top (oh, you know, SPY on Feb 13th or thereabouts) and it falls incredibly fast, faster than you can really react and definitely in a way that isn't obviously knowable how deep it can go, and with your plan on fire you're selling CCs at the highest premium you can tolerate to get out of the hole. Reality? You will, unfortunately, you will far too early; if you did this on SPY after the month and a half decline even at 5% each week you'd have been caught taking a loss.\n\nAnd again this is history. This is not make-believe. The whole notion that the risk is truly understood here and defined is just bad; this is why traders blow up and why even those who run the wheel can implode; they take a strategy and misplace the risk. You don't want to be the one holding the bag whether you're selling CCs or CSPs at all, it does you absolutely no good, and so while you can define the *profit* your risk is absolutely undefined on both of these deals both in upside and downside.

I find 5 minutes helps me cope better with the swings and validate if it's a real break out or not..\n\nPink dots are VWAP. Buy a call below VWAP, sell above VWAP. That's it!\n\nYellow is a 50 tick EMA, light blue is 125, dark blue is 500. This gives me a generally good idea of where the trend is going to go.\n\nI like Session HD, the yellow/blue thing with the red line. It's a nice tool from TradingView. The brighter yellow/blue on the left shows you where 70% of the volume is, the dimmer one is 30%. the Point of Control, or the red line, gives you an idea of where most of the action is taking place. It acts like a second VWAP/Mean for me. Plus the clusters of price of the Session HD show me good ideas of where prices are.\n\nVolume in the middle. Yellow line is just an an average\n\n21 RSI with these alarms setup: [https://storage.googleapis.com/maketheory-send/1dc0a2a8-6c96-44d2-8feb-94ec79dae284.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/maketheory-send/1dc0a2a8-6c96-44d2-8feb-94ec79dae284.png)\n\nRSI 80 : SPY is going to pivot down in price soon, this is a very extended RSI\n\n70 : Wow! Rocketing up, definitely cut some by now\n\n55 : A good time to buy a Put or sell a Call\n\nBetween 55 & 35 I don't buy in. Too choppy and could go anywhere\n\nRSI 35 : Consider buying a Call, sell a Put\n\n22 : SPY crapped itself and is ready for a reversal. Buy a Call.\n\nThe last two things are TNX in green and VIX in brown. TNX is nice to see the 10 year yield, the higher it goes, the lower Spy tends to, but lately that's been reversed.\n\nVIX of course is the ultimate bellweather. I know a VIX below 20 is dangerous as SPY is going up but for how long? Above 22, SPY is suffering and going down, but may want to reverse.\n\nI find looking at the 1 hour and 1 day stick as a good way to get comfortable with what is going on with SPY.\n\nLastly:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/eRvmx5r.png](https://i.imgur.com/eRvmx5r.png)\n\nI find this chart from UnusualWhales correlates well to general trends.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like I need to take a class from you.

Don't get caught in a IV Vacuum(rapid decay in vol sucks the juice out of your option, great for writing).\n\n\\- Just my opinion. I'm a former WS guy that started a BONY on the derivatives desk in 2005..\n\n\\- Lastly, Yes markets go up most of the time, this bottom up rally is nothing I've ever witnessed.

And the things that this IS possible. \n\nI was like you before I really got into $GME. Bought a share in January and sold for a loss at 56. I thought these hedgefunds can do anything to the price so I stopped thinking about it and thought gme could only go to the moon if people weren't selling which didn't happen so I thought we have a problem here with the jail dilemma thing. I thought it was just a pump and dump and these cultist people are just a bunch of idiots that want \"quick money\" which is never possible ever in this world. \n\nI tried to invest in the stock market like every other boomer and it worked a bit with bitcoin. Also put some money in REAL pump and dump shit like weed and RKT. Lost just a bit cause I was scared since I had no experience. 1 month later GME  \"magically\" went back up from 40 to 180 after market closed. Then I was thinking: \"wait these retards were REALLY onto something\". This wasnt just a pump and dump this is really a fight against RICH vs POOR. I felt really bad cause I did trust these apes. I thought I got brainwashed by the community and my brother and I just wanted to invest in the stock market and get slowly rich you know. But something about this stock/event feels different. The rich keep getting richer and its time for them to finally pay. \n\nThis was all just feeling and I was like fuck it and fomo'd everything in at 130$. Since then I decided I will ride it with these retards or die with them. Why? Cause I fucking love them. The community is really good and we have some really smart people in their as well. I choose to go with them to the moon or to the ground. \n\nAfter a few weeks we got some actually really good DD's from smart apes and then my gut feeling was changed by logic and research making me even more bullish on gme. So please don't compare this to any other crazy cult. We are right and only time will show. The hedgefunds got greedy, thought gamestop was dying, corona made it even better for them and wanted to kill gme for money. It didnt work out for them and their faces show it. \n\nThey never had to fight retail like this and the first time they do they're losing hard. They tried to cheat, redirect our attention on silver and weed. They control the media so they always had the advantage. Now that we have technology and we can communicate so fast for example through Reddit, time has changed. Its time for us to make the world a better place. This will go down in history, I cant see it any other way. \n\nIts all really simple tbh. Supply and demand, hedgies that don't want to admit defeat and DIAMOND HANDS \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c.

The real bad guys do that all the time, they are doing it out there in the real world and they are doing it right now. Democrafts, republicans, rich and poor, corporations that convince their min wage workers that they are a family and to work harder than they should for the 'culture', to give up their sick time for co workers because they wont give them any, that health care is \"communist\".\nGME was always dying. Everyone hated Gamestop for years and wanted it gone, it was the prime example of dying retail and how to not treat workers and conduct business. \n\"So please don't compare this to any other crazy cult.

It's also every religion and every radical political movement.\nAnd ill prove that with what you said about Silver and Weed. The members took something unrelated and made a narrative for it, without proof, to try and prove there is an evil orchestrating behind the scenes. They took everything they believed to confirm their narrative and spun it as the only possibility, not that it was more people trying to get rich quick and form the next GME or BTC. Truth is we have no idea, it COULD be rich dudes, it probably was, but does it have any relation to GME? No one can possibly know, we live in a weird time full of volatile stocks and assets where everyone is now aware of the market and digging out new ways to rally everyone to fight for their cause. \nIn the end this is just a stock, play it for money just dont play yourself.\nIt can go super high for all I care, I'm not going to factually say its going to drop because it may not, look at Bitcoin, but it might not, just dont treat it like it's a savior.

Pass. If I had bought in 12 months ago, great play.   But right now?  It's not something I'm sure I want to be holding, and definitely don't want to be buying at this price.  Cathy Wood did great, but her God talk is wonky to me and anyone who was heavy in tech had a great year, not just her.  I don't know if I trust her abilities going forward. \n\nARKX? Pass, for same reasons plus I don't understand why she picked the stocks she did at all.  Wonky.  God talk, etc. \n\nTSLA? Pass.  Way too expensive right now even if future earnings might (keyword *might*)  justify this P/E ratio. Too volatile, too. \n\nXXII? Pass.  You probably haven't heard of this one, but someone recommended them to me because they might be the future of smoking with their \"zero nicotine cigarettes\".  That's just wonky, folks, even if there might be a small market for that, ugh, maybe. \n\nBitcoin?  Out.  Not a real currency and way too volatile and uncertain. \n\nI probably triggered some people. Feel free to explain why I'm wrong about any of these.\n\nAnd of course, no risk, no reward.  So if you want to put a little bit into Bitcoin or Tesla, by all means.  But my current philosophy is that we can just avoid all the wonkiness and go for the straight forward plays.  You know, the Apples, Microsofts, Costcos, Phillip Morris, etc.  Or hell, go ahead and stick it in VOO. I didn't, that's not my style, but it's a safer play than probably everything I listed at the beginning.\n\nI'm new to this so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.  But I think I understand why they say that \"most people lose money in the stock market\".  It's because they're always chasing performance (buying ARKK at ATH) and picking winners based off some vague notion like \"Elon Musk and Tesla are the future\".  It's not smart, and it's a recipe for disaster. \n\nIf you are like Mr. Keith Gill and can truly identify deep value, more power to you.  But you don't find deep value by buying the same stocks that everyone else is. \n\nTL; DR: the markets are pretty weird and uncertain right now.  So, IMO, why make things any more uncertain or wonky?  Just stick with good businesses that will do well in the sort, mid, and long term.\n\nOr do index funds. I chose individual stocks because with my picks I think I will be safer in the event of a correction.  The market can be kinda wonky sometimes, too.  But that's just my style based on my current risk tolerance. \n\nSo far I am slightly up on the month and on the YTD, with a look for the long-term.", "id": "mg5nij", "created_utc": 1617070747.0, "score": 275, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 513, "comments": [{"body": "Aaaaand the bottoms here guys", "score": 623, "replies": [{"body": "Almost certainly.

The only mineral I've really seen this exponential growth hit was Lithium. Even with Lithium I'm hesitant to say it's the way forward as we've come to find the impact of lithium mining is extremely detrimental to aquifers and the environment overall. \n\nBack Pedal a little bit to Strategic metals, Copper, Nickel, Zinc. These metals have a multitude of applications and will have many more come future breakthroughs. So I ask, why haven't we seen Mining players see similar growth albeit some have seen tremendous gains but overall it's not reflected as proportional to Lithium.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to get myself a Mining Engineering degree so I know a thing or two about the industry and can pick out the nuggets of gold when I read through the right Technical report which to the untrained eye looks like utter nonsense. This has led me to making some pretty wise investments thus far.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is, I'm with you on the safe bets but why haven't the masses realized that in order to further these technologies and initiatives we need to dig up some rock and we have well known miners digging up some good rock and others with huge potential.\n\nMy high flying mining players I've got in my portfolio at the moment are:\n Rio Tinto (Huge miner, equally huge dividend)\n Barrick (Gold Player who recently erased some big debt and are frothing at the mouth with future potential given the trajectory of inflation)\nTalon Metals (High Grade Green Nickel project in the US)(Future Mine in the US and will come online as the only remaining US Nickel mine shuts down (~2023)\nBHP (Huge Player even bigger Staying power also a solid dividend) \n\n\n\nTLDR: Why gamble exponential losses when you can have safe solid returns and still see solid growth.

It\u2019s being seen by many people and companies as a real asset/hedge against inflation.

The way I look at it is a hedge against basically everything. Everyone should put in 1\u20135% of their stock portfolio in bitcoin, not only would it increase its value if everyone did so, but it would lessen the volatility in the long run. Not only that, but what\u2019s a few % of your portfolio?

For me, 5% of my money in bitcoin is a hedge against that securing my future, knowing I will be able to be independent from the government if it does happen. I\u2019d put the probability at maybe 5% or more of a total/major collapse in my lifetime, and that\u2019s just piece of mind. I\u2019d put the probability that bitcoin becomes a stable/seen as a legitimate currency in the next 10-20 years at 90%. 5% that it completely fails. For me, those are good odds.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.\n\nThe Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told \"the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.\"\n\nToyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.\n\nWhen the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla \"will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.\n\nI think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What's in it for Toyota?**\n\nToyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM\u2013Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.\u201d Although the context is not clear, it was also written \u201cprobably within a few months,\u201d an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.\n\n[Source](https://www.torquenews.com/1/tesla-and-toyota-are-considering-jointly-developing-small-electric-suv-platform)", "id": "mg91ws", "created_utc": 1617083224.0, "score": 4547, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 303, "comments": [{"body": "It seems fairly odd that only a Korean reporter finds out this.

Furthermore Mr Toyoda has been publicly dismissive of Tesla, it would be very culturally odd for a Japanese ~~CEO~~ President (Edit wrong title) to step away from those unusually strong words and back into partnership.\n\nSimilarly this isn't congruent with Tesla's stated plans (although they are far more likely to do an abrupt change than Toyota). They have stated they're happy to sell their skateboard when they have spare capacity (ie production capability exceeds demand), but they've also made it very clear that their primary focus in the car space is the \"machine that builds the machine\" (in Musk's words) - that is they're focussed on developing their ability to build their gigafactories and the optimisation of the build cycle (the single piece casting of entire subframes etc \"giga press\" as they call it) and FSD.

I believe that AAPL has found its bottom, as it has bounced off of 119 repeatedly while the rest of tech continues to drop. I believe that it will return to the 125-135 range between now and the end of April. \n\nTrading sideways for a week and a half has caused IV to die down to around 30% on most options.

The last two earnings IV hit about 60% on AAPL. My option I'm eying has a vega of 15, we'll say it drops to 10 by earnings. That would imply that an increase in 30 points in IV would spike the options price by 300$. \n\nI know that's too good to be true, and that IV going up has some effect on vega, but I don't know how much.

I'm no expert or anything but my intuition is that the bigger threats right now to the market as a whole are the record-high margin debt assumed, overly bullish sentiment on recent returns and hyperactivity in the market (which inherently breeds more risky/ill-advised ventures at the possibility of greater return), and the very high number of new companies hitting the market (largely in hot theme/sectors like EV, space tech, etc.). \n\nThe IPOs/SPACs in combination with the high margin debt I think are the most concerning, especially considering that so many of these new issues are following up on immense performance last year---this lures in curious investors more easily, who venture to guess what the next big thing is before everyone else realizes. Some of the new companies probably also get roped into popular ETFs and whatnot for exactly that reason. Problem is, as so many new, potentially meteoric growth companies enter the market, only so many of them could ever possibly last very long, at least by competition alone. More problematic is that some of these companies will have little or no financial stability at all (with some, I would guess, being straight-up fraudulent). If many of these such companies **do** get roped into portfolios and ETFs and mutual funds (by virtue of \"\"diversification\"\" across a booming, fledgling sector), then capital investment firms and retail investors alike may have significant exposure to them on the whole. And if they **do** end up tanking, **that** is what I fear could be a huge problem in relation to margin debt and margin calls thereto.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Don\u2019t you think corporate tax hike could affect tech stocks positive cash flows which directly makes the multiples look very big?

I mean, as I understand it, margin calls are done as protection to the lender in the face of excess losses, so while such a chain reaction could in theory be devastating, it would ironically occur in order to protect lenders from loss. \n\nI'm not a tax buff but even if changes to corporate taxes affect valuation multiples (be it at growth or elsewhere), it's largely up to the market to react to that. If current multiples are any indication, it would appear people have largely just stopped caring about the fundamentals.

In its latest brief, Goldman makes an interesting argument: Investors shouldn\u2019t rely on statements such as \u201chonesty is at the heart of our business\u201d or \u201cour clients\u2019 interests always come first\u201d that appear in S.E.C. filings and annual reports.\n\n**The case is a test of shareholders\u2019 ability to sue over claims of investment fraud.** The pension funds have sought to sue as a class over Goldman\u2019s statements, saying that they believed the claims of honesty. Goldman has argued in its latest brief that the investors are resorting to \u201cguerrilla warfare\u201d and aren\u2019t providing \u201cserious legal arguments.\u201d The bank says that an investor victory would lead to a barrage of future lawsuits over \u201cgeneral and aspirational statements\u201d of the kind made by \u201cvirtually every public company in America.\u201d\n\n- The Biden administration isn\u2019t taking sides but will say today that \u201cmeritorious private securities-fraud suits\u201d are \u201can essential complement\u201d to enforcing securities laws.\n\n**How a former S.E.C. commissioner thinks the court will respond to Goldman\u2019s arguments:** \u201cI expect the court to be troubled by the claim that companies cannot be held accountable for saying that clients come first and then acting otherwise,\u201d Robert Jackson Jr., who served on the commission from 2018 to 2020 and is now an N.Y.U. law professor, told DealBook. (The justices probably won\u2019t agree with the claim that making a company \u201cmean what it says\u201d will lead to a tsunami of meritless lawsuits, he added.)

I like Tesla, but Im also realistic. First, this year, the European manufacturers won't need the CO2 pooling, so that's a huge chunk of revenues going away. \n\nPlus as an EV driver, I follow the market closely. There is a chunk of great EVs coming out that are frankly as good or better. Take Hyundai/Kia - they have the Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 as well as a Genesis one. Lots of room, cool designs, efficient and charges back to ,80% in 20 minutes. Tesla is limited by 400 V architecture, while they have 800V, which means they will be able to charge faster and with less wear on the battery. And best of all, they cost less. \n\nSimilarly Volkswagen, while not making as good EVs as Hyundai or Tesla, are producing massive amounts of EVs that seem to suit the average taste in Europe, he most important market. Tesla has an edge in China but there are domestic competitors plus you are always at the mercy of this totalitarian government. \n\nWhen it comes to charging infrastructure, Tesla has an edge in the US and in parts of Europe. But not in some big EV markets in Europe (Norway, Germany etc.). Similarly the open Hyper Charging networks are expanding rapidly.\n\nLastly, it's not only Tesla enthusiasts buying Teslas anymore, but Tesla still hasn't gotten the QC issues fixed. Which leads in a lot of disappointment. Case in point was the beta testing fo LFP batteries on customers in Europe. The batteries weren't calibrated, the charging speeds limited to snail pace. Tesla enthusiasts might be forgiving, but not the average Joe who spent 40000 on a car and then it's a lottery whether you get the crappy LFP battery or a functioning one. \n\nSo these are my thoughts.

{"title": "How to profitably day trade large cap stocks and Index ETFs using Technical Analysis", "selftext": "There's a resurgence of interest for TA in this sub, which I think is absolutely delightful as a longtime TA technician myself, and today I am going to show you apes exactly how it's done, avoiding some pitfalls and misconceptions beginners new to TA might make. So spare 15 minutes of your time to learn to use TA like the professionals managing billions in Wallstreet.\n\nThis post is a follow up on my guide on how to buy puts for  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b  here\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfl6zt/goldman\\_sachs\\_made\\_money\\_liquidating\\_their\\_prime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfl6zt/goldman_sachs_made_money_liquidating_their_prime/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My trading journal from Friday 3/26**\n\n**MORNING 07:00-12:00**\n\nFirst thing we need to do is to setup our charting tools, I would recommend Tradingview for their free yet powerful charting tools having thousands of community supplied indicators.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9e536ycn06q61.jpg?width=1673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d0e4d631c33ccd0baf71e6db44a754f7b70a8cd\n\nNext we need to open our trading chat group, to get synced with the general pulse of the market, though not as important as TA , it's at least useful so that we don't feel as lonely during trading.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3zpnefo06q61.jpg?width=445&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=105c93ad369eb22f1fc9a3dda9fae387ddece542\n\nWhoops, Michael is yapping about some personal matters, something about a block sale at his neighborhood. He was this preppy kid I know from high school, he moved to NY to work for some rich dude named Goldman. He said he works as a prime broker, I think that means he's flipping apartments in NY. I'm gonna pm him privately to remind him not to post personal stuff in the group. I  open up my dashboards, and see that there's not much going on. This is very important for beginners, you don't have to be in the market all the time, look for a high probability play before you open a position. Let's just wait patiently until the technicals tells us to enter.\n\n**MIDDAY 12:00-15:00**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88priavp06q61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ffa27aa5b2950f90bbd91369ff900b002465bf0\n\nMichael spamming the group again with his nonsense, I'm just going to ignore him and open a chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0hy7nat06q61.jpg?width=1641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1870c9155e18f2b195b5be6d9073fec3237f46e0\n\nUsing my favorite indicators of support/resistance, MACD, VWAP and MA cross we can see that this is a clear indicator for a downward move in VIAC according to the technicals, I open a short position here.\n\n2 hours later...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc771x6u06q61.jpg?width=1643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a78ccd799c49944de9ec2e02960e800253fb79c7\n\nlook at that, the TA predicted the exact moment VIAC will drop. Let's close this here, take our tendies and chill while we wait for another play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AFTERNOON  15:00-16:00**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oaq044xy06q61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f03aa90bb5daf00d99b911f88c697c34430c1aa\n\nFor those that don't know, MOC stands for masculine of center, meaning lesbian/trans people that are masculine in nature. Michael is considering a sex change operation and it looks like he has just announced a mysterious donor that is about to make a big donation to his \ud83c\udf46 chopping support group. This is not related to trading in anyway, but it's kinda fun hearing about Michael progressive activism. As markets are about to close, lets look at the chart again, this time let's pull up the SPY\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3hha25f016q61.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a44d401e72b863c90fff719775e7bfd60019acc0\n\nYep definitely we can see an upward movement potential here with the RSI  going up over the purple area and resistance being tested, let's go long here into the close\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5l5m3j116q61.jpg?width=1640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c866e21ff30b2bb117e09df144a5ca82089af1cf\n\nAnd like clockwork, It rocketed up, man look at it go. TA absolutely nailed it once again.\n\nAs Ken Griffith once said, advances in technology have enabled real time information and advanced charting techniques to be available to the retail investor, levelling the playing field with institutions.  You just need some crayons and join Goldman's prime brokerage chat group, which absolutely anybody can do right ?\n\n**Remember, if you can't trade profitably using TA. you have to be either lazy or stupid or probably both**\n\nTune in next week where we will be reviewing the differences between a Crayola and a Wonder Stix and how each will effect your trading style.\n\n*\\*Chat screens taken from Tyler Durden phone*\n\nEdit 1: I can't believe I have to explain this, guys that was the actual screenshot with accurate timestamp from a GS's VP for BWIC (Bid Wanted In Competition) when they were liquidating Archegos, proving that like Hans Solo, GS did shoot first leaving the other IBs holding the bags.\n\nEdit 2:  Well..., turns out all those smooth brained jokes wasn't so off after all. Apes this post is to highlight the difference of what a retail trader using TA sees and what a prime brokerage client sees and the resulting cause and effect on the price.
