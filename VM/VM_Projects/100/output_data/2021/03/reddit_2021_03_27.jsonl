{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021.\n\n# **The end of the quarter could create volatility for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/the-end-of-the-quarter-could-create-volatility-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks could be buffeted by end-of-quarter trading in the week ahead, as pension funds and other big investors buy bonds and sell stocks to rebalance their portfolios.\n*****\n> The dramatic move higher in bond yields this quarter sets up fund managers to shift their holdings, to make up for the shortfall in bond holdings.\n*****\n> The focus in the coming week could turn to the overall economy, with the March employment report expected Friday and the White House\u2019s infrastructure plans expected to be unveiled Wednesday. There is also ISM manufacturing data released on Thursday.\n*****\n> The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, but bonds will trade half a day, ending at noon. Economists expect 630,000 jobs were added in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%, according to Dow Jones.\n*****\n> President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form.\n*****\n> Stocks were higher in the past week, while Treasury yields were less volatile. The closely watched 10-year was at 1.67% Friday, down from 1.75% in the prior week. Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They\u2019re trying to figure it out.\u201d\n*****\n> Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.\n*****\n> Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.\n*****\n> Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat right now,\u201d said NatWest\u2019s Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.\n*****\n> Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.\n*****\n> \u201cIf anything, we\u2019re really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> # Infrastructure plan\n> Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.\n*****\n> \u201cThe Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don\u2019t have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I\u2019m going to have to reconsider my 2% target.\u201d\n*****\n> Gwinn said the market has \u201cfiscal fatigue.\u201d\n*****\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it\u2019s going to be passed, when it\u2019s going to be passed and whether it\u2019s going to be passed ... It\u2019s not tangible enough,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.\n*****\n> # Rotation\n> The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.\n*****\n> \u201cI think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,\u201d said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not going to match one for one with every wiggle,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that\u2019s really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.\u201d\n*****\n> Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.\n*****\n> \u201cAs we\u2019re seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,\u201d he said. \u201cTo their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy \u2014 energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they\u2019re going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/vO6bgbd.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DHyy0jK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/r9toVhW.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WsvEjsM.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Yifrz8S.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ciosFuJ.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mlnREkj.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CtwxDvI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DIpCmjL.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a57hPvk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/up2SDlt.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/16Psc5m.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TSJJQus.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/pLkbs1k.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month \u2013 Up 15 in a Row\n\n> April marks the end of the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday\u2019s close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.\n\n> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, \u201cTax\u201d month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).\n\n> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.\n\n> This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that \u201cwork-from-home\u201d stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.\n\n> Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April\u2019s performance since 1953. April is DJIA\u2019s second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9044f7ae02c5c0f0137bff0911ef7cb6/1367b75d549eb11f-fe/s400x600/d969c7c83e5a15cfb4c671e0a9ca959aa6c9fc54.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Historic Year for the S&P 500\n\n> Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.\n\n> The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**\n\n> Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-Sector-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities\n\n> It has been just over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.\n\n> Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cAfter likely their worst period in history, although I wasn\u2019t around for the bubonic plague so I can\u2019t be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see commodities rise even further.\u201d\n\n> The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market\u2019s top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the \u201cstay at home environment\u201d benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December\u2014even surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.\n\n> We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.\n\n*****\n\n> # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**\n\n> Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low \u2013 actually it\u2019s 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.\n\n> We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn\u2019t bad either.\n\n> With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals \u2013 and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA \u201cSell in May\u201d).\n\n> Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let\u2019s not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means \u201cbearish\u201d perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 26th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.28.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/a57hPvk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/7ZBW7kO.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!]())**\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.29.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KCFoZ0p.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 3.29.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/A79uQcQ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  3.30.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTM92oZ.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.30.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CO3uIVi.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.31.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/T13r2c7.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.31.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4o0Mk0k.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.1.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EE7bg7B.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 4.1.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWonNMB.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.2.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 4.2.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # BlackBerry Limited $9.63\n**BlackBerry Limited (BB)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 5:05 PM ET on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

When the \u201ccorrection\u201d downturn or whatever you wanna call it on the nasdaq started for various reasons recently Soxl\u2019s main holdings lost value so its price went down as well. \n\nNow this is a buy the dip opportunity, SOXL being an etf typically has a ton of volume meaning if I write an option on it I\u2019m very likely to be able to sell it quickly because there is a lot of buyers out there. I watched it bottom around 28 then slowly pushed past 32, between 32support and 35 resistance, but when it breaks 35 it runs to 38/39 very quickly. So for the past 3 weeks like clockwork it\u2019s running up and down between 28-38. \u201cLEAPS\u201d are a term for long dated options usually expiring one to two years out. Leaps are a good defense against time decay and delta is typically over .6 so you\u2019re getting almost 1$ per percentage it\u2019s going up. Options contracts are in sets of 100 shares so you\u2019re  getting 60-100$ in value per 1$ increase in price. When SOXL dips to 32 I buy a 40call leap and wait for it to push past 35 for that big gap up to 38 and I sell it for +300 to 500$. Being that it\u2019s a leap if I\u2019m wrong and it gaps down to 28 I\u2019m still pretty safe because the time decay isn\u2019t really an issue, so I just have to be patient. \n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaps.asp\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveraged-etf.asp\n\nSupport/resistance or technical analysis terms, not every trader believes in them, personally I do. \nhttps://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=overview:technical_analysis#what_is_technical_analysis\n\n#IM A SMOOTH BRAIN TOO\nSo I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m talking about but these leaps have made me 3k a week the past three weeks buying on Wednesday and selling Friday at noon.

Beta for Tesla is at 2.06. E(r\\_m) is the expected growth rate of market, which can be S&P 500 average annual return of \\~10%. Plugging all of this into the equation gives expected return of 18.84% for TSLA.\n\nExpected return is used to discount future cash flows and also the future expected valuation of TSLA to be comparable in present moment. We can discount the future value (Ark's price target) to today. To do this we use the formula PV = FV / (1+E(r))\\^t. We'll assume that the price target is calculated for the end of year 2025. This means t will be 1740 days or 4.767 years. Therefore plugging in all values we get PV = 3,000 / (1+0.1884)\\^4.767 = 1,318.\n\nIn other words Tesla's fair price would be around $1,300 if all of the assumptions are taken as they are.

{"title": "$GME Potential Pattern: Cup with Handle Analysis Part 2. Bullish handle breakout analysis \u2013 MACD, W%R, DMI based analysis. With other examples this time!", "selftext": "First things first, here is where we are with some pretty lines drawn in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrw4w3sw6hp61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3000cf6d8e93869b0118d540ecaca36b2637e73d\n\nSecond things second, let\u2019s take a look at the updated conditions we discussed in the first post:\n\nAccording to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**\n2. **Cup:** The cup should be \u201cU\u201d shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A \u201cV\u201d shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**\n3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to \u00bd. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little wary, and I still stand by this. **Updated**: However, at this point we can say GME is not a textbook example so the depths might be less of a factor.\n4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again? Updated:** At this point it may be safe to say that the textbook depths do not really apply. We have fallen out of 1/3 and even 1/2 depths, and there is reason to be wary. However, this might not really matter for GME.\n5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. Almost there. **Updated: Check**\n6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Updated: 50 Million Volume to go from closing 120 to closing 180. There is definitely momentum here. Previous resistance of 172 broken. Check**\n\nOkay, so now let\u2019s look at the handle:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xt3t0v27hp61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=82cb794baa796b3147084a004f425523e2d72a6f\n\nWe can see here that +DI and -DI are diverging, signaling bullish sentiment. W%R slipped into a strong overselling signal on 3/24, and then on 3/25 it moved sharply towards the middle. This means the stock is starting to be more bought than sold. The MACD histogram is growing in momentum, 3/24 being the most negative day.\n\nSo great! It looks like there could be a breakout forming here. But now what? How long does it go for and what can we expect? Well let\u2019s look at historical examples:\n\nHere is the textbook Investopedia example, WYNN on monthly candles:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9otqyu887hp61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=02d2c757c8c2795ae0382155dfa9c5316ea88fc3\n\nWe can see that when there is a breakout in the handle, the bullish movement pushed the price to go above previous cup resistances. However, after the breakout the price of the stock free falls down almost to previous cup support levels:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xnvryu97hp61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93ed2f9927a28e968e62a36636c81d8d4db7011\n\nOkay now you may be saying, this is so zoomed out and candles are months ect, ect, ect. This is simply the Investopedia textbook example. Lets look at another more recent one.\n\nHere is NVDA on daily candles:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpwtlgrb7hp61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1e72aac25924a18b7f8d2a4b6f1c125e39697cd\n\nHere is what happened after the run up, as you can see this stock kept running up after the handle breakout:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mctgfxpe7hp61.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e9b7105444cbc54cf0831fc71323ded4c1a595\n\nAll of this is just information. I hope you take it with a grain of salt! If a true cup with handle pattern forms and the breakout of the handle happens, then we know prices run up at least to the previous resistance. Until that happens its hard to say what's next!\n\nEdit: Words\n\nObligatory emojis: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "me3yzj", "created_utc": 1616809803.0, "score": 1386, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 185, "comments": [{"body": "Didn't read, but i liked the colors and lines.", "score": 372, "replies": [{"body": "trying to keep apes entertained with crayons", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "cup>handle>handle breakout>breaks cup resistance>??", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Profit>too diamond handed (tarded) to take profits> take loss instead", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13556742668151855}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.004494207911193371}, {"body": "Cup, handle, mouth, drink", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43242746591567993}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.004494207911193371}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1829233467578888}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Sir this is a casino", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17384064197540283}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}, {"body": "i agree", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21120783686637878}, {"body": "Yes and no, technical analysis can give you insight into *what* is being done and how it is being manipulated.

People are jumping in and out of stocks, some spike 100% in one day or crash nearly the same another.  You're right, some folks are just cashing out of the volatile stocks and redistributing back to older paths.  This entire year will be a weird one as the easy money disappears and everyone starts doing weird shit trying to keep or make money.\n\nI'll be curious to see how many keep their money in.  Profits are still to be had.  The odd thing is choice of when to get out. More specifically, why upset a good thing?  Maybe it was just a calculation of diminishing returns since you're making your money from the bottom, not the top.\n\nEven so, the dips have presented a choice.  Do you buy more at a great rate?  Or do you let the stock drop?  The choice is at the whim of the people, although retail investors are alone a pretty small part of the overall pie.  It may be a question of what will the institutions do when presented with this choice.  Will they double down, do nothing, or cut?  Only some got the opportunity to lock in the rewards.  Everyone else got stuck holding.  At the moment, these are stocks with a lot of people willing to buy into at prices higher and often much higher than right now for all of 2021 so far.  This is the cheapest pricing these stocks have had all year.  What does one do?\n\nThis might be a unique situation too.  The dip was fast and not tied to any common event.  These weren't really meme stocks and stocks that many companies were placing in their portfolios.  It's likely that a lot of people were mutually affected outside of just silly retail traders.

{"title": "How to profit from the Suez Canal", "selftext": "What the Suez Canal means for the Tanker market\n\nThe Suez Canal blockage has lead to a surge in tanker rates and it\u2019ll continue to rise the longer the ship remains stuck. They are already rerouting ships around Africa which signals the blockage could last weeks and with shipping as tight as it already is, the rates are going to skyrocket and kick start a new supercycle.\n\nI was bullish on tankers even before the Suez Canal and I have been seeing great gains these past 3 months. The Tanker industry was already seeing a huge recovery across the board and now its being boosted even further by the Suez Canal disruption. CEOs and insiders, specifically CEO Robert Bugbee of Scorpio Tankers and Insiders of North Atlantic Tankers, are already buying stock/call options. \n\nThey are all also trading below their net asset value with strong fundamental cash positions from the huge rate spike in Q1 and Q2 2020. \n\nThe tanker/shipping market is inherently cyclical and hinges totally on supply and demand. Back in the super cycle of 2000-2007 companies were over building tanker ships while oil demand couldn\u2019t keep up, so we had a lot of supply with not enough demand causing a 15 year bear market.\n\nThe 15 year market is incredibly important for product tankers specifically as the major players in the industry stop chartering ships over 15 years old so they are essentially off the market and will soon be scrapped.\n\nThe ship orderbook has been as low as its ever been and it has been low the past 15 years so we are seeing a small amount of ships being built but a large amount of ships passing the 15 years and no longer being used.\n\nSo what we have here is a massive supply/demand imbalance waiting to happen and now with the Suez Canal putting even tighter strain, if the ships have to all be rerouted around Africa increasing the amount of miles drastically then tankers/shipping are going to be the hottest sector in the market.\n\nMy current positions are in calls, mostly in Scorpio Tankers to play product tankers and Teekay Tankers LTD. to play crude.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits. A similar situation is playing out as ships are already being rerouted around Africa.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nFrom 2000-2021, 2687 vessels were built (MR, LR1, LR2) and 1251 of those vessels were built from 2000-2006 so roughly 47% of the global product tanker fleet will have passed that 15 year mark this year.\n\nThe supply side of product tankers is dwindling fast while demand is still rising, its simple supply and demand. But now with the Suez Canal blockage, the supply is only getting more and more constrained.\n\nEdit 3: [positions](https://m.imgur.com/a/VuAchGi)\n\nEdit 4: it seems the ship has been refloated, disappointed but as I said I was already bullish on tankers before the Suez Canal situation. The product tanker market supply is tight and demand has is only growing. As more time passes and older ships get retired, the supply will only continue to get more constrained because no one has been building new ships anymore.\n\nThere is still a 300+ vessel traffic jam at the Suez Canal which will cause delays, I\u2019m not sure what will happen but I am still confident there will be an upcoming bull run for product tankers\n\nEdit 5: Robert Bugbee President of Scorpio Tankers purchases $1.3 million worth of call options today 3/29", "id": "mek9iw", "created_utc": 1616871869.0, "score": 625, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 204, "comments": [{"body": "Sorry, I can\u2019t get involved this time.
