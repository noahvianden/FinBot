After some research, I read through Rule #1 in a weekend because it was recommended by people who said things that seemed to make rational sense. Shortly thereafter, I started dabbling with buy-to-open options. I didn't get far, because the prices just seemed to high for the likelihood of accurately timing the market.\n\nAnd now I'm discovering the world of writing options... I can be the guy who collects that options vig. Yay!\n\nSo I'm looking into selling covered options, and... it seems too good to be true. If I do some basic Rule #1 value-based DD, and find solid stocks, it looks like I can make a few points a month writing cash-covered puts. And if I get the stock, great! I then collect the vig on covered calls until it jumps up and I make bank on the option and the higher sale price. Then just rinse and repeat. The only risk seems to be if the stock goes down and stays down... but even then, I can just keep rolling in the vig on weekly covered calls. So I break even eventually, unless the company just goes belly-up. And on top of that, the risk of the stock going down can be mitigated by diversity and the previously mentioned DD and only picking good stocks.\n\nIf I add to this say 10% or 20% margin use for the risk-limited sides of trades, (e.g. no uncovered calls), it just seems like I can be making 25%+ per year with almost no risk over any period of more than a few years. And even during slumps when I'm left holding the bag on a stock, I'm still collecting that vig every week or two.\n\nSo... what am I missing here?

If the stock trades sideways for a year, I'm writing contracts every month and I made a bunch of money on that stock despite it doing nothing. If the stock goes up, I get assigned and the other person gets my shares from the lower strike price option, and I net the difference in stock price from where it sold to where It was when I bought in, give or take a little.

I bought this on the morning of last Wednesday before the share price hiked above $100, so I think I probably got the last of the relatively good deals on it considering premium is now more than ten times what it was.  \nMy strategic problem is this:   \nIf I assume that GME will undergo a short-squeeze which drives the share-price up to absurd heights multiple thousands of dollars above my strike price over the course of a couple of days, then does it make more sense to hold my single call option until I think we're nearing the peak and then sell to close, or would it make more sense to sell the option after it goes ITM and use the profits to buy a larger number of OTM calls partway up?  \nThe reason I ask is that I am unsure of whether an extreme rise in the share price will make it impossible to obtain new calls (the options chain only appears to go up so high on my brokerage site, are new strikes added automatically as the share price moves? Can I enter custom strike-prices for prices not yet listed on the chain?). I am also concerned because I have no idea of how large an order for call options I can reasonably expect to be filled; is there a risk that an order for tens of calls might be left unfilled in a situation where the underlying share has extreme volatility? I don't want to wind up selling the one good call I have expecting to be able to buy ten or more new calls only to find out that nobody is willing to sell me that many of them when there's a ridiculous multi-day price-spike going on in the underlying stock.  \nAnother reason I'm concerned about selling my call when it goes ITM would be the possibility of premiums for OTM calls already being driven so high as to make buying additional calls unprofitable even if I still expect the price to go on rising (this one is just down to lack of experience though; I don't know what to expect of premium prices in a volatile stock's options other than the major hikes in premiums that I'm already seeing.)

So far it was a low money I-wonder-what-will-happen bet, so someone please poke a tonne of holes in this and tell me why it\u2019s a dumb idea before I develop it further. Love you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLittle over a month ago I sold a dirt cheap cash secured put (against good advise) just to see what would happen, eventually got assigned, and have been average 1-2% gains per week since with a couple of \u201cwindfall\u201d weeks of about 10-15%. All on a $100 collateral. In a couple more weeks my cost basis will be below $0. Decided to model what this would look like into the future (and with bigger dollar amounts) and I don\u2019t trust the graph because the numbers get too big too fast. My math is giving me a very unrealistic expectation so I want as many people as possible to poke as many holes as possible and tell me why this wouldn\u2019t work. Just a heads up, my background is in mathematics and and not finance so I'm sure it's a bad idea but can't be sure.\n\nI know the prevailing wisdom is that penny stocks are not an underlying asset you want to hold for covered calls, and I understand the reasoning why has to do with company fundamentals and poor long-term outlook. However, when I modeled the following strategy the graph quickly went parabolic - and I know that in finance parabolic models are never correct. Here is what I\u2019m doing:\n\n1. Find a stock trading in the sub-$5 range that I can sell put for 1% of the collateral required. This could be a $1 strike price and a $1 contract. Choose the soonest expiration possible given the 1:100 contract to collateral ratio. If I\u2019ve sold for a higher dollar amount then buy back at about half value when I can and push the expiration date out. Repeat until assignment.\n2. On assignment, sell a OTM call (for as little as $1) targeting, again, 1% contract/collateral. Because $1 contracts are usually far OTM if those shares get called away then that\u2019s okay, because it would represent a profit over my buy-in. If they do not however, sell another $1-5 call the next cycle and repeat.\n3. When I've made enough doing this to put up another $1-500 as collateral, add a new option to my rotation.\n\nI\u2019ve seen strategies like this talked about, but almost always for more expensive stocks. And it make sense that no one would care to sell a $1 contract for something like Apple or SPY. But the past few weeks I have been trading options for stocks that hover around $1 per share. Ill-advised as everyone said it would be, so far I\u2019ve been able to put up the same $100 collateral and make $1 each week (sometimes more, depending on the contract - at most $15). Recently the $1 per share strike price that I set got assigned, and I\u2019ve since been selling $1.50 strikes for $1 most weeks. If they get called away at some point - fine, an extra $50 in one week - but if not then am I not essentially making a 1% per contract return on my initial collateral? I decided to model what this would look like over longer horizons, and I\u2019m sure you could imagine what a 1% per week(ish) compounding graph began to look like. The thing is, I don\u2019t trust parabolic graphs in finance so my past experiences (so far) and this model cannot represent any future expectations\u2026 can it?\n\nA few of the risks I\u2019m okay with\n\n\u2014 knowing that occasionally a cheaply traded stock will be de-registered or go bankrupt. I\u2019ve been combatting this by trying to choose companies that aren\u2019t currently getting bad press, but it\u2019s impossible I\u2019ll always be successful in this. And occasionally if this means I lose my entire $100-500 collateral it would have to happen more than 1 out of every 100 contracts to be a loss (less than this given the occasional but also rare \u201cwindfall\u201d weeks where I sell a contract for 15% of the collateral or a OTM call is exercised). Also - diversification. There aren\u2019t a massive number of stocks trading in this range that also trade options reliably - but there are enough that I shouldn\u2019t run out until my portfolio is much larger.\n\n\u2014 taxes. I don\u2019t make a ton of money, so being taxed as normal income on this shouldn\u2019t be a massive loss. But even modeling 1%/contract gains minus 35% per year on those gains still goes parabolic, just slower.\n\n\u2014 the underlying value could fluctuate, sometimes wildly, because they\u2019re penny stocks. From my research, even cheaply traded penny stocks usually have a few options available for 1$, and if the underlying which I bought for $1 per share drops to 0.50 I should be able to (most of the time) still sell a contract for $1, or 1% of my cost. If that isn\u2019t the case and my cost basis can absorb the loss then I could still sell 100 shares for a $30-40 loss and, assuming this didn\u2019t happen with every stock frequently, still be a net gain.\n\n\\-- ???

Limit sell is type of order where you set the price at which you want to sell. The order may or may not get filled. In a CC you have 100 shares and then you sell-to-open (=short=write) a call option.

{"title": "Investors beware: $ARKK is a liquidity disaster waiting to happen", "selftext": "I recently got back on Reddit after a long hiatus - the volatility in Gamestop and other names brought me back to r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks.\n\nLately I have been doing some research on Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and am quite alarmed by what I am seeing. I am by no means an expert in finance, but I work in finance professionally. I spent 2 years on a long-short equity hedge fund in NYC right after college, and have worked in M&A for an asset management firm for the last 5.5 years. I am intimately aware of how active and passive (ETF) investment products function and acutely aware of the impact that investor fund flows can have on price and performance of an ETF.\n\nIn the case of $ARKK and the family of ETFs, it is glaringly apparent to me that all of these ETFs in the last 12-14 months have become victims of their own success. What do I mean by this?\n\nWe'll use $ARKK as an example. In the last 14 months, investors (and many of you) plowed money into $ARKK at a stunning rate - $10 billion in 2020, and another $5 billion in just the first two months of 2021. In conjunction with those investor flows, the Ark ETFs have developed what by any industry standard represent HUGE holdings in many of the portfolio companies, as high as 25-30% in dozens of cases. Many of these holdings are illiquid companies that don't trade significant volume on any given day. The combination of low liquidity, huge investor inflows into the ETF, and now enormous ownership stakes in the portfolio companies has had the effect of driving share prices higher. Much of the ETF's performance over the last 12-14 months is not a function of fundamental improvement of the portfolio companies, but a function of the ETF having to buy illiquid equity securities when inflows are positive. This may not be readily apparent to the untrained eye, but it is crystal clear for those with access to industry flow data.\n\nI ran an analysis on the weekly net flows into ARKK over the last 60 weeks, and found that portfolio performance of the ETF was highly correlated with ETF inflows.\n\n***Correlation of 70%***\n\n***R-squared of 0.49*** \n\nThat is to say, the tail is wagging the dog! ARKK has created its own good performance, but not because the companies have grown or fundamentally improved. Nearly entirely the result of the ETF buying.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nLast week was a taste of the trouble ahead. When investors sell the ETF instead of buy, in order to cash out the investors the ETF must sell some of the stock in its portfolio companies, except that liquidity or lack of liquidity becomes a much bigger problem when investors are selling and when the broad equity/tech markets have a correction.\n\nThe ARKK ETF price has appreciated nearly 350% in a very short time. Now that Cathie Wood represents a big chunk of the outstanding shares within companies that have become overvalued by almost all measures, and trade with very thin liquidity, any meaningful reversal in investor flows (out instead of in) will result in a cascading collapse of the Ark ETFs. If the fund can generate returns of 350% in roughly a year, just imagine what may happen if investors move toward the exits in a much shorter period of time.\n\nAs someone who takes pride in my analytical work, and who is concerned about the limited investor knowledge of many people who own Cathie Wood's funds, I would strongly encourage you to do more research. Learn about the companies held by the ETFs. Try to educate yourselves on valuation methods. And please understand that unless you are willing to lose every dollar that you have invested with Ark, you should take some time to reflect on the risks you are taking.\n\nAfter spending a very short amount of time on this subreddit and others, I am concerned that many people may not be aware of these risks, and unfortunately the small investors in Cathie's funds will be the ones who bear the brunt of any crisis.\n\nAs usual with Wall Street, the insiders like Cathie Wood will get huge payouts and the little guys will get to hold the bag. It is not widely known, but good food for thought that Cathie has sold a chunk of her company to American Beacon. In recent months there were changes to these ownership arrangements that are not publicly known. Whatever happens, Cathie Wood will be just fine, but the small investors may not be.\n\nGood luck and I hope I am wrong.\n\n*****************\n\n***Edit*** - for inquiring minds, the link below is a detailed and succinct overview of some of these concerns from a Fintwit personality.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1366028953828270082\n\n***Edit*** - some have pushed back on the analysis and I appreciate the discussion, for additional thoughts on how some of these ETF products (and ETF's in general) can create distortions in the market, there are a few podcasts below that I found pretty worthwhile.\n\nhttps://www.zer0es.tv/interviews-and-analysis/the-perversion-of-passive-investment/\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-end-game-ep-3-mike-green/id1508585135?i=1000483139066\n\n***Edit*** - some have suggested I re-create the analysis above on a number of more typical ETF products (great idea) to see if outcomes are similar. Some have also pushed back on the statistical significance of 70%/0.49. In finance if you can explain 49% of the variation using just one variable, it is pretty darn good. Not so good in physics or hard sciences.\n\nIn any case, here goes...\n\nBackground on methods and sources: Data comes from simfund, and the analysis is simple. We build a \"roll forward\" of the assets under management (AUM) for weekly flow data sets. An AUM roll forward is commonly found in the earnings presentations of all asset managers and is useful for understanding the sources of AUM growth in any given period.\n\nIn this case:\n\nA:   Beginning of period AUM        <--- Sourced from Simfund\n\nB:   +/- Net New Investor Flows   <--- Sourced from Simfund\n\nC:   +/- Market Performance        <--- Implied by D less B less A\n\nD:   End of Period AUM                <--- Sourced from Simfund\n\n\nIn this way we can see how many dollars flow into a certain ETF over the period, and how many dollars of market gains in the underlying portfolio took place in the same period. Presumably these two values (B&C) would be more highly correlated when B is large and the underlying portfolio is less liquid - causing upward pressure on prices for structural reasons rather than fundamental reasons, i.e. driven by the ETF and not by growth or fundamental improvement in the portfolio companies, i.e. paying a higher multiple for the same stock for no good reason.\n\nI think my analysis stands... but open to more constructive criticism.\n\n**********************\n***Output for Ark ETF's and compared with a number of other popular ETF's - Ticker: (correlation / r-sq)***\n\n*n = 60 weeks of data, which we focus on here because Ark products have seen such outsized flows (and returns) over this period*\n\n***Ark ETFs***\nARKQ: (69%/0.48)\nARKF: (64%/0.41)\nARKG: (42%/0.18)\nARKK: (70%/0.49)\nARKW: (70%/0.49)\n \n***Other Popular ETF's***\nSPY: (11%, 0.01)\nQQQ: (27%, 0.07)\nIWM: (20%, 0.04)\nXLE: (27%, 0.07)\nJETS: (21%, 0.04)\n\n***********************\n\n***Edit*** - Criticism of this approach may be that I am using dollar changes in both flows and portfolio returns, rather than periodic percentage changes, however my view is that it is the magnitude of the dollar flows that matters more than percentages when trying to ascertain the impact of illiquidity and investor flows.\n\n***Edit*** - Worthy correction from u/notredwan - I was under the impression that American Beacon was in process on exercising its option to acquire a majority position in Ark as was originally agreed in 2016. Evidently that option was extinguished in December 2020 in a deal where Ark took on debt (and likely warrants) to pay off American Beacon on the option value. Back of the envelope math would have put the option value in the $100-150mm range.\n\nReading here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1pw88ldyr905m/The-ARK-Invest-Takeover-Battle-Is-Over\n\n***Edit*** - An interesting easter egg in Ark's daily email update and associated disclosures.

To me, 0.60 to 0.70 is what starts being a strong correlation. \n\nAt any rate, short-term I'm not concerned; we've had a near 10% NASDAQ correction (about 8-9%), and ARKK dropped by 18%, which is to be expected given the nature of the companies that's part of its holdings. Where I vehemently agree with the analysis is in case of an actual bear market (drop is 20% or more), whether NASDAQ-centric, or overall markets (although Cathie's holdings tend to be more concentrated in NASDAQ companies). \n\nMy non-expert opinion on this: I do not expect this to happen for the time being. Even if inflation shows up its ugly face, the U.S. has a long-term average target goal of 2%. It's not an absolute target, but an average one. Since the Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, inflation has never been above 2% (I believe), so there is definitely some leeway to let inflation rise above 2% for a small period of time before the Fed increases interest rates. They even said it themselves, and they've also said multiple times that they do not plan on increasing rates until we have a full recovery. That being said, I do expect a sharp correction, potentially bear-territory, when interest rates do increase. For multiple reasons. I mean, if NASDAQ dropped by nearly 10% on a scare of potential increase in inflation, which would potentially eventually lead to an increase in interest rates, than yes, I think it's fair to assume a sharp correction when interest rates do go up\n\nLastly, Cathie ain't dumb. She's expecting this. In fact, she's been moving a lot of her holdings in what she considers quasi-cash; blue chip companies, that while expected to take a hit in a broad market correction, definitely would not take as big a hit as her core, more speculative holdings (I.e.: Palantir, Tesla, Square, Shopfiy, etc. etc. etc.).\n\nLong-term however, despite Cathie being a smart woman and having an outstanding team, I wouldn't hold money into ARK funds. I bought PRNT and ARKK at the low of last week's dip, and will probably ride it until either it stops growing stellarly, or until we again get a sniff of either inflation being too hot, or economic recovery being strong enough that the Fed can finally consider increasing interest rates (so probably not until late 2022).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclosure: I'm no financial expert, take this with a grain of salt.

I can correlate so many things with ARK's fund performance (or even the value of its underlying holdings) and make a correlation that proves nothing really. For instance, I can probably model global debt as a % of GDP against the performance of ARK funds and I would suspect to get a strong correlation but it would be quite nonsensical to suggest that it's what's causing the fluctuations in ARK's prices. Unless I've completely missed your point and you've done multivariate modelling with control variables that you haven't included, the numbers you've shared along with your thesis means nothing to me unless you elaborate more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The ARKK ETF price has appreciated nearly 350% in a very short time. Now that Cathie Wood represents a big chunk of the outstanding shares within companies that have become overvalued by almost all measures, and trade with very thin liquidity, any meaningful reversal in investor flows (out instead of in) will result in a cascading collapse of the Ark ETFs\n\nTo your point about ARK holding various illiquid assets and then inflows which causing them to buy more and subsequently causing low volume assets to spike in price when the underlying business hasn't changed seems like a reasonable thing to say. In which case, I would recommend that you focus your analysis on this particular claim. That is, can you reasonably, using public data that should be available, show that the ARK's personal trades were the sole reason for the buying pressure in certain companies and it was this inflow of money FROM ARK that primarily caused the price to go up. I'm not making a claim against this, just saying that this isn't what was explored. Perhaps it's addressed in your tweet which I haven't read on. However, your overall analysis doesn't do enough due diligence in my opinion because Cathie has publicly spoken about this particular issue and how she has prepared for this with an increased amount of inflows for her portfolio, along with her talking about expecting a correction. See 5:30 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atjQcRXX-NI). They've extended into a lot of \"popular\" names which have a high enough volume for them to buy/sell as a faux \"cash\" position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As usual with Wall Street, the insiders like Cathie Wood will get huge payouts and the little guys will get to hold the bag. It is not widely known, but good food for though that Cathie has sold 51% of her company to American Beacon, and she is likely to receive a check from American Beacon this year that will total in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Whatever happens, Cathie Wood will be just fine, but the small investors may not be.\n\nLikewise, for a post that reached what I would assume the top of the subreddit, I find it strange no one called out other inaccuracies. I'm not sure whether it's just ignorance or bad faith, but to make out that Cathie Wood sold out her investors and firms to give up partial ownership is just false. I'm not sure why you're saying it's not widely known as it was covered pretty publicly in almost all places that discuss ARK-like holdings or anything Cathie Wood related. In fact, she [publicly](https://www.barrons.com/articles/cathie-wood-might-lose-control-of-ark-investment-51605699000) didn't think it was in the best interest of Resolute to do what they did. The whole thing has now kinda been resolved but it's open for discussion as to who the winners/losers might be long-term. But the narrative you're pushing is just incorrect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving said all of these, you might be correct.

You mentioned you were on a hiatus but I still thought to check your past posts to get an indication of what your analysis has been like on other things to gauge an idea of your overall thought process.

If you wish to critique the decision to have a contract which potentially allows the her to lose controlling interest, that's a very valid criticism. However your point made it seem that this decision (in today's context) was about her cashing out. Which brings me to 2) you're arguing about something contrary to what's publicly there. Sure Cathie could have lied about it, but there is nothing to suggest that. I assume you know quite a bit more about the backstory than us average people or what's beyond the publicly available information. However, I'm not sure how useful it may be given that Revolute doesn't actually own majority of the firm anymore and that options contract has been repurchased by Cathie who will remain the majority stakeholder (https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1pw88ldyr905m/The-ARK-Invest-Takeover-Battle-Is-Over)\n\nSecond is the point about your analysis. You've given no public information about what analysis you actually did. Did you run a panel data analysis? Time series? Was it a simple OLS model? Bivariate/multivariate? What controls did you use (if any)? What's your dataset. You can't not provide any of this and just blanket ask for a critique.

ETFs are simply funds that can be bought on the stock exchange.\n\n\nWe often believe ETFs to be safer than Funds because of how dominant Vanguard ETFs have become. Vanguard's ETFs are all broad market, meaning diversified across sectors, and passive (as opposed to managed).\n\n\nIn contrast to Vanguard, Cathie Wood's ETF is a sector specific managed fund, just like Woodford. Imho, the main difference is just that ARK is traded on the stock exchange.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Correct me if I'm wrong here, but ARKK's nature as an ETF makes it entirely different from Woodford's fund. When you buy ARKK on the market you're not giving the money to Ark, but to another investor selling shares. ARKK only receives new equity when their share price exceeds NAV due to demand, in which case their APs will deliver a basket of cash or securities that comprise the fund (usually the latter due to tax reasons I believe) in exchange for ETF shares to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. The opposite happens when share prices are lower than NAV, and APs turn over a bundle of ETF shares in exchange for a basket of the underlying securities of the fund. The former case is ETF inflows and the latter ETF outflows. The AP is hoping in each case to make an arbitrage profit on the conversion due to the difference between the NAV and the market price, which is why they perform this service in the first place. It's not much different from a MM profiting on the bid/ask. \n\n\nIt might seem like just a convoluted mechanism for cash in / cash out like any other fund, but it's actually a pretty big difference when we're talking about liquidity. When people wanted to cash in their shares of Woodford's fund, he was obligated to deliver cash. When the APs redeem Ark funds, Ark is obligated to deliver shares, which makes the liquidity of the shares the problem of the AP, not Ark. When you sell ARKK on the market, the funds come from whoever purchased the shares, not Ark. \n\nTwo things to note:\n\nHolding shares in numerous companies exceeding 10% hurts the liquidity of the fund itself due to the short swing profit rule, which is concerning as the fund is actively managed. I would much rather Cathie be able to move money as her and her team see fit, and they are compromising that ability with these bets. However, these stocks aren't a huge fraction of the overall fund from what I've seen, just something to keep an eye on. Also, I don't think there is any trouble in delivering shares of a company to an AP when the ETF owns more than 10%, whereas if the ETF itself tried to sell those shares they would run into the rules governing greater than 10% shareholders. \n\nThe other issue is that I believe it may be possible to death spiral an etf through the mass sale of shares and the subsequent redemptions, though this should be a rare event comparable to a bank run, as selling ETF shares for less than the NAV of the fund isn't very smart without a damn good reason.

Started to read 10-K reports for companies that I hold, but I had a question regarding PLTR's employee stock-based compensation.\n\nWhen looking into the cost of revenue from 2019 -> 2020, there is a HUGE increase in their cost which PLTR attributes to stock compensation. We even see that PLTR operated at a loss due to these stock-based compensations (per their 10-k report), \" In the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, we **incurred losses** from operations of **$1.2 billion**, or income from operations of $189.9 million when excluding stock-based compensation\".\n\nI read through the 10-K report, but can't seem to find the answer. Are these employee stock compensations 1-time costs due to the listing earlier in September 2020? Or will these compensation programs continue to grow (which seems concerning since their revenue is only 1.08 billion)?\n\nAlso, what tips would you recommend reviewing when reading a 10-K report? I read an overview of the company and their products offered. Now trying to read through these tables for their contribution margin. Anywhere else I should focus on within these reports?

For a hyper-growth company, you need to look at how ROIC is trending.

If you account for that lag, the above trend would look even more impressive.\n\nThis trend is only going to continue and eventually surpass WACC because of these factors\n\n* Increased utilization of installed capacity by increasing cell supply. Partly by making 4680 cells in-house.\n* Larger % of operating income coming from FSD revenue\n* Get better deals on equipment because of larger scale\n* Better capex efficiency from manufacturing innovations (Giga Casting, 4680 lines, improving factory density, many small improvements)\n\nROIC is likely going to fluctuate year over year because Tesla will be in hyper-growth mode for many years to come.

At that price, early on it'd take ~5 years for a model 3 to pay for itself, going by the $30k a year income.\n\nLimited info currently, we'll know for sure soon enough!

{"title": "NVAX part II - Last call before a shit ton of catalysts", "selftext": "[Link to pt I](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/)\n\nTL;DR for Pt 1 is below:\n\n1) NVAX has the best in class vaccine and has the technological advantage of being able to easily become multivalent. This means with 1 vaccine you can get immunity for multiple variants and even the Flu as well. Other companies, particularly MRNA companies, need to give you a separate vaccine for each dose. Also it can be stored at 4C long term (unlike MRNA which needs -20C to -70C long term) and it has less side effects and has the highest reported efficacy to date (95.6%).\n\n2) NVAX is fundamentally undervalued. Sitting at a market cap of $15Bn it is cheap as shit rn. This company is expecting to produce 2 BILLION doses per year and has many deals established already with multiple countries for \\~1.6 Bn doses this year alone. For reference, MRNA announced last week it expects a revenue of $18 Bn dollars in 2021. Guess how many doses they are planning to produce? 600 million. And they have a market cap of 62 Bn.\n\n3) TONS of catalysts coming up.\n\n\\-Earnings call on Monday. If they give revenue estimates even half as good as MRNA they will pop to Pluto.\n\n\\-EU dose deal and approval. France and UK are already saying they're on the cusp of approval. Literally just waiting for finalization of UK phase 3 data which should come soon (this week? earnings call maybe as they did in the past for nanoFlu phase 3 results?). Approval will be their FIRST approved vaccine ever.\n\n\\-South Africa variant vaccine study. They already started developing their South Africa variant vaccine. More updates on this could send the stock up since it actually is for once not far behind MRNA and probably ahead of PFE for this.\n\n\\-NanoFlu. 9 months ago they revealed amazing phase 3 data for a new flu vaccine that is better than the current gold standard. They've been blue balling us saying they're almost ready to apply for an EUA since then. IDK when this will happen it seems they have their hands full with covid (maybe even a covid+flu vaccine?) but consider this one a slam dunk.\n\n4) United States market share DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER. Everyone and their dog will say \"ah but they're too late. US already has enough doses for the whole population\". A) This is retarded the US will still buy NVAX doses. They will not be caught with their pants down and run out of vaccines in the future because they decided to be fully dependent on two companies with new vaccine modalities. B) This doesn't matter anyways, they have deals for 1Bn+ vaccines in the rest of the world (including many developed nations). PLUS they'll gobble up US market share eventually if they can get multivariant covid + flu vaccines going.\n\nThis company is severely undervalued. Short term price target of $500. This will come after EU approval and potential US EUA based on UK data (crossing my fingers for this). Long term price target of $1000+. \n\nWARNING this stock is not for paper handed bitches.

{"title": "Why I love the AMC Stock", "selftext": "Sorry if my English is not the best. I'm from Germany \ud83e\udd10\ud83e\udd23\n\nA simple Reason why I think we should all go in AMC without nearly any cares about losses and hold it. \n\nThe Value is very low now and we all know what's going on this time so we have a very huge chance to make a huge amount of money and even if this gamma squeeze won't happen in near future we will win or at least go out without losses.\n\nAMC has many Cinemas around the globe and everyone loves going to the cinema. After the Covid-bullshit when they can open again with full capacity, the company can earn money again and has a good chance to grow again in long term and we all can take our money back. Maybe one month, maybe one year, who knows. \n\nAnd please remember the rumors about the corporations with Amazon and Netflix. \n\nThat's why I use every penny I can get to buy and hold AMC until we reach the Andromeda Galaxy. \n\nBut that's NOW.

But, in the pure form of a short squeeze this is in fact a case of \"there's nothing new under the sun.\"\n\nMost have become familiar with the Volkswagen squeeze that occurred in 2008, as it has been touted as the most direct short squeeze comparison. Chart photo below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/st5n6zjngck61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b5f0c118efebc43b115246a09e10744c01eee1\n\nTesla has also been compared to the GameStop situation but that was arguably a slower burn and to be fair had been on a steady march upward leading to the explosive growth in 2020.\n\nBut there is another squeeze that occurred in 1901 that might provide a better comparison to GameStop not in terms of its cause and setup, but the potential secondary effect.\n\n**The Great Panic of 1901**\n\nLeading up to 1901 the Union Pacific railroad had been on an acquisition tear becoming the largest rail player in the West under the leadership of Edward Henry Herriman and backed by a syndicate that included the likes of Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Goulds, Ameses and Kuhn, Loed & Co. (read as \"people who don't like to lose\").\n\nBut, in order to expand East a key acquisition had to be made. That acquisition was the Chicago Burlington & Quincy Railroad. However, James Hill through the backing of J.P. Morgan (also read as \"someone who doesn't like to lose\"), controlled the Northern Pacific Railroad and had similar ideas for expansion.\n\nA back and forth bidding war for the Burlington Railway ensued which ended in Hill being chosen and Hill proposing a Burlington and Northern Pacific merger. But, Hill and Morgan did not hold outright ownership of Northern Pacific and collectively held roughly 23% interest. Believing that the $155M or so needed to gain the controlling stake in Northern was of no issue they pressed on with the Burlington merger.\n\nMeanwhile, Harriman quietly began buying the majority of Northern's preferred shares and about $37M in common stock putting him within 40,000 common shares of control.\n\nOn May 6th, after getting tipped off of the activity, Hill and Morgan began frantically buying up common shares on the open market to block this attempt sending the share price from $110 to $130. Not wanting to announce their activity, great effort was put towards masking their buying and the general market remained unaware of the tug of war that was occurring between the two railway giants.\n\nBelieving that the price hike was artificial, traders began shorting the Northern Pacific stock.\n\nHere is an excerpt from *The American Magazine 1907* to give an idea of the climate at the time, it carries some similarities to today:\n\n*\"It is important to understand the mood of the time. Ordinary investors had recently been worked into a frenzy as U.S. Steel shares were promoted and railroad stocks were rising fast on various rumors of insider accumulations and mergers. Lefevre recounts a \"raging public speculation in stocks\" while Clew talks of a \"restless sea of reckless stock speculation that swept the American people into its vortex, with all its razzle-dazzle extravagance.\"\"*\n\nBy the next day the Northern Pacific shares were up to $150 and short sellers were weighing whether to close the position and take the loss or to liquidate other holdings to remain solvent. The following day, that decision was forced upon them as the stock climbed to $200.\n\nBy this point Hill had successfully seized control, yet neither side was going to sell and jeopardize what they each believed to be the controlling stake. As the market realized there was not going to be enough share volume to close short positions the price climbed to $1000 a share. Fearing the deadline to deliver, short sellers began dumping everything to cover their Pacific Northern losses and margin rates spiked to 60% only compounding the issue.\n\nThis created a panic in the broader market and following the lead of the short sellers the entire market sold off. The short sellers lost somewhere between $40M-$70M in the mayhem but those who sold in the broader market dip got burned as well.\n\nOverall, the total pain felt was short lived and smaller than it could have been. Realizing what was occurring Hill and Harriman reached a truce and agreed to allow positions to be closed out at $160 a share. This allowed markets to stabilize and return to previous levels, not to mention save some of the short sellers from ruin.\n\n**How Does This Mimic Today?**\n\nAn interesting take away from this story that has some value in today's situation is first that margin played a key role in causing a broader sell off and second that the stabilization came from two whales calling a cease fire.\n\nToday margin is at a record level, almost at the COMBINED amounts leading up to the internet and housing bubbles, even after adjusting for inflation.\n\nSome data on these levels further down in the post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueSqueeze/comments/lpftk7/investor_gardening_101_know_when_its_time_to/)\n\nSo, should the GameStop situation run away to a sufficient level, we can expect the incentive to sell due to margin will work its magic. Kind of like dry wood building up in a forest waiting for a fire.\n\nA bit of an instance of \"correlation does not equal causation,\" but it seems that when GameStop goes up the broader market does tend to sell off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wb2hq9pqgck61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=a603988fe3cad8c2ddc2e03ad205f3de2b1b83f4\n\nSome statistical data I've seen from various sources keeps landing at about a -0.50 correlation to the indices with a T-stat of < 0.05, which means a low likelihood of random chance correlation.\n\nEh, maybe a stretch but I bet the inverse correlation gets stronger as GameStop goes from $200 to $400 to $800 etc.\n\n*Now for the scary part,* in the above example two whales met in the middle to call an end to all of the madness. I suspect there will be no such \"bailout\" in today's case. A quick review of the sentiment around the GameStop revolution shows that convincing a diverse population of shareholders who see this as more of a crusade rather than merely a profit endeavor is going to be an uphill battle should the price keep rising.\n\nAnd good on them, but should 1901 repeat itself the SEC may have to force some hands. We've already seen brokers take matters into their own hands.\n\n**How Not to Burn Your Hands and Maybe Get a Chance to Profit**\n\nIf you are profit motivated, you could of course try and time an entry into GameStop if you expect the squeeze has not happened and that the best is yet to come.\n\nBut, assuming the above is a good proxy for what could happen, might that be the best way to approach the situation?\n\nIf you are on board for the revolution by all means take what money you can afford to lose and join the cause. But, for those dollars above and beyond this amount, the ones you have to make calculated bets with, can some second order thinking provide fantastic risk adjusted returns?\n\n**The easy way** would be to mimic what a certain Bernard Baruch (a trader on the floor at the time) did in 1901. A quote from him during the panic:\n\n*\"On the Exchange floor fear had completely taken the place of reason. Stocks were being dumped wildly, dropping from ten to twenty points. There were rumors of corners in other stocks \\[in addition to Northern\\].\"*\n\nBaruch realized what was going on and he bought heavily in the drop. He knew great companies were being sold at fire sale prices and he took full advantage.\n\nTo follow his lead in today's situation would be to have some DD already done on companies you'd love to own, make sure the cash is available and see if some fireworks happen.\n\n**The hard way** would be to actually put on a short. Which does not have to be done *prior* to some positive movement from GameStop. But ask yourself, in a selloff situation what is likely to happen?\n\nMost probable would be a flight to safety. So, if you are a trader, going short growth companies as GameStop makes some serious moves upward may be the safest short equity bet. Historically speaking people are most eager to let go of those companies that have yet to grow into their multiples (think high P/E ratios).\n\nRegardless of the method that works best for you, which of course depends on existing positions, risk tolerance, etc. the current situation has the potential to create a low risk high reward outcomes as a secondary effect. We already have a historical data point to look to and the dry tinder waiting behind that one was a fraction of what we have today.\n\nSome thought put towards a response to this possible outcome may prove to be profitable.

Everyone's going through analysis paralysis. If you want to read my other post about 1, 2 and 3. Tldr below\n\n\nNo proof or DD just opinions.\u00a0\n\n1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits. \n\n2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will. \n\n3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of \"making things up to profit\" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv. \n\n4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.\n\nI bet you he's sitting there shaking his head at us dumb apes. He can't say anything or else it'd be market manipulation or whatever and this would all be over. Instead he supports us via his other ways. Stay strong. Why stop at Wendy's when we can make it to the moon?\n\nTLDR: DFV is an intelligent person and able to do his own DD. Yea he has money and was in for deep value, but things change and people adapt, and my opinion is he won't sell low. Not because he has alot of money and can Yolo and not worry, but it's just a better move to sell high. Alot higher.... This is not financial advice. I hope everyone gets their tendies high or low, but for everyone's sake high, because each and everyone of us deserves it. \n\nEdit 1: I get it guys, DFV has banked already. But still begs the question, whether you bought in at 40 or 400 a share, or if you are a broke ass, have money, or have LOTS of money, why settle for less? Wouldn't DFV or yourself say that? Honest question. Not a financial advisor or psychologist. I want tendies and lots of it, do what it takes to make lots of it, that's all. (except stuff you shouldn't do, read#2)\n\nEdit 2: Tldr, love everyones discussions and none of this math and shill stuff.
