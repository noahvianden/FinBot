{"title": "Gamma Squeeze Explained", "selftext": "I've been asked to post this here after posting originally in a wsb offshoot, excuse any insults I miss in my very very quick edit:\n\nToday I'm going to attempt to keep you fine folks engaged long enough that we might learn something.\n\nWhat's a gamma squeeze and why do I care?\n\n# First, let's get some key definitions out of the way.\n\n**Delta** \\- the greek that measures the expected rise or fall in the value of the contract based on a $1 move in the underlying asset. E.g. AAPL is trading at 120.02 and the 5/21 130c is currently trading at 3.37 with a delta of 0.32. If AAPL shares go to 121.02, we can expect the contract to be worth 3.69, holding all other factors stable.\n\n**Gamma** \\- the greek that measures the rate of the change of delta. It tells us how fast delta is changing.\n\n**Market maker** \\- anyone playing both sides of a security, providing liquidity to the market. Most commonly these are brokerage houses whose goal is to stay neutral. You want to buy that 5/21 AAPL 130c? They'll sell it to you. You want to sell that same contract? They'll also buy it from you. Part of this \"playing both sides\" means actively staying neutral which brings us to our next vocabulary word...\n\n**Delta Hedging** \\- a neutral options trading strategy based on the greek \"delta\". MMs will buy or sell shares over the underlying asset as the delta goes up or down in order to stay neutral on the trade.\n\n# Now, tf is a gamma squeeze?\n\nAs options contracts expire, they rapidly approach a delta of 1.00 or 0.00 depending on whether or not they're \"in the money\". Given the rapid move in delta, gamma moves with it since it's the metric that measures its change. Referring back to delta hedging, this means MMs are buying shares to cover the increase delta in ITM options *and at the same time* selling shares for contracts whose delta is rapidly decreasing.\n\nSo how the fuck does this squeeze?\n\nRecent examples would include the first week GME spiked or more recently when TLRY spiked and **every call contract expired in the money**. This means as delta rapidly approached 1.00 for every contract, gamma on every contract was rising with it (being \"squeezed\"). **This effect was exacerbated and \"squeezed harder\" by the fact that there were no OTM contracts for which delta was decreasing, meaning MMs were only buying shares to cover their short contracts**. This creates a vicious cycle wherein covering delta pushes the share price up which pushes delta up which pushes gamma up.\n\nA rapid increase in price as contracts expire can also lead to this sort of gamma squeeze but to feel the full effects of it the whole option chain should expire ITM.\n\nIf you made it this far I hope you learned something.

I think there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe first is that the calculation assumes all options are sold by MM's, which is definitely not the case. Some could be covered calls or covered puts sold by shareholders or shorts. The second is that it's assuming all the volume is buying, which might not be the case if there are large orders of selling calls or puts. This might be able to be fixed by instead looking at order flow. The third is that the MM's delta hedging is just one part of the equation. There NEEDS to upward price pressure because if the price drops then MM's sell off shares. Looking at the GME, AMC and RKT squeezes there was consistent upward pressure on the share price. \n\nI think the idea has legs, but it's obviously flawed too.

A few points that might be useful:\n\n1. Market making requirements by the exchange are not difficult to achieve. It's a common misconception that MM need to always provide 2 way quotes; if action is wild then we are usually on track for rebates enough to just stay away from the ticker that is going crazy. Problem solved.\n\n2. Alongside the point above, there's plenty of opportunities to immediately offset not only delta, but vega aswell using other options in the market. Sometimes, we will wait until two seperate opposing trades in the market are there simulatenously, where individually they would be bad trades, but together they offer a enough edge for less risk. We would then take both at the same time.\n\n3. Market makers do like to stay delta neutral, yes, but we also like money. Just like everyone else, if we have an opinion or see an opportunity to make some money, we will hop on too. This obviously varies degrees depending on the firm, but almost every one I know of will incorporate an element of prop views into their trading.\n\n3. Final point that is really overlooked a lot. The traders at these firms are human and not idiots. Even if they are automated - they are monitored by humans. Yes we like to hedge, but if it's not a good time to hedge and we are confident the price is coming back down, then we will just wait till the levels right. We aren't going to just waste money by hedging at terrible levels if we think something is fishy is going on and the level should return back to what it was. GME was a unique case where a mix of diamond handedness and wild upside speculation made it so risky that hedging needed to be done regardless of a terrible level. Gamma squeezes are far less common than people seem to realise. For reference to your specific question - can gamma short term gamma squeezes occur?

Trading a product where you don't know these things is just pure gambling. With respect to your comment, this is usually linked to very volatile situations. \n\n\n>What are the rebates you are getting?\n\nDepends on the exchange but you can get anywhere from 50% to 100% of trading fees back. To meet the quoting requirements for these it's usually around 70-80% of quoting uptime (average across all products) and meeting a specified spread width (usually quite large) from the exchange.\n\n>when you say you stay away from the ticker, does that mean you don\u2019t provide liquidity for that asset?\n\nYes.

{"title": "Monday School: Your orders are not as good as you think they are (bid/ask, volume, open interest, mark, market, and order filling)", "selftext": "On an irregular basis depending on demand, I'll make a post on Monday to address a FAQ or common misconception that I see posted by new traders dozens of times a day. Everyone is also welcome to find these answers in our [FAQ wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/index).\n\nPrevious posts in this series:\n\n[Your break-even isn't as important as you think it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m0m7at/monday_school_your_breakeven_isnt_as_important_as/)\n\n[Exercise and Expiration are not what you think they are](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m5r8mi/monday_school_exercise_and_expiration_are_not/)\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n======\n\n* If you don't remember anything else from this post, at least remember this: **The narrower the bid/ask spread, the better deal you are going to get on your trade. Avoid wide bid/ask spreads whenever possible.**\n\n* Every contract is up for auction, with active buyers and sellers, represented by the bid/ask spread, respectively.\n\n* Every contract also has a daily volume and open interest.\n\n* The price of a contract is not defined by some kind of central authority or by a pricing model, it is discovered by active trading.\n\n* When your broker calculates a gain/loss for today or since open, they use the \"mark\", which is the mid-point or average of the bid/ask spread. It is an **estimate**. It is not what you will necessarily get if you closed a trade in that moment.\n\n* The \"market\" is the bid when you are a seller and the ask when you are a buyer.\n\n* Consequently, you must be an active participant in the auction in order to get the best possible price. You can't just fire and forget an order and hope for the best.\n\n* There are two types of orders for opening a trade and four types of orders for closing a trade.\n\n* For opening, there are market orders and limit orders. **NEVER USE A MARKET ORDER, EVER.**\n\n* For closing, there are the same market and limit orders as for opening, as well as stop-loss orders and stop-limit orders, to put a floor under your losses on closing a trade. **NEVER USE A STOP-LOSS ORDER, EVER.**\n\n* Liquidity and the width of the bid/ask spread are highly correlated.\n\n* Liquidity is a critically important factor in determining how cost-effective your trades are. Consequently, liquidity should be a priority when selecting option chains and contracts.\n\n\nOptions are auctioned -- it's EBay, not Amazon\n========================\n\nMany new traders seem to believe that the price of a contract is set by some central authority and that looking at the quotes in an option chain is some kind of static price list, like a menu at a restaurant. Nothing could be further from the truth. All option contracts, as well as stocks and ETPs, for that matter, are traded in an auction. There are active buyers and active sellers.\n\nThis means that the current price for a contract is fluid, ebbing and flowing as the number and urgency of the buyers and sellers fluctuates. The current state of the auction is defined by the **bid** (the highest price buyers are offering to pay) and the **ask** (the lowest price the sellers are willing to accept). Since there may be more than one contract up for auction at any given time, the bid and the ask each have a size, represented by xNNN. The NNN is the minimum number of contracts a buyer is willing to buy or a seller is willing to sell. Example: $1.23x100/$1.38x23 -- this means 100 contracts sought for $1.23 and 23 contracts on offer for $1.38.\n\nThe bid and ask only represent the \"top\" of the order book. Prices that are higher than the ask or lower than the bid are recorded in the order book. The details of the order book and Level 2 real-time quotes are beyond the scope of this article, but if you wish to learn more, you can read an explainer [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp).\n\nContracts at a specific strike and expiration have a *volume* number, which represents the number of completed trades on that contract for that day up to that point in time. There is also an *open interest* number that represents the number of contracts in open positions in the hands of traders or market makers. It is similar to the float of outstanding shares for a stock. More about [volume and open interest here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050615/what-difference-between-open-interest-and-volume.asp).\n\nIt is worth noting that for the most part, the active bids and asks you see in the auction are market makers. That is why a contract with 0 volume still has an active auction, because the job of market makers is to, well, make a market. That means to act as a buyer if you are selling and a seller if you are buying.\n\nGiven that there is an active auction for every contract, how is the current value of a contract determined? The process of determining the current value is called *price discovery*. Again, the details are beyond the scope of this post, but if you wish to learn more about price discovery, there is an explainer [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricediscovery.asp). For this post, the point I'm making about price discovery is that the current value of a contract is any number between the bid and the ask at that moment in time. Until a trade actually happens, the exact value is unknown, but not unbounded. Therefore, you cannot say with authority that the value of your open position is $X. At best, that is an estimate.\n\n\nDoes that mean the gain/loss of my position is defined by the last trade?\n=================\n\nNo, not for options.\n\nYour gain or loss has to be based on the current price, but if no trades have happened (volume is 0), or the last trade was an hour ago and the auction has moved far from the last trade, how does your broker know how to calculate the current gain/loss?\n\nYour broker *estimates* the current value of the position by using the *mark*. For options, the mark is the average of the bid/ask spread. It is sometimes also referred as the the mid (middle) of the bid/ask. Example: If the bid/ask is $1.00/$3.00, the mark is $2.00 and that is used as an estimate of the current value of the position. Even if the last trade was $1.50.\n\nThis is the reason almost every long option trade is opened for a loss. You almost never get the mark as your actual trade price when your order is filled, so the distance from the amount you actually paid to the mark is often treated as a loss. For example, using the $1/$3 spread again, if you end up filling your order at $2.10, your broker will show a current loss of -$0.10 on the trade, because you bought at $0.10 over the mark. If you bought or sold at the *market*, which is the bid for a seller or the ask for a buyer, you will show half the width of the bid/ask spread as a loss on open. More about mark and market in the section about order types and getting cost-effective vs. fast fills.\n\nMy buy-to-open at the mark never fills! That means my broker is stealing from me, right?\n=================================\n\nWrong. Or at least, very unlikely. That has more to do with not accounting for the options market being an active auction. You can't just set an order and hope for the best. You need to actively bid if you are a buyer, negotiating a price that a seller will accept. Sometimes you need to increase your offer to get a fill, sometimes you need to wait patiently for the market to move towards you.\n\nA maxim that I found useful for active trading is: Getting a fill on an order is a contest between your greed and your impatience.\n\nWhat that means is that, most of the time, you can either get the price you want or a fast fill, you can't have both. The more money you want as a seller (or the less as a buyer), the longer you may have to wait.\n\nSo once you decide on which way you want to go, best price or fastest fill, you can then participate in the auction accordingly. For the rest of this description I will assume you want a fast fill and are willing to compromise on price. Because the opposite it just a waiting game.\n\nTo get a fill relatively quickly, what I do is start at the most favorable price for me and then negotiate towards the market. For example, as a buyer, I open bidding at one increment away from the bid. If the bid/ask was $2/$3 and the minimum increment of price is $0.05, I'll start my order with a limit of $2.05 (more about limit orders below). I wait 10 seconds for that to fill. If it doesn't fill, I modify the order (cancel the order, replace with a new order) to $2.10 and wait 10 seconds again. I keep doing that until I get a fill. Sometimes that means I end up paying a price that is above the mark. Sometimes it means I pay a price that is close to the market. That's the cost of getting a fast fill.\n\nWhy not use a market order? \n================================\n\nMarket orders give you minimum time but at maximum cost.\n\nThere are two types of orders for opening a trade and four types of orders for closing a trade.\n\nFor opening, there are *market orders* and *limit orders*. A market order means fill my order *at any price*. A limit order means fill my order *at a price that is at or better than my specified limit, whichever is best*. From the definition alone it should be clear why you should never use a market order. You are putting yourself at the mercy of the auction and the order book and could end up paying much more, or getting much less, than you could have gotten with a little more patience. In fact, some traders actively seek to exploit naive use of market orders by placing \"traps\" in the order book, which are ridiculous prices that no one would pay or accept, but that could be snagged by a market order if the top of the order book is cleared out. Or the trap is set to snag a large dollar value order that intends to \"sweep the book\" and clears out all the normal orders in the book and runs into one of these traps.\n\n**Long story short, don't use market orders to open, ever**. If you want a fast fill, use the method described earlier which, in practice, will get you a fill within 5 minutes, and often in less than 30 seconds. It you absolutely must have the fastest fill possible, set a limit order at the market price or one increment beyond.\n\nFor closing, there are the same market and limit types as for opening. There are also *stop-loss* and *stop-limit* orders to make sure you don't lose more than you want to lose. The stop-loss turns into a market order to close when the designated stop price is met. A stop-limit turns into a limit order (at the specified limit price) when the designated stop price is met.\n\n**Never use market or stop-loss orders to close, ever**. If you want a floor on your loss for a sell-to-close order that will fill as quickly as possible, set a stop at the worst price you will accept and the limit at $0. A limit is always filled at the limit or better, *whichever is better*, so if you want to fill at the stop price or as close to the stop as possible, your best chance is with a limit at $0. Or work you way up from $0 to a more reasonable price, if you think a sharp drop is unlikely. For example, if you bought a call for $5 and you want to stop at $4, you can set the limit for a stop-limit at $2. The lower you set the limit, the less risk there is that a sharp drop will leave your order unfilled. But that doesn't mean you will only get $2. You'll get the best price that is above $2.\n\nEDIT: You should be skeptical of any use of \"always\" or \"never\" in the context of option trading, including everything I wrote above. Experienced traders with thousands of trades under their belts will rightly scoff at the idea that you should never use market orders. So let me qualify my exhortation by saying that with enough experience and in the right circumstances, like day trading highly liquid contracts, market orders are not only acceptable, the may be the most cost effective alternative.\n\nWhat about liquidity?\n=====================\n\nLiquidity is a little hard to define for all cases, since it is somewhat context dependent. The relevant [Investopedia definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) is \"liquidity describes the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its ... value.\" Put another way, the better liquidity is, the better deal you'll get from a market maker. The worse liquidity is, the more you will be ripped off by trading with a market maker.\n\nThe width of the bid/ask spread is highly correlated to the liquidity of a contract, to the point where we can say that the bid/ask spread represents the liquidity of the contract. The volume and open interest are also factors in liquidity, but in practice while trading, where liquidity hits you the most is in the bid/ask spread. As a gross oversimplification, the width of the bid/ask spread is the mark-up a market maker adds to the wholesale value of a contract. The wider the spread, the more of a premium you will pay as a buyer in order to own the contract, or the more of a discount you will have to offer as a seller to get a fill.\n\nThere is also an analogy to competition. Consider something highly perishable that can't be easily shipped from Amazon, like live aquarium goldfish. If there are five pet stores in town, you have a pretty good chance of getting a good price on a pair of goldfish that you want to buy, because each pet store knows you can go to the one down the street to get a better price. The competition helps keep prices down as a buyer, because some store can always undercut another store on price, until price reaches an equilibrium that's close to it's wholesale value plus a reasonable mark-up. But if there is only one pet store in town and the next store is more than a 3 hour drive away, your local store can gouge you on price for a pair of goldfish, because where else are you going to go for a better price?\n\nOptions liquidity works similarly. If volume is low or zero, where are you going to go for a better price? Bid/ask spread can be as wide as market makers want it to be, because there is no one else to undercut those prices. Whereas if volume is high, there is more incentive to undercut competitors and close a trade, because a little money is better than no money if no trades happen, from the market maker's perspective.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that when you are looking for options to trade, select underlyings that have highly liquid option chains. Given an expiration or strike with low volume and wide bid/ask spreads versus a different expiration or strike with high volume and narrow bid/ask spreads, choose the one with high volume and narrow bid/asks.", "id": "maufwg", "created_utc": 1616437702.0, "score": 944, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "Good post, though you typo'd \"sharp\" as \"shart\" in there.

It may have taken ten years to recover your investment, and many stocks would still be at a loss after 20.\nSo you want to avoid buying at such a peak. How to do it?

A company can be both an amazing business and a terrible investment, if you pay too much.\nThe market has been defined a voting machine on the short term and a weighting one on the long. That\u2019s why if you plan to hold long term you should be especially concerned about value.\nHolding long doesn\u2019t justify paying too much, it\u2019s the opposite.

There is an element of prestige in owning a brand phone or car, because they are items you use in public.

Generac has a great battery system,  a much more built out network for sales,  distribution,  and installation.  They also have more option sizes offered for the customer. Generac is a 20b company who has been the leader in backup generators for years.  Batteries may replace the standard gas and propane units,  but figure that entire market is not likely to increase 100x because they are batteries.  They may tap into consumers who didn't already have gas as a fuel source,  but the expense will also limit the market for a time period.

I think robotaxis in spots there are very viable in the same way above ground rail/trolly transit, bus/bike lanes exists in cities now where you adjust your existing infrastructure to support the transit.  If the preponderance of your transit is local and planned communities are built around the idea (most of) what you need is < 2 miles away, that's where robotaxis come into play.  Oregon (suburbs of Portland) is based on high density housing with very localized shopping. Northern VA has similar developments.  With populations of planned communities > 30k in many states, it could be very viable as a means to normalize traffic, lower emissions, etc.. It would take a little retrofitting, but painted lanes, a new sign alerting vehicles to turns, etc.. could easily be done in these locations.  Also, with these scary turns we're seeing, you could see a funneling of autonomous traffic to designated intersections, much like school crosswalks.

Newer ideas always talk about the size of the industry potential,  but then the execution has to happen.  Look at 3D printing.

However, expertise in existing automobile manufacturing doesn't always translate to great EVs. Just like Tesla did for a *long* time (and many argue continue to do so), they have to suffer through a period of problems, bugs, and optimizations. Most notably this was early in Tesla's Model 3 production ramp that Tesla seems to have mostly gotten past.\n\nFor me, the closest legacy manufacturer is VW with the ID.3 and ID.4. There were multiple problems with their infotainment system and their over-the-air updates, which tells me that they still need significant investment and experience in the new generation of cars - like many EVs - in the software and infotainment aspect.\n\nAnother part with traditional manufacturers is that when they expand into the EV realm, they're eating into their own sales of internal combustion cars. Automaking is notoriously low margin already so it'll be a difficult transition period where they lose revenue from ICE car lines while ramping up non-profitable EV lines. Their business structure is also very resistant to change, and will be the biggest non-engineering challenge. You can see the problem of the dealership model by walking to a Ford dealer and asking to see the Mach-E. You might even see blank stares. EVs - a low cost-of-ownership vehicle - is not good for dealerships that derive a large part of their income selling service contracts.\n\n>Also, for every Amazon..... there's thousands of companies who fail or become mediocre.\n\nAnd some of the manufacturers you've listed could be prime candidates to fit in this category if they fail to navigate the difficult transition.\n\nAt the end of the day though, does my bull case for Tesla justify the valuation?

That said, the companies with really high P/E ratios these days (or non-existent P/Es because their earnings are negative) seem to be the companies you just described: unprofitable and debt laden. It's this prolonged period of low interest rates that has allowed many of these companies to take on a lot of debt and loans in hopes of expanding and becoming profitable by the time they need to refinance or start paying those debts. However, because many of these companies are in tech they are seen as attractive businesses to some investors which is why there are so many skeptics for some of these companies with outrageous valuations with a supposedly promising future (example someone gave above was Uber - good product that people use but in terms of investing they don't turn a profit).", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla is profitable and has the an excellent balance sheet with very little real debt, and it\u2019s a high growth company.

I think they are going to do well. The issue is with the current valuation and whether the stock price will do as well. Even if the earnings triple in 2 years we're still talking about a P/E of 300-400 assuming the stock price doesn't change. If we want to see stock price growth over the next 2 years then in 2023 people will either still have to pay a significant premium and we'll continue seeing P/E's outrageously high, or the earnings would have to increase significantly. For example, assuming no stock price growth for 5 years (who wants 0% return) the earnings would have to still increase 15-20x just to get to where AMZN's P/E is today. I'm not saying that's the scenario that will play out or that 5 years is a fair timeline for Tesla (7-10 yrs is probably more reasonable in my opinion) I agree that TSLA will remain a growth company and will have a higher P/E. But if they deserve a 70 range P/E like you say, then their earnings will need to increase 20-30x  to also see some stock price growth.\n\nTo answer your last question, my opinion doesn't really matter since TSLA doesn't follow 99.9% of the pre-established norms or fundamentals. Fundamentals aren't reliable with growth companies. I personally don't think they'll be as disruptive as many people think they will be in autonomous vehicles, solar, battery storage, etc. I don't see a good \"moat\" that prevents competition in many of these areas. First on scene for some, but not a moat. Many areas are also not high profit margin - the margins on their higher volume selling vehicles is minimal, the margins on their solar are minimal to negative, etc. The hope that they'll get into the SaaS territory and subscriptions for other technologies remains to be seen. Their current business is sustainable, but so far not worthy of the valuation in my portfolio. I think people sometimes include the recent huge run up in their view of TSLA going forward. What everyone needs to do every so often is step back, look at the stock they currently own and decide if it's worth the current price. Can't take the price from 1 or 2 years ago that it was bought at into account because what I or you currently own is what's in the portfolio today.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": ">Even if the earnings triple in 2 years we're still talking about a P/E of 300-400 assuming the stock price doesn't change.

The good news is that\u2019s exactly what Tesla is on track to do. Analysts estimate Tesla will make $2.67/share on a GAAP basis in 2021, which is >4x 2020\u2019s EPS of $0.64 (these are the same analysts which Tesla beat the expectations of 3 out of the last 4 quarters). Assuming these analysts are correct, Tesla only needs to 4-5x 2021 earnings to justify the current stock price. This is entirely doable for a company that is guiding for 50% CAGR top line growth. I am of the opinion that Tesla can 10-12x their profits over the next 5 years, and hence I am bullish even at today\u2019s prices.

I actually haven't looked at the most recent earnings projections so that was helpful. I realized over the past year that the arguments back and forth about Tesla boil down to people arguing about their own investment philosophy and use Tesla as an ice breaker... Again and again. There's no right or wrong way to invest or else the stock market wouldn't go up or down. For my own investing and retirement portfolio I'm basically 10% hand picked stocks and 90% index funds. Therefore, I'm not seeing nearly as big of rewards, or losses, as a lot of people on here. Since those safer stock market investments are my bread and butter it's easier to see why I can be more skeptical of the higher-end bull case for Tesla.\n\nMy biggest area of discomfort with Tesla is I don't think they're earnings growth will come consistently. I realize that sounds silly because that's completely expected with companies earlier on as opposed to an established giant like Microsoft or Amazon that I'm much more comfortable with. However, where it makes me uncomfortable is paying the super high premium now as if they are a giant in hopes of those big future returns. If it doesn't pan out then it could be a bad situation. Everyone knows that, but for some reason some people get angry about it as if they know the future and argue on reddit. Until they expand outside the realm of being an automobile company I struggle to see big earnings growth since it's such a low profit margin business. That said, eventually, in 2-4 years or whenever they do release their next big thing then earnings can start to grow rapidly again.

{"title": "$FSR is worth $0 a share", "selftext": "This stock will fly again due to hype, but it's a $0 company.  My current thesis is they never actually mass produce a car.\n\nFirstly, their projections are to start production in Q4 2022.  Think about that for a minute.  It'll be late Q1 2023 before they plan to ship a car.  And that's IF everything goes to plan.  By then, GM, VW, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Honda, Toyota, Lucid, and others will have a two year head start on actually delivering EVs.  By then there's no reason for someone to wait 24 months for a car.  People did it for Tesla's because they were the only game in town, but they won't do it for a Fisker.\n\nSecond, the CEO is a huge liability.  He already made decisions that ran the exact same type of company into the ground.  This does not bode well for long term success.  Yes, it could be a one off due to failed battery packs, but who approved their use?   Oh, and they just announced a partnership with Foxconn to build their next car after the Ocean.  And where?  At the (in)famous Wisconsin factory.  You remember the one?  [https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump](https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump)  .  This does not show me that he's improved his decision making.\n\nThird, price.  If they can deliver on what they are promising I will be amazed.  A 300 mile range EV with a solar roof, and full vegan interior for $37,000.  I may be wrong, but I just don't see it.  They have no proprietary tech, so will be getting all the internals from other manufacturers, but can somehow undercut their prices?  That's a leap of faith.  Faith that hasn't been earned.\n\nFourth, volume.  They will need to stand up an entire after sales support network (repair shops, trained repair techs, replacement parts, distribution, etc.) for a brand new car line.  In every country they plan to sell to.  You need huge volume to justify this.  Even Tesla is having problems getting people timely repairs to their cars.  How long will that solar roof last after the first hail storm?  Or the first drive behind a dump truck with unsecured gravel in the back?  Who's going to repair it?  How much will it cost?  How long will it take to get the parts?\n\nFifth, design.  A small concern, I know but I am thinking that by the time they ship a car their design will be outdated.  I think the car looks great now, but so does everyone else's.  And design tastes will change in the next two years.  Can they afford a design refresh before they even ship a car?\n\nFinally, they have no real differentiator.  There's no reason to buy a Fisker over any other EV that will be out ahead of them.\n\nI see canceled pre-orders, manufacturing troubles, regulatory hurdles, and ultimately a failed endeavor without anything to show for it.  Man, I hope I'm wrong, but the more I thought about it the more it didn't make sense.\n\nPositions: 4/1/21 $18p\n\nedit: typo", "id": "maa6g3", "created_utc": 1616372503.0, "score": 173, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "As true as this all may be I never bet against the stupidity of others", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "Fuckin NKLA", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "What do mean by the last five years, the start of the electrification of cars?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ah ok yeah, well, the average consumer probably hasn't even heard of NKLA, so yea true", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06817479431629181}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.035902369767427444}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.035902369767427444}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10520072281360626}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06103280931711197}, {"body": "Evergreen.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.046626899391412735}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17254893481731415}, {"body": "My favourite part about this sub is when a speculative bull posts a DD about their all in on a company a bear comes out and shits on their dreams.

Can we now all agree that not withstanding all the other theories such as RH internalizing orders, citadel writing naked options, DTCC about to audit fake shares, 3/23 earnings blowout, VR+e-sports transformation,  shorts over 100%; Gamma has been the main factor of the week to week price movement these past few weeks. I'm not saying those other theories are untrue, but they don't provide actionable intelligence for \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d to trade besides HODL, which at 0.7% shorts borrow rate might take a looong time. Furthermore, when institutions/whales do a short squeeze, they usually follow it up with recalling their loaned up shares, like what /u/MartinShkreli did with $KBIO, though he was able to do this effectively because he had control of >50% float thus able to coordinate the timing.\n\nSome important points\n\n1. Gamma/Delta goes both ways, it can amplify upward momentum but can also accelerate a downward spiral.\n2. Delta Hedging is a continuous process. The moment you bought an option, within minutes MM bots will start delta hedging your options.   They don't suddenly start to buy the hedge only when nearing ITM or Friday's close.\n3. Buying options at specific strikes and expiries can give you 4-10X amount of share buying amplification compared to buying shares directly due to MMs delta hedging by buying the underlying shares. You may not need to buy options to trigger a gamma squeeze, provided the OI already supports it, a small price increment might be enough to tip it over.\n4. Yes the IV is damn high at +300%, highest in the market in fact,  making ATM and near OTM very expensive, but  that doesn't mean it can't go higher. Ideally for a gamma squeeze we should start with low IV and ladder it up, however you play with the cards your dealt with. Ms Alexis Goldstein / u/dontfightthevol testified in congress that option probably contributed to most of the volatility [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what\\_was\\_the\\_footprint\\_of\\_institutional\\_trading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what_was_the_footprint_of_institutional_trading/)\n5. Short Hedgies are using PUTS to short $GME, PUT/CALL ratio increase almost 10x on long dated expiries. Hedgies love to short because in trading as in life, failures occur much more frequently then successes. Thus it is way easier for hedgies to instigate a business collapse by publishing negative press, influencing creditors, and launching frivolous lawsuits against a business rather than trying to create success.\n6. Make no mistake, this is a battle. It doesn't matter at this point if on earnings 3/23 GME announce new VR tech with e-sports or all 5,509 GameStop stores were to somehow spontaneously combust. All that matters is the buying vs selling amount and the max pain each side is willing to tolerate\n\nI believe if \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d understand the mechanics of a play, they would be more willing to commit their hard earned   \ud83c\udf4c to it, \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d together  \ud83d\udcaa , \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d + \ud83e\udde0 = mega  \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c \ud83c\udf4c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# $GME Gamma Squeeze Calculator v8\n\nThis update contains a graph generator to visualize the total delta hedging vs underlying price and/or time decay, ***it includes 3,143 $GME options chain OI(Open Interest) up to 1/20/23 based on 3/19 closing data***. It aims to make a free retarded excel version of a Total Delta/Gamma Visualizer, frequently used by institutional traders\n\nThe calculator calculates the net buy/sell needed to be performed by MMs given certain price movement and time assumptions. There are 5 sheets with the input parameters color coded in peach orange. Parameters include\n\n* Current Price\n* Projected Price\n* Time to Projected Price (The time in days you forecast the projected price will occur)\n* Net MM%(to estimate how many % of the sold calls are written by MMs excluding covered calls/puts and theta gang spreads)\n* Strike and Expiry filter to include/exclude option chains based on strike price and date\n\nThe new graph simulator graph has the following controls\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8fpj8ao8ho61.jpg?width=893&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfd4cb30cb991751927cff5bfcadb601d2f6586e\n\nThat allows you to visualize the total hedge graph vs price in constant time, so you can have an overall view what the total MM delta hedging is on different price levels based on current options OI. Clicking the simulate price button would generate the graph below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7k5b0np8ho61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c33983b49fe86702be4f41f95708aa23978e138a\n\nFrom the above we can glean information on how price effects total delta hedging, The call options generate positive delta hedge, while \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b buying puts adds negative delta hedge. The total delta hedge converge with the puts delta hedge as price goes lower and vice versa converge with the calls delta hedge as price goes higher. It can be observed that If the price drops below $85, MMs will be net short, and further moves downward will be greatly amplified by the puts delta hedging. Thus the $85 is a level that theoretically should be defended by longs.\n\nBy clicking the simulate time button, the simulator can also show the total hedge vs time decay in days in constant price\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj8gtxdr8ho61.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d278ba91a635a44a91cd209cb7d93b03bdc2571\n\nFrom the graph, due to the current structure of $GME options OI, at its natural theta(time component of option greeks) decaying state, there will be a net SELL of stocks by MMs if price remains the same, leading to a downward pressure on the price. This decay is particular to High IV stocks with an option chain OI concentration of strikes above the current share price like $GME. There'll also be a significant drop as it passes the monthly expiry in 4/16, where a lot of options expire.\n\nTo find witch strikes and expiries are responsible for the largest delta hedged shares, go to the OI sheet and click sort by hedge\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bwwm5os8ho61.jpg?width=1317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c43f3a8aa8568ebace2de5f1fdf4e9cd114072a\n\nTo find the biggest shorts delta, sort by hedge from smallest\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yb8j1jdu8ho61.jpg?width=1315&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6495f3c8ea70a1a543a62a3d03bcda5cd75b3d8\n\nYou can use the index2 field to return the original sort order(strikes & expiries).\n\nTo model what would happen if specific strikes and expiries increases in OI(Open Interest), go to the OI sheet and sort by amp factor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0dyp87px8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc5d8d545b179f9c790de3746f74bc3dd3b0a448\n\nchange the 445C 3/26 New OI from 67 to 10,067\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5rxsyndz8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6819b829b398d0244959845fa7914c9aa9fcfde4\n\nYou'll see the from the diff column, that 10,000 x 3.38 x(100 per contract) = 3.38 MM USD buy would trigger 106,620 net share buying by delta h\\\\edging MMs or about 21.3MM USD, giving amplification factor of 5.4X. If price were to rise, this amp factor would climb further due to positive gamma. Changes in the OI sheet will be reflected back in the Total Delta Hedge on the Cover Sheet and the Graphs. For the Graphs you'll need to run the simulation again to get updated results.\n\nOn the topic of IV too high, as $GME currently has the highest IV in the market and about MMs ripping you off; Well it's actually a bit more nuanced then that. Here's a graph for Gamma Delta vs IV , assuming $200 underlying and 7 DTE. You can find it in the Delta/Gamma sheet of the excel macro. Use that sheet template to model Delta vs Gamma for different strikes and expiries.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r74sn5ud9ho61.jpg?width=1160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bae17addc9f5cf1d9c1dac73343fbb2847524f00\n\nGamma is not linear, depends on the underlying price and IV\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Obligatory harebrained scheme\n\nIf all \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d understand delta hedging/gamma, then a play like the following would be doable.\n\n*Disclaimer : I'm not actually telling \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d to do this, it's more of a what if scenario of what would happen if \ud83e\udd8d did, as many users have pointed out that according to the media this may amount to market manipulation, and market manipulation is illegal if done by retail plebs, mkay... Only hedgies are allowed to do stuff like this and naked short a company to oblivion.*\n\nFor this gamma play to work, the large short interest still needs to be true, then If you all can  \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32 , I suggest \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d wait until IV drops down a bit to <200%. So that the ATM and near OTM options will be a lot more affordable. When IV drops to below 200%, \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d can start building the ATM to NEAR OTM ladder, optimizing our strikes/expiries using the calculator. Why not just randomly pick near OTM price you ask ? $GME option chain have been so volatile that there were huge discrepancies in theoretical delta vs actual delta between the strikes.\n\nSummarizing, the steps are\n\n1. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd32  your shares, because it's likely to drop next week\n2. Wait for IV <200%\n3. Use the calculator to calculate best ITM,ATM, near OTM strikes(depending on your risk tolerance) with largest delta/price ratio\n4. Someone ~~post a call to action~~  do a Tarzan yell, if up vote is over the threshold buy amount needed, everybody goes all in, if not then better wait for another opportunity, no sense in wasting \ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4cs. It takes ~~teamwork~~   *\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d* together or the play won't work\n5. Watch price goes up end of week\n6. Defend it by buying shares on Friday 2.45 PM, just ignore all the earlier price movement on that day and instead concentrate on the close, This is when MMs try to fix price to avoid max pain\n7. Exercise if you have capital or if not, roll those calls to higher strikes\n8. Witness short hedgies cry\n9. Rinse and repeat for the following week, until the entire financial system collapse\n10.

{"title": "You\u2019re buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. Why do you hate money? Technicals 101 for beginners.", "selftext": "**Not a trading advise.**\n\nHey there folks and congratulations if you haven\u2019t blown up your account last week. Thanks to TA, mine **barely** survived. It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you\u2019re down, that\u2019s understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we\u2019ve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.\n\nBright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It\u2019s like we are little puppies.\n\n**So, what do we do?**\n\nWe do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It\u2019s gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it\u2019ll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don\u2019t worry. Basics are super simple and I won\u2019t confuse you with pattern terminology.\n\nIf you\u2019re not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south. You'll be able to apply these methods on short and long term positions.\n\nI received a PM from a fellow Redditor yesterday, saying his puts lost half the value. I\u2019m sure those losses would not have been this big if TA was involved. We will get it back my dude. Read on.\n\n**Resistance and support**. Two simple, magical words we\u2019re going to cover today.\n\nYou\u2019re gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.\n\nI'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f\n\n**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.\n\nAbout 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.\n\nI saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0f493b8sgo61.jpg?width=519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61db8ae9c9f115ae33f5aacfbfd8f24e7cc3ddda\n\nLet\u2019s step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.\n\nWe\u2019re gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it\u2019s 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.\n\nOn **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.\n\nOn **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tumqvxssgo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06512087a5ea457dabb354960c24c5d548f495e2\n\nClearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.\n\nStay with me.\n\n**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**\n\nHere's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b\n\nSuper simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**\n\nNow, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.\n\nUsing same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.\n\nNext, we\u2019re going to add to our chart what\u2019s proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.\n\nGuess what price GE closed on Friday. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssi2kllbvgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e6ac7bbb85f40bd35a4232c794b39f8f4d54cfc\n\n**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**\n\nNo. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There\u2019s a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we\u2019re seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**\n\nWe look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that\u2019s a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.\n\nIf we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.\n\n**Here\u2019s the part that matters for you the most.**\n\nDo not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.\n\nWe see paper handing comments all the time. \u201cIf I were to hold two more days, I could\u2019ve doubled my money\u201d.\n\nWhy would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it\u2019s close to resistance.\n\n**What about red candles inside the channel?** \n\nIt's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would\u2019ve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.\n\n**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don\u2019t look back.**\n\nApply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**\n\n**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**\n\nThis is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.\n\nI added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6\n\nAt this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.\n\n**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We\u2019re stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It\u2019s simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.\n\nWhat I know is this. I\u2019m not touching TSLA. I\u2019m not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.\n\nI want to see resistance break and hold for calls.\n\nI want to see support fail for puts.\n\nDon't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That\u2019s gambling not trading.\n\nI get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, \u201cShit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?\u201d\n\nWell sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It\u2019s a treasure hunt.\n\nThis is the way. \n\nCheers.", "id": "mabmyk", "created_utc": 1616376862.0, "score": 5021, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 511, "comments": [{"body": "I didn't know what colour crayon to use and got stressed and smoked some apha at 9:25 so apha 25c", "score": 538, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 161, "replies": [{"body": "TL;DR OP is not a financial advisor, that being said \ud83c\udfa2 \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11 \ud83e\uddfb\ud83d\udc50", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "So we\u2019re going up downward to the moon with paper hands?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "OP likes roller coasters; timed right they'll blast off to the moon.

I wouldn\u2019t say the stock market is gambling like the lottery system. But ppl tend to let it become that way without realizing it. My first job was working at a gas station so I sold scratchers. I noticed many thought they had a system to winning and would bet on their system to work. But they never do, they always lose and think it just didn\u2019t work this time. But some were smarter than others, they knew most of it was a game of odds. If someone had $100 to spend they would buy nothing more then scratchers worth $5 and their chances of winning back all their money was much higher than someone who blew all that money on just one scratcher worth $100 (these ppl were always the biggest idiots of them all, cus 9/10 times these were the ppl who believed in their systems religiously). This is how I see it with the stock market, the biggest losers are the ones who spend too much on one play thinking it\u2019s gonna be the one that makes them a millionaire. There will always be exceptions but the odds are rarely in your favor. TA can be great but to a certain degree it begins to form the same thought pattern involved with gamblers who believe they have a system. TA can be a very useful tool but never risk so much money based on TA alone. And don\u2019t sell it all as soon as you get in the red. That\u2019s another factor. Emotions play a big factor in winners vs losers. Ppl should learn to separate emotions from rational thinking. It\u2019s a skill worth learning and I believe these are the most successful ppl in general. But if you\u2019re on wsb than you most likely don\u2019t care about rational thinking \ud83d\ude02I mean I am holding on to gme but that\u2019s the only non rational thing I\u2019ll ever participate in again.

What's most important is that you fucking PICK ONE and then ALWAYS USE THAT.  Don't connect wicks to bodies.  As long as you're consistent then you'll get roughly the same information.  \n\n\nNext, and also important is that you need two points to make a line.  However, a line with only two points is meaningless.  I could draw like 30 goddamn channels in those charts and they would all tell me what I want them to tell me instead of what is actually happening and the only thing they'd all have in common is that they're all equally shit.  You need at least THREE touchpoints for a line to indicate a trend.  Also, whether your line goes between wicks or bodies, either of those two things can count as a touchpoint.  I personally use the candle bodies because they're easier to see after like 8 shots of whiskey, so I'll try to find a line that hits at least three candle bodies exactly.  If any wicks then also hit my line or any candle bodies go past it, that can still be useful information.  However, a line only tells you something useful if at least THREE THINGS touch that line.  The more touchpoints the better, so try to get as many as you can even if it puts the line somewhere that you don't like.    \n\n\nLast shit is to also look at other indicators besides just the fucking candles, especially volume.  If I find a triple-reverse hypercube pattern but the volume is way below average then it's fucking meaningless.  Similarly, if my triple-reverse hypercube is isometric but volume is 100x higher than in the past year, it's also meaningless because it's an outlier so ignore that shit when you're drawing lines.  Also you may not find a fucking line no matter how much whiskey you drink or how fat of a crayon you scribble with.  If you need to, draw shorter lines but draw more of them over time since there could by some sort of cyclic pattern or some shit but even then you might find precisely fuck-all.  Shit happens.

There is no confirmation that she is the replacement at this time.\n\nNo known impact on volume yet from this breaking news.\n\n**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen.

After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That's a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we've seen, possibly bigger than January's gamma squeeze that got cut short.\n\n**Next confirmed Gamestop announcement:** \n\n**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)\n\nFollowing that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.\n\n*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.\n\nFor those that want to dial in:\n>2020 earnings results after the market closes on Tuesday, March 23, 2021.

When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. \"Order flow is everything,\" he says. \"It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.\"..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8\u00a2 spread. But if the firm \"worked the order\" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4\u00a2 more, the buyer gets 3\u00a2 off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1\u00a2 instead of 8\u00a2. \"Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,\" he says. \"You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.\"\n\n[How Robinhood (and the other brokerages that have followed them) Make Money on Trades Despite Taking No Commissions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html)\n\nWhat is Payment for Order Flow?

Merrill Edge does have probably the best overall brokerage when you look on paper.\n   1. 0.012 sec execution trades and no PFOF for stocks and only PFOF of $0.05 per contract.\n   2. **BUT** the brokerage site itself is hot garbage if you are going to do options trading. The internals are phenomenal but that doesn't translate to the user experience (lots of loading to change pages).\n2. Chase on paper also has stupidly good specs\n   1. Basically no PFOF on both stocks and options\n   2. **BUT** redditors complain the UI is way too simple and it doesn't even have basic stuffs like stop loss. Doesn't seem to be meant for options trading. AND no extended hours for trading (no pre/after-market)\n3. Both brokerages seem to be excellent for long term buy and hold though. Just don't buy into any of their active fund or active portfolio manager recommendations.\n\nBasically, it seems Merrill Edge and Chase has all the internals checked right. But the user experience... can be R I P for some. Maybe you'll like it. Who knows.\n\nHow I do is I put just enough assets to have Preferred Rewards for my credit card --> have a BoA Advantage Relationship checking account (no fee if Preferred) with $1 --> Open Fidelity and Fidelity Cash Management and treat Fidelity as my new bank (weekly paychecks go through here, etc.) and brokerage (trading). Paychecks should come a day faster on Fidelity Cash Management and the UI is far better for trading than Merrill Edge.\n\nAnd each time you have enough to hit the next Preferred level, just transfer just that amount of shares to Merrill Edge. No fees from Fidelity's side. Don't hesitate to abuse it. Fidelity has no fees for transferring money/stocks/bonds between brokerages/banks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, there's nothing wrong with Merrill Edge or Chase brokerages. Number wise, they are great.

One, they have themselves at risk because their short exposure goes THROUGH THE ROOF while they are playing these games - and two, it becomes less profitable for them over time as volatility drops and the premiums they receive go down.

We never *see him hurt someone*, like truly hurt someone in a repulsive way. We don\u2019t. The closest we get is when he hits Naomi (which is immediately excused, and I\u2019ll explain why, and shone in forgivable light).

My other point is that this all lies almost entirely in Scorsese\u2019s direction. He\u2019s a classic Hollywood style kind of guy, so everything\u2019s always going to be shot clean and lit bright and cleanly, and so almost all the ways he chose to shoot, have his actors act, have his sets dressed, there is nothing ever unappealing or repulsive on screen or in the design of the film at all ever. It\u2019s literally clean and glamorized the entire film and especially within Belfort\u2019s character. The closest thing we\u2019re shown that might make us really feel *sick* with Belfort is when he punches his wife once in the stomach at the epitome of the 3rd act of the film, when we already know that *this* Belfort is in a very bad place, and so when we do finally see him do something like this, this isn\u2019t the normal Belfort, we know normal Belfort would never hit Naomi because he hasn\u2019t for the last three hours.

{"title": "Big Catalyst tomorrow for RKT!", "selftext": "Tomorrow's a big day for RKT!\n\nAt this point, it's painfully clear that the stock price is being artificially kept down. Shares available to borrow dropped from **6,700,000** last Tuesday to **200,000** today.\n\nLet's do some quick maths:\n\nTomorrow all shareholders get a special dividend of $1.11 per share.\n\nWith a Public Float of 108.45 mm shares and 39.66 mm shares shorted (as of Feb 26 per Yahoo)\n\nNo we all know a dividend of $1.11 isn't going to scare shorts off. But what I believe will catch them off guard is the Re-Investment of those dividends.\n\nIf EVERYONE re-invests the dividend, that's:\n\n(108.45mm+39.66mm) \\* 1.11 = **$164,402,100**\n\n$164,402,100 / $23.89 (Current Max Pain Price) = **6,881,628** shares of buying power! There are only **200,000** share left to borrow.\n\nThis could make the stock go **PARABOLIC**\n\n# But's I'm a long-term investor, it's a great company, I don't want it to become a MEME stock...\n\nYES YOU DO. Why? Because think about who the retail investors who would be paying attention if/when it goes parabolic. These retail are Millennials and Gen Z. That means they are looking for their first car loans or first home loans! They are College Students and Grad Students, Engineers/ people passionate about creating change. Not only are they the exact demographic that would be Rocket consumers, they are also the exact demographic that Dan Gilbert wants to recruit to Detroit to rebuild Detroit and build the next Amazon!\n\nTake me for example, I'm 32 and looking to buy my first home soon. I was planning to go the traditional route, talk to some banks... blah blah blah. After seeing RKT and reading about Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner, I'll most likely end up using Rocket! Now take me and times that by millions around the world!\n\nBy \"sacrificing\" your dividend (by buying into an undervalued stock... poor you), you would be boosting the value of the rest of your investment by improving the very fundamentals of the company itself. It's a no brainer!\n\n# Don't most people take the dividend as cash?\n\nUnder normal circumstances at a mature company, yes, people take the cash because the company has nothing else to do with the money. This, however, is a **special** dividend. RKT is nowhere near done growing. In fact, they went public in order TO grow. They didn't do it for the cash. This is from an article from when they first went public.\n\n[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/)\n\n>*Rocket Companies already is the nation's largest mortgage lender. It\u00a0closed $145 billion in loans in 2019\u00a0and recorded $893.4 million in profit on revenue of more than $5.1 billion. Gilbert founded the company in 1985. In 2010, he moved its headquarters from the suburbs to downtown Detroit. The company employs some 20,000 across the country with most based in Detroit.*  \n>  \n>***While Quicken's coffers do\u00a0not necessarily need the capital from an IPO, Gordon said,\u00a0going public could be a valuable recruiting opportunity\u00a0for the company competing for young talent in technology and software development. Gordon has had students recruited for positions in Detroit only to be wooed by other firms with offers that include stock options with the potential to grow over time.***  \n>  \n>***\"That\u2019s a lot easier to do when you\u2019re a public company,\" he said. \"If anything, it might help Detroit become a little more techy and more attractive to tech people and\u00a0software people.\"***\n\nDan Gilbert is trying to build the next Amazon... they only STARTED!!\n\nThis dividend was given out to bust the shorts. I'm sure many thought that the ANNOUCEMENT was to bust shorts....no... it's the **Re-Investment** that will bust shorts.\n\nThe Play : Don't just buy options. That doesn't help, you just end up handing the MMs money. If you're not in this already, it should be a 60/40 split on Shares/ Options Or something like that. Obviously since the event is tomorrow, I bought a bunch of weekly options (not a lot compared to my overall investment in RKT), but I can't in good conscious recommend that to anyone, weeklies are just straight gambling. Buy shares! I'm not sure when the best options play would be since I'm not sure when the next catalyst would be, there's a buyback looming, could be anytime.\n\nPositions- 24k shares and calls splattered throughout the options chain.

Are significantly more companies embracing remote work who previously resisted doing so?  I think it would be hard to believe the answer to that was no.  Does this make their business more reliant upon technology company products?  Yes, and across multiple dimensions.  They need more servers or cloud compute server resources for supporting the remote connections, the works require laptops or desktops, webcams, software, etc.  The managerial side was likely already heavily invested in reporting and metrics, but likely many adopted this more heavily than previously due to managers not spending most of their time roaming around.  Collaboration tools aside from just the obvious conferencing apps also see a big boost, everything from messaging to time tracking to calendars.  Documents can't just be thrown on a shared drive now, so cloud storage or cloud-based office apps are being adopted more, all of which are subscription-based systems that integrate well with an overarching corporate single sign on solution.  All of these things are pieces which are not going to go away once people adopt them and companies see the inevitable significant productivity increases compared to in-office work.

When/if it squeezes and they get caught, the margin calls will force massive sell offs, and STILL the short sales will not settle as it is IMPOSSIBLE to settle them - like a black hole of finance.

It's super useful when you're watching momentum trying to find bottom, you can see when momentum shifts from people selling into the bid, to buying at the mid price, to slapping the ask. It's not 100% needed, but it's a great tool. Also gives you a good idea of possible support/resistance targets, when a ton of orders are posted at a given price point, people are looking to buy/sell at those levels. If those orders get eaten up quickly, then the price is likely going to keep moving in that direction until it hits the next wall. If people shift from buying/selling at those levels, youve probaly found a support/resistance level. \n\n* Learn some of the most common patterns.
