So instead of running scared, I made sure to protect myself with disclaimers and shit.\n\nI'm adding more to it and *I now get more enjoyment out of building a tool that the regular / average / retail investor* could use than managing my own portfolio.\n\nFeel free to use it, it's built with love.

{"title": "Roblox reference share price set at $45 ahead NYSE debut", "selftext": "The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday set a reference price of $45 for shares of U.S. gaming platform Roblox Corp on the eve of its public market debut, implying a market value for the company of around $30 billion. San Mateo, California-based Roblox is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children and offers a host of games across mobile devices and gaming consoles. The reference price is not an offering price to purchase shares but rather will be a performance benchmark for when Roblox's stock starts trading on the stock exchange on Wednesday. The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers. Roblox has opted to go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). This means the company is not selling any shares in advance of its market debut, as is the case with IPOs. Direct listings are still relatively rare, though they are becoming increasingly popular way to go public amid criticism that investment banks underwriting IPOs underprice shares being sold to help create a first-day trading \"pop\" for the benefit of their big trading clients. Reuters reported last week that U.S. grocery delivery app Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through an IPO. Roblox said in January it had raised around $520 million in a new Series H private fundraising round in a deal which valued it at $29.5 billion, more than seven times the $4 billion the company was valued at in its Series G round 11 months earlier. U.S. demand for video games has surged as consumers seek home entertainment while living under lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. - Reuters\n\n**No link to post in this subreddit for some reason so I copied and pasted the article for anyone interested in $RBLX.\n\n***Update: Roblox Shares Indicated Between $67-$72\n- Reuters 3/10/2021, 11:04:16 AM\n\n***Update 2: Roblox Shares Indicated $64-$66\n- CNBC 3/10/2021, 12:38:17 PM\n\nEdit: deleted news article link.\n\n***Update 3: BRIEF - Roblox Class A Shares Open 43.3% Above Reference Price in NYSE Debut.

I had an overweight position in Baba that I sold off in the past month, using the correction lows as an opportunity to rotate that money into MSFT, ETSY, and TGT instead.

profits and only half of $650 profits. +20% was certainly not something they expected.\n- Bearish expectations are all over the place.\n- Bullish expectations are around $700, with big call clusters at $750 and $800 as well.\n- Options writers (MMs) would prefer the price to close around $650, with the delta balance somewhere between $630 and $660 - but I suspect if these prices prevail they'll just raise their delta hedging inventory again. (They might already have done it - yesterday's volume was strong enough, especially in the second half of the day when $650 broke on high volume.)\n- There might have been substantial gamma effects (delta of delta) last week and this week, with TSLA reliably dropping in a row MMs would rather lead the drop than lag it with their delta-hedging shorting. Yesterday was probably not anticipated by the algos either, so the +20% was likely magnified by the gamma dissipating or even reversing.\n- March 19, next week's expiry, is very interesting in that it's a quarterly and quadruple witching day LEAP expiry day, with a lot of in the money calls from last year. There are 2x as many puts though - the broken dreams of 2020 TSLAQ bets I suspect. There are huge call clusters which dominate puts starting at $700, all the way up to $1,000.

{"title": "A refresher on what the $#@! is going on with GME", "selftext": "A lot of you may be new here, or maybe you've been here for a long time.\n\nBut either way, I'd like to bet that aside from knowing that \"hedge funds and shorters got too greedy and we're going to get them for it!\", **you don't really have any idea how the GME rocket started.**\n\nSo let me do the honours of giving you all a quick run-down on what is currently happening with GME.\n\n# It all started when hedge funds and shorters shorted GME into oblivion.\n\nWith COVID-19 impacting the world the way it did, GameStop was set to become the next Blockbuster and go out of business for good.\n\nHedge funds, who love to make money off shorting companies into bankruptcy, saw this as a perfect opportunity to make some easy money by **shorting more shares of GameStop than there were actual GameStop shares.**\n\nWhile some were able to figure this out before anyone else, pointing this out would have meant nothing if there was no reason for GME to go up...\n\n# Then all of a sudden GME had reasons to go up.\n\nPeople like Michael Burry and Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill pointed out that the fundamentals for GME at the time (mid-2020) were not reflected accurately in GME's current price ($3-4 USD). What Michael Burry found out, in particular, was that not a single GameStop was in the red; they were all making profit to some degree.\n\nAfter GME starting showing positive trends, people like Ryan Cohen and companies like Microsoft invested in the company as well. With these investors in the company, there was hope for GameStop to not go bankrupt and actually adapt with the rise of eCommerce.\n\nFinally, to really help GME go along, Microsoft and Sony announced that their latest consoles (the XBOX One X and PS5) were still going to support physical disc copies of games. This further gave reason to believe that full-digital wasn't the future just yet, and that there was still hope and profit to be had in physical products/locations.\n\n# And as GME started going up to most people's surprise, people started noticing how screwed shorters suddenly were...\n\nBut before we continue, I need to briefly explain what a *\"short squeeze\"* and *\"gamma squeeze\"* is. **If you already know, you can skip below.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"short squeeze\" is when lots of people \"short\" shares, yet the price of the stock they shorted continues to go up, and eventually they're forced to cover their positions.**\n\n**This allows those with shares to sell the shares back to them at ridiculously high prices because, well, they have to buy them back.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**A \"gamma squeeze\" happens when many people make lots of  \"call\" options with market makers for prices that are very high to reach (ex. a $100 call for a stock worth $10).**\n\n**They do this in hopes that not only will the stock attain that set price or higher, but more importantly that the market makers don't actually have the shares to give to them if/when the call options can be exercised.**\n\n**If this high volume of \"call\" options does get exercised, and market makers don't have the shares for them, that means that they'll be forced to buy the shares. Those with shares can then make them buy these required shares at much higher prices.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SKIP POINT\n\n**People online began to communicate with one another about GME, and pointed out that is was going up despite what shorters wanted to happen.**\n\n# It was then that they theorized that with all the shares being shorted, and with the stock continuing to go up, that they could buy lots of GME shares and create many highly priced call options to create a short squeeze as well as numerous gamma squeezes.\n\n# But they weren't going to accomplish this alone...\n\n**Other big players on Wall Street also saw what GME was capable of, and provided the high volume required to send GME to the moon. And they provided the high volume indeed...**\n\n# And thus began the GME Gamma Squeeze of January 2021\n\nWhat was once a $3-4/share company destined for bankruptcy suddenly sky-rocketed to a max of $480+ essentially overnight, and shorters and bears suddenly found themselves in billions worth of losses.\n\n# But we all know that big guys don't play nice.\n\nBefore more call options could be filled and the price of GME could go up any further, numerous brokers halted buying GME all together. This gave plenty of time for numerous \"call\" options to become worthless, and for shorters to regroup and recover their losses.\n\nAfter all, the DTCC gives a 21 day grace period for investors in huge debt to cover their positions, so these shorters were going to do everything they could within these 21 days to get the price of GME back down. This way, they could not only minimize their losses, but even get back into the green and continue to bankrupt GameStop.\n\nIn less than a month, GME plummeted to $40/share, and all seemed lost. Hedge funds would win once again, and retail traders were given a grim reminder that they don't play by the same rules as the big players...\n\n# Yet this is not how GME ends.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, more hope was given that GME would rocket once again.\n\nKeith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill proved that not only did he still hold all his original shares in GME, he also doubled down on his position right after he announced that he would still buy GME during a Congress Hearing.\n\nDuring the same Congress Hearing, Melvin Capital (a hedge fund that lost 53% of its value because of the GME Gamma Squeeze) admitted that there was no short squeeze, and that the rise of GME to $400+ was a result of a gamma squeeze.\n\n**In other words, a \"short squeeze\" hasn't happened yet.**\n\nPeople found that shorts theoretically didn't all cover as shorters continued to be greedy and likely held on to their shorts as they thought they could still bankrupt GME like they originally planned.\n\nThey found that while short interest was seemingly much lower that there were still very few GME shares left to short and that shorters were still losing millions every time GME spiked to new level highs.\n\nNot only that, but that shorters likely continued to short as GME went down during the gamma squeeze; putting them in an even bigger short position than the last.\n\nRyan Cohen made it official that he would be heading GameStop's eCommerce division (because of course he is)...\n\nThere were meme tweets of ice cream, frogs, and 1980-90's games/movies...\n\nPeople began exercising call options once more, and now...\n\n# The GME rocket rises once again...\n\n# TL;DR: Shorters and Market Makers are currently in desperate positions where they need A LOT of shares of GME to cover their shorts and fulfill their \"call\" options, and retail investors (but most importantly big players) are buying and holding all the shares they can to make GME the Big Squeeze of the 21st Century.\n\n# NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

This meant that the gamma squeeze was rapid and ended above $60, since all the call options by then were 100% covered, and any squeeze above that was entirely short-squeeze.\n\nToday it's a little different: with contracts available up to $800, brokers buying shares to cover calls will continue pretty much linearly (proportional to the number of contracts at each level..say, isn't there an oddly large number of $800 ones?) as the price goes up but will cap out just around $800. This means a much less sudden gamma squeeze, but one that is more sustained, assuming the price continues to climb at a decent rate of at least 15% per day.\n\nThe other factor is that new shorts opened positions on the way down from $480, and they don't lose as easily this time, because they're still making money so long as the price remains below their entry point, which could be over $450 for some, whereas before by $60 100% of them were fucked.\n\nWhat this means is that instead of gamma squeeze then catapulting us into a short squeeze, this time we are looking at a more even mixture of both, with the short squeeze happening in full throttle only above the previous high, and that short squeeze then catapulting us into a mushrooming gamma squeeze as we reach $800.\n\nIn my view, this means a realistic price target of over $800 is an exit point to consider; after $800 the gamma squeeze is over and the short squeeze by itself this time doesn't have the same potential since it is no longer shorted over 100%.\n\nI have a limit sell at $841.38.

That will drop the price from the top to probably something fractional of its original. This will trigger a second round of buy offs, aka a dead cat bounce driving the price back up to fractional positive values (if the peak reaches several thousand a share), and that'll lead to a second fall off until the price stabilises to , 230-385 range.\n\nI fully expect there to be two major money making opportunities with GME. The primary will for most lead to a 10-100-1000-10000x ROI, and the secondary will for most lead to a 3/5-30/50-300/500x ROI (this is a guess and subjective to however much each individual invests).\n\nThis is just napkin math and there's no real formula to the peak of a dead cat bounce, but dcbs and bull traps according to google are the same thing. DCBs also tend to occur the most during a short squeeze. We saw that happen with GME where it went to 347, dipped hard to 193 and then went back to 345 before declining down to ~40.\n\nDCBs can happen multiple times per stock cycle as well. The higher the value the more bounces are possible. So if GME goes to Mars at 3,000/share theoretically, then it's entirely possible that a correction down to 1k could lead to a bounce back to 2k, then another correction down to 500 will bounce back to 1k, and then finally stabilize with ups and downs between 230-385.\n\n\nUnderstand that the above is just an example. It's not real, and no one knows how high GME will go. More importantly, it cannot be stressed enough that DCBs though have the potential to make a bit more money along the way down, are very risky plays because there's no formula to how high those bounce peaks are. You could theoretically reinvest half your GME earnings expecting a significant gain only for it to within hours net you 10% before cratering 30% leading you to lose more than you gained.\n\nUnderstand your own risk tolerance and trade responsibly.\n\n---\n\nAll that said though, when GME gets to the top (whatever that is), if the 230-385 range is actually true for a fair value price, then puts against GME will be money making opportunities; though... the premiums on puts for GME out to anywhere from end of this month to Oct 15 are insane. ~110-115/share premium is insane. A single 420 put out to 10/15 is $28.8k.\n\nRemember that puts can be used to acquire GME shares for a lower cost. The only risk is that you lose the premium when you exercise; which at 28.8k is ridiculous even if the potential profit value of that curve is multiple times that.\n\n---\n\n# UNRELATED.

They are, of course, a bunch of di\\*\\*\\* who want the retail investors to lose while they make a boat-load of money. I want them to be forced to cover ASAP. \n\n**XL Background:**\n\nXL Fleet was founded in 2009 by Tod Hynes, an MIT graduate. They convert motorized vehicles into one of two configurations: \n\n\\- XL Hybrid -  25% MPG improvement, 20% CO2 reduction \n\n\\- XL Plug In - up to 50% MPG improvement, 33% CO2 reduction\n\nImportant to note: **they currently are developing full-electric conversions of fleets**, which will improve their revenues greatly once completely developed. \n\nThey also develop and implement EV charging stations. XL currently has the largest charging station deal in U.S. history - they are implementing 1,000 EV charging stations in New York City at UBS Arena (NYI rink). The CEO also stated they have a number of other deals like this in the works just a week ago. \n\nThey have a blue-chip consumer base, including **Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Canada Post, Verizon, FedEx**, and much more!\n\nSome significant shareholders include Blackrock, JP Morgan, and Hudson Bay Capital. \n\nThe current price-targets range from 30-58, that implies a 2.5-5x return from its current levels ($11.90). \n\nThere revenues are expected to grow over 100% every year to 2024. Particularly, there **2024E revenue is $1.4B**. The company currently has $**400M in cash on-hand**, which gives them lots of cash to help in there endeavour to grow significantly. \n\nIMO: **a short-squeeze is imminent**, and we are gonna make those losers over at Muddy Waters cover their short position before the weeks out. \n\nGLTA!", "id": "m20zhf", "created_utc": 1615392589.0, "score": 586, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 224, "comments": [{"body": "\ud83d\udc4d \nI bought in for the ride to a new all time high!\nWe can do this! \ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\ude80", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "To the fucking moon\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 my fello tard lol", "score": 48, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09247413277626038}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21426253020763397}, {"body": "Been buying for weeks and averaging down.

{"title": "GME technical analysis from a retard Part 3. Why I think the short squeeze is nearly here.", "selftext": "Last week I drew out a chart looking like this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/acopf56dr9m61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=921fe515d9d1fe8b49c7fc0ff410a016c0b3d5d6\n\nLets see the results...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8odmmly13am61.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=0860362e90fb97b8484df24335ec93dc79e259e4\n\nThe chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher & close to happening. Let me break it down. **The GME rocket is nearly fuelled up ready to go full retard mode.**\n\nWe have just completed a cup & handle gap fill from a gamma squeeze which is why the stock has pushed up this week, however the stock has the ability to push a lot further before the eventual short squeeze. This is due to **IV** (implied volatility). For instance, let's say GME increased from $260 to $269, that would be a 9 dollar difference with a 3.4% increase. Now let's say GME was $20 and increased by the same amount of dollars to $29. It would be the same dollar difference but with a 45% increase in share price this time. This is the exact reason why the gamma squeeze in January was unsustainable and died down quickly because it had a low IV. It went all the way from around $15 to $450 in a quick space of time which the stock itself couldn't handle. Now that GME has had a steady increase to $260 per share, it has a much higher IV & will be able to sustain a $450 price tag without crashing down as it would only be a 73% increase. It's crucial that GME sustains this gradual increase in share price so it can increase it's IV and have the ability to go to **$69420 per share** from a technical point of view.\n\n**Why the stock was heavily attacked today & what the stock needs to do to go to $69420 per share and why it WILL**\n\nWe established that GME had enough IV to go from $15 to $450 for a brief period of time, that's a 3000% increase. That means that if GME can slowly get to $2314 per share, this will be the launch pad for GME to increase by 3000% to go to $69420 per share. To go to $2314 from where it's at now at $265, that's only an 873% increase which is much less than the 3000% increase in January. A crucial point was when the stock recently ran up from $40 to consolidating at $120, this is CRUCIAL as the fact the stock didn't crash back down means that the 300% increase is sustainable for the IV. Using this calculation I can concur that in order for GME to get to $2314 per share & stay there, it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420. This is why the hedge funds short attacked the stock today with all they could as they realised this and are scared shitless.\n\nIf a low IV causes a major move to the upside to crash back down, that means that a major move to the DOWNSIDE will cause the stock to go UP. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try & trigger a sell off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180. They still haven't covered yet. What they have done now is actually increase the IV of the stock with the retarded doji and now it may be EVEN easier to get to $69420. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.**\n\n***I have to say it's very dirty what the hedge funds tried to do today... make the stock tank 40% then put out pre written articles about the tank to scare people into selling. That is not only chart manipulation but a malicious attack directly towards the company and it's shareholders who just like the stock & weren't ready for a 40% loss on their investment. It's not the shareholder's fault that hedge funds naked shorted a stock over 100%, that's a conscious decision they made themselves to do & turned out to be a bad one. It shouldn't be the reason why honest shareholder's saw an unprecedented 40% loss on their investment today.***\n\n**TL;DR** I like the stock & it's fundamentals, I think it's a great company. They generated over 6B revenue before the pandemic and are now transforming their business model into e-commerce. I believe they will become one of the world's leading gaming companies. I am very bullish on GME. I like the stock. It seems to have a lot of respect from the public who also like the stock & the company. I believe the entry point of $269 per share is a great long term hold, the short squeeze is just another attraction & interesting to see & analyse\n\nThis is not financial advice, I am just a retard who did some math and came up with random numbers", "id": "m2b59r", "created_utc": 1615416310.0, "score": 1840, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 203, "comments": [{"body": "BRB.

The chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher & close to happening.  \npls explain significance of retarded doji- or even explain retarded doji to retarded ape.\n3. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try & trigger a sell-off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180 :  \nI suspect hedgies have more tricks up their sleeves- but certainly, they have not met HODLERS and do not know what to do- becoming very apparent.\n4. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.** : what is making it rise up so quick- before it took a lot longer- is it the high IV?\n5. Can you throw some numbers on the 1st chart- because I reviewed your predictions and they are very accurate. Care to throw some more predictions so far as the where and when you predict the next dip. I had to get a new set of pants when it dipped today but i   \n\ud83d\udcf7 and sure enough all the DD of everyone in here paid off.\n\nSo thank you once again. You may have literally saved my and my family's financial future.  \nToday I will say a prayer in your name to have good blessings shower upon you.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "1. I first calculated the rise in January being a 3000% increase from $15 to $450. Knowing that it was possible for the stock to rise this much just from a gamma squeeze, I could then concur that a starting point for the stock to rise 3000% to $69420 is $2314, but the percentage increase could be a lot higher since the january squeeze was manipulated from restricting buying, therefore stopping the true squeeze potential.\n\n2. A doji is simply a type of candlestick that signifies indecision from the intraday price action. In this case that doesn't really matter because what created that doji was an artificial short attack. What matters is that the stock had a significant dip but bounced straight back up, meaning that the stock has huge strength and doesn't want to collapse at all, it makes me very confident that hedge funds are not going to be able to drive the price to where they want no matter how hard they try.\n\n3. Indeed\n\n4. IV is what makes the stock possible to go up to $69420, because the higher the price, the more bigger increases the stock can make relative to percentage increase. If the short squeeze starts happening now and goes up 300% everyday, it will take 5 days to reach $69420. But if it goes up to $69420 in 1 day that would be a 26700% which would technically be impossible due to not enough implied volatility, so in conclusion just be patient and expect the squeeze to last at least a week long.\n\n5. It's not very wise to throw specific numbers because that just can't be predicted, I rather just give rough numbers based on how i personally view things, it's just my own point of view and the first prediction just so happened to come out perfectly from luck. I knew it would push up due to the 5 green candles in a row & the pattern on the chart, it was just a rough prediction that happened to turn out right.\n\nThanks for the questions.
