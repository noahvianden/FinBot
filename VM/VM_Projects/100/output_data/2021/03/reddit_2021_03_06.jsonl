The automotive sector is dominated by extremely operationally efficient manufacturers and low margins. The industry was disrupted by the entrance of Japanese competition and consequently, it\u2019s has literally defined modern supply chain and operational research. There is no coincidence that a lot of the manufacturing efficiency terms we use are Japanese - they came from Toyota. \n\nAlready Audi VW are gearing up their EV offerings across their fleets. Porsche is making waves with the taycan and is rapidly electrifying their fleet. VW has already beaten Tesla to the punch in the hatchback and super mini markets (which are huge in Europe but low margin). Mercedes/Daimler are launching their EVs now, which compete directly with the Tesla 3 and S (same for BMW). Renault, Kia and Honda are attacking the low margin cheap and cheerful end of the market. \n\nThink about it using your own logic. This market has enormous tailwinds due to environmental concerns and policy incentives. Do you think the incumbents are going to do nothing? Tesla don\u2019t even compete for the vast majority of the demographics who make car purchasing decisions at the moment. They produce a luxury product that competes favourably with company fleet cars (because its heavily incentivised) and the executive market. \n\nNow for the \u201cbut the super charger network\u201d - in Europe at least they are facing huge competition from ionity (among others). Similarly other big names are gearing up in this space which is driving a desire for more commonality between charging. There are already companies enabling cross platform billing in some markets for example. The super charger network is a source of competitive advantage at the moment, but it isn\u2019t an insurmountable moat. \n\nOnce again I reiterate, I think Tesla is a great company. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s growth trajectory isn\u2019t without hurdles. Elon and his team have made something spectacular but that doesn\u2019t mean Tesla is appropriately valued based on its fundamentals and the current market information we have available to us.\n\nSticking with your example - if they did return to 60% growth (which is a huge if and would require a 2x growth from last year) and get to $250bn annual revenue they would still be in an industry with poor margins. Let\u2019s say Tesla become market leading and can achieve a profit margin of c. 8-10% that\u2019s a $20bn annual net profit. That\u2019s still a 40x valuation at $800bn - the sector average is typically between 5 and 30. Tesla is worth a premium so it\u2019ll be at the top end of that range, but these are all super optimistic assumptions.

It could be more pain in the short-term. \n\nI'm a long-term holder of TSLA. I've been predicting $10,000 per share since it was $40 (split-adjusted). This isn't based on exuberance. It will get there - you can bookmark this quote and make fun of me in 6-10 years if you want. But there is no telling where it will go in the short-term. \n\nCheck out the FSD Beta videos and keep an eye out for version 9. Whenever that hits - a much wider beta will go out and then a subscription service. The will spur huge data inflows, which will spur rapid improvement of FSD. \n\nI'm predicting autonomous ride-hailing in 2022. If I am right, this will be a multi-trillion-dollar company within a few years. Every one million vehicles they build could add a trillion to their market cap. ($30,000 ride-hailing profit per vehicle annually with 35x PE ratio). That's $1 per mile (half UBER cost) x 60,000 miles annually (14 miles an hour for 12 hours a day) with a 50% profit margin (cost per mile $0.18 + $0.32 for operations).\n\nTesla plans to be building 20,000,000 cars a year in 2030. I think they will get there early. They are currently building out capacity for about 4.5 million cars between Freemont (500k), Shanghai(1mil), Austin(2 million), and Berlin (1 million). If these factories are completed by 2024, that would FAR outpace the 50% compounded delivery ramp they project to get to 20mil by 2030.\n\nAt some point, new entrants will compete in the ride-hailing business and drive the cost-per-mile down. If Tesla could do half of that profit amount for their vehicles in 2030 - that alone would add 15 trillion to their market cap in 2030. These numbers start to look so insane that they are hard to believe. But for them to be a $5-10+ trillion company in 2030 would not be a leap at all if you assume that what Tesla is promising is true. That's why I have been tracking and following Tesla for years, and you know what? Sometimes they are wrong.

{"title": "PSA: Why Treasury Rates matter for your Fundamental Equity Valuations", "selftext": "*FYI This is going to cover some very fundamental stuff that I'm sure a lot of you already know, however since there's plenty of casuals and new joiners, I figured it might be worthwhile to give a primer on.*\n\nHere's a simple question: **What is a stock worth right now and why?**\n\nThere's lots of ways to answer this question, many (revenue multiples, earnings multiples, etc) are short hand or simplified ways of describing the same thing.\n\nThe foundation of modern finance answers this with: **The Present Value of all Future Cash Flows**\n\nRegardless of whether you're talking about equity in a growth tech company, a value oriented utilities operator, or even a distressed oil company, the answer can be broken down further into two components or sets of assumptions:\n\n1. What are those future cash flows this company will produce for this equity share I'm buying?\n2. What discount do I give them to calculate their value today?\n\n# Future Cash Flows:\n\nThe first component I imagine everyone is conceptually super familiar with. Everyone see's headlines about revenue growth or earnings growth and some kind of % figure that gets them excited. So when it comes to the value of equity, which do we care about?\n\nThe answer here is less commonly thrown around. The cash flows we calculate into for an equity valuation are the **Free Cash Flow to Equity**, or **FCFE.**\n\nIn short, **FCFE** is how much cash is available to all shareholders **AFTER** all expenses, reinvestment, and debts have been paid. A comparison for personal income would be, this is like calculating how much you have left each month from your paycheck after you take out taxes, pay for groceries, pay that student loan bill, pay rent, and pay for that oil change on your car.\n\nSo how do you calculate a company's **FCFE**? Thankfully lots of companies do this already in their non-GAAP calculations, but if they don't it's relatively simple on your own.\n\n`FCFE = CFO - Capital Expenditures + Net Debt`\n\nThankfully CFO is a standard GAAP accounting figure you'll always have. Capital expenditures are generally straight forward but can be disguised. And net debt is the net change in debt balances, if you issue more debt, more cash is coming in the door, that's considered that higher cash flow to the shareholders.\n\nSo this gives you an idea of excess cash that theoretically is coming back into your pocket as an owner of the equity. But you can't do this for infinite years right? At some point you have to just create a final value at some point in the future. This is called our \"Terminal Value\" and it represents some generic assumptions about growth and costs of capital to give you an idea of what all the years beyond that are worth. The formula is pretty straight forward. If I want build a 5 year model, I will include my terminal value in year 5. The formula for figuring this out is as follows:\n\n`Terminal CF = yr 5 FCFE * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`\n\nNow there's a couple ways to think about this, but the easiest way is to simply view it as the value of all cash flows AFTER year 5 at an **assumed growth rate (g)** and assumed **cost of capital (WACC)**. This value is calculated as if you existed in year 5 already and assumed long run growth rate is also the same as the long run rate of growth in the economy. If you subscribe to Damodan's school of valuation (widely viewed as the authority on equity valuation modeling), there is an argument for g being the nominal gdp growth rate.\n\nNow that we've put together the string of cash flows, what is the actual value of what you're receiving?\n\n# Discount Rates:\n\nThis is the second component of the answer fewer people on here seem to incorporate when thinking about stocks. The idea here is that there is some inherent discount you need to apply to something you're going to receive in the future. It's a little bit longer but stick with me.\n\nLet's take a step back and think about what that means. If I say I'm going to give you $100 tomorrow, generally you're pretty safe in assuming that's the same as having $100 today right? Cool that's fairly easy. Now what if I tell you I'll give you $50 in 10 years and $50 in 20 years. Are you going to value that the same as scenario 1? No right? Because if you get $100 tomorrow there's still 10+ years of time to do more productive things with that money than you would have in scenario 2 (i.e. invest it etc).\n\nSo how does this apply to valuations? Think of all those cash flows we talked about before. The value of \"buying the thing that gives you those cash flows\" is basically all of them summed up right? **Wrong**. Remember those cash flows are in the future... And things in the future are intrinsically worth less than they are today.\n\nSo how do we figure out what they worth today? Well that brings us to one of the most fundamental formulas in all of finance:\n\n`FV = PV (1+r)^t`\n\nThat is, for a **given rate of growth (r)** and a **given amount of time (t)**, we can figure out what the future value of any amount will be.  If we know our future values, but not our present, then we can just flip this around and solve it the other way:\n\n`PV = FV / (1+r)^t`\n\nWe already know FV is just the cash flows we talked about above already. So what is the 1/(1+r)\\^t? That's what we call our discount factor and this is where we are finally getting to the topic of this post's title. t is super easy, years are years unless you're some sort of time traveler. The real question here is **\"HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT RATE TO USE?\"**. The answer in finance to discount your cash flows by the company's **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** or **WACC**. The concept here is that cost of capital comes in two broad components, cost of debt, and cost of equity. Cost of debt is sort of self explanatory. You have some debt, you owe interest on it each year, there's some marginal tax benefit by interest payments lowering your tax obligations, etc. But let's ignore this for a second and pretend we're looking at a company with zero debt.\n\nWhat the fuck is \"**cost of equity**\" and what does it mean? It's far less tangible of a concept because there are no explicit interest payments that you can point to as \"costs\" like there are for debt. Instead some nobel prize winning financial economists (Jack Treynor \\[mentor of Fischer Black\\], William Sharpe \\[known for the Sharpe Ratio\\], and Merton Miller \\[known for Modigliani-Miller Theory\\]) captured essence of determining an equity share's \"cost\" through a theory called the **Capital Asset Pricing Model** or **CAPM** for short. This was a formula designed to determine what \"cost\" should be assigned to an asset based on a risk free rate of return, a market rate of return, and the inherent correlation of your asset with that market. You can see where I'm going with this. The formula is as follows:\n\n`R(E) = Rrfr + B*(ERP)`\n\nR(E) here represents the expected return of an asset. This can also be called your expected return on an equity or to the company issuing this equity it is the \"cost\" to them that's expected in return for the investor buying their equity.\n\nRrfr is just shorthand for the expected return on a risk free asset. You wouldn't ever buy into an equity share with the expectation that it gives you less than what the most risk free asset is right? Cool. So in the broad scheme of things there's a couple of things you could use for this, but one of the most common is the 10 year US Treasury yield (or some other duration US Treasury note/bill/bond). The US Government is widely believed to be the most risk free counterparty in the world. It's the nature of being a reserve currency.\n\nB is your assets beta to the market. There's a lot we can unpack with this but for an oversimplification, let's think of it as for every 1% the broad market changes, how much does your equity change by?\n\nAnd finally, ERP. This is the Equity Risk Premium. There's several ways to approach this but the simplest is to think of it as the general expectation of investors as to how much the broad market should outperform risk free assets. People purchase equity shares with the expectation of higher returns than safer assets? Seems reasonable.\n\nLet's try this out with the broad market. Let's assume beta (B) is 1.0, the risk free rate is 1.0% and the ERP (expected spread between risk free and market) is 8%.\n\n`R(E) = 1.5% + 1.0*(8%) = 9.5%`\n\nThat's a fairly reasonable rate. The sanity check here is comparing it to cost of debt. Because equities are lower in the capital structure, their cost should explicitly always be higher than the cost of debt. In the broad market companies are borrowing at less than 9.5% so that rough eyeball test checks out. If you invest in the broad equity market, your expectation is for companies to deliver 9.5% in value to you each year.\n\nThis finally brings us back to the topic of this post. You can see, wayyyy down in the granular details of a valuation, the equity markets fundamental valuation are inherently baselined on risk free rates. Now let's combine this with what we talked about above and see why such small changes in that tiny rate can have such large outcomes in valuations.\n\n# Case Study: QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE: $QS)\n\nI'll be honest, the reason I chose this is largely because it's one of the extreme examples that demonstrates how such small changes can make disproportionate impact. Also it seems to be a fan favorite whenever I see it mentioned.\n\nFor a case study I want to do a super rudimentary valuation. For disclosure, this is not a robust valuation or financial advice. I'm going to eliminate as many factors as possible and try to keep it just to what we talked about and help illustrate things. I'm not putting this here as DD or an opinion on this stock.\n\nFirst things first, lets get some cash flows. For this we're not going to do anything fancy. When they were acquired by the \\[insert s word thing that shall not be named\\] they gave management forecasts and we're just going to take them at face value and extrapolate. Their projected first revenues will come in 2024 but it's nothing really material (14m FY24, 39m FY25, 260m FY26) until we get to FY27 (3.2bn). But remember, we don't care about revenues because as equity holders that's not what we receive. Looking at management's forecast, their Free Cash Flow doesn't turn positive until FY28 when it makes up \\~8.5% of revenues. So lets use this and use some really wild assumptions. I'm going to say revenues go up by 75% each year after that and FCF margins stay the same at 10% (pretty insane growth assumptions given such a capital intensive manufacturing company).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||2028|2029|2030|2031|2032|2033|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenues ($m)|6500|11,375|19,906|34,836|60,963|106,685|\n|Free Cash Flow ($m)|565|1,138|1,991|3,484|6,096|10,669|\n\nNow we need to find our terminal value as if it is at the end of 2033 looking forward. Let's assume a relatively high steady state growth of 5% (3% real growth and 2% inflation). So our figure in year 5 is 106\\*(1.05)/(.19-.05) = $133.3 billion\n\nAt first glance impressions are easy to be \"holy fuck, they're going to have $100 billion in revenue? they're generating cash flows of $150 billion?!? they're only at $15 billion market cap?? sign me the fuck up! buy buy buy!\". But let's take this all the way with step 2 of answering our \"What is this worth today?\" question.\n\nSo for this part we need to make a lot of assumptions. And this is important because equity analysts express their views often the most through not assumptions on how a company's cash flows look, but how to think about those cash flow value in present dollars.\n\nContinuing our simplification, let's keep assuming no debt involvement here (mainly bc this post is fucking long) and let's jump back to using CAPM. Let's use the below values:\n\nRrfr: 1.0%\n\nBeta: 2.0\n\nERP: 10%\n\nUsing these we can see this stock's cost of equity is \\~21.0%. It seems high, but this is expected from something with such fantastic growth being priced in to have such a high beta. TSLA for example has a beta of 2.0 and realistically a stock growing at 75% yoy in an economy growing at 3% nominally would likely have a beta much higher than that.\n\nSo using our formula's above we can now now solve for our discount factors (the 1/(1+r)\\^t numbers to multiply our cash flows by).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|\n|WACC|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|\n|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.21)^(8)|= 1 / (1.21)^(9)|= 1 / (1.21)^(10)|= 1 / (1.21)^(11)|= 1 / (1.21)^(12)|= 1 / (1.21)^(13)|\n|(DF)|0.22|0.18|0.15|0.12|0.10|0.08|\n|PV CF ($m)|141|205|296|428|619|10,686|\n\nThe sum of all the PV CF should give us what we think this stock is worth today (since no debt, this would be same as market cap, ignoring any cash balances they currently have). So we get $12.4bn. Compared to a current $15 billion market cap that's another 20% drop WITH some pretty damn rosy assumptions (and low yields). Fuck.\n\nBut that's not all.\n\nNow let's dial in new more realistic assumptions. Let's think of pre-covid life and what the norms back then were. 10 year interest rates were between 2-3% in 2018/2019 and inflation was tipping on the hot side of 2% going into end of year 2019, so a 10 year treasury at 2.5% seems a realistic norm and with a higher vol/growth stock like this we can be more realistically at a beta of 2.25. And finally let's keep our ERP and g (macro assumptions) the same.\n\nOur cost of equity is now 25% which makes our discount table look like this:\n\n|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|\n|WACC|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|\n|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.25)^(8)|= 1 / (1.25)^(9)|= 1 / (1.25)^(10)|= 1 / (1.25)^(11)|= 1 / (1.25)^(12)|= 1 / (1.25)^(13)|\n|(DF)|0.17|0.13|0.11|0.09|0.07|0.05|\n|PV CF ($m)|109|153|214|299|419|5,718|\n\nWith just a slight change in treasury yields and a slightly more realistic shift in beta, we're now talking about a market cap of $6.9bn or a 55% FURTHER DROP from current prices. Start shifting those 75%/yoy growth assumptions towards something that decelerates (a more complicated n-stage DCF that's too much to get into here) and you drop even further. A 10% deceleration yoy would bring this present value more in the $4 billion range.\n\nI'm sorry for being so long winded here, but I felt it was important to explain. In a nutshell that folks, is the power of compounding and why small shifts in a seemingly benign rate can shift massive changes in values for these growth stocks that are primarily basing their value on cash flows happening 10-15 years from now.", "id": "lyrwmq", "created_utc": 1614997308.0, "score": 583, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "Should I read deathly hallows part 1 or...", "score": 145, "replies": [{"body": "I was aiming for making a good LOTR trilogy alternate.

Cathie contends that she sees the recent volatility as a gift to gain alpha over the intended 15% return in many of her high conviction names.\n\nShe mentions that at Ark, they have a five year time horizon, and it is counter productive to compare its performance with a benchmark (like the s&p) over a shorter period. She further adds that many stocks in traditional indices today are a potential value trap, and that ark etfs \u201care a good hedge against broad based benchmarks.\u201d\n\nShe reiterates that \u201cwe are not in a bubble\u201d \u2013 and that the seeds of their 5 innovation platforms were planted in the dot com bubble, and are now ready for prime time, in a period of reality. Fear of a bubble likely stems from benchmark sensitivity and backward looking institutional investors. Furthermore, intuitions should be worried about their own strategies as \u201ccreative disruption will impact nearly 50% of the s&p500\u201d.\n\nTo Cathie, interest rates going up suggest that \u2018real growth is going to pick up\u2019 \u2013 and that she understands the concern over her own stock picks potentially underperforming as a result. However, she believes that that the market has assumed that interest rates will stabilize at a 4 to 5% range - which inversed (1/4 or 1/5) gives a normalized p/e of 20 or 25; so markets didn\u2019t actually misprice assets to begin with. She thinks that nominal growth however, will not be at 4 to 5%, but instead around 2-3%, which can lead to greater valuation support for companies that can grow more rapidly.\n\nRotation from growth to value was also expected on her part. She repeats that value will face massive headwinds going forward. Energy and financial stocks have done amazing in the past month - which is a good thing as the bull market is broadening out unlike the dot com bubble, where \u2018too much capital chased too few opportunities, too soon\u2019.

My take:\n\n- Some of it went into commodities - but not nearly enough, the bond selloff was massive.\n- Some of it rotated into US30-ish 'value' equities - but not nearly all, as both US30 fell somewhat, and tech corrected big.\n- A lot of funds came back from sovereign debt & non-USD equities to an USD base - EUR/USD dropped to 1.19, suggesting significant inflows from that direction as well.\n\nSo there's IMO a lot of cash on the sidelines right now, which wants to find an USD denominated home.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your analysis.

The discounts to get to the terminal values the next 10/15 years I used are as follows:\n\n|Year|DC|SP|PE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2021|**1.26**|$1360|272|\n|2022|**1.23**|$1714|171|\n|2023|**1.21**|$2108|124|\n|2024|**1.19**|$2551|88|\n|2025|**1.17**|$3036|55|\n|2026|**1.15**|$3552|39|\n|2027|**1.15**|$4085|34|\n|2028|**1.12**|||\n|2029|**1.10**|||\n\nAnd of course a terminal discount from 2030 and beyond of 1.09. The earnings I am predicting are $250B in 2030 and $325B in 2035, which sounds insane but that is what we're looking at here. The terminal values at these years would be $6.56T and $8.54T and the discounted value today using the table would be $1360 at the end of '21 averaging the two, although the difference between the two values is only $100 so it's pretty consistent.\n\nThe share price may do whatever it likes but I added the fair values that I'd be willing to buy at considering the fundamentals follow my projections. They may accelerate or they may be delayed, you can change the discounts to any year you'd like to account for increased risk.\n\nIf my earnings projections are correct it won't be 3 years before market has no chance but to accept the valuations, but who knows.

They are determined by discounting the terminal value each year up to the present. If you were guaranteed a bag of cash of $1000 in 2030 and you could put an option on it and you wanted 10% returns per year, you'd be paying $385 for it right now. \n\nThese are, to the best of my model, fair value prices.

{"title": "Is Someone Recreating VW w/GME?", "selftext": "Or really, does someone 'hope' they're recreating VW?\n\nCrazy conspiracy theory time!\n\nTo be clear: I work as a historian, not in finance. Please tell me in the comments why I\u2019m horribly wrong! Also, I understand many might be tired of GameStop. But with the depressing news in the rest of the market, I thought this might be a bit of fun.\n\nEveryone keeps referring to the Volkswagen short squeeze without talking about the larger event, so here\u2019s a quick reminder. On October 26th 2008, Porsche had a surprise for the stock market. They announced they\u2019d secretly been buying VW, up to where they owned 74% of the shares. Before October, they\u2019d had less than 30%. The 44% difference was a total shock to the world. The thing is, apart from Porsche, other investors closely held 25% (which also wasn\u2019t available) of VW.\n\nSo? When Porsche announced it\u2019d secretly bought all these shares, everyone realized there was actually only 1% of VW shares available. To emphasize: the short interest in VW wasn\u2019t that high, it was at 12.8%. The announcement caused a massive panic and a huge short squeeze, where VW\u2019s share price briefly vaulted from around 200 to 1000. Porsche got over $10 billion from this whole thing. They also successfully took over VW, but that's another story.\n\nWhich brings us to today. The media\u2019s been talking about GameStop like it\u2019s a David v. Goliath story, but for awhile now the amount of volume makes it more likely that it\u2019s Goliath v. Goliath. Retail investors hyped this thing up, but it seems that hedge funds really solidified the run-up in January and they're now the ones who\u2019re holding most of the shares. I get it, no one on Reddit (especially WSB) wants to hear that. But it's actually a good thing if institutional money is in the retail investors' corner. At any rate, this could explain the extreme anomaly that\u2019s been happening the past few weeks.\n\nThe larger stock market\u2019s seen a pull-back, where the majority of growth or speculative stocks have been thoroughly in the red. But at the exact same time, GME\u2019s stayed in the 100s range from Feb. 25th until now (March 6th), slowly rising. This came after a dramatic upswing from the share price being in the 40s (which happened after the collapse in early February). What could explain this continued trading range at a somewhat stable (high) price?\n\nI think a hedge fund or whale is trying to recreate the Porsche/Volkswagen event. They\u2019ve been \u2018secretly\u2019 buying up shares and simply holding them, making them unavailable. This would explain the crazy last few weeks.\n\nFor some actual numbers:\n\nTotal amount of GME shares available (as of Dec. 1, 2020): 69.75 million\n\nTop holders of GME (EDIT: these holdings are from around December/January so are outdated):\n- Fidelity Management: 13.3%\n- Ryan Cohen (RC Ventures): 12.91%\n- BlackRock: 12.17%\n- The Vanguard Group: 7.4%\n- Senvest Management: 7.24%\n- Maverick Capital: 6.68%\n- Dimensional Fund Advisors: 5.64%\n- Morgan Stanley: 4.54%\n- D.E. Shaw & Co: 4.07%\n- Susquehanna International Group: 3.57%\n\nTotal of top GME holders: 77.52%\n\nSo there\u2019s roughly 22.48% of shares \u2018available\u2019, that we know of (again, as of a few months ago, though the exact numbers don't matter). Let\u2019s say retail investors own at least 5% of this (5-10%, but I\u2019m being conservative). So that\u2019s around 17.48% shares with a big question mark by them. On top of that, GME still has a short interest of around 41.22%.\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund was \u2018pulling a Porsche\u2019. If I were them, I\u2019d announce out of the blue that they\u2019ve bought a significant proportion of the shares, and there\u2019s actually far less available than anyone had realized. If this occurred, those 41% of shorts would spontaneously panic and have a new urgency to cover. I'm saying that this could be a massive catalyst. I don\u2019t even want to try to predict a ceiling; it could be a blip, a MOASS, or anything in between.\n\nStill, who could be doing this? Any hedge fund big enough. Maybe one who hasn\u2019t said a peep about GME. But I do have an odd theory. This last part is even more speculative than the rest and I have nothing to back it up. In fact, it\u2019s insanely speculative and almost positively wrong! Still, it\u2019s fun to think about.\n\nDr. Michael Burry started much of the GME craze, though he hasn't been broadcasting his position. From SEC filings, he had 5.3% of GME shares in 2018, then sold it (apparently for a loss) in Q2 of 2019. THEN Burry bought 3,000,000 GME shares in Q3 of 2020. He once again sold all of it in Q4 of 2020 (for a very nice profit), missing the insane January run. What if, during the dip of 400 to 40, Burry rebought shares yet again? If Porsche could do it secretly, Burry\u2019s hedge fund (or a different one) likely could.\n\nSo, if my crazy theory\u2019s correct? Sometime in the next few weeks, Michael Burry of \u2018The Big Short\u2019 fame will go on CNBC and announce that he\u2019s been secretly buying up a significant stake in GME. He\u2019d make it clear that he isn\u2019t selling. Overnight, everyone will realize that there isn\u2019t 17.48% of GME shares available \u2014 there\u2019s only 1%. ...or 5%, or whatever. The precise number doesn't matter. It's about having a jolting catalyst.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m half-joking with this entire post. But I\u2019d love if it was proven true.\n\ntldr: The GME anomaly could be because some hedge fund thinks they're Porsche, and could be 'secretly' buying up GME. I'm not betting on this theory, but I do think it'd be interesting if it was the case.\n\n~~~~~\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the comments! As ra246 pointed out, Porsche becoming the majority shareholder was what made it so the shorts had to be covered. And lock2sender mentioned other various great theories of what could be happening. I completely agree with them that this anomaly is likely being caused by naked short shares or the like. But as I hadn't heard anyone say this nutty alternative theory, I figured I might as well make a post about it.\n\n~~~~~\n\nEDIT 2: Hi everyone! To be clear: many of these numbers are a few months old, as the range of the current numbers I'm seeing is insane (in that institutional ownership of GME might be far less than the 77% like I wrote, or somehow all the way up to 130%). It's outdated, I know, I can't help it. The other numbers are also approximate. That's what you get for a post written at midnight.\n\nI'm not AT ALL saying that the VW and GME situations are the same! They're extremely different, seeing as how VW was motivated by Porsche wanting to take over the company, while GME occurred due to its insane 140% short interest in Dec/Jan 2020. My silly theory is that someone (or multiple someones) out there got an idea from VW and are 'paying homage' to it, for lack of a better phrase. I'm not even saying it'd work and would produce a short squeeze (that's my main doubt about this whole thing). I think a hedge fund(s) WANTS that to occur.\n\nAs for whether or not this would be legal? Frankly, it depends. Porsche got around the laws, but those were mainly German or EU financial regulations. People affiliated with GME (like Ryan Cohen) would have to give notice about any massive buying or selling of shares. But for everyone else, the laws seem to be iffier. At any rate, as this is just a wild theory, I'll go the whole way. If there was a million dollar fine for doing this, would a hedge fund risk it to make billions? Eh...\n\nI'm also not saying to buy GameStop at this price! Personally, I'm not. I bought shares back in December and early January and am still holding some, but it's too much of a gamble at this entry point for me to add to my position.

There are the shares available to cover, this we know.\n\n1) A non insignificant percentage of the float is held by a cult of HODLers. This group are currently unaffected by FUD. Many of them think they are going to get 100k per share (\\*sigh\\*)\n\n2) A truly significant percentage of float is held by large institutional players that will only leave when their end of quarter profit taking target is in sight. The pullback in much of the market will make them just a tiny bit greedier. \n\n3) A still significant percentage of the float is controlled by mainstream investors that have seen the steady march upwards of the stock and the Media has started to lean into the Bull case on GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, now we get to the really interesting dynamics.

While I have continued to buy since mid January, I have one eye on squeeze gain potential and another eye on long terms hold for organic growth. \n\nIf I were buying or selling a business, I would look at the Multiple for the sector and apply it to earnings as a starting point. Then I would add or subtract based on underlying conditions and longevity. As the pure brick and mortar retail play, I would offer a maximum of 3x earnings, Plus assets, less liabilities, less COVID discount, less average yearly value decay ( as we see retail losing market share to online sales) , so 3x 1.9B = 5.7BX .70 (  rough guess) for COVID for a starting offer of about 4 billion and then negotiate down based on value decay from market share bleed off. **That puts the bear case at around $50-$65 per share with a downward trajectory**\n\nA more reasonable valuation would look at the turnaround efforts underway. It would also add some weight to the digital and web based revenue growth potential. Take all the same issues but add a new stream of revenue on an upward trajectory and assign an arbitrary number based on potential market share vs. strength of competitors. Here I would hope for Gamestop getting 25% of the market based on current Brand profile. I'm literally too lazy to do the math on this because the data is not right at my fingertips but let's just go with total value of Game industry in 2020 of 160B with 10% YOY growth. Assign an extremely optimistic 25% share of that market to GME and we have a 40B revenue with massive upside. Granted, cost to get there, fails and corrections, disruptive innovations etc... As this is a blue sky scenario, I would weight these changes as a small percentage of their future value. My guess is that we are really close to actual fair value right now. **Fair Value at around $160?** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bull case of $400 per share right now.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a good analysis on GMEDD with some price targets but they are outdated due to the Massive Brand Awareness event for GME, before the Exile of the CFO, before the Double Down by DFV while pointing to the bleachers during a Congressional hearing.\n\n Their Bull case target was $169 a few days before the January Gamma squeeze.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Why yes senator, my balls are absolutely enormous.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Please READ", "selftext": "I just re-edited to be less inflammatory.[Better Link to SEC Document](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)\n\nThis Friday 03/05/21 at 7:30 PM, I was surprised to see the B/A for AMC at  300/29000. So, for the first time since getting on this \u201crocket\u201d on January 27th, and entering the market in December, I went to Edgar.  AND, It just so happened, that today, AMC had filed a notice for their shareholders meeting, at which a proposal to dramatically increase the shares of issued stock, will be voted on.\n\nHere is a link to see the document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746921000518/a2243000zpre14a.htm#da47801\\_proxy\\_summary](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746921000518/a2243000zpre14a.htm#da47801_proxy_summary)\n\n[From EDGAR ](https://preview.redd.it/fdtwzenascl61.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d1eece2449a4f92a87cec51e6c154f3cb212d4d)\n\nHere's a simplified gist of the summary:\n\n1. **On January 27, 2021**, the AMC Board approved a Proposal to Amend their Certificate of Incorporation to increase the total number of shares of Common Stock they are authorized to issue an additional 500,000,000 shares to total 1,024,173,073 shares of Common Stock.\n2. **On February 24, 2021**, they filed with the State of Delaware to *retire their class B common stock,* creating the current article of incorporation which authorizes them to issue up to  500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\n3. **On March 5, 2021**,  an invitation to a shareholder meeting for **May 4, 2021** was filed with the SEC, whereupon the proposal, will be voted on.\n4. The summary contains the following accounting ***as of close of business day, March 3, 2021***:  450,156,186  Shares of Common Stock, issued and outstanding\\*\\*.\\*\\* **Shares Reserved** ***that may or may not be*** **released prior to the EIP:**  **10,920,763** shares of Common  Stock,  **63,096,124** shares (*premium 50,000,000* \\-  and *3,732,625 treasury*)\n5. *So, for the next 8 weeks,*  then the RESERVED SHARES  are what may or may not be released, I guess.\n6. On May 4, 2021 (assuming this is approved)  an additional 500,000,000  can be issued that would then total 1,024,173,073 shares.  The company may use these for private placement, public offerings, IPO's, stock splits, employee incentives, etc.\n\nCan anyone enlighten me and/or assuage my concern? My concern being contained herein the potential Adverse Effects of Certificate of Amendment:\n\n\u201cAdoption of the Certificate of Amendment will have no immediate dilutive effect on the proportionate voting power or other rights of the Company's existing stockholders. However, any future issuance of additional authorized shares of our Common Stock, at the future direction of the Board (and generally without the requirement of stockholder approval, unless specifically required by applicable law or NYSE regulation) may, ***among other things, dilute the earnings per share of Common Stock and the equity and voting rights of those holding Common Stock at the time such additional shares are issued.\u201d***\n\nONE MORE THING -- WE CAN VOTE.

The term naked shorting and counterfeit shares gets thrown a lot without a clear explanation of what it actually means. \n\nIn simple terms, think of a PS5 as a share of AMC. Sony's calling a vote and says \"hey, only people who own PS5's can vote\" - the first important thing to understand is that there isn't much confusion as to how many PS5s are there - Sony made them and keeps a running list of how many are issued. \n\nA person who short sells AMC borrows a PS5 from someone and sells it to someone else, and promises they'll give the PS5 back to the original owner at later date.

With all the bots and shills around it's second nature to start off hostile towards anyone with a different opinion, but I have respect for someone who has a different opinion and instead of saying things without any backing, or simply attacking the other person, actually tries to form a case for their side. Kudos for that. \n\nNaked shorting is \"when investors sell shorts associated with shares that they do not possess and have not confirmed their ability to possess.\" That means it doesn't change what the purchaser of the naked short receives compared to a regular short. They receive what is the equivalent of a regular share, just one that has been fraudulently generated. I get where your thinking is at with your analogy, but I think there is a disconnect in the situation with what and when the scalper/purchaser is buying and receiving: \n\nInstead of an IOU paper, you gotta think of the naked short as a fake console that looks the same, performs the same, etc. which is to be replaced once the legitimate one is acquired. Essentially the same as an IOU, but with the buyer not knowing it's an IOU (it has immediate use and rights once purchased). So as soon as the buyer purchases it, they are receiving a fake console in their hands that can do everything (same voting rights) as a real one. In your example, when someone buys a pre-ordered PS5 from a scalper, they don't get the benefits of the console until it is acquired by the scalper and in their hands. \n\nSony realizes this is all happening and doesn't like that a third party is illegally increasing the amount their product out there. So to catch them, they call a vote to see if they should build a new factory that has the ability to produce 5,000,000 PS5's in 2 months, and say that anyone with a PS5 can have a vote. To make sure the number of voters will equal the official number of PS5's released out there, they will have to do a recount of all the PS5's. Not knowing what they are holding is a fake PS5 instead of a real one, they are counted in as well. But when they do, Sony as expected realizes that there are more PS5's than there are supposed to be. They investigate and when they come across the fraudulent PS5's, they track them back to the seller and those sellers get in major trouble for creating a counterfeit product that they claim has the same rights as a real one. They can't create PS5's that hold the same rights as a PS5 because they are not Sony, even though they were eventually planning on taking them out and replacing them with an official one once they thought they could get their hands on it cheap. So it's either buy at market price to replace the fakes, or get caught distributing fakes and get in big shit - that's how Sony will fuck over the scalpers. If these scalpers know that this vote is coming, they will need to acquire legitimate PS5's to replace their fake ones before the count happens to avoid being caught, no matter the cost at the time of the real PS5. This is why some are predicting that these naked shorts are going to have to cover prior to the vote to avoid being exposed. \n\nObviously a simplified version, and in the real version the scalpers are very smart, albeit very arrogant, people.

In BJ, you come to a point where if you generally lose 5% back to the house, you are then in a downward swing and should walk. Stocks are similar once they pass the value of the company and it becomes a casino. You know GME isn't a 1T company, so there comes a point at which the money becomes SO HIGH that you should consider exiting. YES you could be leaving money on the table, an unfortunate problem, on the other hand, you could wind up like TSLA where you get wiped out.

{"title": "The TSLA bubble has finally popped", "selftext": "Good morning fellow Daddy Musk fans, it's time we talk about what's  happening with TSLA and why it's happening.\n\nAs many of you are by now  aware TSLA has been in free fall for the past month blasting through  multiple \"support levels\" and leaving a **trail of loss porn** behind. Now you may be wondering why your OTM weekly calls are  going to zero week after week and I'm here to tell you it's not going to  get better.\n\nLet's take a journey aboard the modern day EV Titanic known as TSLA.\n\n**Disclaimer: This is fan fiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place, not financial advice.**\n\nBefore you blast my ass how TSLA shorts have been fucked every single time during the past years I'll explain to you why **this time it's different**. I'll start with a late 2019 quote from our autistic uncle Dr. Michael Burry.\n\n*\"Passive investing has removed price discovery from the equity markets.\"*\n\nWhat  does this mean? Well, the quote applies to the overall market but in  the case of TSLA it means actively managed mutual funds with TSLA long  positions have been replaced by passive index funds and ETFs. Passive  funds have overtaken active mutual funds market share in the past 2  years. How the fuck does this relate to price discovery? It means for  the past 2 years retards and degenerates like us have been piling money  onto ETFs like Mommy Cathie's ARKK without actually doing any DD on what  turds the ETF is actually holding. I know, the gains have been  impressive with CNBC and Bloomberg praising Cathie's ETFs to the fucking  moon. Fair enough, however let's take our lips off **Cathie's tits** for a second and look at what ARKK is actually holding.\n\nHere's the punch line (taken from a random tweet yesterday):\n\n**Top  10 ARKK companies have a combined market cap of $1200B with revenues of $76B and  earnings of $2.5B. If it was a single company it would be trading at  480x earnings, 16x sales with a profit margin of 3,3%.**\n\nLet that shit sink in before we move on.\n\nNow back to the situation at hand. ARKK is down 25% in the past month and so are the other **simp funds** trying to ride **Mommy Cathie's ass**  to the moon. Outflows from the ETF have accelerated in the recent  month, which will cause Cathie to sell off her overvalued babies and dump  them onto the street with TSLA being the biggest and most overvalued  stock she's holding with a weight of 9,99% of ARKK. The outflows may  cause overall liquidity issues for her fund, [/u/seldomsage](https://www.reddit.com/u/seldomsage/) wrote a great post about this shit on [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) . Go read that shit to understand what's about to happen.\n\nLet's leave the **certified GILF** alone and jump into a hot tub time machine back to December 2020. Our **gay uncle Burry**  came out of the closet early December last year and stated he's  shorting TSLA. Why? Well he recognized active players on TSLA had gotten  out and short interest was extremely low (limiting any short squeeze  risks, I believe it was around 5% of float). I believe after reading the  \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b erotica uncle Burry has been tweeting for the past months, the **cocaine nosed HF suits**  on Wall Street started to pile onto his TSLA short. You can clearly see  this in TSLA options chain, the put/call ratio and spiking short  volume. It seems right now everyone and their retarded cousin is  shorting TSLA. This will lead to a cycle where TSLA goes down, ETFs  holding TSLA will go down, outflows from ETFs will continue and TSLA  will go down even more. Thus, there's a chance TSLA will drag down the  overall market with it.\n\nIn addition here's a list of smooth brained arguments why I think TSLA is still going down.\n\n1. The **P/E is still 938**. No fund manager with an IQ above 80 will touch this stock at these prices.\n2. The stock is at **$597 a piece**. Most of us work at Wendy's and don't have the cash to buy a single share.\n3. Call options are **expensive as fuck**, again, Wendy's.\n4. TSLA stopped taking orders for entry level Model Y. Together Model 3 and Model Y account for **90% of TSLA sales**.\n5. **Lithium shortage**, probably related to point 4.\n6. Ford and Volkswagen. Particularly **Ford Mustang Mach-E**, which started eating away TSLA market share.\n7. The  jig is up. Selling flamethrowers and tweeting memes wont make TSLA  profitable any time soon, eventually the market will go back to the  fundamentals and realize that TSLA is actually just a car company with **low profit margins**.\n\nLastly I'm not saying TSLA is a bad company or that the products are bad. In fact I think they're making **great products**, the company is just **BIGLY** overvalued at this point.\n\nRelated positions:\n\n\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b TSLA puts ranging from $300P to $20P.\n\nHave a great weekend and good luck next week!", "id": "lyzcxu", "created_utc": 1615028578.0, "score": 493, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 393, "comments": [{"body": "20p?

Laws and regulations for self driving cars and major infrastructure changes to support EV will likely be difficult. By that time the R&D from their competitors will have had time to catch up. They could easily lose their first mover advantage. Their competitors also already have the manufacturing facilities and supply chain in place.

These means they're opened up to a new risk because \"short swing\" profits (profits gained if you sell your shares within 6 months) can legally have to be returned to the company if you sell.

Which could cause significant problems in and of itself.   \n\n\nThis is all becoming an issue because of really recent outflows that will force selling some holdings and such. It's really complicated and I haven't got my head around it all yet but effectively it means bad news for ARK.  \n\n\nThe implications for Tesla are clearer, it could mean that if ARK starts to sink for it's own structural issues it might start liquidating a lot of it's Tesla share which atm would look like selling off something like  1,860,000,000 USD's worth of Tesla (given that it's around 600ish and they own 3.1m shares) which would totally slaughter Tesla's value.

If that's the projection that you're going with, even if we ignore the various limitations of electric vehicles that will continue for the foreseeable future, then Tesla is considerably overvalued for what it is and price will have to be brought back to realistic territory. \n\nUnless Tesla can keep a hold on at least 40-50% of the global EV market, which is unlikely given general market concentration breakdowns of car manufacturing, then it's value is going to collapse. I brought up Cisco earlier I think, and I think that's a really fair comparison. It was a great company, with great prospects and a great future but it was massively overvalued. Tesla has a resilient brand and I believe will be player in the US EV market certainly, I think Europe will probably end up favouring European and Asian brands in the long run but Tesla will still keep some market share.

I think the main driver is the increased competition, VW has been involved in EV research since the 1970s and tested it's first electric car in 1972 and were producing low-volume commercial EVs and playing around with hybrids from the 1990s. I don't think the same gap between European manufacturers and what Tesla offered existed as between Tesla and American manufacturers. Really, until the last few years if you'd asked me about EVs I probably would've talked about VW. In absence of that perception gap, I think a lot of people in European markets are willing to trust and value established brands rather than this strange American interloper who's offering what feels like a new type of a familiar product, that thing with European car companies have been trying to push for awhile.\n\nPlus, i'll not lie but a lot of continental Europeans (basically the Germans and French) often have a pretty snobbish attitude towards the Americans and American products.

Then another \u201ccorrection\u201d happens and we curse our retardation and possibly even get out of the market by:\n\n1. **choice**\n2. **liquidation**\n3. **BASE jumping without a parachute**\n\n**Please do not do #3**. We\u2019ve all had that feeling, sick to your stomach and dreading having to tell your kids, parents, wife, her boyfriend etc. that you fucked up and will be living behind Wendy\u2019s for a while. It will get better if you actually learn from your mistake.\n\nFirst things first. When stocks are dipping or crashing, all the experienced gamblers here are telling you to BUY! BUY! BUY! It does make sense since prices are (subjectively) low. But you can\u2019t because the drop in the market left you with **NO BUYING POWER**! In fact, you\u2019re having to sell off. Why? Let\u2019s go back to how this all started \\[*record screeching, rewind button effect*\\]\n\nGreen candles as far as you can see. You are in a land of plenty.

Resist the urge to buy more and more bananas because know this for a fact\u2026 **this upside WILL END** and you will repeat the sins of the past.\n\n**SELL**: Don\u2019t wait to shoot the moon on every stock. When you\u2019re showing a moderate profit and you\u2019re not using the derivative for covered calls, etc, sell it. **Take your profit like the big boys**. You see it over and over. Huge green candles are followed by a pull back. If not, oh well. Could\u2019ve had more. Grow the fuck up and be happy you got something. If you\u2019re investing, that\u2019s another story for another sub (*I don\u2019t EVER touch my IRAs and keep them mostly in SPY, QQQ, DIA to great effect over the last two decades*).\n\n**HEDGE**: For downside protection there are two main ways -- buy puts for the main index funds, DIA, SPY, QQQ, and, if you sell puts, for fuck\u2019s sake **buy a lower strike put** to protect yourself from a crash. That saved my ass the last days on NIO. If you need more info on how to properly hedge just ask. This community may be retarded, but they are smart retards. As you advance, you can learn about sQQQ etc. Baby steps first, though.\n\n*Did you keep a stash from your profits when things were good*? *And you protected yourself so your buying power didn\u2019t go into the red when dips, corrections or crashes happen*?

{"title": "AMC next week\u2019s OMG momentum", "selftext": "REPOST - Hey all, 2900 ITM Holding. Not Your Financial Advisor. \n\nThis coming week 8th-12th is set up to be huge. I\u2019ll tell you why in 20 important seconds. But first...\n\nNo May 4th\u2019s shareholder vote on 500M Class A stocks being created does not affect the squeeze. \n- Class A are not traded on the open market. They are designed to provide the holder greater voting power (each share is worth more than 1 vote portion) keeping control in the hands of the company and not a institutional buyer looking to have too much power.  These also hold dividend priority and liquidity preference, not what has been shorted. The notice comments that this will not have any immediate affect of dilution. \n- Class A are largely used to help position a favoured potential parent company in such a way that the merger or acquisition is certain to occur. This could be a indicator of a possible Amazon or other takeover. \n- These shares won\u2019t hit the market until months after the squeeze is squoze (not sure if that\u2019s a word). May 4 is vote, takes time to ratify vote, board has to vote when they do want to add shares and by how many, SEC filings, private offering... historically 4-6 months if they wanted to put them out right away... but they use language suggesting no urgency. \n\n\ud83d\udcc4[SEC Filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)for those that want to fall asleep or otherwise don\u2019t believe me. \n\n\nOk, so now that your heart rate has dropped a little and you are HOLDING and a good little \ud83e\udd8d, let\u2019s discuss this coming week.\n\nMarch 8 - Market closed above $8 again Friday so there are more options ITM to be purchased. This adds about 11M to the existing 14M (less since purchased) shares to be bought. We saw a nice spike the other day when one of the firms had to involuntarily settle some positions. Once a few positions have to be settled at the same time we\u2019ll see a huge steep incline which will put the hedges into a musical chairs situation. No a steep incline won\u2019t be a steep decline as well (so why don\u2019t they just wait) because we apes won\u2019t be selling for a few $ profit when we can sell for many $$$$ profit. \n\nMarch 9 - FINRA Full Short Interest Report released. This will confirm the heavily shorted position on this stock which will fuel speculations of scarcity which could prompt the hedges to settle some (not all) positions. \n\nMarch 10 - AMC Q4 2020 and Annual Report (after hours). There is no surprise that they will have to report losses but they are forecasted to report fewer losses than expected which is technically gaining ground. The CEO was on yesterday (Friday) on a few shows and handled himself wonderfully including not being trapped into condemning us apes.  Not his words; \ud83e\udd8d = Loyal Supporters. He also confirmed the Wanda situation was an agreement and not any confidence shake up.  Remember that almost every company sees a lot of selling on earnings day, it\u2019s just not good investing to hold a heavy position in something on earnings. We will see some dips before and after the reporting but not as much since most shares are owned by us apes and institutional buyers which are required to hold for 90 days (most were purchased less than 30 days ago). \n\nMarch 11 - Expect a lot of business savvy \ud83e\udd8ds to be buying up the dip as well as a lot of position settling to occur as they hope to take advantage of what is likely to be the floor price (not lowest yet) moving forward. This date represents a stock price that will have all new information factored into it. There isn\u2019t another earnings report due for 3 more months and by then the theatres are back at 100% and the hedges have long since paid us. \n\nMarch 12 - Expect by this date the Short Borrow Fee rate to rival that of your MasterCard.

{"title": "$BB \ud83c\udf47", "selftext": "BB DD on news and speculative figures that don't allow for the proper analytical price targets on this undervalued stock.\n\nFirst of all BlackBerry has been through quite a number of deals within the last two years. Let's list some of these key partners and deals that have been made with said companies.\n\n1. Baidu\n2. Amazon\n3. Facebook\n4. Huawei\n5. Google\n6. Nearly every tier 1 automotive manufacturer (research brands yourself)\n7. Motional\n8. Nvidia\n9. Aptiv\n\nBut aside from these listed driving forces that will provide slowly increasing revenue within the next quarters along with the mission critical equipment they are already installed in. I specifically want to point out why you can't put a logical price target on BB today.\n\nThree deals in particular.\n\n1. The Huawei deal containing the sale of 90 phone patents not only shows a key pivotal point for BB going all in on software and successfully selling overhanging assets, but also this deal remains undisclosed giving us no solid analysis but instead are left with speculation on the price of this deal with a company that has very deep pockets.\ud83d\ude80\n2. The Facebook lawsuit is one that I have monitored since the filling. Not only was BlackBerry looking for payment for damages from the loss of their BBM platform to Messenger using it's stolen IP. But they also were never looking for a cash payout but instead they were seeking royalties. This deal remains undisclosed leaving us with no real idea of the possibilities within this deal except that once again Facebook is massive and so was the adoption of FB messenger.\ud83d\ude80\n3. Last but not least the deal with Amazon. This deal has a lot of speculation ranging from BlackBerry's already created asset management tracking devices as well as the possibilities of it's QNX operating system. They could leverage the asset tracker as well as the QNX platform for driverless delivery services and also drone delivery services because it will likely be required to run on a mission critical platform. Once again this deal is undisclosed.\ud83d\ude80\n\nTL;DR: DD about why the price targets are not positioned correctly for this company. You cannot put a fair price target on a company with 3 massive undisclosed deals.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "lz61vn", "created_utc": 1615050549.0, "score": 247, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "2200 at $8\n\nCan\u2019t fucking wait to load up on more if this dip continues.", "score": 98, "replies": [{"body": "gravy boat", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06832049787044525}, {"body": "10x the amount I do bby.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15939079225063324}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20367814600467682}, {"body": "Absolutely nothing is able to move the stock.

Watch the VZ movement as they are first at 3 today as a bellwether.\n\nLove ya \ud83d\ude18\n\n**3/10 Pre-Market Update**\n\nI kept more GE then DKNG. That\u2019s the way she goes. \n\nLooks like it could a good day for picks though. I\u2019m getting my vaccine and got a bunch of real work today but I\u2019ll pop in if I can before the close. \n\n**One more 3/9 Update**\n\nDon\u2019t forget T TMUS and VZ all have investor days this week. Let\u2019s go 5G \ud83d\ude80 \n\n**3/9 update AH:**\n\nGlad I called for that profit take PM. The day got tough for our Tier 1 but what could be expected after those starts out the gate I suppose. Tier 2 banged. \n\nI don\u2019t see myself doubling down on the Mouse. Got in got out. \n\nI still have a couple fliers on DKNG. I wanna see if we can squeak out some upgrades after the event. \n\nI still have April GE. It may get rocky but I like the trend. \n\nI\u2019m an idiot and passed on the SQ dip \ud83e\udd21 \n\nPS **next week won\u2019t be any less volatile with FOMC coming.** For those who asked if you should take profits a) I\u2019m a greedy fuck often so I\u2019m probably not the best gauge lol and b) if you\u2019re considering it you *know* the answer in your heart of hearts. If you even think about taking them, that right there is your brain giving you the delineation between profit and greed. Take dat shit (you\u2019re still a paper handed weenie, but take it). \n\nOk gg assault the mouse. Here\u2019s to another one tomorrow \ud83c\udf7b \u270c\ufe0f \n\n**Update 3/9 mid day**\n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve got to take time out of my busy day to drive to Burbank and assault a fictional mouse. A bet is a bet though. \n\n**UPDATE 3/9 PM**\n\n**1) Don\u2019t let all this hype distract you** from the fact I chose FSLY and CRM back to back weeks \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\n**2) I\u2019m taking majority profits on the open** and letting a couple trailers fly, I don\u2019t trust this market as far as I can throw it. \n\n**3) don\u2019t be greedy kings and queens**. Nobody ever went broke taking profits. \n\n**Update: 3/8 closing bell**: I\u2019ll probably have more to say later, currently working on a web project with RAMBOs in addition to my real job has been...taxing lol. But in general:\n\nVery happy with Tier 1 performance out the gate as a whole. The DKNG round trip was a bit disappointing, but I can live with that price movement when the DAQ shits 2%, and I\u2019m holding. \n\n**Update 3/8 6:38 AM**: Just below or at $60 seems to be the buy level for $DKNG\n\nI\u2019m in. Let\u2019s ride. 65c 3/19 \ud83c\udfb2\n\n**Update 3/8 PM 6:00 AM**: don\u2019t chase the picks off the open, let that price action settle for a decent entry.  \n\n**Update 3/7 5:00 PM**: it would seem GE read the DD and decided to front- run us by releasing big news this afternoon. I\u2019m kidding. But am I?\n\n[GE nears deal to sell air leasing unit to AerCap](https://twitter.com/financialtimes/status/1368723194417459202?s=21)\n\n****\n\n*R.A.M.B.O. is what I call Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.

Review of last week and lessons learned.**\n \n**Last Week\u2019s Multibagger (s)**: [EPD was a 300% play with entries and exits timed right](https://i.imgur.com/Aw4DhDW.jpg), **DOCU** RAMBO was a day 1 hit if you sold after the event pop  \n\n**Last Week\u2019s Mid-week multi-bagger**: began pumping **OPEC+ & XOM RAMBO** in the updates mid-week.\u00a0 That flow was correct, and boy oh boy was oil a gusher. XOM COP etc printed. \n\n**Last Week\u2019s Duds**: Literally everything else that was in tech.\u00a0 Just brutal. I failed there thinking the tech dump was over and got tricked by the Monday dead cat. \n\nThe real meat is in the losses, so let\u2019s see what we learned in the tech breadline and how we\u2019ll apply it this week. \n\n**Key Lesson Learned 1**: In volatile times when the trend is against the sector, **we want to stick with RAMBO and UOA that is company-specific (Investor/Analyst Day) rather than chasing conferences and meetings**.\u00a0 If tech is dumping its brains out, for example, the CFO of CRM giving a speech at a random conference has the efficacy of tears in the rain.\u00a0 Very tough but very useful lesson, and sorry to those who got completely rinsed on those lesser tech RAMBOs.  \n\n**Key Lesson Learned 2**: When it comes to sectors, the **trend is your friend**.\u00a0 The news predictions coming out regarding OPEC+ were doomsday, [but I kept seeing large bets placed on oil giants from Monday to Wednesday](https://imgur.com/a/6HIWA7X/).\u00a0 I decided to trust where the money was going, not what the news was predicting.\u00a0 This, coupled with my basic research knowledge from last month that the Saudi\u2019s have truly embraced the pump, was enough to zig when the news zagged.\u00a0 **There are a million reasons why news leaks could lead you to go one way, but around here we ALWAYS watch where the money, not where the manipulated headlines go.**\n\n**PLEASE NOTE THE DATES**. Don\u2019t buy calls Monday for an event listed Friday then hit me with the surprised Pikachu face if it\u2019s red through Tuesday lol \n\nWith another week under our belt and those lessons learned in mind, let\u2019s get to work.  \n\n****  \n\u00a0 \n**CONFIDENCE SYSTEM**: I\u2019m going to split this week\u2019s picks up into high confidence near term plays, and further out plays.\u00a0\u00a0  \n\n**Plays that have U.O.A. (unusual options activity), are company-specific, and near-dated** will get 3 rockets.  \n\n**Plays that have two of those factors get two rockets**, and I will specify what they have.  \n\n**Plays that have one of those factors or,\u00a0 more likely, are further out will be placed in our \u201cwatch bin\u201d and get a sands of time emoji**.\u00a0 This indicates these are plays that will be benificial, but you really gotta wait for entry.  \n\n****\n\n**Tier 1: Company-sponsored events this week with UOA**\n\n[DKNG](https://i.imgur.com/dJNmDYU.jpg)\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nClassic post-ER setup we spoke about in last week's DD.

I have seen some bearish put hedges sneak through, too, so maybe sell a call/buy a poot against the position or play the strike tight, in case they give an insanely bleak outlook related to theme parks that the news runs with.\n\n*Note: Being that I live in Los Angeles, I will personally drive over to their Burbank studios and punch mouse in the face if this doesn\u2019t play out.*\n\n****\n\n**Tier 2: Meeting and conference presentations the next two weeks with intriguing UOA**\n\n[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/RgAE1hG.jpg)\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nOTM call activity and speaking at the Wolfe FinTech Forum on 3/9. https://investors.squareup.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Wolfe-FinTech-Forum/default.aspx\n\nTier 2 because it's not SQ's event, but instead a conference.

Between SQ and TWTR, Jack is absolutely dripping in pump rn and I think the party keeps going here. \n\nPS- I've had Tidal ever since it was a free one year offering on my cell phone plan.

In 2020 this would be a SPY pump, but **recent treasuries activity indicates that the market seems to be reacting to good news by trying to see into the future**.  As more and more bullish news for the actual ECONOMY rather than the MARKET comes out, it has the potential to be bearish, as MMs move money in anticipation of rising interest rates, yields, and the eventual Fed rates increase and Quantitative Easing tapering )even though Powell swears not to.)\n\nSo, ya know, be careful out there. **Wait for index direction to sort in the morning before diving all in**.

{"title": "\ud83d\ude80 PLTR, Palantir WILL moon \ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "I will just tell you why. also the friday news of Palantir with AWH is a $SNOW killer, bye snowflake and boomer buffett\n\n1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defence sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.\n\nA real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.\n\n2) Just last friday, there were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN  to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.\n\n3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesnt make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.\n\n4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realise and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.\n\n5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, dont forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.\n\n6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet.She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.\n\n7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.\n\n8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?\n\n9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.\n\n10) Dont forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the 4Q earnings\n\n11)  If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, i see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)\n\n12) It's ok that the some retards dont join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.\n\nPLTR, a baby of Cathie Wood & Alex Karp.  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80TLDR: PLTR  \ud83d\ude80 , buy PLTR.", "id": "lz9iwc", "created_utc": 1615060089.0, "score": 821, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 287, "comments": [{"body": "Is anyone else here retarded enough to have a 33 cost basis and 80K sunk into this???

I am probably hallucinating.  **Med Status = Not taken**.  You shouldn't ever by any means listen to anything I have to say or take this at all as recommendation to invest.  I am currently a brain in a jar being deceived by a Cartesian demon. I am not even real...\n\nEdit 12 - If you want to skip to the **money shot** [find the psycho-tier options ladder discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzd9js/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_goev_aka/gq5rnbz?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)\n\nEdit 15 - We were wrong on the math... The money shot is good but its not go to prom in a helicopter good... Its show up in your dads WRX with in a mexican suit, hair slicked back sunglasses indoors good...  Either way you're still going to get laid....\n\nEdit 4 - You read something I write that's wrong, Call me out.\n\nI own a share and 25 15$ 4/16 calls\n\n**$GOEV needs no introduction.**  It is a pig of a stock that has burned many... many hands... Had I the will or desire to put this thing I would be a rich man... however I was a wide eyed, impressionable STONK Noob .. always looking for that dose of Hopium. I looked up its website, when I saw its futuristic products I thought of the Star before the TREK, I thought of 3d Jetsons, A brave new world... I bought hard into the Apple car myth and gladly with a smug expression YOLO'd away a few K of hard earned money into some 30 dollar calls that sat hopeless on my account bringing nothing but misery and sadness... I bought these calls at a few dollars!!!!  An albatross of shame... Even the GOEV reddit is full of embarrassing cope posting offering nothing and taking every last shred of dignity.....**(Edit 7 : the Canoo one is much better)** Being long in GOEV is like being a eunuched Tesla bro... All whisky no dick..  All hat no cattle...\n\n**But no longer!** **my friends no longer...**\n\nYou will come to understand that I am **UNCONCERNED** about the current SP.\n\nIt is only a meal ticket to golden palaces and walkways paved with diamonds... no ice.\n\n# The quick Stats -\n\n**Origin Story -** GOEV SPACed into existence DEC 2020 on Nasdaq.  Ulrich Kranz -  The CEO built the BMW Z3, x5 and the Mini and led BMW's \"project I\" and is balls deep in the automotive world.  They are advising Hyundai on their EV vehicles and creating their own with a subscriber model.  Their main addition to this crowded space is the \"Skateboard\" style drive train that you can build on top of... Fly by wire functionality allows designing all sorts of awesome things.... Oh and the \"You will own nothing and be happy about it\" car subscription which is like leasing but probably even worse...\n\n**The Myth** \\- **Apple car**... Probably not happening... But they talked to CANOO!@#@! Canoo and Hyundai/Kia are in bed together... they gotta be part of it. I Saw nothing but money $$ bills and convinced some of my friends that absolutely there would be an apple car ad for the superbowl. I didn't even care about the game... I couldn't wait.... When that failed to drop I told myself... \"They were totally acting like an apple partner, not tweeting, its smart... be silent, they are going to drop news any day now... Apple Rumors bro...  I got addicted to copium.... Every day was just another opportunity to buy the dip...\n\nI woke up.. strung out... Eyes bleary red, shirt untucked, tie askew I hadn't shaved for weeks... Shambling around at work muttering \"Apple partner, they're silent... Its a good thing....  Cheaper now... Its on sale... Hold forever.... New tesla... You can't tell me I'm drunk, thats my decision...\"\n\nI got burned on this one kiddos.... Turned me to the dark side... I learned about Puts...\n\nI felt my power RISING.... I got into Ortex... I troll on Stocktwits.. I enjoy the suffering... I owned the world, the streets were full of blood and I was their king...\n\nSo while many of you were crying I went shopping in the trashcan last Friday and took a sarcastic look at $GOEV again...\n\n**What I found was beautiful.**\n\nI felt something stir... was it hope?  Was there something here?  Can I believe again?  Is there anything good left in this world?\n\nYou tell me...\n\n# Some Important numbers\n\n# Float: 235.6 Million\n\n**Free Float - 53 percent (120 million)**\n\n**Short Shares on Loan 6.94 Million**\n\n# Short Utilization - 99.7 percent let me say that again 99.7 percent of the shares available to loan are loaned!\n\n# Ortex predicts short interest 8.4 Million Shares!\n\n# More than 100% utilization! Naked Shorting!\n\n^(Edit 13 - \\^\\^Probably legal)\n\n*Edit 2: I originally said 100% Short Interest but meant* ***utilization*** *thanks* /u/SheriffVA *for pointing out the typo...*\n\n**DTC is 1.4!!!**\n\nBy my  estimates (Ortex numbers) shorts are short from 17 to 20 as we see a spike in short activity at those prices... the SP of 11 is currently well below the 20day moving average...  SP of 18 will create a squeeze...\n\n# The play\n\nMarch 11th at 1:40 Pm there will be a press announcement by Canoo who is attending the prestigious Motor Press Guild's Virtual Event.   Canoo promised a manufacturing partnership announcement Q1... Who else is there... let me see **Jeep Honda Acura Toyota VW Infinity**... and **Fisker** which develops EV's but higher end luxo models... Canoo and Fisker don't need to compete...\n\n**But brotherluminous EV cars are a bubble?**\n\nYou're a bubble... Should they announce a top tier manufacturing agreement that revalues the company all the money in the other parts of the bubble will flood in and then it will be gucci bubble palace and fat stacks of Tendie gains...  what better time to do it than during a press event at an industry magazine...\n\nEdit - 13  Canoo is world premiering their pick up truck... I don't know which way this will go...\n\nI predict an old fashioned Short squeeze as Shorts will be trapped at **17 - 20** and **the SP will be on mars somewhere looking for the keys to its electric Lambo...**\n\n# Do you want an electric lambo?  I do...\n\n# I'll see you at the dealership...\n\nNo more cope posting $GOEV bros.. Only tendies now...\n\n^((Lesson of the day kids... Don't believe the schizos on the internet, believe in the voice only you can hear...) )\n\nEdit 1- [https://u.teknik.io/Wy7Mm.png](https://u.teknik.io/Wy7Mm.png) Ortex Screenshot\n\nEdit 3 -  So perhaps some expectation management.  With an estimated 8million shares being sold short there will be a noticeable impact to the SP of a squeeze... Will we see GME?, **probably not**, It will be more like $RKT with portfolios being liquidated into the AH robo-buying the ask.. If we are lucky enough to get a 25-30 sp. **I fucked up and held some $RKT calls overnight the day of the fappening, don't be like me...**  There will be a certain number they will defend and open up more short positions from.  **It all depends on the DV presented by the company Thursday.**  Should there be a reason to revalue the company then we win... Should it just be a showcase and nothing Materially different offered then... well that sucks for everyone involved... In fact.. much like earnings calls most people buy the hype and sell the news... there will be no expectation that this will be different than that...\n\nBut look, If they bust on the stage with The Canoo-UBEREATS-Amazon Party VAN drone Apple Car complete with integrated Pornhub socket... And you diamond handed that shit.... Giddyup\n\nEdit 5 - There's a good conversation about the warrants going on in arrr slash Canoo...\n\nEdit 6 - Thought I\u2019d point this out \u2014 Canoo has a lot of recent job listings opened based on google search.
