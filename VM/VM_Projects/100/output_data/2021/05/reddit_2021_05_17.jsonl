Sorry, couldn't resist the joke.\n\n> Put Credit Spread with short leg ITM long leg OTM. Here my loss would be the difference between premium received for short leg minus value of leg at expiry and the long has no bearing unless I manually close it before the bell\n\nThis is understated for the general case. A short put delivers cash and receives shares. The shares have to settle (T+2) before you can do anything with them (but see note below), so there is further risk the shares will lose value before you can liquidate them. Since the short put was ITM on a decline in the underlying, further decline is more likely than a reversal.\n\nNote: Some brokers will give you a float on the settlement time and let you net out the delivered cash vs. shares, so YMMV. Also, specifically for SPX or other cash settled options, this delay in settlement is not an issue, since there aren't any shares. You just pay the net cash difference immediately.\n\n> Put Debit Spread with long leg ITM would be equal to the net cost of option minus the value of option at expiry with the short leg having not bearing on the outcome unless I again closed it manually.\n\nAgain, understated for the general case. An ITM long put that is exercised by exception delivers shares and receives cash. Where do the shares come from? Not from the short put, that expired worthless. So you have to obtain shares to fulfil the exercise of the long put. Your broker may sell shares short to do that. So you get cash from the exercise and cash from the short sale (and cash from the sell to open of the short put leg), but have to cover the short shares at some point. If the underlying goes up in price before you cover, you could end up covering for more money than all the cash you collected combined.\n\nAlso, you should write \"net cost of the spread\", rather than net cost of the option. It's less confusing that way.\n\nSPX and cash settled options would just net cash, no shares to short. So for the cash settled case, expiring at a price between your strikes isn't that bad. It's just slightly worse that both legs being ITM.\n\n> I am looking at the risks involved in expiry because I do not want to risk the PDT strikes from closing before expiry as much as possible.\n\nA better way to avoid PDT is don't trade the same options on the same day. Bet on a lot of different horses. The 0 DTE strategy risk/reward isn't worth the additional risk of trying to dodge PDT. You should have more than $25k cash in your account anyway, if you are trading SPX 0 DTE.

It's a myth that secrecy increases alpha, at least over the long term. Sure, inside information could give you a temporary edge, but you aren't going to maintain that edge for 50 years, unless the SEC really is asleep at the wheel. Alpha is just hard, and the longer and more consistently positive alpha needs to be maintained, the harder it is.\n\nThe most reliable edges are small on a per trade or per dollar basis, so you have to make up the difference in volume.

Current price of the contract, $23.\n\nOK what if instead of $350p he had $500p for same expiration?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/QUFbAj3](https://imgur.com/a/QUFbAj3)\n\nPrice of $500p was $130 on 12/2 while current price of the contract is $74.\n\n$1000P? Same story. Severely underwater.\n\nOnly possible way for Burry to be profitable on puts is if he bought them 90%++ of them in the last 2 weeks only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can also just short sell shares as well. So let's say he short sold at $570. Well current stock price is $570, so that means he's at even, assuming 0% in borrowing cost (just for simplicity).\n\nOnly way Burry would be profitable on his short trade would be if he heavily DCA-d in when TSLA climbed up to $900, which is possible but he would have had to DCA significantly to be in the green after the stock has dropped 40% now already.\n\nI made this digging just to caution the people who may think \"OMFG Burry must be up huge\". \n\nBy my guess, Burry is actually deep in the red, especially if he went short through puts instead of shares.

There is no underlying value. Its purely driven by supply and demand. So when the price of BTC increases, people tend to jump onto the band wagon and drive it even higher. If the price falls, scared people bail and drive the price down. Its a **positive** feedback loop. But because there is no underlying value, there is no counter force.\n\nTake as a contrast TSLA, or any other stock. On small movements, the stock price is equally based on sentiment as crypto is. There is not much difference. However, if you look at larger price swings, there comes the underlying value in play. If the price rises too much, the market valuation of the company might outpace its true value, causing professionals to sell the stock and take profit. If the price drops too low, the market valuation is below the true worth of the company and professionals start to buy. This is a **negative** feedback loop.\n\nThe positive feedback loop is destabilizing, the negative feedback loop is stabilizing. By design, crypto does not has a negative feedback loop. So there is no price range where it would naturally stabilize. Thats why people are soooooo touchy on the topic and salty with Musk. The holdings of Tesla are small compared to the total available BTC, but because there is no negative feedback loop, even the small turbulence caused by Musk in the crypto sphere is a huge thing and can cause BTC to crash big time.\n\nSo there you have it, BTC is inherently unstable and based purely on sentiment.

Some of these people appeared to be very confident and authoritative.\n\nPerhaps Elon was similarly persuaded by these arguments, to the extent that he was willing to give Bitcoin a try, test it out as something Tesla could use. After all, solar and wind are now the lowest cost sources of new utility-level energy, so it could be argued that if increased popularity of Bitcoin led to greater demand and increased mining, people would choose solar or wind as their new sources of energy.\n\nTesla bought Bitcoin, apparently OK. They sold a little bit as a test to see if it would crash the market, apparently OK. But what Elon and some green energy Bitcoin enthusiasts may have not have sufficiently taken into account is that in the short term, a sudden increase in demand can be met by burning more fossil fuels and still be profitable for mining Bitcoin, and this short-term surge overwhelms the installation of new solar/wind which takes time.\n\nSeeing this unintended consequence that he had perhaps not sufficiently expected, with new fossil fuel burning taking a larger share of the new energy consumption compared to new green energy than he had expected, Elon's attitude toward Tesla's near-term use of Bitcoin changed.\n\nI would have preferred that Tesla did not get into Bitcoin at this time, as it appears to me to be too early to think of it as primarily a user of green energy, but I think I can see his line of reasoning.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> This has been well known for a long time.

The issue is not whether Elon was aware that a lot of Bitcoin generation is powered by burning coal - I was certainly aware of it, and expect Elon was too. The more relevant issue is whether an increase in demand for Bitcoin is met more by burning more coal or by setting up more green energy sources. There have been a lot of sincere and convincing people going around making the case that new demand for Bitcoin would be met mainly by green energy sources, and I can see how someone might be convinced by that, though I remained skeptical. Elon tried to implement use of Bitcoin, and found that the assumption was wrong - that at least in the short term, the increase was mainly in coal and other fossil fuels.\n\nIf I were to read the article without the hindsight of the present day, I would get the impression that the Chinese government was in the process of reducing the amount of coal-powered Bitcoin mining, for example the line \"China\u2019s government is planning to shut down Bitcoin miners\".

That said, Tesla is not selling any of the bitcoin on its balance sheet.\n\nTesla\u2019s decision seems to have been triggered by private equity firm Greenidge\u2019s plans to revive a coal power plant to mine bitcoin.

Contrary to consensus thinking, we believe the impact of bitcoin mining could become a net positive to the environment. With real-world data, we demonstrate how mining could impact the amount of renewable energy provisioned to the grid by transforming intermittent power resources into baseload generation by way of energy storage. We illustrate that renewables would be able to satisfy only 40% of the grid\u2019s needs in the absence of Bitcoin mining but 99% with the commercial \u201csubsidies\u201d associated with Bitcoin mining.\n\nStay tuned for more ARK research highlighting Bitcoin\u2019s potential impact on the adoption of renewable energy.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I don't really care much that they bought carbon credits to \"offset\".
