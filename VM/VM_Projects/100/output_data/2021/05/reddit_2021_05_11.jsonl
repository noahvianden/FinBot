{"title": "GME Put/Call Parity breaks apart", "selftext": "In an interesting development this week, GME put/call parity, which has tracked like any normal stock for months, started to split apart this week and today really fractured.\n\nPut/Call parity implies that both the put and call will have (about) the same IV at the same strike. I have been using a model to track GME IV for, among other things, an at-the-money strangle since Jan 27, 2021, recorded in the database at around 1:00 PM ET.  \n\nMy models calculate implied daily volatility (IDV) rather than annual volatility. I am always tracking a monthly so currently the May 21.\n\nGME ATM IV has declined steadily and in a very orderly way and showing relative parity since late March. IV was extremely high in March but began a relentless decline. There was some asymmetry - put IDV typically higher than calls, such as Put IDV at 0.08748 and Call IDV 0.07048 on Friday, April 9 - but this is often seen in tech stocks and is usually explained by heavy hedging of long positions.\n\nIn the last two weeks, both calls and puts were moving down to the 0.05 level of IDV, largely at parity.\n\nToday, a little after 1:09 ET (I ran the model a number of times because I was having trouble pulling in live data) I recorded the 140 Put IDV at 0.06025 (GME at 141.27) and the 145 Call IDV at 0.03856 (GME was 141.22). [Yeah, I know, that is not the same strike but when they are that close you still get very close to parity].\n\nOther than in panics, I don't recall that I have ever seen a parity spread that wide. \n\nTo me it indicates an extreme level of hedging. Any other guesses?\n\n[Edit: ran the models again at 1:18:04 and the spread persists, but at a lower level, the 145 Put at 0.05699 and the 150 Call 0.03062. Another thing that surprises me is that the Call IDV is so low .. part of that explains the parity spread].\n\n[Update edit at 12:30 PDT]:\n\nAnd by 3:20 PM ET it was entirely arbitraged away! At 12:23:19 the May 21 145 Put has an IDV of 0.05680 and at 12:22:19 the 150 Call had an IDV of 0.05539 (and that is essentially parity). I pulled up the limit order book for the 150 Put and watched with fascination how that one participated in the convergence. A while ago when that Put had an ask size of 116 at 11.60 it had a bid size of 1 at 10.80, but hundreds of contracts bid at 10:50. It sat there for about 10 seconds. Then suddenly the solitary 10.80 (it was on PEARL) got filled and then 10.50 ask at high volume instantly became best ask. I have been watching this kind of screwy trading all day long in GME near the money options. Very interesting and kind of unusual. We are back to parity so someone made a little money here I guess on rational arbitrage.\n\nOK, time to move on. \n\nAnd for those of you asking what it all means, it means that options are really, really interesting.", "id": "na2wye", "created_utc": 1620755248.0, "score": 773, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 291, "comments": [{"body": "The short stock rebate must have changed.", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "It's at 1% right now so nothing out of the ordinary", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I believe that the rebate rate is unknown to the public; it's between lender and broker.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That's just the 'borrow fee' aka 'stock loan fee.'

Lets say you had 1000 shares of CCIV at $50, now it's trading at ~$18.  That's more than a 50% valuation loss.\n\nSo you've effectively:\n\n* Lost half of your valuation\n* Sitting on $18,000 hoping it will go up to at least $50/share+value needed to beat inflation rate\n* To beat inflation on the initial $50,000 you would need to see the stock more than double\n* You're not seeing a tax write off since you haven't sold\n* If you don't beat inflation that adds to the \"bag holding factor\n* If you can't write it off in taxes that adds to the bag holding factor\n* What if it takes 10 years for CCIV/LUCID to reach that same valuation per share again?

But most of the time bag holding describe those who buy near/at the top and see it go below their entry price point.\n\nThe company doesn't have to go defunct.  As long as it ties up your capitol it effectively shrinks your account and hinders your opportunity to grow the account via capitol allocation.  If you had a 100k account shrink to 30k and it's all tied up in stock you bought initially at 100k then you don't have freed up capitol to allocate it in other investments.

The bag holding part is when the trade has gone against your initial thesis and either continues to drop or shows no signs of climbing back up. Bag holding is when you\u2019re holding a stock for longer than you initially planned, or at a price lower than you planned etc. and not necessarily because you see the path forward to breaking even/making a profit, but because you just don\u2019t want to take a loss. Bag holding it when you allow dead money in your portfolio, when you let emotion take over and are holding more out of hope and being too stubborn to take a loss. If you\u2019re in the red on a trade but are still confident (and have reasoning) enough to hold, that\u2019s not bagholding.

TLDR: I'm bullish from either thesis.\n\nIf you assume the 40K total thesis\\~ with 25K local and 15K exported, that's amazing. Demand isn't always a linear curve up. You'll have some record months, and you'll have some okay months. 25K, is an incredible number YOY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you assume the 42HOW thesis of 25K with 14K exports, that's still amazing, because they were specific that the line \"was shut down\" for two weeks in April. So, if you assume roughly that Tesla had 2K in inventory coming into April, that assumes within two weeks they produced 23K vehicles, around 11.5K cars per week. That's a really good number, and 11.5x4= 46K if the line was active all four weeks. Personally, upon the split between deliveries and exports, I'd rather Tesla export 14K and get them sold in Europe so they don't incessantly piss off their European customers who painstakingly need to wait for a while to get their car.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne final note about China media. As a person who is Asian, (indian specifically) and who has many chinese friends, I can reasonably say, that most Chinese who are affluent enough to afford Teslas don't fall for the FUD from the news. Most chinese don't trust the state-run news agencies, in general, and Tesla is really doing well from word of mouth.\n\nAdditionally, As a long term investor, I never took China seriously, because I know that China is a risky place. To also be honest, while I think Tesla is supreme in the EV market, I don't particularly think Xiaopeng, Nio, Li-Autos vehicles are bad either, and I believe that they are very good choices for the Chinese buyer.\n\nFinally, Elon's actions and tweets usually serve as semi-accurate confirmation bias on how Tesla is doing, and I think Tesla is doing fine, and like many others believe on this subreddit, the FUD and the media aren't going to cut the mustard for most Tesla buyers around the world.\n\nFinally, one more thing on the prospect of Tesla India. I seriously unlike others, believe that India is at least a 50K vehicles per year market for Tesla. This is because of South India, specifically states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Many families there are very into technology, and I can confidently say their are a Sh\\*t ton of families that can easily afford cars the price of a model S. Also, state elections just happened, and the new governments in south indian states, specifically Tamil Nadu, has a hyper pro-infrastructure CM, running the show. I wouldn't even be surprised if the new DMK government makes a hard push for Tesla to setup shop, and also add superchargers and regular charging infrastructure along the NH routes.\n\nTesla in India can be very successful. It's no China, but its a market that shouldn't be ignored.\n\nAlso, its very cheap to install destination chargers in India for electric vehicles. India's power infrastructure runs at 220-240V @ 50Hz. That cuts down on charging speeds and makes a regular indian outlet as powerful as an American Dryer outlet, which is ideal for most people to charge their EVs. \n\nIf your in for the long run, Tesla has a metric Fu\\*k ton of catalysts ahead of us. Just chill and don't pay attention for now, this will just be a tiny blip on a graph in a year.\n\nFinally, please do correct me if I am wrong somewhere in this write-up.

Stock price target: **$0**. *5% chance of this*\n- Neutral case. Some successes in clinical trials but years away from commercialisation. Stock price target: **$2-$6**. *40% chance of this*\n- Bull case. 1 or 2 effective treatments that treat/cure mental health issues. Stock price target: **$30**. *50% chance of this*\n- Super bull case. All clinical trials are effective. Stock price target: **$100**. *5% chance of this*\n\nCurrent price is $3. So looking at 10X or 30X increase in the two bull cases.\n\n---\n\nI personally would give his bear case a 1% chance, and that I feel is conservative. I don\u2019t think there is much doubt these drugs will work. Anyone who\u2019s had any experience with them knows that they really do work miracles, and the clinical trials from John Hopkins and Kings College London are really really really incredible. The real bear case IMO is competition from big pharma and other psychedelic companies. Currently that doesn\u2019t appear to be much of a risk, but 5 years is a long time and things can change. But really, in my mind, this just increases the odds of the neutral case, rather than the bear case. It\u2019s very hard to see all trials failing completely outright. I think most likely is something between his bull and super bull cases, but that may take longer than 5 years to play out, so my expectations are for his bull case within 5 years.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18252669274806976}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1657019704580307}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2726094722747803}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1508699655532837}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12688161432743073}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07982617616653442}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10869105160236359}, {"body": "hyln", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09488242864608765}, {"body": "I also have SQ and DIS.

Fear of missing out is NEVER a good idea. Look how far you are from the moving average... I feel vertigo just looking at it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x67cnp5evgy61.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=335c9d39eff4e40743e8d537787822b7f4e1f433\n\nYou might feel like a star buying here, as the price might go parabolic some more... but what you didn't know is you're walking a high strung tight rope. The slightest wind and you come tumbling down 1000 metres.\n\nUnless you are a good sentiment reader, it's hard without a chart to really see how dangerous the situation is.\n\nNow to some  silver charts! Check out the setup for silver  .\n\n Here we go!\n\n**Evidence #1 - US Dollar and inflation adjusted**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bhi4hxovwgy61.png?width=1825&format=png&auto=webp&s=41b14643cd570a05387b455f08e154b9d8c7739f\n\n Inflation adjusted shows the truth to how your purchasing power has been subdued, even if the US Dollar index had strong bear market rallies since 1980.\n\nHalf-life of 15 years (US Dollar loses 50% of it's value every 15 years).\n\nNew bearish cycle is about to start.\n\nSilver & friends will have a strong tailwind.\n\n **Evidence #2 - Gold vs Dow Ratio** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rh5mmal3xgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc91b3183804c58e77330288e998a25010bf83ca\n\n Point and figure charts remove time scale meaning, and add new columns only when price action reverses sufficiently (else it just fluctuates in same column).\n\nWhen US equities go in BUBBLE MODE, gold (and silver) get relatively cheaper, creating a low risk, high reward entry points.\n\nWe are at similar points prior to a 1929 crash or 1972 inflation cycle.\n\nBuying silver or gold now is not buying EXPENSIVE, but historically CHEAP.\n\n**Evidence #3 - Silver vs Dow's 3 \"inflation adjusted\" cycles**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gtc4d2gxgy61.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf7822f7a5da4856e13fc475914b0d8da4108b2\n\n Arcs are a powerful tool to identify a downtrend, the slowing of that downtrend, and the eventual rise from the ashes.\n\nWhen you get 2 bounces off the right hemisphere, the new uptrend is confirmed and probabilities of a sustained uptrend is increased.\n\nAngle of descent is usually angle of exit.\n\nThis JUST happened now.\n\n**Evidence #4 - Silver's 50 years bi-monthly log chart** \n\nOnce the price is out of the red cloud, it is GO TIME! You may start to fly \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdr2m405zgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5c954c04d705e9dfebe81bb33d5a576dbd9fce\n\n**Evidence #5  Lastly - Silver's Relative Strength to SPX ( US equities)**\n\nAnother view for silver, now comparing it's performance vs SPX (US equities). When the capital flows leave US equities and start flowing in silver... it creates an explosive move. Don't believe me? check out the chart right below. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tet12j4bzgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb61d89486d5ec0cf4a33c8ab7bed7986fba54ad\n\nNotice the differences? Fear, and more fear. Close to the moving average, the risks are low, especially in a precious metals bull market. Nobody on mainstream media talking about silver really nowadays .\n\n **Conclusive Thoughts...**\n\nTHE INVESTMENT OF THE DECADE\n\n I\u2019ll just put this out there - silver is ABOUT TO GO TO THE MOON. This is the buying opportunity of a lifetime. A group of people around the whole world are buying up all the silver to drive up the prices. Everyone's doing it, and you should do it too. \n\nI would like to thank fellow Patrick Karim  for those fantastic charts .

{"title": "Palantir's (PLTR) fundamentals just became even better ( As management said: \"We are a few steps away from becoming Skynet\")", "selftext": " \n\nFirst of all let's take a look at PLTR's Q1 financial performance.\n\n* Total revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $341 million\n* US commercial revenue grew 72% year-over-year\n* US government revenue grew 83% year-over-year\n* Cash flow from operations of $117 million, up $404 million year-over-year, and representing a 34% margin\n* Adjusted free cash flow of $151 million, up $441 million year-over-year, and representing a 44% margin\n* GAAP net loss per share, diluted of $(0.07)\n* Adjusted earnings per share, diluted of $0.04\n* Cash and cash equivalents- 2.3 billion\n* The company managed to pay almost all of its outstanding long-term debt\n\nThese numbers look amazing,especially when you take into account the fact that as the management stated numerous times on the earnings call, the company is just starting to expand and acquire new customers. Many people think of Palantir as this old, mature company that is still unprofitable and with limited growth opportunities. The thing is that despite being 17 years old, Palantir is just starting to get recognition on the world stage. They spent years just developing their software and investing heavily into R and D( over 2 billion dollars). Foundry was launched in 2018 and already is experiencing very high-levels of adoption despite the fact that it is a very complex and expensive software( It is way easier to grow your revenue and acquire new customers on a quarter basis when you are selling cheap and rather simple software solutions, not a complete OS for businesses) . PLTR is also just starting to build a proper sales team ( more than 50 new salespeople hired in this quarter alone) and partnering with organizations like IBM that can pinch their soft. to potential customers. The only slightly negative thing is the fact that currently their european commercial business growth is lacking behind the U.S one, but it is mostly because european economic recovery from the Covid pandemic is way slower. They still managed to close some deals and on the earnings call announcead a new client in Peugeot. Also the Covid crisis definitely helped PLTR in a way, but this does not mean that we should expect a slower growth rate in the future, but qute the opposite. For example, video game manufacturers experienced huge growth during the pandemic, because people stayed at home and had nothing better to do, but that would not be the case in the future. On the other hand, the pandemic helped companies to realise how important is for them to be able to make sense of their large databases of unfiltered information and make better-informed decisions to protect their operations from future geopolitical or macro-economic events.\n\nPalantir is also well positioned to increase their revenue significantly in the government sector, due to the fact that their Gotham software proved its worth throughout the years and they just started their AI based Appolo software.( The Biden admin will apparently invest billions in AI technologies in the coming years).\n\nI would not dive deep into other financial metrics, cuz this DD will become too large, but their margins are insane, cost of revenue grew way,way less than actual revenue, adjusted free cash flow is now positive( insane growth also, wink, wink to all analyst who use DCF) and PLTR somehow managed to expand its business operations while at the same time increasing their cash at hand and having almost non-existent debt.\n\nLet's adress some retail investors worries now. WSB and r/ PLTR are constantly complaining about the high amounts of SBC the employees receive. They of course talked about this on the earnings call and the CFO said that the SBC will normalise in the future( very common for growth companies), but they will still give SBC to employess to align their personal interest with interest of the company ( also very common, especially for soft.companies) and to have more cash for expansion and future investments. Also, they said that Alex Karp is selling shares for tax purposes and he plans to continue being one of the biggest shareholders in the future.\n\nA lot of people also complain about the fact that \"the management does not believe in the company, Karp told me to sell my shares\". The truth is that their believe is actually a bit cult-like. Management again stated that they are convinced of the fact that PLTR will become the most important software company in the future and they even literally said that they are a \" few steps away form becoming Skynet\". Furthermore, they invested in Lillium and Sarcos robotics, cuz they think that it is an incredible opportunity for an innovative startup to use Foundry from ground-zero and not waste years of its development having to deal with data silos and so on. When talking specifically about Sarcos, they said that their are vision for Foundry is to become a digital \"IronMan suit\" and Sarcos is trying to build a physical \"IronMan\" suit and they want to combine their efforts. Yes, that is right. Management thinks that their software is so good, that instead of just selling it to other companies, they can just invest in startups, give their soft for free and reap even bigger rewards in the future.\n\nAnother interesting thing we learned from the conference call is that PLTR accepts (the currency that rhymes with groin) as a form of payment. Investing in PLTR is giving you some indirect exposure to the \"forbidden word\" market.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to say that my personal opinion is that PLTR's fundamentals actually became better and as Jeff Bezos said the stock price does not always reflect the state of the company correctly. If you did not FOMO into PLTR expecting it to moon immediatly it is probably better to just wait and stick to your conviction that the company's financials will justify its generous valuation in the coming years.", "id": "n9ydod", "created_utc": 1620743617.0, "score": 1224, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 299, "comments": [{"body": "I'm super excited for this stock to pop off in 2029", "score": 752, "replies": [{"body": "And by pop off you mean hit $25?", "score": 405, "replies": [{"body": "Let's manage our expectations!

{"title": "Important Connection Between UFOs and Defense Stocks. *PLEASE READ I BEG OF YOU*", "selftext": "**TLDR:** The U.S. Government has confirmed several sightings of UFO's (possibly aliens). Several government officials have come out and said that U.S. military has had several encounters with physics-defying vehicles. Based off this evidence, defense stocks have a direct relationship with UFO disclosure. I recommend purchasing U.S. defense stocks due to recent UFO activity and human emotions. **PLEASE READ, THIS POST IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME**\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\*THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. STRICTLY INFORMATIONAL\\*\n\nThis is my first time posting on this subreddit. I hope this post can be welcomed with open arms like many other posts on this platform. This is a rather long post but it is definitely the most important one for not only this subreddit but Earth as a whole. I beg of you to take this post as serious as possible as I lay out claims that might not be considered \"realistic\" by some of you. Again, this is one of the most important issues of our time and I thought that it would be a great way to share this information with you guys since the spread of information on this platform is unmatched.\n\nThe issue that I am referring to above is the growing contact/sightings of possibly extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional beings and crafts on Earth. This is an issue that everyone in the world should be familiar with and allocate their greatest interest in order to find the truth behind this. This post is very unusual compared to the others on this subreddit as most posts are stock market related. However, I promise that I will show the intersectionality between this global issue and finance throughout this post.\n\nI first began to become interested in this issue in December of 2020 while quarantined in South East Michigan when the former Israeli space security chief, Haim Eshed, announced to the Jerusalem Post that aliens are indeed real. He later stated in the interview with the reputable news source that extraterrestrials from distant planets are engaged in a \"Galactic Federation\" where important policies regarding issues between civilizations are made. Eshed exclaimed that the United States is in talks with the Galactic Federation and even have American representatives participating in meetings and research with these extraterrestrials in an underground base on Mars. The former space security chief states that the main purpose of the research is to understand \"the fabric of the universe\". Around this time, America's former president, Donald Trump, established the seventh branch of their military, the Space Force. Haim insists that Trump was briefed and is fully aware of this situation. He even says that Trump was \"on the verge\" of disclosing their existence, however, he was stopped by the Galactic Federation as they didn't want to cause \"mass hysteria\" due to the many conflicts we are facing today such as political divide, COVID-19, and degrading international relationships.\n\nKeep in mind that Haim Eshed is the one of the most credible, reliable, high-ranking, and intelligent individuals in regards to this issue. This would be comparable to if the head of NASA announced that intelligent life from other planets is a reality and that they are in communication with our highest-ranking officials. It is also important to mention that Israel's space agency is one of the best as they are one of only seven countries on the planet that build and launch their own satellites into orbit. Not only that, but Israel and the United States have a very good relationship regarding not only trade but military operations as well. This means that information is without a doubt transferred between the countries' military in regards to warfare and space. You may be asking why Haim Eshed is going public with this reality-shattering information nine years after his retirement in 2011. He claims that a lot has changed in the scientific community and that \"if I had come up with what I\u2019m saying today five years ago, I would have been hospitalized\". In the end, he stated that he is one of the most respected individuals in the academia setting and that he has \"nothing to lose. I\u2019ve received my degrees and awards\". Again, this is a man who served for 30 years as head of Israel's space program and is a three-time recipient of the Israel Security Award.\n\nHere is the original Jerusalem Post article \\*PLEASE READ\\*: [Jerusalem Post Article](https://www.jpost.com/omg/former-israeli-space-security-chief-says-aliens-exist-humanity-not-ready-651405)\n\nIn December of 2017, the New York Times published an article entitled, *Glowing Auras and \u2018Black Money\u2019: The Pentagon\u2019s Mysterious U.F.O. Program.* This article was one of the first publications to give an in-depth investigation of the current state of U.S. intelligence about UFO's (unidentified flying objects) or UAP's (unidentified aerial phenomenons) as they are known today by the U.S. Government. In the NYT report, it provides evidence to prove the U.S. Government's involvement in research programs investigating UAP sightings. According to Defense Department officials, included in the $600 billion annual defense budget was a virtually impossible to find $22 million allocation of money to an unknown Pentagon program called the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The program's main responsibility was to examine proof of UAP's provided by various military sources and to determine whether or not it posed a threat to our country. The program was ran by a former military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo on the fifth floor of the Pentagon's C ring. The Defense Department has never acknowledged the existence of this program before and when asked about it recently they said that they shut it down in 2012. However, when the program's backers were asked about it, they confirmed that the Defense Department stopped funding back in 2012 but the program still continued to investigate several more episodes provided by service members until October of 2017 when Luis Elizondo resigned from the Pentagon to protest excessive government secrecy about this issue.\n\n[New York Times Article \\*PLEASE READ\\*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html)\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about this program was the examining of videos showing encounters between these unknown objects and U.S. military aircrafts. Three videos on this subject were published by the New York Times entitled \"FLIR1\", \"GIMBAL\", and \"GOFAST\". The videos were taken by Navy fighter jets belonging to the USS Nimitz and USS Roosevelt. All three of these videos show cockpit display data, infrared imagery, and even audio communications between the pursuing pilots. The UAP's displayed in these videos showed unprecedented and \"impossible\" aerial maneuvers that is unmatched by any technology present on Earth at this time. One of the fighter pilots, Commander David Fravor, who was part of the F/A-18F team that attempted to intercept the UAPs in 2004, had only this to say to the *New York Times:* \u201cI have no idea what I saw...It had no plumes, wings or rotors and outran our F-18s.\u201d Another fighter pilot witness named Chad Underwood described the movement of the craft as \"not behaving by the normal laws of physics\". Furthermore, he described the UAP to not be \"behaving in a manner that\u2019s predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move\". In addition to this bizarreness, all the pilots involved stated that the crafts didn't produce a heat signature, fumes, or even a propulsion system. Overall, these crafts can only be labeled as otherworldly as they clearly aren't capable to be developed by our current standards of science and innovation according to these pilots and other significant figures in the scientific community.\n\n[\"FLIR1\" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWLZgnmRDs4)\n\n[\"GIMBAL\" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TumprpOwHY)\n\n[\"GOFAST\" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUrTsrhVce4)\n\nAlthough these videos showed compelling evidence of extraterrestrial existence, it still was not confirmed by any government officials to be raw and genuine footage. Some of the videos actually surfaced on the Internet as early as 2007, as they were being passed around in various website forums. It wasn't until September of 2019, when a spokeswoman of the Pentagon confirmed that the released videos were in fact 100% real and recorded by Navy aviators. She also added that this was \"part of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years.\" This was one of the first incidences of the U.S. Government confirming that unknown and physics-defying air crafts have entered U.S. airspace.\n\n[Confirmation of Video Authenticity by Pentagon Representative](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ufo-video-authenticity-pentagon/)\n\nMore recently, in April of 2021, a new video published by [Mystery Wire](https://www.mysterywire.com/) showed yet another case of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The video took storm on the web and showcased a swarm of pyramid shaped aircrafts hovering over a U.S. Navy destroyer in night vision. The UAP's flashed with bright lights and performed physics-defying maneuvers. Additionally, what stood out about this incident was that the crafts were \"transmedium\" vehicles, meaning that they could transition from air to water seamlessly. Also, three photos supposedly taken by Navy fighter jet pilots displayed three different shaped UAP's. The objects the Navy Personnel captured on his iPhone included a \"sphere\", an \"acorn\", and a \"metallic blimp\". Although the video clip and photos originally didn't seem to standout from the other UFO videos found on the Internet, it wasn't long for a spokeswoman from the Pentagon to confirm the authenticity of the video and photos. Susan Gough, the spokesperson for the Pentagon said that, \u201cI can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel. The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations.\u201d As you can see, this is an ongoing issue that most likely happens very frequently. It wasn't until now that the people of America can really see what secrets the U.S. Government is hiding from its citizens.\n\n[Confirmed Pyramid UAP Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3zpqQJYinc)\n\n[\"Sphere\" UAP Photo](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2021/04/Sphere.jpeg?w=900)\n\n[\"Acorn\" UAP Photo](https://www.nxsttv.com/nmw/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/2021/04/Acorn.jpeg?w=900)\n\n[\"Metallic Blimp\" UAP Photo](https://www.wtrf.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/04/Metallic-Blinp.jpg)\n\n[Pentagon Confirmation Article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/15/politics/unidentified-aerial-phenomena-defense-department/index.html)\n\nNow you may be asking yourself \"what happens now?\" Well in last years' gargantuan $2.3 trillion appropriation bill that was mainly for COVID-19 relief aid for millions of Americans, contained a rider that was provided by the Senate Intelligence Committee. For anyone that doesn't know, a rider is when an additional provision is added to a bill while having little to do with the main subject matter of it. In this case, the rider mandated that the director of national intelligence works with the secretary of defense on a report to detail everything the U.S. Government knowns about UAP's. The small provision in the 5,500+ page bill also warranted that the report be released within 180 days of the bill being signed. Donald Trump signed the bill on December 27th, 2020 so that means that UAP disclosure should be released in early June. Some speculate that this report will contain all the secrets the U.S. Government has regarding unidentified aerial phenomenons while other say that they will only release the minimum amount of information in order to be labeled as a \"UFO report\". What do you think? I'd love to hear your opinion!\n\n[UFO Disclosure Article](https://nypost.com/2020/12/29/covid-19-bill-started-a-180-day-countdown-for-ufo-disclosures/)\n\nWhile this is potentially one of the greatest ongoing issues in human history, I'd like to take a minute to fulfill my promise of connecting this global issue to the stock market. All the evidence I provided were confirmed by some of the highest-ranking individuals on this planet. This means that there is a high probability of similar events occurring in the near future. These events could be increased UFO sightings, more government confirmations of UAP encounters, or even extraterrestrial contact. Overall, what is absolutely certain if any of these events take place, is the growing awareness of extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings by the general public. Based off human emotion, people will not take this news lightly. I truly believe that many humans will panic after hearing the startling news of unknown crafts traveling over their countries airspace without their country's military able to do anything about. People will instinctively go into a defensive state meaning that they will purchase more weapons like guns, knives, and ammunition. Some people will most likely even commit suicide due to the feeling of insignificance and defenselessness by this devastating news. Additionally, there will be a massive pushback against the U.S. Government because of this unprecedented and excessive government secrecy regarding this issue. Most likely the government will stay intact and billions of dollars will be put into the military as it is the only structured organization that can defend against this off-world threat. However, this will be the start to a new concept of what us humans call life.\n\nWhat I stated above sounds absolutely horrific, however, our species need to recognize the fact that we may not be alone in this universe. New information we find on this issue will happen inevitably, it is more of a question of when. Investing in military defense stocks like Lockheed Martin ($LMT), Raytheon ($RTX), and Boeing ($BA) will be a great long term investment because I hypothesize that this situation is caused by only three scenarios. The first scenario is that there are extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings navigating the UAP's shown in the evidence above. The second scenario is that one of our country's nemesis like China or Russia has technologically leaped frogged us and created aircrafts that has defied our current understandings of physics. The final scenario is that the U.S. military has developed these crafts and in an attempt to keep our rivals from figuring out this information, they made a massive effort to hide it from the general public. All three of these scenarios ultimately conclude with the U.S. military's capabilities being expanded along with a giant budget increase. Higher budget means more money for big military companies like the ones stated above to develop cutting edge technology for the government. Again, whether this happens in June when UFO disclosure is released or 10 years from now when aliens make contact, this is an asymmetric trade meaning that the potential gains of buying defense stocks FAR exceed the potential losses.\n\nNow if you can take one thing from this post, it is that information is ESSENTIAL. What the U.S. Government has held from its people, is the greatest intelligence failure in United States history. This global issue affects us all significantly and as people of Earth, we deserve to have this information told to us in full.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Resources:**\n\n**THESE RESOURCES ARE STRICTLY FOR OBJECTIVE PURPOSES ONLY, NOT POLITICAL**\n\n[r/UFOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/) \\- UFO/UAP Sightings posted every single day\n\n[Retired Navy Commander David Fravor Describes his Encounter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-h3dIeD_A)\n\n[Former Defense of Intelligence Official on Public UFO Findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTdCDfEu6x0)\n\n[Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Proving Luis Elizondo was Head of AATIP](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ez8o2MIVEAM3pzb?format=jpg&name=large)\n\n[Luis Elizondo Interview on U.S. Intelligence Failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MbJpTQD2Uk)\n\n[Luis Elizondo Interview on U.S. in Possession of UFO Debris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-DhPCG_II)\n\n[Former Director of National Intelligence Speaks Out On UFOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNLCfSnJDgs&t=2s)\n\n[In-Depth Breakdown of \"FLIR1\" Video](https://thevault.tothestarsacademy.com/2004-nimitz-flir1-video)\n\n[In-Depth Breakdown of \"GIMBAL\" video](https://thevault.tothestarsacademy.com/gimbal/tag/Tom+Delonge)\n\n[In-Depth Breakdown of \"GOFAST\" Video](https://thevault.tothestarsacademy.com/2015-go-fast-footage)", "id": "n9zlpn", "created_utc": 1620746813.0, "score": 3006, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 1536, "comments": [{"body": "(*Puts on tinfoil hat*, *calls broker*). \u201cPut it all on Lockheed Martin, Jerry.

It is not backwards engineered alien technology. It is technology bases on Unified Field theorem. Knowledge of the true physics of our reality that has been in certain human hands since before recorded history. This knowledge is purposely kept from the general public as it unifies all science and religions. It proves absolutely the existence of an immortal human soul, as well as anti-gravity, free enegry, and superluminal technology. As you can clearly see, if this knowledge was allowed to become widely known, it would instantly destroy the entire world economy. All Governments would collapse under the weight of the truth they have been hiding. It will never be allowed to happen. Aliens are the true \"Big Lie\", and simply a cover story they will use to inslave humanity further. I am not saying that Aliens do not exist... \"As above, so below\". However, they want nothing to do with us until this truth is known by all. They are waiting for us to... Settle our own affairs. If there is some kind of disclosure, remember these words, because I can prove them true empirically. Unified Field theorem is a mathematical expression, not an equation, as Nature does not do math, Nature only knows how to express itself. That expression is 1/(1.618^-3). Which is the basis for the Pythagorean Pentagram. It is a two dimensional representation of a physical three dimensional process. Three interlocking triangles whose angles equal 108\u00b0,36\u00b0,36\u00b0. This is also the basis of Platonic Monastic Metaphysics, and Sacred Geometry. The Fibonacci sequence is also included in this understanding. This is why the \"elite\" (little e) for some unknown reason seem to be so intrigued by the occult (secret). They are Oculists, and that is why the \"All Seeing Eye\" is on the U.S. Dollar. This is also why the Pentagram is on many ancient gold coins as well. Our health, our minds, every aspect of life is constantly manipulated by disinformation. Modern physics and medicine has no clue what it is doing. It is all based on false assumptions, and kept that way purposefully. Believe me or not at your own peril. Just don't be the first ones to enter any of their ships.

The energy required to accelerate anything of mass to the speed of light is infinite, and it would take years traveling at light speed just to reach the nearest star to our solar system. Additionally, there is a long chain of events that needed to occur, with perfect and stable conditions for tens of millions of years, for life to form and for human civilization to get the point that we are at. That we even exist at all is highly unlikely, and the same can be applied to other potential alien civilizations. \n\nPersonally, I think any \u201cUFOs\u201d documented by the military could possibly be the experimental aircraft and/or stealth technology of foreign governments.

It is not backwards engineered alien technology. It is technology bases on Unified Field theorem. Knowledge of the true physics of our reality that has been in certain human hands since before recorded history. This knowledge is purposely kept from the general public as it unifies all science and religions. It proves absolutely the existence of an immortal human soul, as well as anti-gravity, free enegry, and superluminal technology. As you can clearly see, if this knowledge was allowed to become widely known, it would instantly destroy the entire world economy. All Governments would collapse under the weight of the truth they have been hiding. It will never be allowed to happen. Aliens are the true \"Big Lie\", and simply a cover story they will use to inslave humanity further. I am not saying that Aliens do not exist... \"As above, so below\". However, they want nothing to do with us until this truth is known by all. They are waiting for us to... Settle our own affairs. If there is some kind of disclosure, remember these words, because I can prove them true empirically. Unified Field theorem is a mathematical expression, not an equation, as Nature does not do math, Nature only knows how to express itself. That expression is 1/(1.618^-3). Which is the basis for the Pythagorean Pentagram. It is a two dimensional representation of a physical three dimensional process. Three interlocking triangles whose angles equal 108\u00b0,36\u00b0,36\u00b0. This is also the basis of Platonic Monastic Metaphysics, and Sacred Geometry. The Fibonacci sequence is also included in this understanding. This is why the \"elite\" (little e) for some unknown reason seem to be so intrigued by the occult (secret). They are Oculists, and that is why the \"All Seeing Eye\" is on the U.S. Dollar. This is also why the Pentagram is on many ancient gold coins as well. Our health, our minds, every aspect of life is constantly manipulated by disinformation. Modern physics and medicine has no clue what it is doing. It is all based on false assumptions, and kept that way purposefully. Believe me or not at your own peril. Just don't be the first ones to enter any of their ships.

The consensus is that Annual CPI will go up to 3.6% tomorrow morning. I think that the number is going to be closer to 4% .

I would expect the April number to be higher than the March number of .6, Inflation is heating up, so I am not sure why they would expect a lower number in the consensus, that would then add onto to the 3.3% and give us a CPI of 4%.

And of course there is last year where we went all the way down to negative -1, which is where we are now.**\n\n\\-Yields are going to want to rise on this inflation news tomorrow, and I expect the markets to tank pretty quickly, but as you can see with the new inflation numbers that the real rates will be much lower.
