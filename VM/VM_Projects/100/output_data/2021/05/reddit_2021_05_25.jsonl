Ad revenue is highly profitable like AWS, so it could use the profit to support other business. The ad revenue is growing very fast so it could able to compete with FB and Googl in the future. The stock is trading under $3300, investors should consider buying some and hold.\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "nkqj4f", "created_utc": 1621951490.0, "score": 3329, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 268, "comments": [{"body": "A side effect of this is the Amazon shopping experience has gone to shit.", "score": 1076, "replies": [{"body": "Yea this is why I don't think the advertising revenue is that sustainable.

A lot of people look at this from the eyes of a technology user. But I think Tesla needs to accommodate actual Ford users.

Most truck owners consider resell value but often times in my own experience hold trucks much longer than a sedan.\n\nSo I would like to see the cyber truck focus on longevity, quality, customization, interchangeable tire sizes, modification capabilities, ease of cleaning. Autonomous is okay, but not necessary. They also need consider the hours of output capable with the current charging system under strenuous use.\nThis sounds bearish but it's not.
