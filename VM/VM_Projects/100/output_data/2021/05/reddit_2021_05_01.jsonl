Similarly, I expect SR Cybertruck to beat the most basic ICE F150 ($29k) in terms of TCO.\n* When comparing TCOs of similarly sized EVs, drivetrain efficiency matters a lot. For example, Mach-e goes 270miles with 88 KWh battery and Model Y goes 326 miles with 75 KWh battery. That's more than 40% more miles/KWh with Model Y. Which translates to 40% less cost to charge the vehicle per mile. Mach-e is less expensive than LR Model Y but you can imaging that if Tesla starts making SR Model Y, it will be price comparable to Mach-e and the charging-cost/mile differential will be little wider than 40%. Lower  charging costs over 300k-500k lifetime miles will amount to major TCO savings (Yes, Tesla batteries do last 300k+ miles. Lets assume Mach-e will do too).\n* Now add to this to what [Tesla announced on The Battery Day.](https://images.hgmsites.net/med/tesla-battery-day-vertical-integration-overview_100762380_m.jpg) They have a 54% range improvements from combinations of Cells design, Cell chemistry and Cell-to-structure architecture. If you assume these improvements in the next gen Model Y, the charging-cost/mile differential with Mach-e could go higher than 70%.\n* I expect similar efficiency differences in similarly priced Cybertruck vs  Competing EV pickup trucks.\n* Ford hasn't seemed improve the battery tech between Mach-e and 2022 F150 Lightning. [Rob at TeslaDaily estimated](https://youtu.be/op_JzEp9O_0?t=595) 230 mile Lightning  to have 120-125KWh battery pack.

In case of major crash where drive train is damaged beyond repair, the vehicles is totaled; so are any ICE vehicles or EVs currently on market.\n\nAgree that any crash damaging drivetrain would total any vehicle. But repairing a CT from smaller crashes will not be simple. For one, welding stainless is a lot more specialized and difficult than welding carbon steel or even aluminium. It will not be a job that your average body shop can just start welding on. Secondly, If an exoskeleton takes an impact it can cause distortion throughout the exoskeleton. This would be comparable to a truck with a bent frame. A skilled body shop can maybe get it to \"look right\" again but it will always have issues with wheel alignments, vibrations, getting parts to fit again, etc. With a body-on-frame a loader or semi can back into the truck and severely damage the body but leave the frame untouched; replace the affected parts and you're good to go.  With a CT the vehicle will (or should be) a write-off.\n\n> the right architecture for most buyers who don't use their truck for real work\n> \n> Why do you say that?\n\nIt's a bit of hyperbole there for sure; there are \"real work\" applications where the low TCO and perks like bed outlets will be great. Things like landscaping and municipal work trucks come to mind. But any application that requires towing will be really challenged to successfully use any EV. Likewise, any work applications where people would normally modify a truck will be very difficult to apply to a CT without affecting the exoskeleton, let alone the challenges of working with stainless (e.g. put a flat deck on 3/4 tonne, put panel carriers or drilling equipment on that swings over the side, etc.)\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think the CT will be a wild success and can crush it in the market.

{"title": "I analyze mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!", "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tymisf4seiw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa1cef4c9a92f4863d89db376e4b86acf9380c9\n\n Microvision has overtaken GME to become the most discussed stock. This is the first time since Jan\u201921 that any stock has overtaken GME in the number of mentions (Not even the $100B Coinbase IPO could do it). Clover health has fallen from 3rd position last week to 7th this week. Coinbase also dropped out of the top 10 and is now in the 12th position. All the others are the usual stocks in the top 10 list except for Microsoft. They booked their biggest revenue growth since 2018 but down 3%+ after hours. \n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/obttnaoueiw61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0b1a918c030d69646aa7f4915def8c13f1007\n\n Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**MicroVision ($MVIS)** has been trending for the last two weeks. To say that the stock had a wild ride for the last 2 weeks would be an understatement. The stock went from having less than 500 mentions to more than 15,000 mentions in the last 2 weeks. The sentiment has also been affected by the recent drop going from 24% last week to 15% this week.\n\n**Globalstar ($GSAT)** is a Mobile satellite service company incorporating themselves into many new areas. GSAT was up 50% on Monday causing the spike in chatter. There has been a lot of discussion on the company trading at a value less than what their satellites currently in orbit are worth.\n\n**Nokia($NOK)** has beaten all expectations in earnings report and the stock jumped 11%. Their net profit increased more than 11-fold to 375 million euros ($455 million) which was well above analysts' estimates for adjusted profit of 90 million euros. The extremely bullish outlook is also reflected in the sentiment figures.\n\n**Ocugen($OCGN)** was trending mainly due to their partnership with an Indian firm \u2013 Bharat Biotech which produces Covaxin. The vaccine was found to neutralize a new type of Covid-19 variant and Dr. Fauci has said that this might be very important against the current pandemic. Ocugen is planning to bring this COVID-19 vaccine to the US, pending FDA authorization.\n\n**Amazon($AMZN)** was generating discussions due to its pending earnings report. There was a lot of speculative talk about a stock split. But they delivered beats on overall revenue and AWS revenue and far exceeded EPS estimate for Q1 2021.\n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nCan I use the code/is it open source: Yes.\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "id": "n2i6oj", "created_utc": 1619875150.0, "score": 271, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "Unfortunately by the time any stock gets this kind of recognition, it's too late, you've already missed the boat.", "score": 128, "replies": [{"body": "Basically, I bought OCGN as a yolo with my dads entire portfolio that I manage for him back in December, started with 2K he gave me, flipped it to 3200 in oil stonks and then yolo\u2019d that to OCGN at 2.60 a share for 1240 shares, been riding the rocket ever since and only now are people noticing it here lmao", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "I wish my daddy had a portfolio or 2k to give me instead he saw me as a dumb ape the day I arrived and got the fuck outta town.", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "good man", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "How else you gonna learn to pull yourself up by your bootstraps", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07146381586790085}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1834842562675476}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15792904794216156}, {"body": "Me too.\n\nIts the perfect excuse for emotional trading; my daddy didn't love me \ud83e\udd72", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42206287384033203}, {"body": "![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13849785923957825}, {"body": "F", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19208088517189026}, {"body": "Your dad left town too and got mauled by a giant ape and never returned?

Cloudflare vs. Fastly Overview\n4. Content Delivery & Network\n5. Serverless Computing - The Event Driven Network\n6. Conclusion\n\n[Fastly on Reddit's r\\/place](https://preview.redd.it/1oeznj8egmw61.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=a37e37ac8e96397360cfe98e2ca67fff72b18693)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n**Expectation: Acquisition by Google.**\n\nI discuss how to think about Fastly as an investment to folks who have reasoned that investing in cloud compute and networking is a good idea but may not necessarily understand how or why it\u2019s a good idea. We focus on basic networking and the consequences of \u201cserverless\u201d computing; an architecture that has gained popularity in recent years.\n\nI\u2019ve written about Cloudflare before in May 2020, on an account called u/codingprofessor, before taking DD writing more seriously. I claimed that Cloudflare would blow past $60 dollars and was critically undervalued due to COVID economics, their current position in web security, and serverless computing. I still view that Cloudflare and Fastly can both reach 40B+ marketcaps by 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Don't doubt your vibe](https://preview.redd.it/bgr8i8qmmjw61.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bf7e7d98c3282535be6240c354322969fdd4bb1)\n\n# Purpose\n\nTo be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can outpace Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or The Motley Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that often gets filtered out.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation. Here are some recent DDs:\n\n* [Understanding Fintech: Square, Jay-Z, and the Future of Neobanks From an Industry Engineer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m50k8j/understanding_fintech_square_jayz_and_the_future/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Understanding Social Networks: Pinterest\u2019s Idea Search Engine, Women\u2019s Influence, and What Google+ Got Wrong. $PINS DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8jd87/understanding_social_networks_pinterests_idea/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [\\*SIGH\\* Understanding GameStop: Ryan Cohen, Customer Service, and The Great Long.

I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Cloudflare vs. Fastly\n\n**- TL;DR Fastly makes stuff faster, Cloudflare is more general purpose. They can be used together.**\n\n[Support](https://preview.redd.it/8nw4s6mlojw61.png?width=1220&format=png&auto=webp&s=0060e02dd4363ce7e7cc4cf3b59b3438603b9bc7)\n\nThis is a common question that is asked by investors interested in the cloud computing space from both novices and experts alike. In my view, the comparison isn\u2019t very useful and usually illustrates some misunderstanding between the two product spaces. Fastly is focused on real-time services and acts as an optimizing layer for existing network providers. Cloudflare is a general network competitor. You can use both, and most do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[General purpose needs](https://preview.redd.it/8g9lk7uhwjw61.png?width=2314&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdaadd144aa9a0b64a37a3c05a6f236c965fefb6)\n\nIn a crude sense, Fastly focuses on convenience akin to the services provided by Costco, while players like Akamai or Cloudflare focus on the convenience brought to you by gas stations or companies like Walmart. It\u2019s not to say that one is better than the other, because it's not. They just solve different problems with completely different approaches. You may not go to Costco as often as you do Walmart, but when you go to Costco, you're picking up and utilizing a lot more.\n\nThis explains why Fastly takes the approach to generally co-operate with other service providers and is able to provide a range of services for things like Snapchat storage, Spotify network meshes, Google Cloud services, and other real-time demands from the tech industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"While a convenience store is generally closer to a person's home, it has a limited set of items for sale. If the person drives a few more miles to the supermarket, they could get all of their groceries in one trip. In this case, convenience stores represent the approach taken by the legacy CDN's with many local POPs and the supermarkets represent Fastly's approach with fewer, larger ones.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCloudflare has ambitions to compete with the likes of companies like Amazon and attempts to be a general purpose solution for networking on the internet - it wants to make the internet more accessible, safer, and fair. Fastly seeks to solve specific problems on the internet. So in a nutshell, one is a general solution and the other is a specialized solution.\n\nAn example of specialized needs provided by Fastly is like Reddit\u2019s execution of the r/place experiment in 2017 - which allowed millions of users to collaborate and draw an image together pixel by pixel with rules and regulations in real-time.\n\n[Real-time collaboration services meets art and communtiy.](https://i.redd.it/2kf4qnoorjw61.gif)\n\nThis is only one example of many. The way I like to frame it is by viewing real-time and collaborative services as a relatively new economic need, and thus a product like Fastly has a high demand from organizations that excel with these kinds of services. You may see associations with Fastly from places like Spotify, Ticketmaster, or The New York Times - all of which have specific needs or demands when it comes to content delivery and network management.\n\n[world-class research](https://preview.redd.it/m9muspwsrjw61.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b18b1b49ed8aed906a2b9936beb1e29a5479a1)\n\nA big advantage that Fastly has in this regard is the fact that they often build their network with the intention of being world-class from top to bottom, from the code they write to the metals that build their points of presence. They are effectively able to choose their destiny as a product versus having to race the horses in competition. They research, experiment, and execute on the boundary of networking, making it a superb way to play the serverless and networking industry from a long point of view.\n\nThe result of this approach means higher quality servers and less need to rely on the number of PoPs used.  This ultimately means that Fastly spends less on building and maintaining servers while being an order of magnitude faster at the same time. They are efficient and provide value per the dollar spent on their network from customers and internal alike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[the capex equation](https://preview.redd.it/s9n1xm5zrjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e97432b694a884e1445db1793377e0f3eefa8c)\n\nCloudflare's team of course counters this by saying that speed is not nearly as important as Cloudflare's ability to be compliant to global requirements. This is completely nonsense if you consider that in the long-term, Fastly's general approach is to solve specific problems rather than to function as a general purpose network.\n\nThe compliance debate is a bogus marketing attempt when Fastly's speeds, in the microseconds, is exponentially faster than Cloudflare's serverless implementation that sits in the milliseconds range. This is frankly an example of how Matt Prince is warmer to investors and plays a stronger marketing game than Artur Bergman, who seemingly could not care to impress Wall Street funds and plays for the long-term.\n\n[Matt Prince's Hierarchy of Developer's Needs](https://preview.redd.it/9afefjyasjw61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=af129b27bf734c74c0d8a039341ff03b126af5c1)\n\nWhy does this distinction matter? Well what of the requirements where networking speed and response times are critical, like hospital communications, stock market crashes, wildfires, or other problems unique to the challenges of running a network?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The way to think about this is, what do you pay for, right? I mean if you -- and where are these moments that are valuable. When Tiger Wood walks down with the 18th green the Masters and God willing he is able to do that again, that matters, that moment matters. Everyone is going to tweet about it, and everyone wants to see it, the company that is in charge of that cares desperately about that content. When you send a gift across the Internet, like it's not monetized in the same way, it's not as valued.. So where we have seen the value is in content that is highly valuable to customers and their end consumer, where they're willing to pay for it and the quality, and the security and the scale of that deeply matters. And we have always focused our work on that type of content. There's plenty of content that just scrapes by and is low commodity. Every month, they want a lower price. That's a different market from our perspective, and we're not in it.\" - Fastly CEO\n\n# Understanding Content Delivery\n\n**- TL;DR You have data, you cut the data into smaller pieces, send it across a network, and rebuild those pieces somewhere else.**\n\n[The global cache](https://preview.redd.it/a92mp9wesjw61.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=c98e66b61a7b13f89a4556399c8264a038bb16ac)\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to understand the 7  steps that protocols take as they travel across and through a network around the world. This model is known as the OSI model and it\u2019s not necessarily the end-all-be-all model that governs the internet; but it is a useful framework to understand at a glance.\n\nThere are many complexities that go behind these protocols and they are the subject of intense debate or research. At the same time, many of these steps follow a similar process - translate or transform the data that\u2019s received and sent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Edge computing, an extension of the cloud.](https://preview.redd.it/r5k1yknbyjw61.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=60bbe4420f4025c8c791d62c569453ce82a8a8b0)\n\nFor example, the web browser translates the data into machine bytecode in a similar way that a networking router will need to translate information into a stream of 0 and 1 signals. This may not make too much sense yet, but just remember that it\u2019s just a series of translations and preparations of data into different segments so that it could be read and understood by other pieces of hardware.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Email, zoom calls, pins, streams, different network flavors.](https://preview.redd.it/kvhajfjtujw61.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&s=2570ebd03b9fd5c08989b0b5551d9eea2c5c3c44)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Application Layer:** You initiate a Zoom call. It has passed through the application layer using an real-time messaging protocol. It sends the video to the presentation layer.\n2. **Presentation Layer:** The video data is received and compressed. It gets sent to the session layer.\n3. **Session Layer:** A communication session is initiated. A network communication is initiated, with various receivers at some set of defined internet address routes.\n4. **Transportation Layer:** The data is further segmented and prepared for transportation.\n5. **Network Layer:** Once the data has reached this stage, the segments are converted to packets.\n6. **Data Link Layer:** The data is sliced into frames and delivered to the physical layer.\n7. **Physical Layer:** The frames are converted into a bitstream of 0s and 1s as a way to represent that final stage of data representation, which are signals that along a physical medium like a cable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OSI Model](https://preview.redd.it/68fe020vsjw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f4ae86782c3c87978af6e4a9bf46d1b0f695347)\n\nAs the data reaches its destination, it goes through the 7 layer process again in the opposite direction, where the data is received at the physical layer and concludes at the application layer (the person who you sent an Zoom call to). There\u2019s a reason that the network use trucks or mail deliveries as ways to compare the process as it can be strikingly similar at times.\n\nWhat are the complexities related to delivering a letter, a box of clothes, or a Home Depot truck full of metals and wood? So that\u2019s the essence behind content-delivery networks - preparing information and delivering it with optimal paths.\n\nIt\u2019s worth taking some time to ponder and think about this. They may be words or ideas that you\u2019ve heard - routers, bitstreams, addresses, and so on. What is the difference between collecting a Pinterest pin, playing a Spotify stream, or setting up a Zoom call without a video? How do we utilize location data when it comes to COVID containment efforts? What are the consequences of correcting a news article, fact checking a social media post, or reconciling the differences in video game connections in a game like Call of Duty?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Networking meets human experiences](https://preview.redd.it/d5nbigz1tjw61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=d39cdad6269f4b7d224fff12e6c39adc60584d60)\n\nWith this developing model in mind, consider again how Cloudflare is particularly invested in the overall health of a network, while Fastly is primarily concerned with pushing the network further. They seek to solve different platforms, while having obvious overlaps at the same time.\n\n# Serverless Compute - The Event Driven Network\n\n**TL;DR Serverless allows software engineers to spend more time building products.**\n\n[The event driven network](https://preview.redd.it/lhez9rq6tjw61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb377d7a5f2c3d3995c4c56ec0a5b925a860e0f7)\n\nWhat serverless architecture accomplishes is that it adds programmability and portability to the cloud clusters and the network. There are two major benefits to serverless computing:\n\n1. It grants developers access to complex functions out of the box.\n\nFor example, if a developer wants to create a lightning fast application where taking an image of a crop plant returns some analysis about the health of the crop or warning signs that the crop image is showing, a serverless \"function-as-a-service\" can provide that capacity for a developer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bm6jwodptjw61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a9e9552a1f3874b8932e5baaabe5bf91c8fccd\n\nThat image is stored with the provider to improve the quality of future recommendations and output as well. Given that the image taker is likely situated in a rural area, edge computing like this allows the application to complete this process much faster than communicating to a central server that is in a much farther location.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Functions as a service](https://preview.redd.it/1trzui6ctjw61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=5501fee8d2a9a8e2e5bce681a6b86d6f48e69da3)\n\n2. It allows developers to spend more time working on application code rather than infrastructure tosupport it.\n\nImagine that a product that benefits off real-time services and events has particular problems handling the amount of traffic that reaches their servers. A perfect example of this are the server failures of Rob-in-the-hood during spikes of activity or Reddit's own ability to handle surges of logins, registrations, and activity after events like GME's stock market explosion. Other historical problems were things like World of Warcraft's expansion releases, where servers were effectively \"on fire\" and required round-the-clock support.\n\nEdge computing effectively offloads some of these problems from central servers by making the network more programmable and effective. If an application I wrote suddenly has to manage 1,000,000 users, a serverless architecture allows for intelligent \"autoscaling\" - which means that services like Fastly will handle those problems for me. This ultimately results in a metered pay-as-you-go system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The network as a utility](https://preview.redd.it/hq7l51wwtjw61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f88e8d28b452a5bf0a7d0c560e22e8b2ba0f7a)\n\nThe combination of these two benefits is pretty powerful, allowing a developer to essentially start up an idea from application to deployment at a much faster pace. I believe this should equip a reader with the ability to imagine the opportunity behind edge and serverless computing. Here are some simple questions I like to think about:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[we've all been there.](https://preview.redd.it/ydk0hfx7ujw61.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c506b4d99dfd7e7f512f9d304f5c1e8f53e52e9)\n\n\\- Can we improve the customer experience of swiping a card in a store or other network based currencies?\n\n\\- How do we improve the security of individual network-connected devices?\n\n\\- Are we able to improve the response times of emergency technologies like hospital or firefight dispatching?\n\n\\- Are we able to better measure online engagement and create new interactive experiences?\n\n\\- Will online video games require servers bounded by location?\n\n\\- Would we be able to change camera angles when watching a sports stream?\n\n\\- Can we improve the quality of industrial automation or logistics?\n\n\\- Are we able to extend programmability to \"node\" based products like windmill farms or electric vehicle charging stations?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ \ud83d\ude80](https://preview.redd.it/5otn5vekvjw61.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=14201da0292e3f895dc829239999889d0af43add)\n\nSome of these questions are asked by Fastly themselves, as they list the following subjects of interest in their S-1:\n\n1. **API acceleration**. Accelerate and secure critical API responses at the edge for delightful application experiences, such as instant hotel lookup based on location and real-time inventory updates between retail stores and their online storefronts;\n2. **IoT**. Process and secure data from connected devices at the edge for instant results for time-sensitive applications;\n3. **Cloud migration**. Seamlessly migrate from data center to cloud, hybrid or multi-cloud environments, enabling the customer to take advantage of the functionality and cost savings of one or more cloud providers\n4. **Enabling redactedchain (block)**. Cache and accelerate individual transactions on the redactedchain (block) in real time.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTL;DR Investing in some form of serverless computing is a good idea.\n\nYou may have noticed that I did not discuss financials. This is mostly because these details do not nearly weigh as much as the general understanding of the product, which is content-delivery and serverless computing. In my view, the economic consequence of these architectures far outweighs any other metric that could measure the future value of a company like Fastly. Most of my DD writing follows this principal; I'm far more focused on economic consequences and incentives of an industry player rather than data-points that can be fixed in time like a recent earnings or financial report.

This is the tourist ticket Shift4 Payments chairman Jared Isaacman bought, for himself and 3 other tourists.  Price undisclosed, but rumored to be about $220 million for the flight, and they will fly in September this year.  The space tourism company Space Adventures has also bought a Falcon 9 / Crew Dragon tourist flight like this one.\n\n2) Launch on Falcon 9 / Crew Dragon to visit the ISS for a week.  This is what Axiom Space bought from SpaceX--  The Ax-1 mission is all set for next spring, with 1 professional astronaut and 3 millionaire tourists.  Tom Cruise also signed up for a later Axiom-brokered SpaceX Crew Dragon flight to the ISS.\n\nThe only competitor to SpaceX in the orbital tourism market right now is Roscosmos, with their Soyuz rocket/capsule.

{"title": "CLOV volume price analysis", "selftext": "  \n\nHi fellow traders, this is my first time posting on WSB and wanted to share with you some TA using volume price analysis on CLOV. I got interested in CLOV recently and having profited a lot on GME (bought in shares and options in November). I felt this was my next big bet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2sx4id9ldlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fabd25308652e8c12e834d7e4f17b77e160b430\n\nFirst of all on the weekly chart, I see signs of the market maker buying during the bear market in this stock that lasted from January to March. At #1, we have a hammer candle with a deep lower wick on very high volume which signals that the market maker is trying to stop the downfall and failed. The stock pursued its fall and reached the buying climax by the market maker in March. I can see this with the high volume and deep lower wick. Having retraced a significant amount since its ATH, the market needed to test this level to see if all the sellers were out of the market. The $7 retest was successful on low volume as we can see with the small doji that printed on the chart in april. The retest was above the ATL signaling strength. The next 4 candles have higher highs, higher lows and very very high volume. The long upper wicks signal that insiders are trying to push the price down but are incapable of breaking the trend because the buying pressure is intense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4oo9rdmdlw61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=11d7e1ed18232b575526ec194f840d47fddaa3f4\n\nOn the daily chart, we see the buying climax with the white hammer having a deep lower wick that coincided with the general market bottoming out in March. #2 was an attempt to breakout on high volume but was unsuccessful; the market retreated on falling volume, which is bullish. #3 is a very interesting candle: the stock tried to breakout again but was pushed violently to the downside below $9 on insane volume. Insiders were very desperate to push this stock down. #4 was the breakout on again very high volume. Insiders were trying to push the stock down again but failed! The following candles saw a test of the commitment of the sellers (test of supply) and there was none! Instead, we saw the stock trending lower of declining volume, which is very bullish (this is where I pulled the trigger and got a fill at $9.42 once the stock started climbing again). It didn\u2019t take long for the stock to rise again on high volume, only to be suppressed once again. The battle isn\u2019t over with the bears, but the signals that the bulls are starting to take over are there when you look at price and volume. At the second to last candle we see a bearish candle called the dark cloud cover: it signals a short term downtrend. As we see with the last candle (inverted hammer), the volume is declining once again as sellers are not in the market. This could signal the end of this short-term downtrend, but we need more price action to confirm this. There is a case for a short squeeze in this stock, though I don\u2019t believe it will squeeze like GME since the percentage of the float shorted is nowhere near what GME was. Clearing the $14 mark on high volume is very important to see this stock soar to the ATH of $17.50 and beyond. The last candles on the chart signal a bumpy ride ahead; the bears will not give up easily but when they do, this bet will be a very rewarding one.\n\nP.S.: Don\u2019t take my word for it and do your own DD.\n\nCLOV 15$C 06/18 + 550 shares.", "id": "n2u41n", "created_utc": 1619911296.0, "score": 765, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 280, "comments": [{"body": "What\u2019s your timeline predictions?

But stop using soy wax we need the real poured beeswax to even stand a chance against hammers.  Most of the would would argue that a hammer crushes candle, but sometimes the hammer isn't big enough or the candle is just too tough to break down, and if the wick is deep enough they have to keep hammering as we pile more wax. \n\nIf the wax and wick keep getting added, then eventually the hammer will wear down and not be strong enough to pound our candles.  \n\nCandle makers hit the craft stores to load up on some deep wicks and keep the stove hot making more wax. \n\nSomeone in Spain go and release the bulls - They don't know how to open the gate on their own.
