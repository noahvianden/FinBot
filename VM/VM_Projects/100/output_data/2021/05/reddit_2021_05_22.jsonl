I saw MA\u2019s chart before I bought, and I noticed the wild price swings, but I also saw the general upward trend of higher highs and lows, which is why I\u2019m not worried about its ability to eventually recover again.\n\n2) SBUX - The stock was climbing from the moment I bought it\u2026until its earnings report. Then it recovered. Then it didn\u2019t. Yet despite its ridiculously high P/E ratio, it\u2019s Starbucks. Its brand is as loud as Coca-Cola or Disney. I doubt it stays down for long.\n\n1) OPY - When I was trying to find undervalued stocks, Oppenheimer\u2019s numbers made it an attractive buy. Then the recent panic over inflation hit, and OPY wasn\u2019t immune from the fall. Still, all indicators point to it being undervalued, and it\u2019s already shown the ability to recover at least once.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.\n\n# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**\n*****\n> The trading pattern of the past two weeks \u2013 particularly alongside cryptocurrency\u2019s movements \u2013 suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.\n*****\n> Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.\n*****\n> The Dow and S&P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.\n*****\n> A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.\n*****\n> \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.\n*****\n> The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.\n*****\n> \u201cB/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cIt tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we\u2019re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.\u201d\n*****\n> There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.\n*****\n> But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n*****\n> \u201cThe key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,\u201d said Boockvar. \u201cWhat will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.\u201d\n*****\n> The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.\n*****\n> # No correction yet\n> As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.\n*****\n> Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.\n*****\n> \u201cFor me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,\u201d said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. \u201cIn any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.\n*****\n> Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. \u201cYou should be in the cyclical parts of tech,\u201d he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.\n*****\n> Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%.

Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.\n*****\n> \u201cLast cycle, we had eight of those,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.\u201d\n*****\n> Knapp said it\u2019s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncertainty shock,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.\u201d\n*****\n> Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.\n*****\n> The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. \u201cThe thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,\u201d he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/SNr7XsYn/finvizmaps1.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/GtPPx3MS/finvizgroups1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.postimg.cc/ZY6LSjTF/alphatrends1.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.postimg.cc/WbjwbrzR/finvizfuts1.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/02qcMFtB/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Qddgc3c0/marketdata3.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/cJKQ5B93/spxsectors1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jS2NLhr1/marketpullbacklevels1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/dt4rsxgd/marketrallylevels1.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Q5m35tO.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/KvrQnfwv/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PKIAGRB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/IEcMlNw.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year\n\n> While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**\n\n> Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI-1.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month\n\n> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ\u2019s \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.\n\n> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to \u20131.1% while S&P 500\u2032s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/baf2bcec363b55b19e25cde2661623df/feae79c5b2f9f78d-88/s400x600/6b9c15c89838e0b90c212cd3faa79d598c7bc187.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong\n\n> The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**\n\n> Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.\n\n> Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**\n\n> Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.\n\n> Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**\n\n> Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**\n\n> In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**\n\n> Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-5.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady\n\n> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,\u201d Benjamin Franklin\n\n> The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**\n\n> Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**\n\n> As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-ITB.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators\n\n> The S&P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n> Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n> Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**\n\n> Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n> The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**\n\n> Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

Note I said easiest, not most effective. The most effective one would be to just write a program that creates that overview by pulling Google finance data, determining its industry and labeling the boxes.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "How.", "score": -21, "replies": [{"body": "You have to learn that yourself, for programming I will most certainly not give you a full tutorial.\n\nFor Excel, use the googlefinance functions which allows you to get the price of the opening and closing price of today, or the opening price and current price of today (depending on if you want to make it after market closes, you can also use closing price of the last day to include after hours and pre market changes).\n\nNow you need to determine what company belongs to which sector, I assume this is manually done, but there could also be a google finance command. None that I know though. This is used for grouping them together.\n\nOnce this is done you have to add the total of the sector to get the percentages of for each company within it's sector. If e.g. Amazon is 10% of it's entire sector, then your goal is that the volume of the box is equal to 10% of the entire sector it belongs to. By setting a standard size for the entire sector box you can determine what volume is needed for the Amazon box (in length and width) while attempting to keep length and width the same size (at least to gain boxes, though it looks like this is flexible here to make fit for everything. Point is it's supposed to be accurate and similar for most, at least).\n\nNow comes the more complicated part of what belongs to what. This might be possible via some sort of graph I am not familiar with, but if I had to do this I would do it via a VBA macro. Since I calculated the length and width I can use a sheet where I use the cells as squares, meaning same length and width. Each square is supposed to represent a certain measuring size, like 0.1cm x 0.1cm. This would also represent 1% market cap. Note that this is super simplified and the actual sheet might require thousands, if not more, single 0.01cm x 0.01cm to give an accurate picture.\n\nBack to the macro, you take the length and width and fill out these areas. There is a ton of fine tuning that can be done here, e.g. pre-calculating where the top 10 have to be to make a fitting image (if you have a total of 10cm x 10cm and 2 companies combined have a length of 6cm and 3cm, then this will look weird as 1cm is left unused). I assume here scaling would be effective, or simply morphing values to make them fit. Morphing can't be done to all values, so it would be off by a slight amount. In above example of 6 and 3 cm that would be 66% of the 1cm for the 6 size one (6/9=0.66=66%) and 0.33 cm for the 3cm to keep the same ratio. Scaling is technically the same, except it would be on all sides equally.\n\nLastly the macro only has to take in the original calculation you did (current price/opening price or whatever you are looking for) to calculate the difference. Depending on the value you can choose a range of colors to use. VBA allows you to use RGB colors, meaning you can simply use a basic number, multiply it by the outcome of the division and based on that color the cells. That will lead to darker red if its deep negative and darker green if deep positive. Now you just take the hight of the cells you just colored and add a title to it, I would probably just use the top row of it, type in the ticker name (here: AMZN), add the profit or loss behind it, then combine all the cells that belong to it's width and finally select all cells I colored and put a frame around them. This can easily be done since you calculated in the beginning what cells are supposed to be colored, so you have the measurement readily available. For something like the title you just take less cells. You can even set a font size depending on the amount of width and length to make it fitting, so a 50x50 cell would have a larger font than a 10x10 would have.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "3 cm is 1.18 inches", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1149551123380661}], "tickers": ["amzn", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.011155229061841965}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12852390110492706}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I mean like put stocks/crypto I choose like that", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "Its called a tree map.

{"title": "$BABA is Now A Value Stock with 50% Upside - Time to Load Up", "selftext": "First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 3 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I loaded up shares at $212 after these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that cause no harm to the environment, something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yes (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, just 10% off it's 52 week low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow what REALLY caused me to go all in was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO.  For Munger to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says \"We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.\" $BABA fear has been baked in, and now I plan to back up the truck.", "id": "niiukt", "created_utc": 1621690778.0, "score": 213, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 227, "comments": [{"body": "Now if only you could actually invest in the company instead of some unrelated holding company based in the Cayman islands.", "score": 201, "replies": [{"body": "That 'unrelated shell company' do own shares of 9988.

I doubt very much that BABA would go bankrupt, especially with their market strength/position. \n\nFinally, the political risk. This one has been around literally since BABA first listed on NYSE. While this one definitely is the biggest risk as a foreign investor, I'm confident that a 500B market cap company **won't** get delisted from an American Exchange as it brings in way too many liquidity. They'll always come to an agreement. And for the anti-monopolistic violations, it's already in the past.

(And since the disclaimer says this was written by some random blog, these critiques are not directed at the OP).\n\nFirst off, let me just point out that economists actually do not agree on how to measure inflation. No, \"more money printed\" is not inflation. No, \"more money velocity\" is not inflation. No, \"price of gas/milk/homes/[other specific commodity] is going up\" is not inflation. It's a mixture of all of these, weighted somewhat arbitrarily, and almost all think tanks have their own metric on measuring it. Even looking at the government's metric for inflation isn't perfect, as a 10% spike in used car prices is contributing to most of the scary inflation value coming out of April.\n\nInflation going back to ancient history is also slightly misguided, as inflation is specifically tied to fiat currency and not to goods in general. More animal skins to trade is not akin to economic principle of inflation; animal skins have a base use value as a commodity, not exclusively as a currency, so their being devalued is a supply increase, distinctly different from inflation. The coins example from Rome is better, but fraudulent coins and government crackdowns on that area are a better indicator of the loss of value than simply more in circulation.\n\nGermany ~1920 did experience hyperinflation, and the cause is aptly described with the Treaty of Versailles debt (every country printed money for war; it was not the unique causative factor). The lessons learned are not accurate though. Money does not need some standard backing to be valuable: the US dollar is the world reserve currency because of trust and faith in the US' ability to honor that obligation, or, in other words, the US is the world's hegemon and declared its currency is super valuable and nobody had the balls to tell us we're wrong in the face of our massive military. In fact, it is entirely necessary for any sovereign country's currency - if it wants a sound economic policy - to NOT have a tangible backing, so that under a crisis such as a pandemic, they can inject cash into the system to prop it up (this was the biggest lesson of the 2008 financial crisis).\n\nSo now we get to the argument of why inflation will rise, and none is convincing. Yes, we printed a lot of money this past year; yes, a good chunk of that money went into the hands of regular people. But as I stated above, none of this actually means inflation will be significantly high in the foreseeable future. More money is created by bank lending than federal reserve policy - significantly more. This is why the US is primarily considered a debt-driven economy: money I put in the bank is lent out to you who buys assets that goes into another person's bank which lends it out to someone else, so on and so forth, a multiplicative effect of spending ability stemming from my initial deposit. The fed printing dollars (or changing numbers on a spreadsheet to be exact) is no different, except that the Fed is doing it, not your local JP Morgan.\n\nThe thing is, the Federal Reserve historically does not often hit its 2% per year inflation goal, usually hovering around 1.8%. This means our economy could take a little higher inflation like 2.4% for a year or two and be fine. But even if 2021 hits 2.4% inflation or higher, it's still going to be marginally impactful because 2020 was a deflationary year! If you extrapolate our inflation from Feb 2019 to now, we're exactly where we would be without a pandemic: a ~1.9% YoY inflation level. We're not on the verge of a hyperinflation to 50%. We're not about to see the collapse of the American economy. We're not about to see gold prices spike to 5x overnight.

Real estate has similarly shot up in value since the 1960's, but even if the US dollar were originally backed by land (\"One dollar for one acre of land!\"), we wouldn't measure today's purchasing power to real estate. When using the word inflation, it's proper to treat it as the scientific term it is, and not some stand-in for a commodity's price going up.\n\nTo bring in the WSB angle, yes, people can still make money off of inflation-resistant goods like gold and silver. Someone who YOLO'd into silver in 1960 probably would be pretty rich today. That's a solid investment strategy, but a 60-year hold doesn't strike me as WSB's modus operandi. And since hyperinflation is not right around the corner, it's unlikely people will make significant money overnight (unless other people buy it because they also believe gold will spike, but that's a different story with different game theory).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06544436514377594}, {"body": ">Money does not need some standard backing to be valuable: the US dollar is the world reserve currency because of trust and faith in the US' ability to honor that obligation.\n\nThen explain to me what happened in the 70s when USD left the Gold Standard.
