{"title": "I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!", "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find last weeks post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nj7tco/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!   \n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/ke62zgv6o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=67333daccbb4aefc351eff62aad5e9d8b0f1d40b)\n\nOverall, it was a good week for meme stocks in the market. It took a 176% rally in AMC stock price in one week to finally dethrone GME and become the most discussed stock of the week.  GME is a close second and had an exceptional week in the market. Virgin Galactic also made into the top 10 list due to them successfully completing their spaceflight. Another newcomer to the list is BlackBerry. If a stock could run for President, it should probably be BlackBerry as the percentage of people who have a bullish outlook on the stock far outweighs any other stock which is reflected in the sentiment. Electric car makers are still continuing to generate interest following the launch of Ford\u2019s F150 lightning. \n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**  \n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kpnkug68o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88d4c286c7bf60e4e94cbf0ac3760cba0a90b35)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks in the list.\n\n**Virgin Galactic ($SPCE):** \n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/6b1p1y39o9271.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f64d87ae205fce62b2be427ecd81638af12b868)\n\nNo points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft (pictured above) reaching space. This marked the company\u2019s first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022. Wall Street analysts have flip-flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33% and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation (a 50% hike). Overall, the company has already reached the consensus 12-month price target of $31.20 and has risen a cool 25% in the last week.\n\n**Beyond Meat($BYND):** The stock has rallied 28% last week mainly following commentary from CNBC's Jim Cramer. On his Mad Money show, Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze. He specifically noted that almost 25% of $BYND shares are held short, setting up a scenario for sharp gains. Since Wednesday, there has been a continuous stream of $BYND YOLO\u2019s and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion.\n\n**BlackBerry($BB):** shares jumped as much as 12% Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks. One important thing to note here is BlackBerry's short interest still remains below 10% of shares outstanding, meaning any short squeeze wouldn't have too much room to run. [This](https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/) article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation.\n\n**NVIDIA($NVDA):** announced a stellar quarter with revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier, and Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. They are projecting a record $6.3B revenue next quarter. The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8.4% this week. Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product, I don\u2019t expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon.\n\n**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** was trending as the stock passed the $1-mark last Friday. For those who are not familiar with the company, it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost $3 within one month last February. With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of $1, interest seems to be picking up.\n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\n**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\n**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also (eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "id": "noc6r0", "created_utc": 1622384457.0, "score": 581, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "So in other words 100 11$ Jun 4 BB calls next week will get me lambo ?", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "Yep", "score": 30, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1061725914478302}, {"body": "Let me tell you why BB is the play:\n1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they\u2019ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.\n2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it\u2019s that much easier to double.\n3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don\u2019t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn\u2019t called BB it would be 100+ by now.\n\nhttps://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/\n\n4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it\u2019s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that\u2019s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don\u2019t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.\n5.

After watching George Gammon's videos all night, I've been studying Paul Franke's article this morning titled *The Great 2021 Bond Market Collapse* and making sure what I've been reading/watching are correlating with his hypothesis. Below are the most important notes from his article I sent to my spouse; Burry is absolutely right to short TLT *and* TSLA (TSLA is grossly overvalued). Regarding treasuries, this is scary shit. I want to warn my family about a financial collapse but know they'd look at me like I was crazy... I probably shouldn't even bother telling my therapist. She'll just tell me to \"stay in the present.\" hah\n\nThe Great 2021 Bond Market Collapse  \nhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4413979-great-2021-bond-market-collapse  \nCPI = Consumer Price Index  \nGDP = Gross Domestic Product  \nYOY = Year Over Year  \nNote 1:  \n\u201cTo artificially drive interest rates lower for the common good over the last 12 months, the FED under Chairman Powell has purchased nearly $4 trillion in Treasuries, added mortgage securities, and even acquired corporate bonds to stabilize prices after the coronavirus pandemic recession of 2020. In total, measured from the Great Recession bond buying program begun under Chairman Bernanke in 2008, **the FED\u2019s balance sheet has risen $7 trillion. For perspective, $1 trillion in FED assets was accumulated over the previous 95 years of the central bank\u2019s existence**. These quantitative easing efforts have injected $7 trillion in paper money and liquidity ($23,000 per U.S. citizen, $92,000 for a family of four) into the financial system the last 12 years, **producing the biggest bond/stock bubble in the financial world\u2019s history.**  \nAt some point soon, if interest rates are not allowed to free float again, **either capitalism will be supplanted by complete government management of the economy like other socialist experiments that ultimately failed miserably, and/or confidence in our currency by foreigners could implode.\u201d**  \nNote 2:  \n\u201cWell, with loan rates still being held underwater by record Federal Reserve interference in the world\u2019s primary bond market, the 2021 rate picture could quickly become the most detached from reality since 1966. **The projected 6% gap between nominal GDP growth in the second half of the year and the current 10-year Treasury rate is absolutely horrible news for bond investors.**   \nAnalysts are boosting their growth and inflation forecasts, with Americans on the cusp of getting stimulus checks under President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion package. The average projection for nominal gross domestic product hit a 32-year high of 7.6% in Bloomberg surveys. Even after doubling to 1.6% since November, 10-year bond rates can barely keep up with the growth upgrade, leaving the gap between the two likely to be the largest since Lyndon Johnson was President.   \nNote 3:  \n**The last time nominal GDP to bond market yields was this out of whack with reality came during the rising inflation 1960s and spiking inflation 1970s.** While some of us have been suggesting investors look to inflation hedges since the FED announced \u201cunlimited money printing\u201d efforts last March, the reality of 3% to even 4% YoY CPI gains by the summer is only now sinking into mainstream thought on Wall Street.\u201d  \nNote 4:  \n\u201c**Warren Buffett** (CEO of Berkshire Hathaway), in his annual report letter to shareholders released late in February, specifically mentioned **fixed-income investors face a \u201cbleak future\u201d as inflation and economic growth accelerates after the pandemic.** Jamie Dimon (CEO JP Morgan Chase) correctly and aptly recommended investors shun the Treasury market back in early December. **He said he would not touch the U.S. government bond market with a 10-foot pole**, much less consider buying securities at today\u2019s record low yields.\u201d  \nNote 5:  \n\u201cIf the FED refuses to raise short-term savings rates and/or allow long-bond yields to increase a further 1-2% this spring, **we could see a complete loss of confidence in the dollar\u2019s exchange rate, forcing foreigners to liquidate U.S. financial assets.** And we desperately need overseas capital with our staggering structural sovereign deficit borrowing needs of $2+ trillion each year, alongside the $5-7 trillion mountain of annual refunding requirements.  \nNote 6:   \nIf they (FED) don\u2019t allow a bond market rout (likely cascading to a stock market tank similar to 1987), **even bigger issues with our currency will hit like a bomb later in 2021.** Compared to a relatively stable U.S. currency situation for decades, none of us in America have experienced a true currency crisis, **or what repercussions a 30-50% drop in the dollar would unleash on world trade and wealth movements.** \\[For example, given a Yuan to dollar value increase of 40%, the Chinese economy would almost overnight become the largest in the world, passing America with a gracious wave as they zoom by the former #1.\\]  \nNote 7:  \nThe flip side is a **FED adding fuel to the inflation fire by continuing to interfere in Treasury security, corporate debt and mortgage markets.** If that is our future, I fully **expect a dollar tank will be the release valve for those wanting to express their disappointment in America\u2019s failing economic experiment in socialism.** A total train wreck in the dollar\u2019s exchange rate could quickly lead to even higher inflation and interest rates in 2022, nicely above 5%.\u201d  \nNote 8:  \n\u201cMy gut feeling is the March 2021 world is looking a lot like the middle of 1987, which I traded. A weakening dollar, record money printing, a super-strong +50% stock market advance over six months, spiking commodity prices, an upturn in the economy, and a zig-zagging lower bond market were ingredients of the 40% equity market crash over less than seven weeks into October 1987. Sound familiar? **The scary difference to consider is today\u2019s stock market is the most overvalued in history, based on total market capitalization to GDP output, price to tangible book value, and price to underlying business sales.**  \n**Playing the FED\u2019s current game of manipulation, guaranteed to outline amazing losses in asset purchasing power, spells real trouble for funding Uncle Sam going forward, at a time of record need.\u201d**  \nNote 9:  \n**\u201cTLT remains the \"poster child\" bond investment to Avoid or Sell. I am modeling another 20-30% price decline, on top of the 13% loss in 2021 to date,** assuming coronavirus herd immunity is being reached into June and the FED realizes its aggressive easing mantra has reached checkmate.  \nI have been short TLT off and on since December. **My battle plan today is to reenter a small short position in the $136-138 area**, on a minor rebound following last week's beat down. This position is a good candidate for a straight 10% stop-loss level (buy-stop in this case) on my sale price. If my thesis is correct, more intense bond selling is right around the corner with robust and upgraded economic/inflation numbers reported by the government.  \nReal estate holdings, **REITs**, oil/energy conglomerates, and utilities as income alternatives seem to **have better odds of maintaining their purchasing power years down the road.** However, these investments may also suffer losses in a stock market debacle, before rebounding.\u201d  \nNote 10 (holy shit):  \n**\"I can think of just two events that could prevent a bond market implosion the rest of 2021. Scenario #1: the FED talks the big New York City banks into intentionally crashing the stock market first, thus relieving the building consumer confidence, spending and inflationary pressures. Scenario #2: variants of the coronavirus unaffected by current vaccination formulas make a big comeback in April-May, forcing new economic disruptions, lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, like those appearing in Europe this weekend.** So yes, we may be stuck with a number of rotten realities to choose from right now.  \n**If you pair short sales in weaker securities like bonds against relatively undervalued names continuing to witness strong buying, your portfolio can rise in value even if the wheels fall off our financial markets.** That's how I am positioned.\u201d  \n   \nThe 1987 stock market crash: Original news report:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0\\_8YEglCFdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_8YEglCFdU)  \n\n\n*tl/dr: The market is fucked.

But its way more they have deep learning meaning the company has software that studies the costumers behavior and proposes to them products. This has lead to 70% of sales not being from searches but from the menu.\n\nThey use a discovery based menu which is very attractive and also focus on personalized browsing just like tik tok does deep learning at its finest.\n\nThey collect data from more than 100 million users every month to personalize the menu even more giving them a very unique advantage. Using data is the key to success here because they use data to get better and more effective ads to maximiaze returns and conversion .\n\nGrowth\n\nThey grew revenue from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate of 31% and from $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 32% revenue is diversified and global. In 2019, 93% of our revenue was from marketplace services, 84% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 16% of which was from our native advertising tool, ProductBoost, and 7% was from logistics services.\n\nThey refer to marketplace revenue, excluding revenue from ProductBoost, as core marketplace revenue. ProductBoost is an advertising feature by which our merchants can promote their listings within user feeds.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 82% of revenue was from marketplace services, 90% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 10% of which was from ProductBoost, and 18% was from logistics services.\n\nIn terms of geographic diversification by users, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 43% of core marketplace revenue came from Europe, 42% from North America, 5% from South America, and 10% from the rest of the world growth has been highly capital efficient.\n\nThey have been able to achieve this massive growth and scale by having net cumulative cash flow from operations of $16 million from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2020, aided by their positive cash float, where they receive an upfront payment from a user, and remit payment to a merchant a number of weeks later.\n\nMerchants\n\nThey are basically the middle man that connects millions of costumers with merchants. They also provide them with value data to help them do more sales and expand even more. Analytics and data is a key part of their business and it should not be ignored\n\nWhat's is not so great about them\n\nThey grew to fast and have some problems with logistics\n\nThere have been some serious delays and even packages missing. They will need to use money from going public to solve this matter and get better at serving costumers.\n\nThere business model is to expand advertise and get new costumers. But their problems in logistic could cause them problems with visitor retention and i want to see improvements here.\n\n# Conclusion and My Point of View :\n\nI'm not hoping that it will be the next amazon probably will not be,but  if the management hundle All the challenges and go profitable, this can have huge upside, and even without that, it have already a great upside potential (That's why average target analysts is about 24$).\n\nStill not entered Indian market wich can be huge.\n\nWish Local And wish logistics (logistic as a service) : Great potential.", "id": "nolcn9", "created_utc": 1622410981.0, "score": 1272, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 382, "comments": [{"body": "Here\u2019s what I read.
