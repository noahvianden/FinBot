This spike blindsided me. Bought shares at $8.83 and sold a 6/18 $9c for $0.41 premium. The call is down $391 (-950%). The shares are up $430 (+48%). So I could close this and still have ~$40 which is basically the premium. Is this wise to ride the shares higher, do I just buy more shares and let these ones get called away, or do I just watch the ship sail without me? I entered to get that juicy $0.41 premium (oof) so sticking with that says I should stay the course and get assigned, but damn the gains are huge. What would you do?\n\n2) AMC long puts. I keep losing on these. Started with $13p last week, then a $14p this week, and now I just opened a $41p and $43p today, all expiring a week to a month out. How hard will IV crush be if this drops? Should I sell some puts to reduce cost/will that help? Or try gamma hedging off a strangle? We've got to be near the peak right? Right?\n\n3) MNMD long calls and short puts/early exercise. I bought $2.50 calls and sold $2.50 puts. I really want to lower my basis ASAP and wouldn't mind just buying them now. This is stupid though since I could just wait to see if it rises, and the premium I paid would put me at a loss, correct? However, the lower basis would also put my long shares into a gain position. This is just red green psychology though I think right, dollar wise I'd be losing from throwing away the premium. Can you confirm?\n\nI've got too many moving parts at the moment.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Bought shares at $8.83 and sold a 6/18 $9c for $0.41 premium.\n\nStrike price was too low. You want to write CC calls at 30 delta OTM. Why did you pick a strike that was so close to your share price?\n\nYou should almost always let winning CCs get assigned. If the current share price is way above your strike price, just let it expire and enjoy the profit you collected (and you would have collected more profit if you had picked a higher strike price).\n\nIt doesn't matter if the share price is much higher than your strike. You couldn't have known that when you opened the trade. FOMO is not a good reason to make trading decisions.\n\nThe only time you would close/roll the call instead of letting it be assigned is if the profit you make by doing so is *much* greater than the profit you make by letting it get assigned. Break-even of $40 does not qualify as \"much greater\".\n\n> AMC long puts. I keep losing on these.\n\nIn general, don't go long (puts or calls) on meme stocks. You are paying a ginormous premium in IV that almost always works against you.\n\nYou made a bad trade that is demonstrating why it was a bad trade. Why would you continue to hold a bad trade? Cut losses early, not late.\n\n> MNMD long calls and short puts/early exercise. I bought $2.50 calls and sold $2.50 puts. I really want to lower my basis ASAP and wouldn't mind just buying them now.

It depends on when expiration is and how much the net cost/credit was on the synthetic. And, as per above, going long on meme stocks is a bad play in general, even if you can mitigate that somewhat with the short put.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Wow thanks for hitting all three points.\n\nBB) I picked the $8.83 and $9c with the idea that it was trading pretty flat and maybe even downward. Added to that is my own issue of needing an easy win after a bad streak, so this was 'easy money,' which turned out to be a bit too true. I definitely locked in my $40 so I got that going for me, and I can take the W which is technically what I wanted so yay? I can see now I should've set my sights a bit higher but premiums sucked. Side question, say I sold a $10c for like $0.20 instead (I don't remember what it was), wouldn't my return would be pretty similar since it'd still be deep ITM by now?\n\nAMC) This stock just isn't worth $40+ IMO but here we are at over $60. High IV puts scare me and are high risk, but at the same time it's not like nobody touches these, they are fairly priced after all. Should they mainly be used for hedges then rather than just going long? I don't plan to hold these for more than a couple days max due to IV crush, but I'm also having trouble remembering the formula to predict future IV, this is Black-Scholes right? It just has to come down eventually, and likely hard is my guess. Maybe I should do vertical puts instead?\n\nMNMD) This is my strong conviction stock. I want to buy more and more and more. But when I buy more at $3.15 the price drops to $3.05 or something, then comes back to $3.15 by EOD. Basically I keep missing the dips. So I'm thinking I can get way under them by just exercising early and buying for $2.50 to lower basis. I've got 7/16 $2.50c for $0.91, currently worth $0.88. So that'd be like paying $3.41 per share which is bad... OK talking through this makes this obvious, don't exercise early or at least wait til it's around $3.50 to beat breakeven.\n\nSince MNMD seems settled for my question, just looking at BB and AMC, which are both memes, what's the play then for when these eventually crash? Puts are expensive but that's also how you bet on a drop. Do spreads instead? How to capture the downward movement? I'd like to avoid short selling or at least have a super secure hedge since I haven't sold stocks short before.\n\nTLDR: Some rambling, some clarification, some further questions.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> but I'm also having trouble remembering the formula to predict future IV,\n\nYou probably mean comparing to IV Rank/IV Percentile. It probably won't be useful, because a meme stock doesn't really pay attention to its history. It basically defies history and logic.\n\n> It just has to come down eventually, and likely hard is my guess. Maybe I should do vertical puts instead?\n\nYeah, but when is the question? And it might not be a hard crash. As more movie-going good news rolls in over the summer, this situation could go for months and then slowly decline over more months. Meanwhile, you are paying all that extra for IV.\n\nA call credit spread would mitigate IV. You make a trade-off by capping your profit in order to net vega to near zero.

Throughout the day I opened some pretty horrible AMC straddles but was able to leg out of them for profit on most. IV gain beat a losing put on one of them which was lucky.

I'd be loaded right now if I still had my $14c I bought last week, but I sold it when underlying hit like $15 since apparently I'm a bear now.

I am interested in selling a call option on this stock. I believe this referred to as a covered call.\n\nLooking at the available options, I see a $2.50 strike is paying $0.05 per share, expiring June 11.If I were to go forward with this, selling 5 contracts I would make 500\\*$0.05, or $25.00. Assuming someone wants to purchase this option.\n\nThe purchaser may only exercise the contract until markets close on June 11 (4pm Eastern time).

I expect the purchaser would only do this if the actual value of the stock were to climb above $2.55, since this would be the total cost per share including the option premium. Theoretically, if the actual value of the stock were to go to $5.00, the purchaser of the contracts would be profiting the remaining value ($5.00 - $2.55 = $2.45 per share)\n\nAs long as the value of the stock remains under $2.55 until the expiration date June 11 (purchaser chooses to not exercise the contract), I keep the stocks and the $25 premium.  At this point, I could sell another covered call option if I want.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You got it mostly right, except for this:\n\n>I expect the purchaser would only do this if the actual value of the stock were to climb above $2.55, since this would be the total cost per share including the option premium.\n\nThere is actually no specific one \"purchaser\" out there, but let's assume for a moment that there is.  Let's say I bought this call contract for 0.05, and the stock closes at 2.53 on expiration.  I have two choices: exercise or not exercise.  Just do the math in each case:\n\n1. Don't exercise.  The option expires worthless.  Overall, I lost $5 on this trade.\n2. Exercise.  I buy 100 shares at 2.50, and I can sell them for 2.53.  $253 - $250 = $3.  So I make $3 from the stock trade.  Subtracting the $5 I paid for the option, I only lost $2 overall on this trade.\n\nYou see? It's better to lose $2 than $5, so it's still better to exercise.  For a long option holder, it's always \"worth it\" to exercise an option that's ITM at expiration.  For this reason, the OCC automatically exercises all options that are even 1 cent ITM at expiration, unless they receive a notice from a brokerage not to.\n\nSee this link on [why breakeven isn't as important as you think it is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m0m7at/monday_school_your_breakeven_isnt_as_important_as/)  Another way to think of this is to look at the P/L diagram of a long call.  (I assume in your reading you've come across P/L diagrams?)  The breakeven point is just the point where you go from making *some* money to losing *some* money or vice-versa, not some binary switch where you jump from max profit to max loss.  And it's better to lose only a little bit of money than it is to lose your max loss.  Look at [Graph 2 here](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/call-option-profit-loss-diagram).  The breakeven point is 43, but you don't reach max loss until 40.  If the stock closed at 42.99 the person would only lose a tiny bit of money.\n\nFor this reason, if you have a short option, e.g., your covered call, you will get assigned if it's even 1 cent ITM at expiration.\n\nNow, about there being no one specific \"purchaser.\"  When you trade an option, you're not somehow linked to a particular seller or buyer on the other side of your transaction.  Yes, for you to sell, at that same moment someone else has to be buying.  That party is probably a market maker, not a retail trader like you.  And you don't know what they do after that, and don't care.  They could be buying to open, and then they could sell to close later and not have any position in that option.  They could be buying to close their own short position at the same moment you're selling to open, and thus no longer have any position in that option.  And when a long holder exercises, he is matched to someone, anyone, out there in the world with a short position, at random.

I am interested in selling a call option on this stock. I believe this referred to as a covered call.\n\nCorrect.\n\n> Looking at the available options, I see a $2.50 strike is paying $0.05 per share, expiring June 11.If I were to go forward with this, selling 5 contracts I would make 500*$0.05, or $25.00. Assuming someone wants to purchase this option.\n\nThere is information missing.\n\nHow much did you pay for the shares? You should never use a strike that is lower than the cost basis of the shares. If you bought the shares for an average of $3, the $2.50 strike is too low.\n\nThe recommended strike for opening a covered call is 30 delta out-of-the-money (OTM). This gives the best balance of risk vs. reward. What is the current price of the shares? That's what determines whether the $2.50 strike is OTM or not.\n\nIf you open 5 contracts, you must have at least 500 shares to cover the calls.\n\nAssuming all of the information above is filled in and suitable, the calculation of $25 net position premium is correct.\n\n> The purchaser may only exercise the contract until markets close on June 11 (4pm Eastern time).\n\nThat is an odd way to put it. First, there is no one \"purchaser\". You neither know nor care who bought the calls you sold. Most of the time, it will be a market maker who turned around and sold them again a few minutes later. The contract may change hands a dozen times before expiration day.\n\nAs the holder of a short call you may *theoretically* be assigned at any time, but in practice, early exercise is extremely rare. So you can basically assume that *as long as you close the position before expiration week, you will not be assigned*.\n\n> If the purchaser decides to exercise the contract, then they purchase the shares from me for $2.50 per share, earning me an additional $1250.00.\n\nWhich is why it would be a problem if you bought the shares for $3. You'd realize a $1250 - 1500 = $250 loss on exercise, less the credit on the call.\n\n> I expect the purchaser would only do this if the actual value of the stock were to climb above $2.55, since this would be the total cost per share including the option premium.\n\nIncorrect. As I noted above, the call could have changed hands many times for radically different prices than you sold it for. So you have no idea what price would make sense for the final holder of the contract to exercise.  And you shouldn't care either.  **Do not hold options to expiration (with some exceptions)**. Since exercise almost always happens at expiration, all of this analysis of what motivates an exerciser to exercise will be moot, because you will be out of the trade by that time.\n\nIn any case, by regulation, any long call (or put) that is still open at expiration and that is at least $0.01 in-the-money (ITM) will be exercised by exception, even if that means the final purchaser realizes a loss. That will mean there is a high certainty your matching open short call will be assigned. So that's another reason why the calculation of the purchaser's break-even point is irrelevant.\n\n> As long as the value of the stock remains under $2.55 until the expiration date June 11 (purchaser chooses to not exercise the contract), I keep the stocks and the $25 premium. At this point, I could sell another covered call option if I want.\n\nThat is a reasonable conclusion based on a false premise.\n\nYou should not care whether you keep the stock or not. All that matters is whether you hit your profit target or loss limit or maximum holding time. Those are your exit points.\n\nHere is a counter-example that proves the point: If you opened the CC 45 days to expiration (DTE) and on 30 DTE you have made a 20% profit on the position, which is 10% higher than your target, are you going to wait another 30 days just to see what might happen? Of course not. You are going to close the trade and collect your 20% profit right there and then.\n\nException as noted above: It does make sense to hold a **winning CC trade** to expiration, in order to capture the profit you originally targeted. For example, say you bought the shares for $1 and selling for $2.50 is a 150% gain on your capital, so you would be ecstatic to make that kind of gain. You write the call at $2.50 at 45 DTE and by 30 DTE the stock has risen to $2.60. You fist pump your good fortune. The stock continues to rise and by expiration day it is worth $5.21. You should still be happy. Your call will be assigned and you will get the $2.50 stock price you wanted for your 150% gain and you will keep the $0.05/share of credit as well. \n\nThe fact that you coulda/would/shoulda made more if you had not written the CC (the gain on the stock would have been much more than 150%) is just greed and hindsight and FOMO. It is not a reflection on the success/failure of the CC. It was clearly a success. The exact same thing would have happened had you not written a CC, you sold the shares when they hit $2.50 and then they hit $5.21 later.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, this is very helpful.  \n\n\nFor further clarification, the stock was purchased for $1.43 per share.\n\nIt seems that if the option expires unexercised, then I come away with $25 and I keep the stock, able to sell another covered call option.\n\nIf the option is exercised, then I come away with $1275 ($25+$1250), less the cost I originally paid for the stock.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Only true if you hold through expiration.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3421885669231415}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6459998488426208}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8421105742454529}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5851381421089172}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Short answer: That's not a good idea.

You basically turn your covered call into a call vertical spread. But every other expiration is bad also. If you go further out or closer in, you make a diagonal spread.\n\nYou can't hedge against the CC rising above your strike price. Everything you might do removes profit from the original CC or at least adds more risk to your total portfolio.\n\nMaybe the one thing you could consider is, if you are still a long ways from expiration and the stock rises close to $42.50, you can open an ATM call for a nearer expiration and still make a profit if the stock falls after that point. The cost of the long call has to be lower than the premium your collected on the CC, or else the whole trade loses money if the stock falls and stays down by expiration of the CC.\n\nThis still turns your CC into a spread (calendar in this case), but at least it is a spread that has a shot at making a profit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.011089954525232315}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13185575604438782}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You can't.

What you don't want to have happen is the short leg to go ITM (unless it is a debit spread and the long leg is also ITM).\n\n> Being I'm PDT, I can't close the spread the same day, so the next day, ABC falls below to $68.\n\nIt's still not clear if you are talking about expiration day or some earlier day. \n\nIf you are two weeks before expiration or w/e, you lose value on the long leg, but the short leg will gain value.

If the spread were narrower, the gain and loss would be pretty close together.  Of course, it's possible for the short leg to gain *more* than the long, if there is strike skew in your favor.

The higher IV is, the further from the expiration loss the value will be, in either direction (better or worse).\n\nIf it is expiration day and you hold through expiration, the short leg expires worthless and you keep the entire credit, which means you only have the loss on the call.

Every once in a while I revisit this on my head, and I always come to the same conclusion - this doesn't make sense and why do people say this all the time?\n\nMy points:\n\n1. income is income, no matter where it comes, and it can be used to spend wherever you want to spend. What's the reason to say that a specific income gets applied as a discount to a particular purchase? It makes the same (no) sense as if I found a dollar on the street and say that now my morning coffee is 1$ cheaper. Or conversely, why can't I say that I sell a covered call on my $AAPL shares and with that money I reduced my cost basis on my $MSFT purchase?\n2. more importantly, it doesn't make sense from a tax point of view. Tax-wise the money earned on CCs does not really reduce the basis when I report to the IRS. Moreover, if I hold long term, taxes on the CC income and on the stocks gains will likely be short-term for the CCs and long term for the stock. The only way options \\*really\\* affect the cost basis of the stock is if I get assigned on a CSP (or if I exercise a call, but in that case it \\*increases\\* the cost basis).

But There is a growing perception that Tesla has moved past issues like the \"production hell\" that plagued the Model 3 ramp, especially given how smoothly the 'Y' rolled out ahead of schedule. Bumpy rollouts and repeatedly missing timelines throws people off and causes them to be concerned about timelines for new gigafactories, 4680s, and FSD - all of which do materially impact the model.

Generally, people just want 'stonk to go up' and don't understand that you are investing in a company, not a stock.\n\nRegarding specifically the Model S, I think people have underestimated a few things about Tesla at the moment. They are trying to do a ridiculous amount of new things at the same time. Add on top of that the extra overhead from having to deal with all the supply chain issues this year, specifically the semiconductor shortage (which required them to reprogram some of their firmware). This stuff takes time out of what would normally have been an easy ramp. Ford is going to lose HALF of their total output of cars in Q2 because of the shortage. The fact that Tesla is still able to grow and deliver their cars whilst delivering on massive technology innovation is impressive.\n\nPeople are too quick to complain and criticize when they are meant to be 'investors'.
