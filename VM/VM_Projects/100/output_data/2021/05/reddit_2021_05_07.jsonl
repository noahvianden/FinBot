As for the squeeze, I would not mind it but could care less atm. Should it occur, I will buy covered calls (buy-write for those who do not understand) and enjoy it.\n\nWith the proxy vote arriving, does anyone see it being the catalyst for the squeeze to finally occur and be ended? We can all agree that absuive shorts attempted to bankrupt GameStop and should not have the power to do so. My thoughts are, with the amount of calls being \"thrown to the wind\" like these, is there something we do not know or cannot see? Why would someone aimlessly throw away $1.6m? They wouldn't. I have the luxury of doing well for myself and would not waste money on a guarentee fail. So, if you have any thoughts that aren't too tin-foilish, lmk.\n\nCheers and good luck to everyone. Bears, Bulls, Pigs, and even gamblers.\n\n***Edit*** : If you find this person, please let me know so I can buy them a Ternion award and give him my wife for a night.\n\n***Edit 2*** : Please everyone....this is meant to be a discussion on who or what would buy these and NOT a debate on whether or not to buy them. Understand, I would not buy them myself as I only play weekly covered calls/puts. I am invested IN GME and NOT trading GME. I like Ryan Cohen and love what he has done with Chewy. So his new journey is exciting. Outside of GME, I play TSLA, MARA, VIX (bear mode activated), AMZN, AAPL. I also tried playing RKT calls for earnings. We all know how that went.... 1.89-.06 per contract lmao\n\n***Edit 3*** : A buy-write is how to purchase covered calls. I'm happy to make a post on this as a few people in the comments below do not know about this. Learning is key to success and I'm happy to share knowledge on it.\n\n***EDIT 4 :*** *Thet bet CORRECTLY!!!! BRILLIANT play!! Well Done person.

The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.\u201d\n\nAnyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, \u201cTesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars \u2014 VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.\u201d  \n\nI am all in on VWAPY and POAHY. I am a bit biased - drive Porsche Macan and love it. Will be switching to Taycan within 12-18 months but apparently they are already back ordered for months. \n\nAnd no, this isn\u2019t intended to be a detailed DD, so don\u2019t come at me for that. :). Just sharing what I read this morning.\n\nEDIT:  in terms of EV only sales, here is how these two companies sold world-wide. As you can see, in 2020 VW already sold almost half as many cars as Tesla.

If VW is hypothetically only selling half as many cars as they used to post-EV transition I don't think VW investors are going to care if they're still selling more vehicles then Tesla. If Tesla is selling 10 million EV's a year in 2025 I don't think Tesla shareholders are going to care that Tesla is only producing 20% of the EV market.

Keeping the price that high does 2 things. \n\n1. It attracts SERIOUS investors. When you finally commit and manage to own entire shares of a stock that expensive, it really discourages you from wanting to sell them for a while. Folks with a lot of cash will see the price and AMZN's success and decide to commit to buy a few shares and holding them for ages themselves. This helps its price continue to rise and rise. \n\n2. It discourages trading and options manipulation. Cheaper stocks are easier to flip. It can bolster volume and price short term but long term it just makes it harder for your stock to consistently build value. Look at Apple. For months it's been having hard time getting its price to hold and I think it's relatively sheep 130ish price is part of the problem. Look at how much talk you see of folks buying options on FAAMG stocks. Notice how you see Apple calls appear way more often. It's largely cause their price is much cheaper than their contempories which makes it more inviting for retail and institutions alike to fool around with price as they see fit. Eventually APPL should push past this but it'll probably be a while before they get enough folks to diamond it at these cheap prices.\n\nTo make an anecdote, my brother who starterd day trading during college break last summer would frequently tell me about how he would like to flip APPL for easy bucks around earnings or news times. By contrast, one of my more serious investing family members has committed to buying a batch of AMZN shares and holding them for years and years. And I myself am trying to gradually work my way to a full share. It may not be a full share but seeing how much 1 is worth makes me want to keep building my way up and not just casually flip it.\n\nA higher price simply makes a stock more consistent.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Makes it harder to short would be my guess.

The only issue here is these are mostly CONSUMER regulations, and this is specifically commercial. Very little oversight in this area changed after 2008. \n\nFor context, I used to personally call appraisers myself to get valuations on CRE in the past. You build a relationship with these guys. While yes they're licensed and whatnot, it's still just an opinion of value. If I hypothetically provided them with some slightly inflated leases from a tenant that were indeed executed by the tenant, they wouldn't have changed anything unless it was substantially outside of market numbers.  In the case of the Dollar General leases that were researched, that's most likely what they did; say you're paying 100k a month while you're really paying 50k.  It's fraud. \n\nThis is just my two cents from my experiences.

No office can compete with the benefits of remote work, they just can't.  You instantly shrink your talent pool you can draw from to almost nothing, take on huge equipment and maintenance costs, the lease, etc.  It's really a monumental cost for any business to take on - with no clear return on that investment.

Industrial Revolution required factories with a centralized workforce, which birthed dense cities, and resulted in a large pile of nearly-identical goods.  That invented the problem that would rule the next century - Distribution.  Solving that problem built empires.  Empires that have been eroding and failing and dying since 1990.

There are a lot of desires in the business world.  Executives and managers at places like Amazon fulfillment centers desire strongly that their workers were not human beings, and while they might be able to sustain treating people like machines for a little while, we know how this ends.  It ends in bloodshed (where do you think the phrase 'going postal' comes from?  The USPS in the 1990s, after rolling out automated sorting machinery adopted a program to pair human operators with the automated machines, handling the mail the machines couldn't sort.  And they expected the humans to operate like a component of the machine with zero downtime, zero slack time, minimal bathroom or lunch breaks, etc.  Which broke people.  They're human beings are their human needs are BUSINESS needs.  The USPS failed to recognize this, and dozens died in workplace massacres.)\n\nSometimes desires do translate into immovable forces, I will admit.  Industrial Revolution factory owners did not want to pay adolescents a wage adequate enough to raise a family, and instead of forcing them to, the entire machinery of society organized to enact the largest global change in human reproduction in history and we got the Victorian era.  Remote work certainly isn't a similar degree of desire, I don't think.  If companies had done remote work and seen their business flounder as a consequence, or seen productivity dive by 50% or something like that, sure, it would be a much bigger deal.  But as it is, it opened a lot of eyes to a lot of opportunities.  You mean a company in San Francisco can hire a software engineer with 10 years experience living in Ohio for $90k instead of paying $300k for a local?  The competitor who does that also nets the benefit of not having the negatives of an office aside from price.  Human things like how when a group of humans discuss an idea, the tallest extrovert wins in almost every situation.  Protip: The tallest extrovert rarely has the BEST idea for the business.  Knowing this nets you nothing.... unless you can omit the physicality from the interaction.  Many companies seem to have made the beginners error in remote work of adopting VIDEO calling, but I expect that to die off.  Audio is useful.  Text is better as it is more fungible, but audio is much higher bandwidth and faster.  You just can't save it, reference it, or search it later.  We may revert to almost entirely text interactions because of that last bit.  Search won.  It is the best human-computer interface we've ever developed and it is what people prefer.  But that's a different topic.\n\nI entirely agree about higher wages will have to be offered for companies that insist on on-premise staff.  I think those that pay this premium because they merely prefer it, rather than can make an objective ROI argument for it, will be insolvent before 2030.  I also think this is going to push up wages at jobs that require physical colocation of workers, things like heavy equipment manufacturing.  Light manufacturing might be offloaded to distributed workshops, but no one is going to build a John Deere tractor that weighs 5 tons anywhere EXCEPT in a large purpose-built factory.  And no one is going to want to work those jobs unless the pay is greatly increased when they can work a good paying job from home 'in' a city 1000 miles away.  Or in another country.  Or on another continent.\n\nOnly doing remote for new/low level roles is very beginner-grade for remote work, but I could certainly see it starting there, especially for established companies.  This will backfire.  You will end up with senior members of the company, higher ranking, performing very poorly in comparison.  While their newer compatriots are at home with that productivity boost, not getting interrupted, wearing comfortable clothes, eventually someone is going to notice almost none of the projects getting done have the seniors' names on them.\n\nHybrid is a non-starter.  It's a terrible idea that can not be executed well.  It preserves all the bad parts about offices while sacrificing their few benefits, while abandoning most of the good parts of remote work.  \n\nI'm seriously not engaging in fantasy here.  This is my life.  I had been talking about how remote work was the future for years online, and in 2016 I decided to put my money where my mouth was, I quit my job of 15 years without another job lined up and no intentions of looking for one.  Not an office job, anyway.  Started doing freelance gigs online.  Best decision in my life so far, actually.  Ended up ducking back into an office for about 3 years (company didn't offer remote to 'unproven' folks in their eyes which I can understand), then to remote contract work, then just in the latter half of 2019 I landed my \"unicorn\" job.  100% remote, global team, permanent, high up enough I pick my own technologies and propose my own projects.  Many of my meetings have people on 3 different continents on them.  Customers are spread out just as much (its a B2B managed IT and professional services company, we do lots of different things, I'm in the engineering/hosting ring, like a mini AWS sort of thing, building private clouds, helping companies transition to public ones, etc).  My company did maintain some physical offices in the US, none in states I am less than 500 miles from, and they realized they could close one permanently with the pandemic, and moved to a smaller one for the other.\n\nThere are absolutely problems and issues left to be figured out with remote work.  The people who set to doing that with affordable, workable solutions are certainly places to invest IMO.  I can't imagine how you would handle entry level positions where its a persons first job out of college.  I very much grew up online, getting early Internet access in 1990 as a kid (real Internet too, not AOL or Prodigy or Compuserve junk, dialup to a VAX that dumped me at a shell prompt and let me use gopher and telnet and shit), and even I don't know how I would have figured out the whole 'being a decent employee' thing with my first job being fully remote.  At my company the AVERAGE years of experience is 17 years in IT or related field.  And hiring is a very real challenge.  But hey, there are challenges in the traditional way of working too.  Solving them makes money.\n\nI thought fully remote was a long-term fantasy, and up until the pandemic I would have said it was still definitely a decade off before it was widespread.... but the real world has a way of throwing a wrench in things.

Israel I suppose but I dunno how realistic is that they\u2019d even answer the phone and I don\u2019t speak Druish or whatever it is they speak over there so \u2026. this is a no brainer.\n\nI\u2019ll ask Tyrone, my wife\u2019s boyfriend, one of them anyways \ud83d\ude10if maybe I can have access to some of my savings. It\u2019ll have to wait for a bit though he just took the wife to Vegas and then they\u2019re skipping off to Hawaii for a couple weeks.\nNot a cheap trip lol but it\u2019s cool he has my Amex so there\u2019s no limit.\n\nI\u2019ve never actually been out of state. Grew up here always dreamed of traveling abroad with my beautiful wife and God bless his heart Tyrone is living that dream for me.\n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t a little disappointed when I asked if I could maybe tag along and he didn\u2019t respond he just spit on me and called me a CRACKA so I just went back out to the garage made my cot and got some sleep.\n\nWorking 3 jobs these days. Had no choice really Tyrone is really into precious metals. Gold chains gold bracelets gold watches lol nothing but the best.\nComes at a high price though so that\u2019s why I grabbed the second job.\n\nThen when he borrowed my Audi he accidentally got a little too tipsy and ended up \u2026 long story short high speed chase, Sheriffs, and when he ended up wrapping the car around a telephone pole he did the right thing and fled the scene.\n\nWhich is a good thing he could have gotten in a lot of trouble.\n\nHowever, when the Sheriffs found and recovered the now totaled vehicle they found individually wrapped bags of crack cocaine. So naturally with the car being in my name and licensed to my name the Sheriffs came a knockin. \nUnbeknownst to me I guess the money I gave Tyrone to pay for my car insurance he mistakenly assumed the money was for a new pair of sneakers he had wanted so bummer on that aspect but on the plus side when I was arrested and charged with fleeing the scene of an accident / reckless driving / reckless endangerment / speeding in excess of 140MPH / crack cocaine possession of a scheduled narcotic / and due to the individual baggies I was also charged with intent to distribute / vehicular assault and \u2026 blah blah blah you know how it is a bunch of other stuff.\n\nAnyways to lay for my Attorney Tyrone said it was cool if I a got a 3rd job. He said \u201cYou don\u2019t do shit else but be sleeping all night get yo ass out there make that money before I beat the Mayo off yo ass\u201d lol he has such a great sense of humor.\n\nBut he was right. What do I do after I get home to my garage after my second job but lay down and sleep for 4-6 hours anyways so I\u2019m thankful he inspired me to be more in this world and to set goals and work towards them.\n\nNot really any City busses though where I live so I bought a new bike and even though it\u2019s over 28 miles one way to my first job it was really helping me tone my calves up.\n\nThat was until my bike was stolen. I don\u2019t know how it happened, I had it in the garage and no one except us has access to the garage and there was no signs of forced entry.\n\nTyrone said it was probably one of my cracka ass cheeto smelling homeboys, but the thing is I don\u2019t really have any friends.

Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**\n2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*\n3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and \"feeling pain\", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.\n4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**\n5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.\n6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed\n7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*\n8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed\n9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO\n10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO\n11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**\n12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.\n13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**\n14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet\n15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The shorts:\n\n1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish.  Related note:  Think I've finally got a grasp on this one - 6 successful trades in a row, and I was even able to call the closing bell price within less than a dollar this morning.  This stock is finally starting to play by the rules.\n2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.\n3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out\n4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*\n5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.\n6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again\n7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*\n8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.\n9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**\n10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall\n11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*\n12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it\n13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story\n14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop\n15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.\n16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding.\n17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.

Still room to drop\n21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.\n22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.

Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it\n26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*\n27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.

I guess it's a bit of fundamental and technical but which do you rely on more? Is it like 70% technical followed by fundamental and market senitment?\n\nEdit: Spelling", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "So, for me, when I'm looking at a stock, the first thing I look at is the story.  I want to invest in companies that I think are game changers (or, as some say, \"innovators\", or as SF hipsters say, \"disruptors\").  I want organizations that are doing something that nobody (or almost nobody) else is doing.   This is why I key into outlier companies in a sector like $NVTA, $CLNE, $BE, etc.   And I want to believe that they can execute that vision.  Which is why I don't fuck with companies like $QS or $FCEL or $NKLA, because I don't think they can ever actually make something.  Or at the very least, I want a company who's story has a lot of tailwinds.  I want to make sure the company is focused on being a company, not virtue signaling social causes that are just distractions.  This is also where I decide if the market agrees with me.  It doesn't matter if I'm right, if the market disagrees with me, the market is right where it counts (money).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second thing I do is look at Travelcenters of America.  I start with a daily and expand it out 6 months (used to be a year, but Covid Wall Street isn't useful data), then I go to a 10 minute chart, and I re-chart.  Then I take it down to a 4 and break it into segments.  Finally, I break 2 weeks down into 2 minute charts to confirm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHEN I look at the fundamentals.  I don't pay a lot of attention to traditional things like PE ratios, I don't go digging for \"catalysts\" or \"reasons\" why a stock increased in price.  Nobody ever looks for a reason why something dropped, so it always pisses me off when they ask why it will go up after a drop.  I do want to see cash on hand.  I want to see what the debt looks like.  I do care about multiples to a point.   If sentiment is illogically insane ($TSLA) I'll overlook it even if I dislike the company, but if it's too high ($UPST) I'll key in on it as a short play, even if I like the company.  I want to see if they have a dilution problem or an activist investor fucking things up.  I want to see their institutional hold percentage.  I want to see their customer base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they pass all that, then I go into my wildcard stuff t hat doesn't matter to most people.  For one, I have a strict \"no asshole\" policy.  For example, my VC was an early investor into $SQ and I made the decision to liquidate us out of that when the stock was all the way down in the 40's, even though I knew it was going to go much further, simply because Jack Dorsey was the 2nd most vile person I've met in executive management, and I wanted nothing to do with him.  This is also why I'll only ever short $TWTR.  I would never do business with or invest in any company associated with Vlad, or Chamath, etc.  Then I want to see what analysts are covering the company, and I want to make sure these people aren't especially problematic (part of $CLNE's problem is I overlooked that Pavel from RJ was covering them).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom there it's just a question of studying the charts, looking at volume and order flows, trying to understand how the machines trade the equity and how they behave, etc.  This is very much an art form and not really something I can make a runbook for.  It's very intuitive.  All this is also why I'm so good at catching bottoms, say buy into pain, and completely disregard the adage about not trying to catch a falling knife.  Once you build that intuition, falling knives become good things because you can just instinctively see at a glance where to grab it from.

Those are red herrings. For one, investors don't give a shit about bond yields (and Millennials/zoomers are too young to know this, but back when I first started angel investing near the turn of the century, bond yields were over 6%. Contrarians will point out multiples were a lot lower back then, but the two aren't handcuffed). \n\n\nI don't think it's neccesarily concern over bond yields, it is more the inflation that would cause action to adjust rates.  Beyond Berkshire commentary last week, I have friends and family that run businesses where they need to order a *very* broad array of items.  Prices are ramping *extremely* rapidly.  PLUS with Xiden handing out money like a drunk sailor in a whore-house there's no incentive to work.  That poultry shortage (which I knew about weeks ago from a friend who does large-scale ordering) is not from a supply chain thing...it's labor.  They can't find people interested in working 40 hours when they could make 80% of that for 0 hours.   I don't think we're heading in a very good direction right now; sometimes I wonder if we're in the opening stages of a dystopian future.  \n\nI do agree about the yields being still incredibly low; I don't think the average person realizes how Reagan's policies set us up for the next 35+ years of equity run.  If the average person looked at yields in the early 80s they'd have a seizure.  Look at whatever your favorite index is, look at the run it's had since the early/mid 80s, and then try and figure out how much of that is from supression of rates.  70% 80%?  You have people in their 30s now that consider yields above 5% to be anathema, and I *think* that some of them are realizing they should have paid atttention to history, and that foreboding is beginning to seep into the market sentiment, no matter how brain-damaged that thinking is. \n\nAlso, what investors *don't* care about bond yields?  I may have misinterpreted your statement, but as I am reading it, it is basically saying that investors don't care at all what a company's bonds are yielding, or if yields are moving up.  That would be dead-wrong, in my opinion.  That's directly impacting what your investment's cost of capital is going to be, hurdle rates on projects, liquidity (ability to issue at appropriate yields), unlevered cash flows (higher coupon payments on new debt when yields rise), and overall company fiscal health.   Or did you mean that a lot of equity investors are basically dumb-money proto-chimps that don't realize they *should* be paying attention to yields? In which case I agree.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "What's the market rate for a ball washer these days?

I was talking about this with someone here in the last couple of days, but that whole narrative is a complete lie. In any capitalist system, you have supply and demand. If supply runs short but demand runs high, then capitalism demands that supply be enticed until it equals demand. I recently hired a new security architect for my firm (notable because we don't often hire as people rarely leave), and in my welcome lunch with him, he was telling me how refreshing it was to see someone offer him what he was worth. Turned out he had been getting literally dozens of offers from companies offering him 100-150K a year and a standard rote soft comp package under the guise that \"well, the economy is real tough right now\", when he was worth 3 times that. In a ridiculously in-demand field. Fortunately for him, he had the savings necessary to tell them all to fuck off until I came along. He was legitimately disgusted and insulted by his job search, as he should have been.\n\nI agree with pretty much everything before and after the quoted part above. In the quoted portion though, what you are describing *is* a labor shortage;  by definition, a labor shortage is when employers are not able to find enough qualified individuals for a position at a certain rate.  That rate *is* set by the employers.   That's the literal definition of a labor shortage.  Even if it's a shitty rate.   I'm not sure what industries you focus on (or if you cast a wide net);  for high-end food service I have a connection that runs a large-scale operation.  They pay more now than in 2019, and it's in a small suburb, the rate is good for low/medium skill labor.  They cannot find *anyone* qualified, in some cases they've been turned down cold because people *do* believe the government udder is going to continue to be there.   Is that the *entire* reason they can't find anyone? Absolutely not, but there is a labor shortage, and that is a contributing factor.  \n\nThe other factor here is the reorganizing of the economy.  Our economist did a write-up on this last week actually;  ~35% of service businesses that closed during the pandemic remain closed at this juncture, and I *believe* 80% of them are not expected to re-open.  That is going to leave a lot of unemployed capital *and* labor that is going to need to reorganize into new ventures.  That could take time.  There are permanent changes that have happened in our economy (orgs finally fucking realizing you don't need to cram everyone into a soulless office every day), lower mass transit, higher rates of home schooling, more order-in, less dine-out, etc.  There's plenty more.  As the economy reorganizes (and truly, continues to reorganize, since it began reorganizing over a year ago) businesses are going to need new skill-sets, or rather more individuals with certain skill-sets, more than are available right now.  We're at a labor force participation rate of ~[61.75% ](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate), down from a peak of ~63.4%.  Considering where we were, that rally is nuts, *especially* when you consider that above statistic about service businesses.  Consider this; at least *some* of the population has removed itself from the workforce due to stimulus/unemployment.   That could explain a lot of ~1.65% gap pre and post pandemic in participation rate.   *Pre*-Pandemic we would talk to management teams and almost every one said that the main issue they had was finding qualified labor.  Construction, machinery, transports, it was all the same story.   Now look at the start of this paragraph; the workers that are not participating right now are more likely to have come from those service businesses, and may not be qualified (at ANY rate of pay) for the industrial positions available.  \n\nHaving said all of that, I do agree that wages in this country for qualified working/middle-class folks are ridiculous.  I'm not talking about the people wanting 15 bucks for serving fries, that's supposed to be a job for teenagers, not someone trying to support a family.  I found [this](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FT_18.07.26_hourlyWage_adjusted.png) to be the most enlightening exhibit regarding wages.  In 55 years, Americans' buying power has only increased 10%.  However, it is worth noting that this was the case pre-Pandemic as well.  I just don't buy that suddenly people are saying \"no, I'm not taking 60 cents on the dollar\" especially coming out of the Pandemic.  Honestly, I think you're giving WAY too much credit to people here.  It's a depressing thought, but I mean that.  I worked as an industrial psychologist for several years, people just have NO clue how much they are actually worth.  They just think/know it's *more* than they make right now.  A few are disgruntled enough to take 60%-70% of what they made pre-pandemic, via stimulus, and sit on their asses.  I think the rest just aren't qualified for this reorganized economy, nor for many of the industrial jobs that were ramping up pre-pandemic.  I actually have a couple calls this week probing on this issue, and your post has definitely given me food for thought; I'm going to see where the analysts come down, perhaps they'll say my idea is completely off base, but I just don't see this being an issue of people suddenly refusing to work for sub-standard wages.\n\n\nedit: I got this through without having to replace a single fucking word to appease auto-mod.

{"title": "UWMC - Don't be fooled my friends", "selftext": "Here I am at home, sipping champagne and laughing at how the market is convincing you that UWMC, America's largest wholesale mortgage lender, is supposed to be at ALL TIME LOWS while the real estate is exploding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vfuohmplrx61.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=60ec4444fbbf936dcac53ffdca7f5f0d530789e1\n\nLet's get some facts straight, because it hurts me to see how all of you amateurs are being played by the master poker players of Wall Street.\n\n# Real Estate prices\n\nHome prices are hitting record highs. Record low supply of homes. New listings selling on average in just 18 days, also a record pace. 48% of buyers are confident now is the right time to buy real estate. Where are these people getting the money from, you ask? By taking MORTGAGES! High lumber prices, high copper prices, high home prices? Yup, all that money comes from mortgages. Power to those who buy houses with cash, but most of the people need a mortgage. And guess who is in the mortgage business? You betcha, UWMC.\n\n# RKT's earnings were a dissaster, UWMC's will too\n\nUmmm, did you know Mat Ishibia (the CEO of UWMC) gave an ultimatum about a month ago, that brokers must choose who they want to work with. Either RKT or UWMC. Guess whom they picked?\n\nListen to the CEO: \"*out of my 12000 brokers less than 500 said they were gonna go with them, you will see that in the Q2 numbers*\" - [https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20](https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gwamgh5nrx61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ea48f104e76caf6a368cbe5ef2a9b86ae43eebc\n\n# Dividend\n\nI know most of you goofs here do not care about dividend because you are all busy making 100% a week gains, but in the real world, where you actually do get to drive a lambo, consistent predictable income like dividends are a big deal. You see, UWMC pays $0.40 per year for every share you own. This is fixed! It does not matter how much the stock price is. However, what matters is that your dividend yield depends on the price you pay to acquire those shares. Confused? Let me give you an example:\n\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $10 a share) = 4.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $9 a share) = 4.44% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $8 a share) = 5.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $7 a share) = 5.71% annual dividend yield - **WE ARE HERE!**\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $5 a share) = 8.00% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $3 a share) = 13.33% annual dividend yield\n* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $1 a share) = 40.00% annual dividend yield\n\nBasically, it's a gift from heavens to be able to buy a dividend paying stock at low levels because you are locking in a higher % return. Now some of you smartypants will say, *\"don't buy a stock just for the dividend\"*, and I agree. In some cases, when the company **does not generate cash flow** they will have trouble paying the dividend and will be forced to cut it. However, **UWMC** has no problem with cash flow, meaning $0.40 dividend per share is here to stay for the foreseeable future.\n\nFun fact, RKT pays no dividend. Institutions know this. They care about predictable stream of cash a.k.a. dividends. BlackRock knows this, hence why they reported on May 2, owning 11.15% of UWMC's float.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4oibshivrx61.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=9724aeb147bdd05e8e28cd08babb8b4a06c2c63b\n\n# Russell Index\n\nRemember the Russell index hype? Remember how the price went from $7.63 to $9.62 in a matter of few days?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tb8i3ikprx61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b49973b32b0f6171a51cbf110250ab48b3187d\n\nWell the inclusion story is still pretty much on the table. Russell made a mistake. UWMC is in touch with them and **UWMC is eligible for consideration at the annual review in June 2021**. Yes, that's in about a month from now. Don't believe me? You should.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xxjhba02qrx61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=49913305ca2b760bca63a596b977f86b64b62961\n\n# Bluffing\n\nThe definition of bluffing in poker is - ***betting heavily on a weak hand in order to deceive opponents***. I know what you beginners fear - \"*What if my stock goes to zero?*\" Do you hear yourself? America's largest wholesale dividend paying mortgage broker soon to join Russell 1000 going to zero? Are you that dumb? Did Wall Street pros managed to fool you that much? Remember bluff stories like:\n\n* **We covered on GME** \\- No you did not! The stock ain't going below $100 and it's been months since you covered!\n* **AMC is going bankrupt** \\- No it's not! It went up 348% since January 2021!\n* **UWMC is worthless. You should buy real estate at all time highs, let us buy this shitty dividend paying stock that's going to zero.** \\- Are you gonna fall for it again?\n\n# Mathematical pressure\n\nYou see, when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at $2 in January 2021, GME at $5 in August 2020, there is a point at which there is just no meat left. There is only a bone. You can't short stock into an oblivion. There is nothing left to short! You are running a risk.\n\nAt some point, the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock. Melvin did not understand this concept and that's why he lost billions. Simple as that.\n\nYou wanna buy low and sell high. Not short sell low and buy to cover high.\n\n# Holiday Party\n\nDoes your company invite Ludacris to sing at your holiday party?
