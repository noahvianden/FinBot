{"title": "The love/hate mating dance of Cathie Wood (ARK) with this subreddit, her take on this correction and her strategy going forward", "selftext": "Preface: I'm **not** invested in any ARK funds myself. I do hold some of the stocks in her funds.\n\nLoved by most of this subreddit in 2020. Hated by most in 2021. Yikes. In the past 3 months, correlating with the sharp drop in most of her funds (Most of them have dropped 30%+ since February), more and more people have started critizing ARK. ARK has seen outflows of more than $750 million in the last week. Now, everyone has a different take on whether her stock picks will do well or not, that's fine. I think we can all agree that 2020 has been an extraordinary year, with growth / tech / speculative stocks being the absolute winners of this mad year, mostly due to historically never before seen low interest rates, but also affected by a huge in-flow of new investors, support packages which are focused on certain sectors (Clean energy for example). More traditional sectors have underperformed last year, yet we've been seeing an institutional rotation away from speculative stocks into more value oriented names. \n\nHowever, let's not forget that pretty much all ARK funds are still up 300%+ up from the beginning of 2020. And while the sectors ARK is heavily invested in outperformed hard, they are most likely primed to underperform this year as institutions rotated away with interest rates picking back up and the global economy slowly opening again. Is this a problem though? No. 300% in a year is insanity. This is a healthy correction. And while it may hurt seeing your portfolio like this, this is a good moment to remember why you invested the way you did (and also a good moment for self-reflection). \n\nWhether the criticism she's getting lately is deserved, i'll leave that up for debate. Some of her picks are HIGHLY questionable in my opinion, yet i also see some as primed for explosive growth in the upcoming 5/10 years. She has also received a lot of criticism on here for selling her bigger blue chip stocks. Is this warranted? How does she view this correction?   \n\n\n\u201cI love this setup,\u201d she said Friday on CNBC\u2019. \u201cThe worst thing that could have happened to us is to have the market narrowly focus on just our ilk of stock \u2014 the innovation space. From our point of view \u2014 five-year time horizon \u2014 nothing has changed except the price,\u201d she said. Back in February, Wood expected a 15% compound annual rate of return from her strategies, but after the recent fall in prices, she envisions that number rising to between 25% and 30%.\"\n\nIn other words, she welcomes this. Now, obviously she would not say this is a disaster, as she is the fund manager. But there is also truth to her statement. Now, why does she love this setup? She sees this as an amazing buying opportunity, now that prices have dropped. But where does she get the money from? Mainly her blue chips, which is heavily debated on this sub.\n\n \u201cThe FAANGs certainly meet that criteria \u2014 they\u2019re acting like defensives,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring a period of volatility like we\u2019ve just seen, we will sell those stocks and move into either our more pure-play or earlier-stage innovation companies that are being hurt by risk-off.\u201d  \n\nI actually wrote a quite comprehensive piece on this (on this subreddit as well), diving deeper into her strategy, and how she exectutes this.

ARK funds have outperformed in 2020, and will most likely underperform in the short term. Whether it will underperform in the long term, who knows. Imo, she has some holdings that i do not see a future in, and her projections and valuations are... Rich to say the least. But let's not forget she was right with her earlier Tesla valuation when everyone called her crazy. It's also possible that this correction gives her the ability to make changes in her portfolio's for favorable prices, and thus makes higher returns possible. \n\nThis is not financial advice.

Many people were surprised by Aykroyd's 2013 statement, and headlines at the time made reference to him \"revealing\" his condition. So at the time he appeared as host, he had not yet \"admitted it\".\n\nAykroyd may have revealed his Asperger's to people close to him, but the vast majority of the people watching his SNL host appearance would not have been aware of it. Aykroyd making a disclosure more than 10 years after appearing as host is hardly the same as Elon standing there live with millions of people watching and saying he has Asperger's. \n\nGreat of Aykroyd to make his statement in the 2013 interview, and an encouragement to other people with Asperger's, but I agree with /u/__TSLA__ that for Elon to say it live in his opening monologue during his host appearance is an extremely powerful statement.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4384964406490326}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41433602571487427}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2597222626209259}, {"body": "I open Twitter: 'Elon is killing it'  \nI google and I see an article from 'thewrap.com':  \nElon Musk Was the Worst \u2018SNL\u2019 Host Ever  \nSubtitle:  \nMusk had absolutely nothing to offer except a marketing boost \u2013 he failed to land even a single joke\n\nInteresting.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I guess the FUD follows everywhere.

{"title": "I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!", "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! \n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/q29ncm07m3y61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=e400362006ce7ce4571361731cece094ba3b9d38)\n\nGME is back at the top again this week. GME was briefly overtaken by MVIS last week to become the most discussed stocks. The drastic drop in the stock price after its rally muted the discussions. This can be reflected in the sentiment as well. AMC has experienced a continuous decline in discussion volume and now is in the 8th position. \n\n **Top Growing Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdfgfdncm3y61.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc44dd645aa9f8fdba923805c7013156328d8b70\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Majority of stocks gained in mentions this week following their earnings report. The returns were a mixed bag for the companies even after exhibiting stellar growth. \n\n**Rocket companies($RKT)** shares fell 16% on Thursday following their first-quarter results. Even though their revenue increased by 236% and net income by 170%, investors appeared to focus on the guidance provided by Rocket. They said that they expect to close a loan volume of $82-$87 Billion which would represent a significant decline. This along with rising interest rates and inflation concerns caused the stock price to tank. \n\n**Etsy($ETSY)** was also trending due to very similar reasons where they reported exceptional first-quarter results but management guidance for the second quarter was mediocre. The stock was down 13% but a lot of users were extremely bullish on the company and were considering the drop as a good entry point for long-term hold which is reflected in the sentiment. \n\n**Corsair($CRSR)** also delivered an exceptional quarter with first-quarter revenue increasing by more than 72% to $529MM. The growth majorly came from their Gamer and Creator peripherals segment which is far more profitable than the regular systems. Even though Reddit and Twitter users are bullish on the stock, the stock still sold off more than 6% from the top after the earnings report. \n\n**Peloton($PTON)** had a wild week with the stock dropping 15% on Wednesday following a full recall of their Tread and Tread+ treadmills. The US CPSC had called for a recall months ago but the company had initially resisted the accusations. The recall of more than 130K units is expected to be a logistical nightmare.  \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "id": "n8ek8d", "created_utc": 1620567942.0, "score": 1020, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "Is this open source?

MKBHD recently mentioned on his podcast that he was surprised at how well he could ride the Porsche Taycan considering its charging network. IIRC, he said that if it wasn\u2019t for Tesla Autopilot, he\u2019d pick the Taycan all day.  \n \n Second off, this is a pretty surface level analysis. Tesla is far from the \u201cmanufacturing nightmares\u201d stage that we saw them in the late 2010s. They\u2019ve almost perfected the art of manufacturing EVs and are prepping to bring an even cheaper EV to the market. The Model 3 for 38k is not a bad price at all - I mean, that\u2019s about the same as a new Camry XLE with a V6. The real problem is that you\u2019d be stupid to not get autopilot, which then makes the Model 3 a 50k+ car.  \n  \nI think what Tesla will need to do going forward is offer a 22-25k car that costs 35k after autopilot. Since Teslas are already autopilot equipped, I\u2019d image a lot of people who buy the baseline 25k model would upgrade within a year or so. Moreover, Tesla has made strides in battery tech and release the Plaid Model S with in-house batteries that are structural in nature. They are strongly believed to have made breakthroughs in battery tech that will enable them to double (or more) their car\u2019s current battery density (hence why they promise the Roadster to have a 650 mi+ range). If they are able to increase the battery density and decrease the cost/cell using new in-house manufacturing techniques, they\u2019ll have drastically reduced the most expensive component in their cars.  \n  \nAll in all, I think Tesla\u2019s future and stock projection is very bright. We\u2019ve seen a dip in TSLA, largely due to a correction after their massive hype wave in 2019. I think TSLA\u2019s price will correlate strongly with how successful they are in their battery tech.

The point is as other manufacturers release their own EVs, the market share that Tesla could've captured as the flagship EV manufacturer is decreasing quickly especially since Tesla cannot ramp up production quickly enough to match the likes of VW. \nFor instance, here in Germany, in Q1 2020 Tesla sold 3300 vehicles compared to 6000 in Q1 2021. That is a very impressive x2 increase. \nHowever, VW sold 6000 vehicles in Q1 2020 but sold 16000 in Q1 2021. This is almost a x3 increase, and currently has a 25% share of the market.

So when the CEO of a company comes out and promises a product release, we should take it with a grain of salt? And not take his words as fact? I'm sorry but that is unacceptable. Why should anyone accept being stringed along by Elon? The CEO of one of the most valuable companies on earth? If he tells me that my Tesla which I preorder will have 490 miles of range or will fully charge in 1h, should I also not take that as fact? Why should I then believe that FSD will work as promised? Why should I believe anything he says regarding car safety? Why should I believe the Model 3 I bought last year is equipped to have FSD?\n\nYou're heavily taking things out of context. If Elon comes out and promises stuff on an earnings call or company presentation, we 100% should hold him accountable. The problem with Elon's deadlines is that 90% of the time it's just somebody asking him when he THINKS something will be ready, Elon saying he EXPECTS something to be done in X amount of time, and media companies then misrepresenting what he said as targets/promises/etc. to smear Tesla in the future.\n\nI also think you should cut them some slack on the FSD front. People don't fully appreciate that this is one of the most difficult problems humanity has ever attempted to solve. Obviously it's going to be difficult to put a timeframe on that. I can't even give you an accurate timeframe of how long it takes me to build a video game with a handful op people.\n\n> Let me clarify. Demand for EVs are increasing worldwide and even VW and others have preorders. The point is as other manufacturers release their own EVs, the market share that Tesla could've captured as the flagship EV manufacturer is decreasing quickly especially since Tesla cannot ramp up production quickly enough to match the likes of VW. For instance, here in Germany, in Q1 2020 Tesla sold 3300 vehicles compared to 6000 in Q1 2021. That is a very impressive x2 increase. However, VW sold 6000 vehicles in Q1 2020 but sold 16000 in Q1 2021. This is almost a x3 increase, and currently has a 25% share of the market. This means its VW not Tesla that is most likely to meet the demand for EVs in Europe simply because they can make them faster than Tesla thereby capturing a bigger market share.\n\nI understand where you're coming from, and I agree VW will be one of Tesla's biggest (and only) competitors, but it's also an outlier and slightly cherry picked data for a number of reasons:\n\n* VW is coming from extremely low numbers, so of course percent-wise their growth is going to look impressive. \n* You're looking at VWs home country, where Tesla doesn't even have a factory yet. We could do the same for Tesla by looking at the US alone, and it would paint a completely different picture.\n* VWs EVs are currently unprofitable, so demand is artificially high. If they were to sell them as the same gross margins as Tesla, I wonder if demand would be the same.\n* VWs cars have a slightly lower average price, so we can't compare their production numbers 1 to 1 with Tesla's\n\nAnd ultimately, I do think VW will be able to make the transition to EVs, but it will be a huge challenge for them to phase out their profitable ICE vehicles and replace them with unprofitable EVs, turn those EVs into profitable products, convert their MASSIVE company's culture to that of a software/tech company and replacing all of the managers that don't understand iterative and agile production processes, and doing all of that while having a terrible balance sheet and a much higher number of short term-minded shareholders and executives than Tesla does. I do think VW will manage it, but I don't think people appreciate how difficult this will be and how many legacy automakers will go bankrupt or become a fraction of what they once were while doing so.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Just wanted to add [this](https://ewauij3y4gmdkc7rqcuj4knxhm-ac5fdsxevxq4s5y-www-tagesspiegel-de.translate.goog/berlin/tesla-fabrik-in-gruenheide-brandenburger-wirtschaftsminister-rechnet-mit-produktionsstart-spaetestens-im-herbst/27185458.html).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "de"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla", "pfe"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29520440101623535}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "That's all interesting....but I wish the cars didnt look so goddamn boring.

The way stock offering works is it depends on tesla stock price for past 1 month I believe before engineers join.

{"title": "I'm buying WY and so should you.", "selftext": "Have you ever wanted to invest an an asset where it's *not* already priced in? **Wyoming**.\n\nWyoming is comprised of just under 65MM acres, with an average price of $600/acre. That works out to a market cap of approximately $45B, *but* you don't even need to purchase the entire state, or even half of it to own it outright. The Federal Government already owns 48.19% of the land in Wyoming in one form or another, and they have little to no interest in its internal affairs. That reduces the total capital necessary to own all *available* land to only $22B. Now consider that an additional 3MM acres are Indian Reservations (which are their own entities, legally) and you can reduce the price by another $2BB, leaving us with a sticker price of $20B to own the entire state of Wyoming. With 10MM ~~apes~~ jackalopes, that works out to just $2,000 per jackalope (or $1,000 if we just want to take a controlling interest) and we can have our own WSB Polity.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for us as ground floor investors. WY has no personal or corporate income taxes and some of the lowest property tax rates in the country. Combine that with one of the lowest costs of living as well. If we purchase the state and live there as well (paying minimal rent to a newly formed REIT, which we can get back in the form of dividends) it's basically living for free, eat your heart out FIREtards. Your FD budget just grew in size by your current rent payment, or spend the savings on that pair of Grand Tetons you've always wanted to help with your gender dysphoria. You're welcome. \n\nGiven that Wyoming has a GDP of $35B, it has gross revenues 75% *greater* than its equity value. Currently the state is only able to capitalize on $2B of that via taxation, but I have a better idea. Using TSLA's *minimum* P/E for the last few years of 550 as a benchmark, we get a price target of nearly $20T or over $1MM per acre. -an order of magnitude greater than pitiful little companies like AAPL, who have a market cap of a measly $2T. If we take shares of WY public I estimate we could *easily* see an ROI of 500x. Asset classes can be based on the primary use of the land. Common shares can be rangeland, the least valuable, with arable farmland comprising A and B classes (irrigated and non-irrigated, respectively), and residential/commercially zoned acreage making up preferred shares.\n\nBut, aren't there already people heavily invested in Wyoming? Well, the current population isn't even 600,000 people, so we already outnumber them over 15:1, and that's not taking into account that statistically speaking, *some of us are already in the trade*. If we're quick about it, the level of buying pressure we would generate can only be good for us, since Real Estate takes more time to respond changes in demand. Shortly after we snap up the available land *it will have substantially appreciated in value due to market forces alone*.\n\nIn conclusion, buy WY. The state. Buy it all. It's cheap AF, but if all 10MM of us work together we can squeeze the shit out of it, have a 500 bagger, and set up shop in a place where we'll never have to worry about the cost of reloading our accounts again!\n\n[All in on Monday](https://imgur.com/a/DtZV9pk)", "id": "n8mv7h", "created_utc": 1620592387.0, "score": 677, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 273, "comments": [{"body": "I know this is fake, but I might actually yolo into this stock...", "score": 357, "replies": [{"body": "WY can only go up from here.

{"title": "Mega Move Incoming For WELL Health $WELL $WLYYF", "selftext": "OK so after seeing the fundamentals were pretty sound: \n\n1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish\n2. They   just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led   by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of   his own money\n3. Completed   the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the   company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.\n4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M\n5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing\n6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone.\n7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to take it one step further and dive into the charts. Canadian company so I'm going with the Canadian ticker \"WELL\" as it seems to get most of the action. \n\nI like to start my TA by zooming out to the maximum relevant period for any story. This last year given the pandemic seems like the most logical time frame for this... The stock performed exceptionally well throughout the pandemic and is now finding itself consolidating in the $7 range. \n\nNow the key for me is that within this consolidation period the company has made immense progress as I stated above. This is an entirely new story , management was able to use their operational skills and really take advantage of this situation. \n\n1. They raised an additional $305M led by the 29th richest man in the world who has invested in every single round to date... This one priced at a 25% premium. \n2. They used that capital to acquire CRH Medical which is going to bring revenues to $300M and free cash flow to $50M \n3. They acquired Circle Medical - a leading silicon valley company which is going to allow them to compete with any US Healthcare company. \n4. They are now the first Canadian healthcare company to directly integrate into Iphone. \n5. and still they have 0 debt and what I calculated to almost $80M in cash... \n\nTo put it simply - they are on a hot M&A streak and doing it very very well (no pun intended lol). \n\nSO this is where it gets interesting for me - If we zoom out a year to the point they last started bolstering up M&A activity around March/April we see WELL is sitting clean on its 200day SMA before making a monster move for the better half of the year. \n\nNow this is where they stood apart... Unlike other companies who experienced monstrous returns over the year and didn't focus on the operational aspect (Cough cough CLOV) WELL was able to use this time to focus on operations and exponentially increase its revenue, brands, cashflows, and ultimately justify its stock price up here. \n\nNow here is where the TA comes in... A year ago they were sitting flush on the 200 Day SMA right as they started increasing M&A Activity... Now again, after making hugely successful acquisitions with CRH, Circle, etc while in this consolidation period WELL is again sitting clean on its 200day SMA and has double bottomed with a higher low and  is further shown with the RSI being oversold and coiled in the right direction. .. There is also a massive Bull Flag forming... Further suggesting a huge breakout\n\n[1Year\\/Daily \\(200day SMA confluences\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/rloh016ij5y61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=b480d9d3d67d44c2c757dd4234ed8803d9072309)\n\nNow obviously one time frame doesn't tell the whole story so I went deeper. \n\nRight, 6 month/Daily shows the same thing - Massive consolidation - Bull flag - Higher low - and a clean on its 200 day SMA. \n\n[6Month\\/Daily - Higher low - Bull flag - Double bottom.](https://preview.redd.it/wejhg81hn5y61.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=79e205d5e494309bc55812d0a8a74f2210136d02)\n\n10 day/Hourly - WELL Closed on strong volume right below its 50 day SMA - The last time was on 04/23 when it closed just below its 20 day SMA on strong volume and proceeded to move 10% + (Caused by a failed short report). \n\n[10 days\\/Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/bzzwkfayn5y61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=a81147d55aaa39ab985e6b88a0323d5be4ed0601)\n\nSo that led me to look at the volume... Which we see is roughly double the week prior. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Volume Increase 04\\/09 - 05\\/07 ](https://preview.redd.it/0d1flpjho5y61.png?width=2482&format=png&auto=webp&s=573ba72ecbdc124b99ebddf9f92860e17c6fd40b)\n\nAnalysts are expecting record earnings Tuesday so that's more than likely the cause. \n\nNow that brings me to my final question? Where can this go? \n\nOn a short term we see an inverse H&S and a next resistance at 7.18 (Likely opens above that I think) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vffo46n3p5y61.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=256fa9d69a481aacc997a97dd96fe378a0894415\n\nNow this 7.18 level is key to break so the next stop would be 7.80 as we see here (+10%) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2oktpnxep5y61.png?width=2872&format=png&auto=webp&s=509a680d5f995a9009e64078c057aec47b500404\n\nOnce that 7.80 level is reached which I believe earnings will help us achieve then we need to zoom out again and look at where this really could go... The answer to that is obviously subjective based on what happens in the business but I think as they are exponentially increasing the value of their core business via M&A activity the very same thing could happen with the stock. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snwojxnzp5y61.png?width=2634&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a929096195ed04fb7402f0879c6e964fff8f345\n\nI believe if earnings are positive that WELL could break out of this $7-$9 consolidation zone and find itself trading in a new zone, likely blue skies somewhere in the teens or 20s. \n\nI really have conviction in this because they just raised $305M priced at a 25% premium to market at the time ($9.80) which the 29th richest man in the world put up $105M of... \n\nNow the question is to load up before earnings or watch and see what happens but potentially miss out on this move.", "id": "n8nalc", "created_utc": 1620593587.0, "score": 236, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "When one of your longterm sleeper plays makes it onto WSB... \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGuess it's not gonna be longterm anymore", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "WELL believes that share purchases pursuant to the NCIB will contribute to the facilitation of an orderly market and be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

As a result, WELL's combined pro forma revenue is now approaching C$300 million with over C$80 million in EBITDA(2) on a run-rate basis.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5830550193786621}, {"body": "Too bad I\u2019m already balls deep in $CLOV which is partnered with google already, but this should be a sympathy play if anything and this is good news for both companies if they both have good earnings around the same time & it is interesting they BOTH pushed the earnings date up!

In an era of record highs, it\u2019s important to find the companies that will continue to provide value in the long term. So, you need to identify innovative companies with a strong leadership team that are part of a rapidly expanding market. One such stock on the TSX is WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL). This health-tech company has managed to crush the broader market returns ever since it went public in April 2016. However, as the first Canadian health company to offer compatibility with iPhone and recent expansion into global markets, WELL Health is just getting started. Furthermore, the stock is down over 25% since February making this a golden opportunity to buy the dip. What makes WELL Health stock a top pick? WELL Health stock is valued at a market cap of $1.32 billion. Its management team believes that the Canadian primary healthcare system is under-digitized and the lack of modernization has resulted in inefficiencies. While patients face long wait times, the physicians are overworked and burdened by operational challenges. However, the Canadian government continues to spend heavily on healthcare. For example, in 2017, the federal spending on care delivery stood at $242 billion or 11% of the country\u2019s GDP, making the industry ripe for disruption and creating massive opportunities for WELL Health.\n\nThe company is a primary healthcare operator and a tech innovator allowing it to combine professional healthcare expertise with technology and create an improved outcome for healthcare participants.\n\nWELL Health is an active acquirer of digital assets and primary healthcare services. These acquisitions are highly accretive and the company is now the single largest chain of primary healthcare clinics in British Columbia. Record quarterly results In the first quarter of 2021, WELL reported revenue of $25.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 150%. This growth in top-line was primarily driven by a 345% increase in Software and Services sales. WELL reported a second consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA in Q1 and this figure stood at $1.1 million. In the March quarter, WELL announced the acquisition of CRH Medical. This transaction was valued at US$372.9 million and was funded by a $302.5 million subscription receipts offering as well as a senior secured credit arrangement that was administered by JP Morgan and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility was for an aggregate amount of US$300 million which will help WELL support the growth of its business via future acquisitions. Further, CRH is forecast to generate sales of US$150 million with an EBITDA of US$60 million and a free cash flow of US$40 million in 2021. In 2020, WELL Health\u2019s total sales stood at $50.24 million. It means, WELL\u2019s combined pro forma revenue is fast approaching $300 million with more than $80 million in EBITDA on a run-rate basis. What next for WELL Health stock? Bay Street analysts tracking WELL Health stock expect the company to increase sales by 367.5% year over year to $235 million in 2021 and by 40.4% to $330 million in 2022. Its bottom line will also improve from a loss per share of $0.03 in 2020 to earnings of $0.08 in 2022. As WELL Health continues to focus on acquisitions going forward, investors can expect these estimates to move higher as well. WELL Health stock is currently trading 27% below its record highs making it attractive to both growth and contrarian investors. Analysts have a 12-month average target price of $11.35 which is 67% above its current trading price. WELL Heath stock is valued at a forward price to 2022 sales multiple of less than 4x which is very reasonable given its robust forecasts and acquisition-based business model.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["gdp"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11728959530591965}, {"body": "I\u2019m with you.

The INO-4800 vaccine does not require refrigeration, cheap to manufacture, and will be the number one vaccine for the 95% of the globe\u2019s population that is yet to be vaccinated. Last month India was wrecked. Next week I suspect Nepal, Pakistan. The infection will probably circle back to China in the near future. They are racing against time for  a safe, effective vaccine that can go into the rural hinterland. INO-4800 DNA vaccine is the answer.  (Market size $2.5 Billion)\n2. Joint Patent with [Regeneron ($REGN) for their GBM drug/therapeutic.](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=523&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&s1=%22*%22&p=11&OS=) (Market size $400 million)\n3. Success of their [phase III HPV Immunotherapy therapeutic VGX-3100](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-announces-positive-results-from-reveal-1-a-phase-3-pivotal-trial-evaluating-vgx-3100-its-dna-based-hpv-immunotherapy-for-the-treatment-of-high-grade-precancerous-cervical-dysplasia-caused-by-hpv-16-andor-hpv-18-301237793.html)  (Market size $1.2 Billion)\n\n**Bear Thesis**\n\n1.25-30% short interest. Citadel of $GME fame has made over $100 million in profits in shorting $INO in 2021. Inovio doing well means bad news for Citadel and hopefully increase the upward pressure on $GME>\n\n2.No product ever successfully commercialized. But remember this was the case for Moderna for their $MRNA vaccine. I suspect $INO is the Moderna of 2021 in terms of DNA vaccine.\n\n3. There is [high short interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ino) which is driving the stock down which is very typical of late stage biotech.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Upcoming positive catalyst next 9 days.**\n\n**Monday May 10th**\n\nQ1 2021 Earning Call at 430 pm Eastern Time.[(Link](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2021/41181))\n\n**Wednesday May 12th**\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference [(Link)](https://www.veracast.com/webcasts/bofa/hc2021/id9FE54M.cfm)\n\nSpeaker: Dr.Joseph Kim, CEO\n\nModerator: Aspen Mori, Bank of America Securities\n\nTime: 9:30 AM Eastern.\n\n**Tuesday  May 18th**\n\nRBC Capital Markets Global Healthcare Conference ([Link)](https://ir.inovio.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)\n\nSpeaker: Dr.Joseph Kim, CEO\n\nTime: 9:45 AM Eastern\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My plan to donate to St.Jude\u2019s**\n\nIf $INO crosses $20 this week I will donate $20K to [St.Jude Hospital/Research for Children with brain cancer.](https://www.stjude.org/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update #1  5/10/2021**\n\n[https://www.americanbankingnews.com/2021/05/10/inovio-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqino-receives-average-recommendation-of-hold-from-analysts.html](https://www.americanbankingnews.com/2021/05/10/inovio-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqino-receives-average-recommendation-of-hold-from-analysts.html)\n\nAverage PT of $17.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update #2 5/10/2021 4:30 pm**\n\nQ1 2021 Earning Call at 430 pm Eastern Time.[(Link](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2021/41181))\n\nKey Points:\n\n\\> INO-4800 induced robust T-cell response too all COVID-19 variants (including UK and Brazilian variants).\n\n\\> INO-4800 has the same effective powers in generating neutralizing antibodies similar to mRNA vaccines like Moderna.\n\n\\> Second generation Pan-COVID vaccine INO-4802 is being developed and is progressing well and upcoming pre-pub  coming out in the near future.\n\n\\> Immuno-oncology effort: novel combination trial with PD-1 inhibitor with Regeneron and Sanofi in newly diagnosed GBM is ongoing. The company anticipates sharing 24 month survival data and other data later this year\n\n\\> On their HPV trials they have meet their efficacy end points. This is for the management of HPV-16/18 induced malignancies. The findings/data will be shared later this year at scientific meeting. VGX-3100 biomarker will help find patients that potentially will respond to VGX-3100\n\n\\> VGX-3100 indications may expand to include anal dysplasia and vulvar dysplasia following further discussion with FDA\n\n\\> Financial summary for Q1 2021: Well positioned finally with total cash $111.6 MM. Net proceeds of 162 million from recent offering in february. They have multiple years of capital to support Inovio's many project. RV 371K for Q1. Total operating expnese 52 Million. Net loss for Q1 54.4 Million. Or 27 cents per share. R&D expense 32MM. HIgher drug manufacutring expenses related to INO-4800 and other trials. They also had increased expense from cellectra\u00ae 2000 device and new hire. These expenses have been essential for their INO-4800 trial for covid 19 and their cellectra\u00ae 2000 device. Overall Strong financial position.\n\n\\> On track with INO-4800 trial with phase III on track for this summer. This temperature stable vaccine will be important globally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ/A Session:\n\n\\> Q1 - Jeff Mecham BoA:  How is the phase III INO-4800 clinical halt going? How does this relate to trial being done outside USA?\n\nA1: Clinical hold on phase III for INO-4800 only impacts USA and not outside of USA. They still plan to open sites in USA but most of the trials will be global. They will apply with FDA during Q1 to lift the partial clinical hold hoping to start in Q2. The goal is global phase III trial and looking with external sources of funding. Not going to Ex-US for cost reasons but they have external links with some countries which do not have covid-19 vaccines and they can do randomized placebo control blinded trials there\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> Q2 - Ellen -  Looks like you are targeting countries with active Covid-19 and without vaccines. Have you considered non-inferiority trials?\n\n\\> A2 - Case driven efficacy window is still open Ex-US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> Q3 - Ellen - Planning on revealing INO-3107 data?\n\nA3 - We received orphan drug designation last year for INO-3107 last year. The most impactful data will be released in 2022. Maybe some meaningful data later this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>Q4 -  Aydin Huseynov, M.D., CFA Benchmark - We see the data in the pre-publication. Can you commend on Geometric folding?\n\n\\>A4 -Antibody levels and impact on vaccine on rise on antibody is important. We feel INO-4800 is equally as good as current EUA approved vaccines in providing protection against COVID-19. Our phase 2 trial shows strong T-cell reponse. Furthermore, the T-cell responese mainted in respond to the new variants. This will be important in providing protection as per our phase III effacicy trial which will start later this summer.\n\nQ5 - Can you see boosting with the INO-4800? What is the medium term view for this vaccine.\n\nA5 - Many experts globally feel like COVID-19 vaccination will require annual seasonal boosting. If they are correct. A vaccine that can be boosted safely and tolerably seasonally over and over again will be important. After the pandemic we will have endemic COVID-XX which will require boosters and INO-4800 will be important to vaccinate people. They can also be used to boost other first generation vaccines that have already been used. INO-4802 is a further generation ahead and will be a pan-COVID vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ6 - E Chan from Wayne Right - Can you tell us if INovio is going to put some of their capital in global Covid-19 research.\n\nA6 - We have over 500 million in cash right now and that is one of our strengths. We want to maintain that and limit our expenses. We are currently are in the process of working with external sources of funding to expand our INO-4800 trial in the US and globally. We are focusing on places where we feel Covid-19 vaccines are needed globally. We will have more information published in the next few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ7 -  Piper Sandler - Can you comment the neutralizing antibody response in comparison to convalence plasma. What gives you confidence the reaction from the investigators and subjects?\n\nA7 - The geometric mean titer presented in the pre-pub shows excellent level of neutralizing antibodies. This is specially apparent for the 2 mg group. The confidence intervals are very strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosing Remarks: Dr.Joseph Kim\n\nINO-4800 phase 3 trial info coming out in the next few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "n8qpji", "created_utc": 1620603814.0, "score": 573, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 310, "comments": [{"body": "This ones gonna be huge I can feel it.", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Tbh same, or it's probably your dad's peen in my ass", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Bro what \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Bro?

The company anticipates sharing 24 month survival data and other data later this year\n\n\\> On their HPV trials they have meet their efficacy end points. This is for the management of HPV-16/18 induced malignancies. The findings/data will be shared later this year at scientific meeting. VGX-3100 biomarker will help find patients that potentially will respond to VGX-3100\n\n\\> VGX-3100 indications may expand to include anal dysplasia and vulvar dysplasia following further discussion with FDA\n\n\\> Financial summary for Q1 2021: Well positioned finally with total cash $111.6 MM. Net proceeds of 162 million from recent offering in february. They have multiple years of capital to support Inovio's many project. RV 371K for Q1. Total operating expnese 52 Million. Net loss for Q1 54.4 Million. Or 27 cents per share. R&D expense 32MM. HIgher drug manufacutring expenses related to INO-4800 and other trials. They also had increased expense from cellectra\u00ae 2000 device and new hire. These expenses have been essential for their INO-4800 trial for covid 19 and their cellectra\u00ae 2000 device. Overall Strong financial position.\n\n\\> On track with INO-4800 trial with phase III on track for this summer. This temperature stable vaccine will be important globally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ/A Session:\n\n\\> Q1 - Jeff Mecham BoA:  How is the phase III INO-4800 clinical halt going? How does this relate to trial being done outside USA?\n\nA1: Clinical hold on phase III for INO-4800 only impacts USA and not outside of USA. They still plan to open sites in USA but most of the trials will be global. They will apply with FDA during Q1 to lift the partial clinical hold hoping to start in Q2. The goal is global phase III trial and looking with external sources of funding. Not going to Ex-US for cost reasons but they have external links with some countries which do not have covid-19 vaccines and they can do randomized placebo control blinded trials there\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> Q2 - Ellen -  Looks like you are targeting countries with active Covid-19 and without vaccines. Have you considered non-inferiority trials?\n\n\\> A2 - Case driven efficacy window is still open Ex-US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> Q3 - Ellen - Planning on revealing INO-3107 data?\n\nA3 - We received orphan drug designation last year for INO-3107 last year. The most impactful data will be released in 2022. Maybe some meaningful data later this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>Q4 -  Aydin Huseynov, M.D., CFA Benchmark - We see the data in the pre-publication. Can you commend on Geometric folding?\n\n\\>A4 -Antibody levels and impact on vaccine on rise on antibody is important. We feel INO-4800 is equally as good as current EUA approved vaccines in providing protection against COVID-19. Our phase 2 trial shows strong T-cell reponse. Furthermore, the T-cell responese mainted in respond to the new variants. This will be important in providing protection as per our phase III effacicy trial which will start later this summer.\n\nQ5 - Can you see boosting with the INO-4800? What is the medium term view for this vaccine.\n\nA5 - Many experts globally feel like COVID-19 vaccination will require annual seasonal boosting. If they are correct. A vaccine that can be boosted safely and tolerably seasonally over and over again will be important. After the pandemic we will have endemic COVID-XX which will require boosters and INO-4800 will be important to vaccinate people. They can also be used to boost other first generation vaccines that have already been used. INO-4802 is a further generation ahead and will be a pan-COVID vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ6 - E Chan from Wayne Right - Can you tell us if INovio is going to put some of their capital in global Covid-19 research.\n\nA6 - We have over 500 million in cash right now and that is one of our strengths. We want to maintain that and limit our expenses. We are currently are in the process of working with external sources of funding to expand our INO-4800 trial in the US and globally. We are focusing on places where we feel Covid-19 vaccines are needed globally. We will have more information published in the next few weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ7 -  Piper Sandler - Can you comment the neutralizing antibody response in comparison to convalence plasma. What gives you confidence the reaction from the investigators and subjects?\n\nA7 - The geometric mean titer presented in the pre-pub shows excellent level of neutralizing antibodies. This is specially apparent for the 2 mg group. The confidence intervals are very strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosing Remarks: Dr.Joseph Kim\n\nINO-4800 phase 3 trial info coming out in the next few weeks.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would also like to know this", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08527544140815735}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04713236168026924}], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I\u2019m in and if it flies I will also donate but to the Children\u2019s Stollery Hospital \ud83d\ude01", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Where is that?
