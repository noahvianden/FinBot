Your car knows there's a meaningful chance that a child or dog follows that ball, because duh: this has happened literally millions of times in its training. It stops faster than you possibly could, and signals the car behind you to do the same, essentially in real-time.

{"title": "Thinking of following Dr. Burry in shorting bonds", "selftext": "As many are aware, the 13F for Michael Burry\u2019s hedge fund was released on Monday. His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that\u2019s why I\u2019m not Dr. Burry. I\u2019m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation.
