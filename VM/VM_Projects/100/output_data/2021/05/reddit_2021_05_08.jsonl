Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.\n\nNonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.\"\n\nSource:  https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/", "id": "n7eybf", "created_utc": 1620439925.0, "score": 14360, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 1546, "comments": [{"body": "More is coming.

Likewise make sure if you did have a data bundle, we'd not decrement from it if you visited the website. If I'm a business customer to a telco, I might want my engineers to only access certain sites, and again we can build that logic into systems (both these things are real world examples). We also have options further downstream, with rating (think network > mediation > rating > bill), so I can allow you to call 911/999/112 free of charge, or I can have a premium rate number but see you're phone number and because you are a customer not a rando, charge you differently or not at all.

I was personally involved in a police request for a compromised PBX, that turned out to be part of a network of compromised PBXs, and long story short, the people doing this were selling phone cards in 3rd world countries as quasi-legit business people, only the phone systems weren't theirs and they were basically leaving those owners of the phone systems with huge bills for that usage and they just made 100% profit on the sale of phone cards. The scale was almost admirable, the hackers absolutely know their shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Dial Through Fraud\" is also quite common. Again personally involved in a listed insurance company and a 7 figure fraud, where hacker had gained access to mailboxes, routed those mailboxes to premium rate services they controlled, then used another compromised phone system to spam call the mailboxes which routed to the premium numbers and they presumably collected the rebate from that. I literally stood behind our main Mitel engineer with CEO (who was an engineer, and this was our largest customer) as he tried to fix it, and in live time the hackers were still trying to redirect stuff.

But all we have to go on is logic and history right now. Logically, it would hurt them to renege on their privacy stance. And historically, it's clear they haven't been using our privacy so far. So many companies have complained they don't share data and a lot of their products are worse off for it. \n\nApple TV is built around a user interface where all of your video apps and subscriptions are gathered in one place. But Netflix, the leader in streaming, wouldn't join in because Apple wouldn't share data about the viewers. And I believe someone else (it might be HBO) just left or is leaving. Siri has sucked since the beginning and lagged behind of competitors. That's because Apple doesn't gather the data that Google and others do. Look at Apple Maps. It's actually pretty good now that their own cars have been driving the roads like Google does, but it took how many years to get to a level of near-parity? Apple tracks some information on how users are using Maps, but they don't log complete trips. Instead they break it up into anonymized chunks. So one chunk of data might show you leaving your house, another might show you making some turns, and another shows you arriving at a location. But it doesn't see the complete route you as an individual took. That's tough when you're trying to improve products. \n\nThe evidence is pretty clear already. They collect a minimum of data, don't share it, and anonymize and randomize it until it's not even clear what's coming from who. I'll take that ANY day over what someone like Facebook is doing.

Since April of last year, ad inventory has gotten like 5x more expensive. Ads on Facebook get inflated by a lot of factors but the one affecting CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) was VC funded companies that sell things nobody wants. The next was the election. Even with all the sophisticated tracking - people would comment \u201cis Facebook reading my mind?\u201d on our ads every day - ads have already been getting way too expensive. Our performance on ads is unusually good. Still, Facebook has steadily raised the price of ad space. They want you to give them every profit dollar knowing you\u2019ll continue to pay for break-even \u201ccustomer acquisition.\u201d They even say that in their literature  to ad buyers. I\u2019ll search for that link. \n\nThis is actually the perfect smokescreen for Facebook to say, \u201csee it\u2019s apple hurting your business.\u201d Facebook serves a warning on the ad console saying something to that effect. Except Facebook sets the CPMs!! This is not some perfect market where there is no centralized influence. Facebook warns me \u201cyour ads will be less effective because of... reasons.\u201d You know what would make ads more effective? LOWER THE COST OF YOUR INCREASINGLY INEFFECTIVE AD SPACE! The iOS14 stuff could not have come at a better time for them. \n\nI don\u2019t know why Apple is doing this. Maybe to sell more iPhones? Honestly that seems like the na\u00efve explanation.

I don\u2019t know. If anything the day has been won by VC funded zombies -that only look like businesses but whose charge is to sell their equity not their product. Because they don\u2019t care if produce a profit on ads. They don\u2019t care is they ever generate a financial profit. So they spend on ads regardless of return just to drive their topline.

{"title": "Alibaba: A Short Analysis", "selftext": "**What does Alibaba do?**\n\nFirst and foremost, they are an online commerce platform. They sell retail, they sell wholesale, they sell single items, they sell container loads of items. This also includes a logistics platform and global fulfillment network, Cainiao Network, and an on-demand delivery and services platform, Ele.me. Then, they also have a rapidly expanding cloud business in addition to some small entertainment, gaming and other business units, but in this analysis I'll mainly focus on the online commerce and the cloud business as they are the two pillars of Alibaba's business strategy.\n\nSo, let's look at the online commerce. Is it doing well? Well? It's doing fantastic! The last year, it grew by 35% YoY! Over the last 5 years, online commerce sales increased by almost 500% from 92 billion RMB in 2016 to 436 billion in 2020. To give you an idea, 1 US dollar was roughly 7.08 RMB then so Alibaba's online commerce revenue in 2020 was roughly $61.5 Billion. Revenue is extremely important for business growth so seeing a 35 PERCENT increase is amazing! In fact, this is almost unheard of for businesses of this size which just shows you how unique Alibaba is. Then, the adjusted earnings from online commerce also grew by roughly 22% to 165 billion RMB or $23.4 billion. So, how are they doing THAT well? Simple! They did get the boost in online sales because of the pandemic, but they also have 780 MILLION active consumers on their online marketplaces in China and another 190 millions internationally as of the end of 2020. They also have 846 Million Mobile Monthly Active users. Essentially, they've got more customers that the population of the US and EU COMBINED!\n\nSo, Alibaba's online marketplaces include several websites, but not just any websites. In fact, the company owns 2 of the 10 most visited websites IN. THE. WORLD. Tmall and Taobao. Alipay ranks in 26th place and Aliexpress ranks in 42nd place. The company presence is just mindboggling. And, to top it all off, the business model is much lighter than Amazon's, for example. Why? Well, Alibaba does not sell its own products, it doesn't have any inventory, doesn't have any warehouses, which results in less expenses and a higher net profit. How much higher? Well, Amazon's latest net profit margin is 5.53%. Alibaba's? 24.71%!\n\nSo, the online commerce is the main driver behind Alibaba's amazing performance as currently none of the other business segments are producing any meaningful earnings. In fact, the digital media and entertainment and the innovation incentives and others segments are actually losing money, although the CEO has explained that their purpose is not to be profitable, but rather to augment the Alibaba brand and support the online commerce platform. Now, the cloud computing is different. In the 4th quarter of 2020, it finally broke even! It is an important part of Alibaba's long-term strategy and they are placing a lot of emphasis on growing it. In 2020, cloud revenues grew by almost 62%! Alibaba Cloud is currently the biggest cloud provider in China and they intend to stay that way.\n\nOverall, the company is growing fast, roughly 38% increase in sales YoY with net income rising roughly 70% in the last year! We can see that the core business and the future business of Alibaba are doing well. How are its financials though? Well, it has a lot of cash, roughly 330 Billion RMB and its current assets are enough to cover all of its liabilities so they are looking very healthy. In fact, they've got enough free cash to start repurchasing shares. In the final quarter of 2020, they repurchased roughly $110 million US dollars which is not that much honestly, but they've approved a share repurchase plan of between $6 and $10 Billion. If we see them acting on that plan, investors could get very excited!\u00a0So, the business is growing fast, the financials look solid, they're starting to return money to the shareholders. What about their price?\n\nWell, the company is relatively cheap right now. Their PE ratio is 25.5 with a forward PE of 20.6. Historically, they have a PE average of 34.5 so we can see that they are on a big discount right now. Their PB ratio is 5 which is normal for them so there's that. Compared to their direct Chinese competitors, Alibaba's PE isn't actually that low, but I'd say that the reason behind it is that most of its rivals are only involved in online commerce whereas Alibaba is also the leader in the rapidly growing cloud computing business. Also, if we compare Alibaba to Amazon which is pretty much the closest comparison we can get in terms of business segments, we can see that Amazon's PE has not dropped below 60 in the last 5 years and their average is 137.2, way higher than Alibaba! Amazon's PB ratio is also roughly 18 or almost 2 and a half times higher than Alibaba's! Their revenues and earnings are growing at roughly the same pace although Amazon had a phenomenal year in 2020.\n\nBut, they've also beaten the last 10 analysts earnings estimates and the last 8 revenue estimates so they tend to outperform although I think that their next quarterly earnings will be a miss due to the fine that was imposed on them. Basically, we can see that investors have not priced in the growth in the share price which essentially means that Alibaba is a great deal, at least in my opinion.\u00a0It's no wonder that virtually all of the analyst recommendations for this stock are either BUY or STRONG BUY (Yahoo finance screenshot). Also, most of their competitors are focused only on online commerce which means that Alibaba has a better overall offering and competitive advantage than them. It's got better sales, better net profit margin, better brand presence, better long-term strategy AND more users than Pinduoduo, Vipshop, JD. Clearly, it's the better deal, at least in my opinion, but in all fairness even its competitors are doing really well. Some people who agree with me are Ray Dalio whose 3rd biggest stock holding is Alibaba and Charlie Munger who just bought into it with 20% of his Daily Journal portfolio.\n\nNow, this stock just looks to good to be true, right? Sort of. Alibaba does have some issues, but they're of slightly different nature. The main risks involved with the company are more... political. First of all, you have the SEC threatening to delist any companies that are doing business with the Chinese military, that don't provide proper financial statements and reporting, that have a Chinese Communist Party member on their board OR are controlled by an entity of a foreign government. Now, technically speaking, just because a company is delisted doesn't mean that you cannot trade it, but chances are that its stock price will be hurt... A LOT. You'd still be able to trade it over-the-counter, but that brings a lot of problems of its own and also chances are that most normal online brokers won't support it. I know that my broker, eToro, does not. Still, you can easily avoid that by simply buying Alibaba's stock that is trading on the Hong Kong exchange. The ticker is 9988, but it's essentially the same stock. Personally, I don't think that's going to happen, but don't take my word for it. Buying the Hong Kong stock will ensure you are protected from the delisting.\n\nThat isn't all though. Currently, there is also an ongoing regulation crackdown in China aimed at Chinese big tech companies. Alibaba was famously targeted because Jack Ma, its founder, made criticised the Chinese government's approach to financial regulations. As a result, the IPO for Ant Group, which is essentially Alibaba's spin-off that deals with consumer financing and lending, was squashed late last year and restructuring was ordered. More recently, more regulations and restructuring was ordered. While this has affected Alibaba's business model to an extent, the regulations have also affected Alibaba's direct competitors so the company still retains its competitive advantage. The regulators also handed Alibaba a fine of $2.8 BILLION US dollars, the biggest one ever handed... so far. They also ordered the company to stop its anti-competitive practices which involved Alibaba making merchants choose between using only Alibaba or rival platforms. So, are the regulators finished with Alibaba? Well, we can only speculate. The biggest worry that investors have is that the regulators will break up Alibaba into different smaller businesses, which is a possibility although a lot of analysts say that China will not risk destroying one of its biggest and most famous companies. They do seem to have moved on to the other tech companies, but as I said this is not something that you can know for certain.\n\nSo, what's the verdict? Is Alibaba a good investment right now? Personally, I think so. It is undoubtedly risky, but the company offers such amazing prospects that it's just crazy to miss out on. I mean, if you could buy Amazon at such a cheap price, wouldn't you? I'd recommend doing your own research into it, but I believe that it offers a great opportunity right now and that's why it is my second largest holding and almost 10% of my total portfolio.\u00a0\n\nFinally, Alibaba will be reporting its 2021 quarter 1 earnings next Thursday so check this out to see what could happen. There will probably be a lot of price action before that and likely after it, hopefully in a nice positive green upward trajectory.\n\nThat's my analysis on Alibaba. There's a lot more to talk about, but I wanted to keep it on the short side. What do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; Alibaba is solid and cheap.

{"title": "Why the media hates Tesla - an insiders view", "selftext": "I've worked in the media industry for over 15 years now. I wanted to give an insight of why CNBC & the media in general are so determined to bring Tesla to its knees.   \n\n\nWhether it's stories on crashes that are blown way out of proportion, or bringing on haters every 3rd day such as Gordon Johnson - the media industry is fighting Tesla because if Tesla explodes, it could destroy legacy media brands.   \n\n\nHow would a car company destroy media companies like ComcastUniversal, ViacomCBS, WarnerMedia etc?  \n\n\nMany times in local news markets, the largest advertisers are car dealerships. The will usually take a Ford or Jeep Advertisement from the manufacturer, and slap a \"available at Johnny's CarMart on - just off exit 37\" on the end of the ad.   \n\n\nIt is big money - sometimes huge money, for local TV stations.  \n\n\nDo you know whats even bigger money? National Accounts in Advertising.   \n\n\nCar & Automobile advertising are some of the largest accounts a media brand can have. GM Spends about 3 Billion USD a year. Berkshire / Geico spends about 2.3 billion. Ford - 2.3 billion & Fiat Chrysler - 2 billion. Billions more a spent on advertising by all the auto insurance companies (Tesla Insurance is a risk to those billions as well) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla famously spends zero dollars. Nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the extreme bull case is correct, then major programs on all the Network TV show's such as Today Show on NBC, GMA on ABC, CBS This Morning etc will lose significant amounts of money, and sometimes entire shows. If Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler all die slowly, so will their advertising dollars. Not to mention the cascading effect - ICE vehicle advertisements on the late night shows, on live sports etc. **Tesla's success without spending a dime on advertising is scaring the living shit out of TV executives.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake for example NBC. NBC was gearing up to launch a big new [international channel to take on CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sky_World_News). It was hiring staff all over, and setting up bureaus all over the world to have a really decent crack at the 24/7 Global news game that CNN enjoy a monopoly on.\n\n  \nTheir plan was to use the advertising dollars for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to fund this operation. Olympics got cancelled - and so did NBC's big new news channel. They had already hired and trained people as well - some of them were let go before the job even started. That's just one event axed and they had to cancel an entire News subsidiary because of it cancellation. What happens when entire industries that have been funding you for 50 years are obsolete, and the competitor spends zero on advertising? Catastrophic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think will happen if some of their largest funders, ICE vehicle manufactures, go belly up? Thousands of staff will lose their job within these media networks.    \n\n\nThe curious case of Gordon Johnson makes even more sense now. For those that don't know, Gordon was / is a regular \"super bear\" on CNBC - always talking down Tesla and having a ridiculous valuation on the company. He has been talking down Tesla for almost a decade now - but he let his mask slip this week. He tweeted about his Dad being a senior executive at GM, and his family has been working at GM for decades - I believe the quote \"GM has always been good to my family\". The same GM that pays millions of dollars to Comcast/NBCUniversal in advertising slots on NFL Football, Late night shows, CNBC, Today Show - the list goes on. \n\nIt was in both Gordon's families interest, the interest of NBCUniversal & GM to have him out on TV sets & news articles talking about how shit Tesla is. **EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE FOR ALL OF THEM.** \n\nTesla for me represents a slow, but catastrophic end to many industries, and those will cascade into the media world where they spend billions on advertising. They are being replaced with a company that spends zero. \n\n**They are all terrified - because Tesla marks a new era for not only the auto industry, but dozens of industries. And if those legacy industries and companies fail, the advertising dollars dry up as well.**", "id": "n7lth2", "created_utc": 1620467353.0, "score": 968, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "Television is also a business that is on the verge of becoming obsolete.

Maybe they start to see it now, but the FUD and behaviour of the media is from way longer. I think you give them way too much credit about understanding Tesla's magnitude from so early on. \n\nPersonally, if I have to speculate, I just think it's a combination of the following things: Ambition that seemed unrealistic (people don't want to change their view, so if they thought it was unrealistic they want to keep thinking that. Therefore they reason from a perspective how it can go wrong rather than how can they achieve it and even go so far to talk everything else down), the polarising factor that attracts a lot of eyeballs (both lovers and haters blow the attention out of proportion, which means way higher reach for outlets. Also bulls retweet articles that are total bs, they also make money for the outlets), getting information from wrong sources (they have OEMs on speed dial and OEMs have good relationships with many analysts, specialists and so on and the media just lives in that same bubble, because that's what they always believed was the whole world).\n\nWill there be malicious individuals in the media? Definitely, and probably also quite some. However, I think quite some just follow the incentive structure and lives in a certain bubble they can't look beyond. To judge certain things, you need to trust on people that are better educated in that subject than you. If you gather the wrong people around you, you will be fucked. I believe OEMs do create those bubbles intentionally, but I don't think the media necessarily takes the bait intentionally.\u00a0\n\nI just don't believe in a bigger sophisticated conspiracy than that, without any evidence such thing exists.

{"title": "CLOV will be a multi-bagger", "selftext": "I'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)\n\nBelow is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I\u2019m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):\n\n1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let\u2019s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) \u2013 a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover\u2019s business model is so fool proof!***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***\n2. **Competition:** Now let\u2019s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***\n3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover\u2019s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***\n4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let\u2019s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/)in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this\u2026as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn\u2019t\u2026.60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover\u2019s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***\n5. **Customers:** Let\u2019s now put some light on the target demographic\u2026seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.\n6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance\u2026except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money\u2026now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.\n7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock \u2013 he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as board member and dem access. Recently they added the former director of Medicare - literally the only possible guy in the world that can get them what they need to continue growth for years to come.**\n8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \\~$3B, which is \\~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover\u2019s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated\u2026upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond\u2026.it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space \u2013 TDOC \u2013 and a Cathie Wood & ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***\n\nI am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6swl0khqxx61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd81da7db75a98f1aad0ab150d7667d7f7c85240\n\nCLOV YOLO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** as someone correctly pointed out below, heavy investors such as Vanguard, Blackrock and Bailee Gifford (Tesla mega bulls) all bought in at a mid $8 price point.\n\n**Edit 2:** as requested below, there is also a bear case which simply means CLOV might take time to realize its full potential...which is different than saying it will go into the ground.**B1. Competition:** new competitors trying to enter the fast growing (but boring) MA market with an advanced tech platform ala Clover Assistant could impact growth rate (not growth). I think its highly unlikely but possible specially when Biden announces lowering the Medicare eligibility age. Smaller companies might want to get in on the gold rush. And legacy companies may want to invest heavily into revamping their business model (UNLIKELY - why? read [The Innovators Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-audiobook/dp/B06Y4RRGVV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw7diEBhB-EiwAskVi11l5HeOM_5nz4Z9EMKJHbGR9bSEs5YenWuxP8ykS-TP5AKJo1UhP1hoCiTkQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241921991729&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1018704&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=3239668408352121876&hvtargid=kwd-59432786&hydadcr=24632_10399692&keywords=the+innovators+dilemma&qid=1620501116&sr=8-1))**B2: Management:** management churn might impact the vision on which this company was founded.

My overall feeling from the materials I read in last few days was negative. I have never seen a CEO like Alex Karp! He sold\n\n|Date|Number of Shares|Price Range|Market value|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|05/06/2021|638,629|19.99\u00a0-\u00a0$20.73|12.8M|\n|05/05/2021|638,629|$21.50|13.7M|\n|05/04/2021|638,629|$21.31\u00a0-\u00a0$21.99|13.6M|\n|04/21/2021|638,629|$22.26\u00a0-\u00a0$22.54|14.2M|\n|04/20/2021|638,629|$21.68\u00a0-\u00a0$22.36|13.8M|\n|04/19/2021|638,629|$21.86|14.0M|\n|04/08/2021|638,629|$23.19|14.8M|\n|04/07/2021|638,629|$23.08|14.7M|\n|04/06/2021|1,308,465|$23.15|30.3M|\n|03/31/2021|223,755|$$23.12 - $23.54|5.2M|\n|03/31/2021|223,755|$23.12\u00a0-\u00a0$23.54|5.2M|\n|03/30/2021|237,779|$21.55\u00a0-\u00a0$21.96|5.1M|\n|02/02/2021|1,285,123|$31.18\u00a0-\u00a0$33.89|40.1M|\n|01/04/2021|1,285,123|$23.30\u00a0-\u00a0$23.78|29.9M|\n|12/02/2020|1,285,123|$21.95\u00a0-\u00a0$23.32|28.2M|\n|11/16/2020|1,285,123|$15.79\u00a0-\u00a0$16.06|20.3M|\n||**Total shares=14,159,165**||**Net = 275.9M**|\n\nIt's not even a year the company went public via DPO and he sold over 14 million shares already. His current holding is less than 6.5 million shares. If you look at other insiders such as Ryan Taylor, Shyam Sankar, Matthew Long, David Glazer, Stephen Cohen, Peter Thiel, they also sold some although not as frequently as the CEO (yes, I know they have less shares comparatively)\n\nNow let's look at some **counter arguments**\\-\n\n**Automatic sell:**\n\nLooking at the number of shares in each transaction, you might argue that they are automatic sell. I know they are but if you believe in your company then why would you sell this kind of large number of shares that frequently? Like 3-5 transactions worth millions of shares every month, so early after the company went public?\n\n**DPO vs IPO:**\n\nYou might say that the company went public via DPO and insiders need to sell the shares otherwise public wouldn't be able to buy them. I am here talking about the shares he kept selling after it went public. On the day they went public, they have already sold much larger shares. For example Peter Thiel sold 23 million shares, Alex Karp sold 13.7 million shares etc. Also, there is no shortage of float in market. On the first day of trading the volume was 338.5 million shares whereas 90-days average volume is only 74 millions. So, no he does not need to sell that frequently to keep the liquidity with demand(!). The price action rather says the opposite is true.\n\n**Stock-based Compensations**:\n\nYou might also say their salary structure is heavy on stock based compensations. The company has been around over 13 years and he waited enough so he deserves some lambos. Yeah bla bla bla whatever as if he did not withdraw any salary each year. Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public?\n\n**He needs money like everyone else:**\n\nAnother argument could be he needs to buy a Yacht or a mansion or a jet or whatever. Make the company profitable and cash positive first and then those $20 dollars stock will go to $50 or even $100 and then freaking buy 2 mansion and 3 yacht or whatever. If you keep dumping millions of shares each month when the stock kept tanking, many investors including retail and institutional, are holding large bags. Cathie alone will not be able to save it, she has already bought all the shares you sold since November 2020, and some more.\n\n**TlDr:** Not giving any kind of financial advice. I am not going to touch PLTR unless insiders, specially the CEO stops dumping shares frequently. If he does not like the stock of his company then who the hell am I.", "id": "n7ziwe", "created_utc": 1620511124.0, "score": 344, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 243, "comments": [{"body": "Wow a post on PLTR that\u2019s bearish on WSB?

[Stockcharts.com](https://Stockcharts.com) is your friend.  Not the random BS charts Robinhood gives you. It's called momentum and you don't want to be on the wrong side of it, JMHO.

Almost all of them I sold over at 100% profit in less than 2 months. You might say that was a special time. With that logic and if you actually know how a moving average filter actually works, you should know that price of a stock on a random  day in Sep 2019 has an effect on that 50 and 200-day filter curve you see today (on 05/07/2021)! That means all these 50 and 200-day MA curves are severely skewed due to that rapid fall and rise of all these stocks.\n\n>but people much, much smarter, and with a LOT more money, have already put in their bets\n\nMost of the volume we see in stock market is due to trading activities by institutional traders/investors. Some are betting on bullish speculation and some are on bearish speculation. Most of the major stock prices are currently above both 50 and 200-day MA on a yearly chart. Now tell me the people who are betting bearish are less smart and have less money? Go and look at the option open interest on SPY. Billions of dollars are betted on both sides. So, the bearish side is less smart, poor and they do not follow these indicators. Is that what you are trying to say?\n\n>Why would u want to buy a stock below the 200-day MA on the daily, and especially on the weekly?\n\nAll these indicators changes their level based on whether a chart is daily, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, monthly, 3 months, 6 months or yearly and so on. The shape of a chart also changes based on the frequency of the data points such as 1 min, 5 mins, hourly etc. play around with the frequency and duration, you get many different charts. All of them are real chart based on true stock price but they all will look different, all the TA indicators will look different. I would not even look at these MA indicators to buy a stock so that question was invalid.\n\n>Use it as a place to enter and exit a trade is all I'm saying\n\nI entered SPY calls this week when SPY was below both 50 and 200-day MA on both daily and weekly chart. I sold them and make profit when SPY was above 50 and 200-day MA. Which is exactly the opposite of you are referring me to do. \n\nLet me tell you one thing, stock price do not follow any predefined pattern. Once the market closes and the chart is established whether it's a daily or weekly or monthly you can then draw as many pattern as you wish by changing the variable like timeframe and frequency. If a stock price closes above it's 50 and 200 days MA line on both weekly and daily chart. Nobody, I mean nobody in this world can guaranty that that stock price will close higher on the next trading day. Period. A trend is only a trend while it last but the truth is no one knows how long it last. SPY was going up on Wednesday and then it started going down on the same day. What is the trend here up trend? downtrend or dance trend? \n\nTA does not work, ever. Worked, never with any amount of certainty.
