The Lightning Network enables fast, secure, private, trustless, and permissionless payments. Here are some of the features of the Lightning Network:\n\n* Users of the Lightning Network can route payments to each other for low cost and in real time.\n* Users who exchange value over the Lightning Network do not need to wait for block confirmations for payments.\n* Once a payment on the Lightning Network has completed, usually within a few seconds, it is final and cannot be reversed. Like a Bitcoin transaction, a payment on the Lightning Network can only be refunded by the recipient.\n* While \"on-chain\" Bitcoin transactions are broadcast and verified by all nodes in the network, payments routed on the Lightning Network are transmitted between pairs of nodes and are not visible to everyone, resulting in much greater privacy.\n* Unlike transactions on the Bitcoin Network, payments routed on the Lightning Network do not need to be stored permanently. Lightning thus uses fewer resources and hence is cheaper. This property also has benefits for privacy.\n* The Lightning Network uses onion routing, similar to the protocol used by The Onion Router (Tor) privacy network, so that even the nodes involved in routing a payment are only directly aware of their predecessor and successor in the payment route.\n* **When used on top of Bitcoin, the Lightning Network uses real bitcoin which is always in the possession (custody) and full control of the user. Lightning is not a separate token or coin, it is Bitcoin.**", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I like the low fees of lightning, but honestly, I see the value of banks are very good in that they can reverse transactions from fraudulent vendors, as well as keep a history for you.

I have been reading a book on the beginnings of speacex and this mentality is much at the core of how they do things both there and at Tesla.

She meets with Musk and she give's him all of that and glances at it and hands it back and says just do it.   Don't tell me about what you are going to do just do it.\n\nI think this idea is clear in everything they do including this BTC thing.   I think for them this was a grand test.   If you want to be a leader sometimes you have to venture where others haven't and that means potential that things don't work out the way you think they will.   And there is no way of knowing how it will work when you have a company this size making a move like that.   So they just do it.   They buy some and then sell a bunch to test for liquidity and when new info comes out about energy usage shooting up for BTC transactions after what they did they reevaluated and moved on.  What looks like them throwing things at a wall to see what sticks is them testing if something will work.  They are not afraid of admitting they made a mistake and moving quickly to something else.   You can see that in how they are designing starship at SpaceX for example.   Very public failures but they then quickly iterate and move on and do it again.     There process has seemed to be very successful for them.\n\nPersonally I am invested because they are like this.    And while that might seem like crazy spur of the moment things I really don't think they are.    Just at some point you have to decide to try it or not.

And it is pretty clear his view of short term stock movements is meaningless to him.   I mean what other CEO would go on twitter and say the stock price is too high.   In the end his focus is just much different then yours.     If you can't see the value in this that is okay but it seems to have worked out fairly well up until now.   If you don't like that then I would sell and move onto another company with a more conventional structure and CEO.   This is likely to keep happening because of the way they do things.   And they have been successful because they are like this.   And you can believe in the long term mission or not but you have to take the good with the bad.

{"title": "Discovering the True Rate of Inflation: A DD on the Fed", "selftext": "*Would have posted on* r/investing*,  but they don't allow graphs. Read at your own risk.*\n\nSo I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**\n\n1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.\n2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. \n\nI decided to do some research into the questions: \"how much inflation are we really experiencing?\" and \"is it out of line with historical inflation\" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.\n\nSince this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.\n\nSo...\n\n# What is the actual Inflation Rate? \n\nBased on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).\n\n[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)\n\n**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**\n\nTo question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.\n\nTo question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.\n\n**What about inflation in Housing?**\n\nGood question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  \n\n[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)\n\nThat's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.\n\n[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)\n\nI also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. \n\n# How did you come up with these numbers?\n\nI decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).\n\n[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)\n\nTo construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.\n\n I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. \n\n**Last thing I'll note:**\n\nIf you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vzzrknsyyz61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a1ba2ddc10e53d0553e597ae6d990751a23cc14\n\nAlright, I'm done now.

Broadly speaking, a generational new deal would contain three elements.\n> \n> 1- Limited bailouts: politicians and voters would realize the futility of trying to restore the world of yesterday.\nWhether it is fair or not, the post-Covid 19 world will need fewer cruise ships and cars, as fewer workers commute to their offices. Airlines CEOs, who failed to prepare for what should have been a normal business risk after the SARS, avian flu, and Ebola outbreaks, do not deserve to get bailed out. Neither do investors who bought junk bonds in highly leveraged companies, or the private equity managers who sold them. The U.S. bankruptcy system is designed to reorganize failed businesses and transfer their assets into stronger hands. Creative destruction is the true engine of long-term growth: it should be encouraged, or at least allowed.\n>\n> 2- Large fiscal response: record low interest rates, mass unemployment, and depressed commodity prices create a\ngenerational opportunity to \u201cbuild stuff\u201d \u2013 in the words of entrepreneur Marc Andreesen. Hospitals, dams, 5-G towers, windmills, solar panels \u2026 the bigger the better. Austrian types will correctly point out that some of this production will be wasted on bridges to nowhere, pork barrel politics, and the kind of highly visible but\nuneconomical projects that bureaucrats crave, such as high-speed bullet trains. Encouraging the private sector to build simple things, such as affordable houses near major urban centers, could reduce the risk of wasteful spending. But ultimately, even wasteful government spending would achieve the goal of injecting money into the\neconomy, provide employment, and eventually kickstart inflation.\n>\n> 3- Inflationary policies: **inflation is the only politically palatable solution to the generational crisis.** A decade of\nhigh single-digit inflation would wipe out about two third of the outstanding value of all student debt ($1.6 trillion), encouraging household formation, boosting discretionary spending, and eventually reversing the decline in births. A flexible universal basic income would allow the government to target a desired price level much more effectively than the failed monetary policies of the past decade. Protectionist measures would transfer purchasing power from idle consumers (the old) to the working producers (the young).\n>\n> The generational inflation gap I mentioned in the earlier part would eventually shrink. Housing prices would\nfall because of the recession at first, and then thanks to an increase in the supply of affordable homes in tense housing markets. Medicare for all, for which the moral case has never been stronger, would spread the rising cost of healthcare across generations. Medicare for all would also reduce the cost of labor, increase\ncompetitiveness, and boost economic flexibility as workers would be able to switch jobs more easily. Last, if the world economy can work on Zoom meetings, so can classes of 30 college students. Colleges have shown true genius to preserve their rents, escape competition, and ignore the technological revolutions of the past 30 years, but Covid-19 may eventually be lethal to university mandarins. The real value of a fancy college education (becoming part of a professional network after graduation, four years of boozing without many\nresponsibilities, and mating with members of the same socio-economic status) cannot be realized on online\nclasses.

If wages go up then everything becomes more expensive. This is taking everything else equal of course. Wages CAN go up without causing inflation if it is paired with increased productivity. \n\nThink of it like this: how much does it cost to make something? Well you need raw resources, energy, and then manpower or technology. If manpower costs go up they aren't ever going down which means inflation. Of energy prices go up, well they can go back down in a month...its temporary. Raw materials are the same...during supply shocks like we ha e right now prices go up.

Utilities in particular had something like 15% inflation over the last 10 years, and that accounts for half of most people\u2019s energy expenses.\n\nOn the part about wages: I believe this chart shows an increasing drive towards assets, which implies that the greatest source of inflation in the last ten years comes from asset prices, not the weak wage growth and subsequent spending shown in the last chart. Moreover, if you look at a chart of productivity vs wage growth in the last 50 years, you\u2019ll notice that estimated productivity continues to rise radically, while wages begin to flatline in the \u201870s. If what you\u2019re saying is true, then we could expect to have extreme deflation over that period- fewer wage dollars are now chasing relatively more goods. But capital and rentier income has grown massively at the same time, offsetting that effect. \n\nThe main place I\u2019d argue you can see that effect in action is the difference between inflation in essential consumer goods, and in luxury goods and assets.

Coinbit to 500,000k is a bit ridiculous, however given its limited supply (21m) and inflationary markets, it could be looked at as a digital commodity which will keep it rising.\n\nNetflix however is a company that I have felt could be in trouble for a while now. Given that anybody that owns content is starting their own streaming service, it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to keep Netflix as a middle man because they offer a currently premium streaming platform. While they do own some of their own content, I feel like it is very hit or miss and that could drive consumers to look at their competitors. While their financial are healthy in the present state, I feel they could fall victim to diminishing margins very quickly.
