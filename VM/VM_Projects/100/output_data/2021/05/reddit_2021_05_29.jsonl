{"title": "I think Xiaomi has huge long term potential in IoT - tech giant at a market cap of just $85 billion", "selftext": "Xiaomi (HK: 1810) is a mere 11 years old and didn't go public until 2018 - the same year they turned profitable, yet the are a well known brand and already third in global smartphone sales.\n\nA few days ago the company delivered a pretty wicked [earnings report](https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/05/26/xiaomi-posts-record-results-as-2021-q1-revenue-and-profit-hit-historical-high-levels/) with an adjusted net profit increase of 163%. \n\n [Two days prior I published an article](https://jesbaek.com/2021/05/23/xiaomis-future/) of how their unique 'AIoT' and 'Internet Services' strategy will eventually allow the company to make much larger profits on revenue in the future.\n\nXiaomi commands one of the largest product portfolios with smart enabled devices of every category. In the West we don't yet see their smartphones too often - but their robo vacuum cleaners and electric scooters (They own Ninebot and Segway) and other smart home equipment is everywhere. They are basically taking the opposite route of Google and Apple in providing the hardware before the software - which also means they currently have higher costs and lower return on revenue.\n\nYet they are already profitable and sit on a cash pile of 5.6 billion. About 60% of their revenue right now is however attributed to their smartphones - which are doing extremely well. Their phones receive high praise (though their Android fork is not liked by all) and offer unbeatable performance for the price. They do well in every price category and own several well known sub brands like Redmi, Poco and Blackshark. As an example Mrwhosetheboss (huge tech YT channel) picked Xiaomi brands for all top 3 spots for his best phones of 2021 out of 22.\n\nXiaomi holds the top spot in market share in several emerging markets: India, Russia and most of Eastern Europe and soon South America. In Scandinavia where I live, they just recently entered local carrier stores, began advertising actively and opened a local [official webshop](http://www.mistore.dk). The ban on Huawei left a HUGE gap in the European market for Xiaomi to just freely gobble up and it seems like they are doing it. Xiaomi themselves have been [removed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-us-remove-blacklist-1224721/) from a similar (but much less severe) blacklist by the US government this week as well. They do not pose the same threat as Huawei did, as they do not build infrastructure telecom equipment\n\nThere are rumors of the company designing their own SoCs (chips) in collaboration with OPPO and just last month they [invested $10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/chinas-xiaomi-to-launch-electric-car-business-and-invest-10-billion.html) into the Electric vehicle space. They already financially back Xpeng too and I think with the insane growth in the Chinese EV market they really have an opportunity to add even more value to their ecosystem integration.\n\nThe company is founded by Lei Jun and former Vice President of Google China and Zhou Gaungping then Senior Director at Motorola\u2019s Beijing R&D Center. All three still lead the company today with Lei Jun as CEO. Xiaomi and their CEO has a huge following in China and a very dedicated loyal fan base. \n\nThe company trades at a P/E of 23 and a share price of 28.6 HKD (~3.69 USD). The price to earnings is pretty typical for a tech stock but I think the benefits in profit of Xiaomi's strategy and investments are yet to be seen. I began buying up a few months ago and just doubled my investment after the earnings report. I will continue to buy in over atleast the next year and truly think this is a case of a company working hard for the future and with the right strategy. I saw the same patterns in Microsoft 6 years ago when Sadya Nedella took over and that position I'm up over 500%.\n\nPlease let me know what you think and if you feel like there is anything you feel like I need to address. I'm really bullish on this company and it helps balance my portfolio with exposure towards Asia. I know Chinese stocks can be effy and at least for me it was also quite the challenge to find a brokage where I could buy them.", "id": "nnn1og", "created_utc": 1622293363.0, "score": 257, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah apparently they\u2019re huge in South America according to friends.

HERE'S HOW!", "selftext": "$$$ HOW TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE $$$\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* If you aren't in TSM ( ***Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing***) you hate money. Here are some reasons you should look into this stock and buy it before it is too late. \\*\\*\\*\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Economics 101, Supply and Demand.**\n\n* TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world\n* THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE\n* Let me emphasize this point. THERE IS A WORLDWIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE\n\nAs many of you know, there is a worldwide semiconductor shortage (yes I said it again). These semiconductors are vital components in every electronic we use today. Without these semiconductors, things like smartphones, automobiles, video game consoles, etc. Would not be able to function.\n\n(Read the following if you want to see why these semiconductors are so vital...or just completely trust me, that's fine too)\n\n***\\*ALL COMPUTERS NEEDS SEMICONDUCTORS TO FUNCTION\\****\n\nSemiconductors are used primarily in electronic devices, including chips, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits. According to Goldman Sachs 169 industries rely on semiconductors. Anything that is computerized or uses radio waves depends on semiconductors. Your phone is a computer, your car is a computer, your video game consoles are computers, your amazon firestick is a computer, every aspect of your life is dependent on these semiconductors.\n\nTSM PRODUCES THESE CHIPS FOR THE FOLLWOING COMPANIES AND MANY MORE:\n-Apple\n-Toyota\n-NVIDIA\n-AMD\n-SO MANY MORE\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDo you believe the future of automobiles are powered by electric? Not without semiconductors.\n\n**Semiconductors in Automobiles**\n\n1. **Vehicle electrification \u2013** Semiconductors have made it possible to replace manual systems with electrical systems. Electrification of key systems provides benefits such as increased vehicle efficiency, reductions in carbon emissions, and minimizing oil dependency.\n2. **Safety and driver assistance \u2013** The increasing need for better safety and driver assistance systems in cars has provided a niche for semiconductors. Intelligent functions such as backup cameras, blind-spot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, airbag deployment, and emergency braking systems are all made possible through the integration of semiconductor technologies.\n3. **Connectivity \u2013** Cars are increasingly incorporating technology that improves their connectivity. New vehicles on the market include ever-more sophisticated telematics (long-distance data transmission) and infotainment capabilities which feed drivers information on factors such as road closures, collision avoidance, and even free parking spaces at their destination. On-board computers which handle this information have to process millions of lines of code every second. Semiconductors allow cars to stay connected in real-time.\n\nSemiconductors are key to the future of the electric vehicle (EV) industry as they help to control the powertrain and battery. Semiconductors are also used in the variety of touchscreens that are installed in the driver\u2019s dash and in the back of passenger seats.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**FINANCIALS/NEWS**\n\n* Financially, the company has reported its third straight quarter of record sales in its first-quarter earnings report back in April.\n* Its revenue came in 25.4% higher year-over-year to 12.9 billion.\n* The stock has more than doubled in price over the past year\n* Japan\u2019s government recently announced that it wants TSM and Sony to invest $9.2 billion to build the country\u2019s first 20-nanometer chip plant.\n* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) said on Friday (5/21/2021) that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage.\n\nThese are just a couple of things. If This has caught your eye please research TSM on your own and you can find more great news and financial statements...or don't, you've made it this far, might as well go all in.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSupply and Demand.\n\n**Positions**\n\n**30 7/16 $120 C**\n\nIt\u2019s a yolo play for me.

{"title": "AMC Volume Price Analysis", "selftext": "  \n\nHey fellow traders. Today, l\u2019ll present to you a very strong bull case on AMC that is not explained by simply putting a rocket emoji (I love this emoji by the way) or because someone else posted a strong YOLO bet on the stock. Here is my analysis based on volume, price action, and a powerful pattern named the flag, high and tight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/5bruexp383271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f679d9584a983071eaf036df2e4c5be14069eaae)\n\nFirstly on the weekly chart, we see a high tight flag that started developing from the low on January 5th at $1.91 (#1) to the high of the pattern which was achieved on January 27th at a staggering price of $20.36 (#2). In 17 trading days, the stock soared 1065.96%. It\u2019s an understatement that this price action caught my attention. The following months saw the stock consolidate in a flag, high and tight on falling volume. Bulkowski studied this pattern extensively and it\u2019s one of his favorites. HTF is characterised by a rise of at least 90% (aim for double) in less than 2 months followed by a consolidation period on ideally falling volume. I think we easily meet these criteria! The performance rank of this pattern in his work is 1 on 23 in a bull market (1 being the best) with an average rise of 69% and throwbacks happening 54% of the time. Price meets target 90% of the time. The measure rule helps us acquire a potential price target for this trade. In his work, Bulkowski tells us to measure the rise and project it 50% past the breakout point. With the measure rule, using the breakout point at $12, we would have a theoretical price target of $63.96 (1065.96/100/2\\*12)). Now to the analysis based on volume and price.\n\nOn the weekly chart, we have the breakout on #3 with rising and above average volume. This confirms the breakout is not fake, but supported by the professionals. After the minor pullback, we see the momentum exploding and the price action ripping past $20 on very high volume. Like we will see on the daily chart, the last trading day of the week saw some heavy selling which can be seen with the long upper wick on the weekly chart. \n\nI attribute this to two things. First, the stock rose to overbought levels and a pullback was imminent. Two, the stock hit the ATH of around $35 and many market participants saw this as a good point to take profits.  While it is true the SI rose in this period, I do not believe shorts created this long upper wick. Seems more likely professionals were taking money off the table. This being said, I do not think we are witnessing a trend end since strong momentums like this one cannot be broken in a single day. Like a big cargo ship, it cannot be stopped simply by turning off the engine. More effort will be necessary to break this rocket for sure. On top of that, the most conservative assessment would bring us to $63.96 in less than 30 days (around June 10th) following the breakout and we have a 90% chance of hitting this target according to Bulkowski. If these are not good odds, I don\u2019t know what is. I truly believe this is an opportunity of a lifetime!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/wslu122983271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1d2f718d41538d8bfad7ffad44ade99c796356)\n\nOn the daily chart, we can see the flag, high and tight develop from January 27th on #2 to the breakout at #3 on May 13th. Developing this cause is important according to Wyckoff\u2019s law of cause and effect. The development of a cause will be proportional to the subsequent effect. On May 14th (breakout day (#4)), we see rising and above average volume that confirms the start of a new trend. Then, the test of supply on the pullback at #5, we see falling volume until the stock reaches $12 which means there is no interest in selling at these prices. The rally resumes on very nice long white candles on steadily rising volume which means volume and price are in harmony fully supported by the great professionals. \n\nOn the second to last candle, we see some selling happening as shown with the upper wick. On #6, we see a tall black candle that closes very close to the prior day\u2019s close. I associate this candle with the bearish meeting lines candle. Bulkowski\u2019s work establishes the candle to be a continuation pattern 51% of the time in a bull market, which is pretty much as valid as a coin toss. If the next day\u2019s close is below this candle, Bulkowski tells us there is a 70% chance the candle acts as a reversal. So this is to be looked at closely for next week. The long upper wick and shorter lower wick associated with very high volume tells me there was more selling happening Friday by the professionals. \n\nWe must remember that stocks do not trend in a straight line. Volatility is cyclical, and all this is normal price action. Even in the event that Friday\u2019s price action is stopping volume by the great professionals and the beginning of a distribution phase, Wyckoff\u2019s work tells us this is associated with a potential preliminary supply and this stopping action ALWAYS fails and thus the rally WILL continue. Ladies and gents, I cannot stress enough how AMC is trading currently at a discount and any entry point is a good one at this point in time. We do not choose our seats on a rocket ship! You get in, strap on, and enjoy the ride! Trying to perfectly time the bottom on any pullback is a fool\u2019s errand! Looking back at the daily chart on AMC, #1 (hanging man) and #3 (dark cloud cover) shows us that any bearish candle in the recent history of this stock is likely to be very short lived. Shorting this stock based on the bearish meeting lines (weak bearish candle by the way) would be a very dangerous endeavour indeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/erdc846b83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec91557abfecf685c4af681eaf68f0da6a1fd9b)\n\nLastly, on the 30 minutes chart, friday we see at #1 strong buying pressure as seen with the long lower wick and high volume at $25.50. #2 was a retest on falling volume meaning falling interest to sell at this price. I do believe we have strong support at this level.\n\nNo one has a crystal ball and this could go either way, but the odds are that we reach $63.96 by the end of June with a 90% probability according to Bulkowski. I am adding to my position at any dip in this stock. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbs706tc83271.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8669186d98ef0792b216b50992969cd1d08fe785\n\nIf history is of any guide, I expect AMC to have a short consolidation period with falling volume like we saw with GME before the great run up. Thus, I believe we have another week to add to our positions before this really takes off. Any close above 35$ will be extremely bullish\n\nI\u2019ve been reading many posts explaining the short squeeze potential and this adds to the excitement of a strong bull run in this stock way past $63.96. AMC is currently the most shorted stock in the market as we speak. Though I have doubts that AMC will reach 500k like many claim, I do believe we have a strong squeeze potential in this stock as shown by the candles and volume recently printed on the charts. Ultimately, volume and price will tell us when it is time to close our positions.\n\nCheers,\n\n20$ 07/16C AMC\n\n30$ 07/16C AMC\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, Bulkowski\u2019s HTF gives us a 90% chance to hit the target in the next 30 days after the breakout. This target is his CONSERVATIVE target not MY target. I do NOT plan to sell at this target. I have no price target at this time since it could squeeze to 10k for all I know.

There have been several posts about maxpain and what it means is they know there is 100,000 ITM calls, and 100,000 PUTS and they try and manipulate the price to the penny to NOT PAY those that are ITM. In other words, calls over say 27 are ITM and PUTS under 26 are ITM so they park it at 26.50 to fuck both sides. Now sure, some people still win, those who bought really high/low/early but there is a point where MOST people LOSE. That's how they rig the price. They use shorts and buy ITM PUTS (taking a loss) to lower the price right to the cent to bring max pain. Retail doesn't have enough cash to offset this, and they can also use illegal dark pool trading where they only report the sells and not the buys, so it alters the percieved price. It would be like having 500 buys and 200 sells, and only reporting the 200 sells. This is how they manipulate the price to fuck us. Since learning this, I always exit my calls before Friday morning as I always get fucked. Also, institutional traders, day traders, week traders close their positions Friday morning. Now when this happens, all those shares that Market Makers bought to cover, can now liquidate them and do, driving the price further down.

To me also looks like a \"bearish meeting lines candle\" as you put it.  \n\nSo good chance Tuesday there's testing of supply on falling volume and we consolidate for a while, and the uptrend may continue soon. \nOr there is more selling off and another candle with lower close and longer upper wick forms for then a 70% chance of trend reversal, and we have a pullback to find lower support and enter a longer period of consolidation. \nSeems it'll go down anyhow; with first scenario happening if falling volume, second scenario if volume picks up.  \n\nAny opinions?\n  \nAll this not taking in consideration whether any significant shorting is cause for selling pressure. As you say any bearish candle in the recent history of AMC is likely to be very short lived, and shorting based on bearish meeting lines is dangerous. Perhaps these bearish meeting lines followed by a quick reversal are the result of continued short term shorting and covering.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hey! Glad you liked my post!
