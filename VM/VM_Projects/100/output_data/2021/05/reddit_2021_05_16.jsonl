The employer decides where to spend the money in order to attract labour. This is business; there isn't anything moral or amoral about it like you imply by calling it an \"excuse\".\n\nIt seems also you don't understand what is included in total comp vs wages. Would you rather get:\n\n$40/hour (which you then pay an effective tax rate of about 30% on for a net income of $58k) and no benefits (because of an excuse)\n\nor\n\n$15/hour (27% effective rate so $22k net) + $5,000/month healthcare (no taxes) + $15,000/year 401k contributions (no taxes) + $700/month car allowance (employer covers taxes) + $2,000/month housing allowance (employer covers taxes) + stock options worth $40k (not wages, but part of total comp)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven just stock option of $80,000 with no wage income and you'll be out here complaining about wage stagnation while making 20% more that US median wage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Walmart doesn\u2019t pay minimum wage because these social programs exist, they pay minimum wage because they can.\n\nAnd the reason Walmart can pay so little for labour is because labour is subsidised by social programs. \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f That is literally why walmart can pay so little. Not only that, but [increasing the payout from social programs also reduces the LFPR](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/229716069.pdf); you get less taxpayers while simultaneously needing more funding for social program obligations to be maintained at given levels.\n\nNow we also have [these guys](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/myth-busted-taxpayers-are-not-subsidizing-wal-marts-low-wages/) who take issue with a report written by Democrats that claims [Walmart can pay its workers so little because of welfare and social benefits programs.](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/files/Walmart-on-Tax-Day-Americans-for-Tax-Fairness-11.pdf)They are half correct: that is why walmart can pay so little, but when they claim\n\n>\"Sheppard goes on to write that \"According to a 2014 report by Americans for Tax Fairness, Wal-Mart receives an estimated $6.2 billion in subsidies every year, primarily from the Federal Government.\" **If Wal-Mart would only pay its workers more, the argument goes, taxpayers would save all this money.**\n\nThey suddenly [start reasoning from a price change](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/never-reason-from-a-price-change/): they ignore the first step which is that welfare subsidises labour which causes more labour to be offered at lower prices thereby reducing equilibrium wage.

Is our goal to increase nominal wages or to increase living standards? If a 2021 car costs half as much and lasts twice as long as a car from 1980, do we really care that wages \"stagnated\"? You can buy twice as much at any given income, is that any different than doubling your income?\n\nThis is also why we care about total comp. Before like 1980 you had to get your wages and then buy your health insurance after tax. After that you could get your healthcare paid for pre-tax. Pre-tax makes it a benefit AND removes the extra 30% income tax you had to pay before you could go buy your healthcare! Would you rather have 10% more wages that you pay 30% tax on or 10% more benefits that you pay 0% tax on? Do you want those stock options into your 401k with no tax or do you want a wage increase that the government is going to take 30% of?\n\nMinimum wage is a price floor, it doesn't \"bring wages in line\" with anything. At worst it causes industries and jobs to disappear and at best it has no effect. Ex. Raising min wage from $7.25 to $10/hour in Texas would have no effect because there are 0 jobs offered at $10/hour as equilibrium min wage is above that level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Admittedly I had a hard time on the same website finding the data I wanted before making my previous comment.\n\nthe [BLS.gov](https://BLS.gov) website is absolute trash and a royal pain to find anything on especially lately.

But those coffee bean trees you planted years ago are dead now and you have to replant and wait months for your coffee to be commoditized and sold.  \n\nNow imagine this happening to say 80% of coffee farmers.

Instead, securities dealers compete on the open market based on price, submitting bids or offers to the Trading Desk of the New York Fed through an electronic auction system.\n\nIf the FOMC decides to change the target range for the federal funds rate, the baton passes to the Trading Desk in the form of a policy directive. This directive includes the target range for the fed funds rate and an order to buy or sell government securities to hit that target.\n\nWhen the Trading Desk purchases government securities, such as Treasury bonds, the Fed deposits funds into the bank accounts of the sellers.\n\nThat payment becomes part of the reserve balances that commercial banks hold at the Fed; this increases the amount of funds that banks have available to lend.\n\nThis injection of reserves into the banking system puts downward pressure on the federal funds rate, which then puts downward pressure on other interest rates and therefore encourages more borrowing throughout the economy.\n\nPolicymakers refer to this as \u201ceasing\u201d or expansionary monetary policy\u2014pushing on the gas pedal to give the economy more fuel and to encourage economic activity, such as in times of slower employment growth or a potential economic downturn.\"\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2019/august/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained\n\nOne important thing to note is that the reserve balances held at the fed are not legal tender.

He has a YouTube channel and following that is at its heart based around Tesla & Elon. \n\nOne of Dave\u2019s big goals is to interview Elon. I really like Dave\u2019s content but he has a lot of inherent bias, as do a lot of these YouTubers. That\u2019s why critical thinking and observation of the facts is always important. \n\nThe facts are, Elon made hints that he was \u2018on board\u2019 with Bitcoin (putting on his Twitter), as well as making Doge references; both things respectively saw increases in Bitcoin/Doge prices. \n\nIt was then announced that Bitcoin held Tesla on its balance sheet. Then we found Tesla would allow customers to be purchase a car or make a deposit using Bitcoin. Again moving prices upwards. \n\nThen a subsequent announcement was made in a matter of just months, that Tesla had concerns over Bitcoins\u2019s energy usage and especially its use of coal in mining. He also noted Tesla would not be selling Bitcoin.\n\nSince then it\u2019s come to light that Elon has been in contact with Doge developers for quite some time and it\u2019s now clear (unless of course he\u2019s lying on Twitter etc.) that he wants to see Dogecoin succeed after some changes are made to it. \n\nQuite ironic, given Dogecoin also uses a \u2018proof of work\u2019 algorithm/mining approach, even if it is currently less polluting. He also made a fairly harsh comment to a Litecoin developer, when he pointed out flaws in Elon\u2019s ideal changes to Dogecoin. \n\nHe then went further and suggested Bitcoin isn\u2019t decentralised as 35% of its hash rate was lost when a region in China had to stop mining operations temporarily. \n\nQuite ironic again, given Dogecoin is primarily held by a handful of very large whales, with one owning circa 30%. In essence, although a valid point, nothing to suggest Dogecoin is superior here. \n\nLastly, he has hinted at the idea Tesla may already have, or may in the future sell Bitcoin. A contradiction to his previous statement about not selling at the time of his energy concerns. If Tesla hasn\u2019t already sold Bitcoin, he\u2019s done a great job of encouraging Bitcoin\u2019s price down as much as 15-20%, wiping off perhaps $300-400m\nof Tesla\u2019s BTC position, which seems a very irresponsible way to behave on behalf of shareholders. \n\nOverall, Elon\u2019s enthusiasm towards Bitcoin and subsequent reversal of opinion in a short space of time seems for lack of better word \u2018odd\u2019. Yes, energy use has increased since Tesla held Bitcoin on its balance sheet, but that is to be expected whenever Bitcoin\u2019s price rises, a trend that has long been established. \n\nHis frequent doge references now seem less innocent, given he has been in talks with doge developers for some time and actively wants to improve the currency. \n\nSorry for the long post, but that\u2019s everything I\u2019ve seen to date and my opinion.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "good points. felt like i was reading an essay lmao", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20629380643367767}, {"body": "Excellent insightful comment a rare sight in these parts.

The argument you just gave in this quote is for due diligence from a financial perspective: is this investment likely to pay off? In answering that, the scarcity of bitcoin is a good thing in terms of securing value. You don't want new bitcoins to flood the market, so the fact that it is harder and harder to add more is a *good* thing. \n\nBut the fact that the juice is getting harder and harder to squeeze has an unfortunate side effect: it consumes more energy. That is a separate question from the value of your investment. Consuming more energy for new bitcoins doesn't make the value of bitcoin go down. \n\nTesla as a public company has a duty to its shareholders to do the best it can for them financially. The mission to protect the environment is not a fiduciary responsibility under US law, so Tesla and Musk are not under the same obligations for due diligence.\n\nOf course, promoting something so wasteful and destructive of the environment is not a good look and is contrary to what some investors want. For all sorts of reasons I think it is better for them to walk away from bitcoin, but then I'm not a crypto fan. In any case, my understanding is that they do not have a fiduciary responsibility to carefully estimate and consider the environmental impact.\n\nBut let's say they did the research and they haven't learned anything new recently.

This is Tesla money, not Musk money. Tesla has a CFO and team who should have looked at headwinds to any investment paying off. Energy use increases were obviously going to be a headwind because they're environmentally destructive which will deter adoption - it's often cited on this sub as a thing people hate, and it's baked into the design of bitcoin.

It's exactly the kind of thing someone who believes in the potential of crypto who had billions of dollars would do. We both know of such a person.
