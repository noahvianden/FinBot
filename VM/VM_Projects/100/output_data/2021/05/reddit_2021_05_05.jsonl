I am indeed in for the longer term (4 to 7 years, something like that). But see my fear above. Whenever I buy now, and let's say in one year the economic will go down (which I expect (lots of unemployment, lots of bankruptcy, higher prices vs lower incomes etc)). At a certain point it must go up, but will it be that much I will take a good profit?\n\n>There's probably better buys in other industries at this point\n\nLike what? Bio-industry? Healthcare? Energy (curious to this industry as well)?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Doesn't this mean it will go significantly lower on a certain point?\n\nNot necessarily. The year following most recessions often has outsized returns because the market overshoots to the downside. For example, in the 12 months following the great recession, the stock market rose 71%, which is quite close to the 74% return we saw in the 12 months following the coronavirus crash. And there was another 10 years of gains to be had after that period. Similarly, the tech bubble of the late 90s gave outsized returns for five consecutive years. No one would've wanted to wait out the gains of 96-2000 just because the S&P rose 34% in 1995. \n\nThe real reason for worry about overvaluations is that, considering the economic conditions, the market did not fall that much to begin with, and because interest rates are so low, there aren't really many good alternative investment options besides the stock market, so everyone is disproportionately funneling their money into it. The other side of the coin, though, is the tremendous amount of Fed support that essentially has the market believing that Powell can cancel any recession by slashing rates and printing endless money. Who's to say the Fed keeps rates at zero and doesn't stop QE for years? I mean it just happened last decade with the recession. Rates were kept at zero and QE was enabled all the way until 2015. The only chance that we see a real, steep correction is if Powell is forced to raise rates and taper QE because of inflation. Otherwise, the economy will be pumped hard for the next few years, and so will the stock market. If you wait on the sidelines, you're essentially banking on inflation getting out of control in the near future (which is obviously possible, but I wouldn't 100% count on it). \n\nI think what u/Fearstruk said is the best idea: invest most of what you want to invest now and keep a somewhat sizeable portion, like 30%, aside in cash so that you can still take advantage of a correction if one occurs in the near future, without running the risk of missing out on gains if a correction never appears or only appears much later than you expect.\n\n>At a certain point it must go up, but will it be that much I will take a good profit?\n\nSeven years is a long enough time horizon where you are very likely going to see gains on your investments, even if you went all in at the top and then saw like a 30% correction immediately after. Again, this is where I direct you to what u/Fearstruk said, because having some cash on the side will dramatically lower the chance of you getting screwed by bad timing.\n\n>Like what? Bio-industry? Healthcare? Energy (curious to this industry as well)?\n\nWell that's where doing your own research comes into play. The point was that tech is at an outsized risk for a major correction compared to all of the other industries since their valuations are stretched much further than any other sector. You're going to find better risk/reward in stocks in those other industries than you will tech, especially if you believe that there will be a correction in the near term.

My answer starts with my understanding that short term prices are mostly based upon emotions, with fundamentals and analyst opinions factoring into those emotions. Long term prices typically fall into line with fundamentals. The emotions are basically greed and fear. Nobody can magically impact financials, but impacting emotions is not only easier, but it happens all the time.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I would do. I would start with a volatile stock that has lots of support and hopes of quickly rising prices. I would buy some calls and help that stock rise slowly by buying shares carefully and slowly as the prices rise. Then, after selling my calls and buying puts, I would quickly drive the price downward with selling spurts. The slow buying encourages greedy buying, the quick selling triggers panic selling.

{"title": "Return of Big Oil. The death of oil has been greatly exaggerated", "selftext": "Return of Big Oil. The stories of Oils death have been exaggerated.\n\nI dont know if the previous post made it to WSB. Been lurking here for awhile posting comments here and there. Here is the link to my previous post.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfom5q/long_oil/\n\nTLDR: Still have my calls however I sold some at the top in March and bought more since then. Fully levered to specifically OXY and XOM. \n\nXOM Calls:\n171 $80 calls for 1/21/22\n63 $75 calls for 1/21/22\n87 $70 calls for 1/21/22\n22 $60 calls for 1/21/22\n\nOXY Calls:\n21 $40 calls for 1/20/23\n\nNow for some details. As of yesterday we got our first clear indication that the reflation trade is on like donkey kong. The API estimate for supplies for oil were a huge draw in inventory. https://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1389680376545697798 \n\nThis has been slowly building with other investment banks earlier this year saying that oil production is in a major deficit and will significantly effect the price per BBL later in this year. As of right now we have Goldman Sachs at $80 by this fall (https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Goldman-Oil-To-Hit-80-On-Largest-Ever-Demand-Jump.html) JPM at $75 by this fall, Morgan Stanley at $60 for the year but $75 this fall, and other major investment banks that have gone balls deep in betting on the oil price environment. So clearly, they see something coming this year that hasnt accurately been priced in to the energy sector through the share price. (Ignoring the small cap energy names and talking about the large caps and Majors IE XOM, CVX, PXD, OXY, FANG, EOG, MRO and maybe you would look at ConocoPhillips..)\n\nThis brings me to my next point, all those companies have told investors that the plan to keep production flat to return money to shareholders. That means that if demand returns to pre-Covid levels in the near term we will have a significant supply deficit on our hands. Now lets look at the EIA data (next data dump from them is later today around 10:30 CST.)\n\nHere is the general link for the EIA Gasoline Supply ( https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/ ) Key takeaways from this is that Gasoline demand is up and continuing to increase, additionally, the EIA reported on their outlook for the summer driving season and they estimated that the price of gasoline would increase alongside with the increase in driving that we might see due to pandemic being handled. Specifically, the Biden Administration has set July 4th as the date for true reopening assuming we can get enough people vaccinated. I see this as a key date to watch. People seem restless after being locked up all year and want to take a vacation especially since the prices of vacations are cheaper and most families having the most liquidity that they have ever had on record. https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/archive/2021/210407/includes/analysis_print.php\n\nNow that seems to be a pretty rosy outlook for gasoline demand and trucking diesel has already surpassed last year precovid levels back in March. So that means travel and transportationa are up. Now lets look at air travel which would add more demand to the supply chain. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47756\n\nAs you can see in the link EIA shows that we are moving in an upward direction in air travel but I would expect this to slowly keep rebounding this year while coming back to the original usage next year. \n\nNow lets look at production, something that is heavily debated amongst oil bulls/bears. EIA has revised their production estimates 3 times this year downward because of lack of capital going to replace the production. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47056\n\nThat 8% drop from 2020 to the previous estimate was a shock to some but now the EIA predicts that the US will produce 10.9 MMBPD which some think is a stretch due to the amount of drilling required to bring production to a level that we were at in 2020 and 2019. https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_oil_rotary_rigs\n\nThe US has been slowly adding rigs to keep drilling new HZ wells that will help keep the production flat however, due to the extreme decline curve of HZ wells (they decline about 67% in the first year) both the amount of wells being drilled and completed will need to dramatically increase to meet the demand. Roughly speaking it will take an operator about 20 days to drill a well to total depth and completion according to SM at the beginning of the year however they are one of the fastest drilling and completion teams in the Permain Basin. https://s22.q4cdn.com/545644856/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-SM-Energy-Presentation.pdf SLIDE 14\n\nAlso something to consider is the fact that most operators now drill and complete wells in large groups nicknamed the \"Cube\" (for SM its about 8 but some go so far as 36 at once.) So wells drilled in this style would take between 160-720 days. (Now for a less aggressive estimate we can assume that some companies complete multiple wells together and this is known as Simulfrac which would cut the completion time in half for large groups. For sake of optimism lets just say 80-360 days. This means wells that are drilled now wont be online to keep production flat until about fall at the earliest and next year at the latest.\n\nAll this info is to setup the big kicker. With our boi J-POW printing like no ones business and Oil being priced in dollars across the world we can also get some weird inflationary pressure due to the dollar getting weaker. Alongside with the interest rates coming higher and investors flocking to safer boomer dividend stocks. That is why I took agressive bets on XOM. This is the biggest boomer of all. They are incredible about producing around the world, refining, and getting great prices for their products. \n\nOXY's bet is for a separate post but it boils down to this being a company that might be too indebted to survive unless they get $65 oil which as of yesterday we are there. They have torque to the oil and gas market and should be able to pay down debt thus making them financially solvent and increasing the share price. \n\nHold on to your bootstraps boys. This year is going to be wild for Oil and Gas companies. There are a couple of risks to this theory but with the API information and IRAN posting a video about blowing up congress it looks like Repubs are going to want to get tough on Iran and not sign a new deal. That leaves roughly 2MMBOPD off the market. Venezuela just decreased production to 500mBOPD which is terrible considering the size of their reserves. My case actually still works for this year even if both Iran and OPEC+ start pumping due to the demand rebound that will cause a terrific spike in prices. \n\nThis is my own opinion and I am probably retarded so dont take anything as fact but I think its setting pretty nicely.. GLHF.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention I\u2019ll update this when the EIA numbers come out.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1389950802069008387?s=21", "id": "n5dzl9", "created_utc": 1620215184.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Crap wsb is joining the energy play.

The policies also don't need to be neoliberal, it is enough if they only profit a small group of people in power. Furthermore, it is not so important if the population is likely to accept something or not but more so that you can change policies and laws to your liking without major repercussions. And finally, the profiting group or individuals and their profit are always the only relevant consideration. This almost always leads to infighting at some point.\n\nApplied to hedge funds, bankrupting a company to guarantee and maximize profits from naked shorting can definitely be regarded as one aspect of applied disaster capitalism.\n\nu/Comrade_Corgo's suggestion of Karl Marx is interesting because the therein described period of early industrialization in the UK is one which arguably comes quite close to disaster capitalism being observed at a large scale in real life.
