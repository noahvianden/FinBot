The result is that their investment portfolio is earning something like <0.50% annually. Overnights are below 10 bps right now, money markets are below 5 bps, and low investment grade CP is like 20-30 bps for month long paper. It's a terrible time for yields. \n\nSource: work/worked in treasury for major F500 companies.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4527188539505005}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4983069896697998}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48849692940711975}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5076743364334106}, {"body": "It's cash and marketable securities.

{"title": "Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit.", "selftext": "Alibaba Becomes the [Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now According to Reddit.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-undervalued-stocks-buy-133333592.html)\n\nFirst off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)\n\nAlibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)\n\nWhy do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.\n\nNow what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.\n\nSince Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.\n\nIn short, there are times when investing seems easy.

{"title": "Detailed analysis on why UWMC\u2019s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst", "selftext": "**UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!\n\nOne piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.\n\nThe list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to \u201cMSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions\u201d on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **\u201cUWM HLDGS A\u201d**.\n\nThere is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.\n\nFirst, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It\u2019s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC\u2019s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.\n\nWhy is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.\n\n~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock\u2019s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~\n\n**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** \n\nThis allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.\n\n>[BlackRock iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) \\- Net Assets $4.12 Billion  \n>  \n>~~0.16%~~ (0.02%) \\* $4.12 Billion = ~~$6.59 Million~~ ($824 K) corresponding to ~~816,800~~ (102,100) shares @ $8.07.  \n>  \n>[Vanguard Global Small-Cap Index Fund](https://markets.ft.com/data/funds/tearsheet/summary?s=IE00B42LF923:USD) \\- Net Assets $3.69 Billion  \n>  \n>~~0.16%~~ (0.02%) \\* $3.69 Billion = ~~$5.9 Million~~ ($738 K), corresponding to ~~731,600~~ (91,450) shares @ $8.07.  \n>  \n>[SPDR MSCI World Small Cap ETF](https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-zprs-gy) \\- Net Assets $950 Million  \n>  \n>~~0.16%~~ (0.02%) \\* $950 Million = ~~$1.52 Million~~ ($190 K), corresponding to ~~188,350~~ (23,500) shares @ $8.07.\n\nIn comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It\u2019s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.\n\nTL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC\u2019s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index.", "id": "nj0cj6", "created_utc": 1621745577.0, "score": 387, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "Many tailwinds converging for the long play, scooped up 24,300 shares while they\u2019re still on sale \ud83d\ude80\n\nproof: https://imgur.com/a/9qIRBwi", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "What app is this in the screenshot that you use to trade shares?

The only thing that makes me pause is the price to sales ratio of DKNG.  BUT if the short-term premium for no debt is 20x-35x then pay attention to forward revenue and buy the fucking dips kids.

{"title": "Come enjoy the $RIDE \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 (comparison to $MVIS included)", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice.\n\nI\u2019m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I\u2019ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I\u2019ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:\n\n* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE\u2019s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)\n* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry\n* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued\n\nThese stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE\u2019s 6-month chart for reference).\n\n**$MVIS comparison:**\n\nTaking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.\n\nI actually googled \u201cHindenburg MVIS\u201d and the second article that popped up was titled \u201cTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.\u201d This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.\n\nMore recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE\u2019s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.\n\nI found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg\u2019s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.\n\n**$RIDE Intro:**\n\nLordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM\u2019s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.\n\nDiscussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that \u201cTimeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.\u201d\n\nThey have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.\n\n**Ohio\u2019s Endorsement of LMC:** \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn\u2019t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it \u201c\u2018bull\\*\\*\\*\\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don\u2019t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.\u201d\n\n[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): \u201cI think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area \u2014 Voltage Valley as we like to call it \u2014 but all over Ohio.\u201d\n\n[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) \u201cReally, this is the future,\u201d DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. \u201cI think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.\u201d\n\n[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he\u2019s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he\u2019s seen the company\u2019s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he\u2019s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. \u201cThey\u2019re way way way far along,\u201d he said. \u201cWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.\u201d\n\n**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE\u2019S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**\n\nThey also [recently announced \u201cLordstown Week\u201d](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.\n\n$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.\n\n**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**\n\n* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.\n* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).\n* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.\n* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.\n\nEVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you\u2019d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.\n\n$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).\n\nPosition: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I\u2019m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it\u2019s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20\u2019s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "njgs1i", "created_utc": 1621802662.0, "score": 413, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 380, "comments": [{"body": "Well I just bought 10,000 shares.
