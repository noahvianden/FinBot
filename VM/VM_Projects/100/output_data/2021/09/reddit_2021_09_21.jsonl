I think they will continue talking about it but not doing it until they see a confirmation from a market that it will not crash when they do it.\n\nThe table doesn't reflect any market fundamentals but more likely human psychology on how they perceive the market and corrections. It can give you an idea of when you may expect buyers to step in and prop the market again. Humans behave the same way all over again and again. So if you see an ugly correction or bear market, markets down 40%, and 120 days (example) in the mess, you may feel from the table that the bottom is possibly near so you do not want to be selling or hedging your portfolio anymore but start looking for an upside move. Then the table can tell you that you may expect another 230 days (example) for the crash to recover... That's all this table does. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe idea behind the table is to give you a reminder about the previous corrections and what you may expect because I do not know about you but people (myself included) have a short memory span and no longer remember what has happened before. A great example is people telling you that we are in an uninterrupted 12 years-long bull market. Well, we had three bear markets already, one even took 155 days. That doesn't count?\n\nAnd that brings you to distinguish between cyclical and secular markets, which people mostly have no idea what that is.\n\nBut if you need more information on the market moves, you must go to the charts and fundamental analysis. the table doesn't tell you that.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "crash", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "buy some straddles", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14061929285526276}, {"body": "when the market goes down that fast, always look for the dead cat bounce. that cat bounced a couple times this morning", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4805797040462494}, {"body": "I vote bloodbath.

{"title": "Evergrande isn\u2019t the only reason the stock market is headed lower, here are 7 other reasons", "selftext": "I've summarised the news and added a link just in case you guys want to read the complete article-\n\nU.S. stock benchmarks were on track to post their worst daily drops in more than two months, with the skid being blamed on the potential collapse of Evergrande. The Chinese property giant is threatening to default on $300 billion in debt that could ripple through global markets. However, the downturn in the highly leveraged real-estate sector, which the Financial Times notes makes up more than 28% of China\u2019s economy, isn\u2019t the only problem for markets on Monday. Here are the other reasons-\n\n**Delta woes**\n\nThe delta variant of COVID-19 is resulting in higher case tallies in the world\u2019s largest economy. The U.S. is now averaging more than 2,000 deaths daily, according to a New York Times tracker, the most since March 1, and consist almost entirely of unvaccinated people. Florida, which has vaccinated 56% of its population, is averaging 353 deaths a day. Texas, where 50% of the population is inoculated, is seeing 286 deaths a day, according to the Times. Those two states account for more than 30% of all COVID-19 deaths since March 1. \n\n**Fed taper talk**\n\nMarkets are fixated on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s Sept. 21-22 meeting, where Fed officials face the prospect of winding down the accommodations that have propped markets up since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., even as the economic rebound looks uneven. The Fed has been buying $80 billion in Treasurys and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month since last June to keep long-term interest rates low and bolster demand.  A number of Fed officials have expressed a desire to announce tapering at the September meeting and begin the initiative before year-end. Investors are anxious about the timetable for such reductions and are also looking out for any signals of an interest-rate increase in 2022.\n\n**Debt ceiling**\n\nOn Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged Congress to raise or suspend the nation\u2019s debt ceiling or risk \u201cwidespread economic catastrophe.\u201d In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, Yellen, a former Fed chair, noted that the U.S. has never defaulted, and she said it must not do so now.\n\n**September and stock-market seasonality**\n\nThere is a growing sense that valuations are rich and the Federal Reserve\u2019s easy-money punchbowl will be yanked away at the worst possible time. Seasonally, September has been one of the worst months for stocks, and investors think that the market might behave true to that pattern.\n\n**A correction is due**\n\nStrategists think that the market is due for a significant pullback as the S&P 500 has recorded more than 200 sessions without having seen a drawdown of 5% or more from a recent peak, making the current stretch of levitation the longest such since around 2016, when the market went 404 sessions without falling by at least 5% peak to trough.\n\n**Inflation lingers**\n\nInflation continues to dog markets. Data recently showed that the cost of living for Americans rose in August at the slowest pace in seven months and signalled the surge in inflation this year may have peaked, but Americans probably aren\u2019t going to get much relief from these elevated prices soon.\n\nAside from a brief oil-driven spike in 2008, consumer prices have risen this year at the fastest pace in three decades. And a new survey by the New York Federal Reserve shows consumers expect inflation to average 5.2% in the next 12 months.\n\n**Buy the dip?**\n\nInvestors have grown accustomed to buying market downturns, referred to as buying the dip. However, Monday\u2019s action, and trading over the past week, suggests that investors are becoming more reluctant to purchasing beaten-down stocks with expectations that stock values will resume record run-ups after modest declines. On Friday, the S&P 500 closed below its short-term trend line for the first time since around June, which could reflect the erosion of buy-the-dip behaviours.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/evergrande-isnt-the-only-reason-the-stock-market-is-headed-for-its-worst-day-in-2-months-here-are-5-other-reasons-11632146759?mod=article\\_inline](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/evergrande-isnt-the-only-reason-the-stock-market-is-headed-for-its-worst-day-in-2-months-here-are-5-other-reasons-11632146759?mod=article_inline)", "id": "psevc3", "created_utc": 1632214312.0, "score": 323, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "Ever time there is some movement in the stock market people want to blame it on something in the news.

{"title": "Evergrande - thoughts from an ex hedge fund analyst", "selftext": "There\u2019s been a million questions about the Evergrande risk of default and whether it represents a systemic risk to China equity markets that could spill into ours via contagion. I\u2019ll give you my thoughts as someone who has spent their career as an investment professional in both hedge fund land and as a private equity investor (current job).\n\nThe first thing to recognize is that China operates very differently \u2014 their government\u2019s motives aren\u2019t based on economic prosperity like Western governments\u2026it\u2019s control. Look no further than how they were willing to shoot their entire big tech industry in the gut to bring it to heel under the party\u2019s control.\n\nSo what happens I\u2019m not 100% sure, but the actions taken will be whatever maximizes party control. I personally think that\u2019s quasi-nationalization.\n\nIf they let it default it will pose the risk of very rough contagion to their financial system, especially within debt cpaital markets which could lead to liquidity and short-term financing concerns, etc. that would eventually require monetary intervention. China doesn\u2019t care much about a business going under\u2026it cares about those risks to the financial system that in turn pose political risk to the party.\n\nThe market (or at least the buyside) has been expecting / talking about this for a while and yesterday was in my opinion a more behaviorally based knee jerk reaction. We\u2019ve been overdue for a 5-10% correction (based on historic patterns which I realize aren\u2019t necessarily predictive of the future) so this feels like a good excuse to initiate selling waves which becomes self fulfilling. That's not to say there's no risk of a further slide and I'm not calling a bottom, but it does present an opportunity to start dollar cost averaging your way in.\n\nIf you want to know how this plays out the best thing you can do is look towards historic precedent for over leveraged businesses in China that pose risks to the system. In the case of HNA, for example, the playbook was to essentially take over the business and cut lose debt where they don\u2019t care about the relationship and pay off those who they do care about. So someone like HSBC would be fine whereas a smaller foreign bank may get burnt. Any large international a bank is important enough that the party is going to make them whole, (or close to it), mitigating concerns for systemic contagion. And the quantum of debt is not too much of a dent to China\u2019s balance sheet, especially compared to the money printing that\u2019s gone on for covid stimulus.\n\nWhile the only person who truly knows what will happen policy-wise is Xi himself, based on historic precedent I think the outcome will be more favorable than the market is pricing. Personally I am going to buy in on what I think is an overreaction and a lot of market noise where people have been looking for an excuse to sell off. The selling yesterday was actually very orderly and you saw a lot of institutions unwind their hedges (buying back their covered calls). And new option volume did not suggest the market is now incrementally more bearish. \n\nEDIT: Adding link to a piece by Michael Pettis who (I think) succinctly explains the risk + regulatory quandry and how he estimates it will play out. I agree with his points and a lot of sellside reports have been predicting a similar outcome for a bit now. This is to say I am not re-inventing the wheel with this perspective, merely pointing towards how institutions and leading academics are thinking about the situation to try to cut through some of the misinformation I've seen posted (on both sides of the coin).\n\nLink: https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/85391\n\nTl;dr:\n- The key is to understand which constituencies within evergrande\u2019s debt burden China cares about keeping happy and how much debt those they don\u2019t care about have on their balance sheets\n- Yesterday was an overreaction but selling was calm and orderly (not a panic) and many people took out their downside hedges (i.e. buying to close on covered calls, selling their long puts, etc...a bullish signal)\n- The market and smart money has known about this for a long time.

Following that, supply chain issues cause a spike in raw materials (I.e. wood) that has already lead to a cooling in new home builds. And inflated prices has cooled secondary purchases as well. Throw in the prospect of higher interest rates as a catalyst (bc it will further suppress demand) and you\u2019ve got a recipe for a short play.\n\nOn letting Evergrande topple to send a message on leverage I\u2019d push back a little. The regulatory regime has already implemented leverage rules and the adherence of those is in part what has lead to the situation at Evergrande.

UNLEASH THE BEAST AND SQUEEZE THE SHORTS!!!**  **\ud83e\udd2b** \ud83d\ude4c  \ud83e\udd11\n\n\\-------------\n\n**BlackBerry has earnings coming up this Wednesday, September 22nd after the market close, and there has been speculation from RBC Equity Research that the patent settlement/details could be announced.**\n\n[RBC Equity Research](https://preview.redd.it/u8c9mp5kovo71.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=be29bb850a6833f65987bcce09b4d81d6a552aa5)\n\n**On top of this, IAM media outlook who is a legit and fairly accurate media outlet specializing in Intellectual Property (and who first broke news about the BlackBerry Patent sales earlier in 2021) said in August 2021 the announcement is likely close and could be announced towards the end of September 2021, which is now (see below for the article):**\n\n\"Nine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry\u2019s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame\n\nIt\u2019s almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:\n\nDuring the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.\n\nThis came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.\n\nSince that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.\n\nSo, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry\u2019s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents \u201crelating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies\u201d, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.\n\nInevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.\n\nOur understanding, though, is that neither of these \u2013 or the many other stories doing the rounds \u2013 are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.\n\nThe pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.\n\nHowever, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month (September 2021), closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.\n\nNote \u2013 the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.\n\nFamous last words!\"\n\n**Don't forget about IVY + Amazon partnership with connect cars for IoT (Internet of things).
