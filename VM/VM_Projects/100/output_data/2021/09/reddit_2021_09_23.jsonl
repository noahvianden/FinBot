The way it adds new money to when you started is dumb on so many levels.  I feel like they do it so you don't know what is going on with your money.   We have no way of knowing the timing of your investments or real returns.  What the chart is conveying is that back in Oct 12 you had 157k burning a hole in your pocket so you opened up a Robinhood account.  For a year and some months nothing happened to your money.  Shit a pandemic hit, the market tanked, and it barely moved the needle.   Then on June 1st you said fuck it, I'm going to thetagang this shit and turned your 157k into 223k.  Read some of your responses to other people giving you shit.  The picture I see and what you have stated do not correspond to each other.  In the end as a person who analyzes data for a living, we can't really compare this information to what the S&P did since then. \n\n2) Congratulations on not having a similar but inverted graph that is red.  \n\n3) I wish my buy and hold 401k target date plan looked like this.  Sadly it doesn't.   \n\n4)  If I was doing an analysis on these numbers (based on the chart) and did a pre post thetagang strategy analysis, say using a regression discontinuity design, controlling for the market, with 6/1/20  as the place where the strategy changed, I suspect that it would show a statistically significant improvement over whatever strategy you were doing before.   Without the data it's hard to do.\n\n5) If you really want to know what your real returns are, break out excel and do the math yourself.   What I did was take my monthly statements and figured out the returns for each month  (column a).  Column A should be monthly return/total invested up to that month.  I usually add money every month, so this works for me.  This helps control for some money being in a very long time and other money only being there one week.  If you really want to be anal you could do it every time you add or subtract money.   Every month should suffice.  Make a new column (column B).  In that column add 1 to your monthly return.  This helps for the next calculation.  Finally add a third column  with a formula that looks like this.  = (B1\\*B2\\*B3...Btoday)-1.   Got these formulas from a website a few years ago when I was trying to figure out if I was beating the market.  If any of you smart people have a better way of doing this, or if my math is wrong, I'm totally interested.  In the portion of my 401k that I control, for example, my returns make up 50% of my portfolio that I controlled since November 2019.   I suck, the S&P kicked my ass, I should have bought SPY....  Well not really.  I started by moving only 1K from my target date funds as an experiment.  1% to see how I do.   I slowly added more since then, and when it was clear that Fidelity's target date funds aren't really taking advantage of this raging bull market I started moving substantial amounts over.  Well according to this math I'm up 218% as of the end of last month.

First The chip shortage needs to be fully resolved, then we need to at least see ground broken on charging station infrastructure and the EV tax credit take effect. Those 2 things will push the EV  market into overdrive as consumers will be heavily incentived to make their next car electric and manufacturers are able to ramp up production to match the increased demand. The increased demand will lead to there being more competition in the market sector, and late comers to the party will be happy to use BBs proven tech in their cars rather than develop their own like TSLA. Think of it like windows vs Mac in the 90s. Sure the Mac was higher quality most the time but everyone used windows because it ran on lower specced, cheaper pcs. Just like computer elitists used to  swear up and down about the superiority of Macs PC people just shrugged and nodded because Windows could play doom too and was $600 cheaper. It'll be the same with BBs software.\n\nSo yeah, dont psyche yourself out by putting unrealistic expectations on the stock for this year. Just hold till the company proves you right with their sales.

I'm bullish on the company too for all the same reasons but you can't base everything on what you believe they have the potential to do in the future. You have to look at the companies standings right now in the present as well. BBs EPS tanked hard mid last year and dropped hard again Q2 this year before the last 2 qtrs started showing improvement. They've only had 1 profitable qtr in the past 3 years way back in the beginning of 2019. Yes there is currently a lot to be bullish about regarding the companies *potential future* but a company that's been around as long as BB has and hasn't been able to maintain any semblance of consistent profitability since Kony 2012 was on your Facebook wall they need to have more than just potential, they need to prove that they can show *results*. Concrete results that the last decade of unprofitablilkty for the company wasn't due to complete incompetence but rather used to develop the tools that will allow them to pivot completely from a hardware company that had good cyber security tools to a fully fledged cyber security firm with tools that are intuitive for manufactures to use and are unparalleled in security. \n\nYeah it seems very likely that they're value will rise when all their catalysts are hit but there are a lot of variables that could impact either the timeline of EV manufacturing (like the ongoing chip shortage) or they could lose some of their *projected* market share if a competitor comes to market (we don't know what every business out there is doing all the time) or a fucking sharknado tearing through their headquarters killing all their top talent (earths fucked yo it could happen). \n\nThat doesn't mean it's not a good stock to sit on, it's currently trading right around its 5 year avg meaning it's sitting on some good support around this level so there's little chance of it plummeting, not unless BB comes out with some bad news or another trash earnings randomly. Some institutions have been capitalizing on recent buying opportunities to aquire some pretty large positions which lends credence to the bull thesis. They're basically saying 'this most likely a good trade *eventually* so I should buy shares now whenever they go on sale and hold them till the catalsysts start developing' Fairfax and Primecap in particular both have raised their position to about 7% of the company, Primecap has been so hungry for shares that it seems they've even been willing to buy at some pretty aggressive prices. If you don't know PrimeCap they run a private fund for institutions and mutual funds which. They're the *investors* investors and their strategy focuses on *long term* value plays driven by intensive FA, but unlike other funds that use a set of benchmarks to determine what stocks to buy strictly on the data PrimeCap is basically 5 God tier investors and their teams doing their own research and are each given full autonomy of their part of the fund. They pitch their ideas to the other 4 investors at which point they decide whether or not they want to include it in their segment of the fund. You don't get a job like by being a yes man who buys what the computer tells you to, you get it by having a legit sharp eye for deep value and risk assessment. Based on the size of their position at least a few of those guys were so convinced by the research they were presented that they felt like an avg cost of $11.28 on BB (remember they are value *long term value specialists) was within they're risk tolerance. Other big names like Vanguard hold substantial positions (they got in at $10.50)\n\nA Rule of thumb, if the basis of your thesis starts with an 'if' (for example *if* their cyber security picks up steam) then no matter how confident you are or how likely it seems the biggest moves are always going to coming from the institutions that either use a strict set of parameters to determine what to buy or sell or ones that do not make any moves until every possible deterring factors to the play have been cleared.

They already have $772m in the bank & their market cap is $6bn. So they would have 30% as much cash as their current market price (yes it's a lot).\n* Revenue for all businesses beat expectations this quarter.\n* If and once it's confirmed the media will run the story that BB is now a company of the future fully focused on IoT (internet of things) and cybersecurity (and no longer failed phones \"lol\").\n* Their most ambitious project: building the equivalent of the Apple Store back when the iPhone came out but for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. Project name: IVY. Oh and they have a partner in this: Amazon. Early release: in a few weeks October 2021.\n* Now why it's taking so long to sell that Portfolio? Well the big boss (Papa Chen) said he's mad too and added *\"it's coming up, the next Christmas\"* (2021). *I put 80%, we get it done this quarter.*\n\n**Before I go any further: imagine you have a paper acct like me, so how to trade BB?**\n\n^(Not a recommendation to use real $$$.) Rule of thumb: when it's below $10.00 it's a paper buying signal. But why bro? Well check the graph for whichever timeframe you want in 2021. It doesn't stay for long in single digit. There is big money behind it (yea looking at you Allianz AM) so ppl BTFD.\n\nBut it's already above $10 bruv... Well either wait for a pullback and pls refer to how quick it bounced back from the dip this morning or do your own DD and risk assessment if it's still worth it below $11...\n\nDo not FOMO at $15+ or God forbids $20+. Be smart be early with your monopoly paper bills.\n\n**The in-depth details and why I call it a Christmas Gift**\n\nThe most important is: Papa Chen said 6 months ago - when they first revealed the ongoing negotiations - that \"our investors would be very pleased with it\". In the previous quarter he said it is at a stage of definitive agreement. But last night he brought that term: it's coming for Christmas. And I feel how cheeky he is. It's both a time frame and a gift to BB ^(bag)holders. \n\nNow I must emphasise it's not 100% done. The sale could still fail. He put a probability of 80% that it would be done by Xmas. So now I must share Papa Chen's exact words:\n\n*Turning now to licensing. As I mentioned earlier, negotiation to sell the portion of the patent portfolio related to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking, are ongoing. And we have made significant progress since our last earnings call, including preliminary agreement of many of the key terms of the deal. We expect to execute definitive agreement this quarter. Closing the transaction will be subject to a normal regulatory review. Naturally, given this backdrop, we will continue to eliminate monetization activities for the remaining of the fiscal year, therefore, revenue for both Q3 and Q4 is expected to be similar to Q2, which is at $10 million per quarter. While we expect the sales to conclude essentially, the process has taken longer than we expected or anticipated. Should it not conclude this quarter, we have other options, including additional interested parties. We will update investors on any of the material developments in a timely manners.*\n\nThen later in the Q&A:\n\nPaul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n*Hi, John. First question on the patent sale, I know you can't say much just given you're in the middle of negotiations. But in your statement, you mentioned that the negotiations are going well. But then you also indicated that if it doesn't close, you have other options. Just could you bridge between those two statements, because they're actually quite far apart from a tone perspective.*\n\nJohn Chen -- Executive Chairman & CEO\n\n*That's a good one. I'm glad you caught it. Yes, it is going well. I fully expect to finish this this quarter.* ***But I'm tired of waiting. I know a lot of our investors are too.*** *I'm not blaming anything on anybody, and may be we have too many lawyers assigned to this, sorry, lawyers, I doubted you. But the key is: it's a complex and big portfolio. It is rightfully so that they have done a lot of due diligence, and those things are now completed by the way, all the due diligence are completed. And then we have a lot of time span on definitive agreement negotiation. And then by and large, with the exception of one or two items, we're done with that. And then we have the purchase agreement. And so it just for me, it's been since last Christmas. It's coming up, the next Christmas. So, I basically kind of draw the line in the sand and say, I can just stop licensing the business so either move on one direction or the other. And then there are other interested parties in calling. And so we are not entertaining them because, as you recall during a period of time, not long in the past, we were in exclusive discussion with these people. So I can't really entertain a third-party. So my only point is, if you want to put percentage, waiting percentage, I put 80%, 20%. I put 80%, we get it done this quarter. Does that help?*\n\nPaul Treiber -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\n*Yeah, that's very helpful. I wasn't going to ask for percentage, but I'm glad you threw it out.*\n\nLater in the Q&A Chen added: *I would say to you that that we have settled on the price.*\n\n**Thoughts and Risks**\n\nTo be honest some of the risks are behind: it should have been sold already. Instead these negotiations have been dragged over the last 6 months hurting BB both top and bottom line. Making them miss their numbers. Downgraded by mean analysts. Reduced to a meme name.\n\nBut Papa Chen had enough of this BS. He and I quote has drawn a line in the sand. Either they send the money or he's gonna talk to other companies. I'm not sure how threatening does this sound...\n\nBottomline: if the sale is not concluded to this particular buyer from North America it would have been a lot of time and money wasted.\n\nThen comes the regulatory risk because the sale could be delayed or even blocked for antitrust concerns or what not.\n\nBut if we are in the 80% area and the sale is indeed concluded by Xmas that would significantly strengthen BB financials and business model as they would be then fully focused on IoT and cyber.\n\nBlackBerry needs to tell this story to the world: forget about the past, forget about our phones (even though they were so cool with the keyboard), we are now primed to be a New Big Tech company. For where you are now. And where you go next.\n\n^(Positions or ban: paper long shares at 9ish and long BB FDs, next weeklies and monthlies.)", "id": "pu3xox", "created_utc": 1632428839.0, "score": 532, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "It's gonna be a white Christmas for me and my 50 $12 BB calls then \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf84", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "I'll buy you a turkey for Christmas if it doesn't work out.
