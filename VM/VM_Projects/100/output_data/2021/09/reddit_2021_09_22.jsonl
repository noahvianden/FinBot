What are some misconceptions you once had about the stock market? They can range from any time in your life when you were exposed to the market, be it as a child who knew nothing to an adult who was researching it hoping to invest or trade.\n\nI\u2019ll start with a few of mine from when I was a child.\n\n- In Chinese, \u201cstock\u201d is \u201cg\u01d4 pi\u00e0o\u201d (literally: \u201cstock-share ticket\u201d). However, the first character is pronounced exactly as the same as the term for \u201cdrum\u201d (\u201cg\u01d4,\u201d although the written character is different). When I first learned about the market in Chinese, I kept thinking it meant \u201cdrum ticket\u201d and used my own wild imaginations to picture what such a thing would look like.\n\n- The first time I heard \u201cDow Jones,\u201d I thought it was \u201cDown Jones\u201d and immediately jumped to the conclusion that the market must be called \u201cUp Jones\u201d on days when it went up. When \u201cUp Jones\u201d never appeared, I wondered why people would keep calling it \u201cDown Jones\u201d when the price clearly was going up.\n\n- The first time I watched business news covering the market (pre-Internet days), I had no idea what was causing these stock prices to go up or down. I just thought all these companies were scoring points in some kind of game, so I kept waiting for the toy companies to show up just to see their scores.\n\nYours?", "id": "ptib5p", "created_utc": 1632352545.0, "score": 82, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "You\u2019d be amazed at how many people think the price of a share alone tells you how valuable a company is.", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "If that\u2019s actually true, then a damn Americanized Mexican fast food chain is filthy freaking rich compared with all the big tech companies \ud83d\ude02", "score": 34, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3777405023574829}, {"body": "Once upon a time, that person was me.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.041158802807331085}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44994691014289856}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "Same here and missed out on so much", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22613151371479034}, {"body": "When did you realize that was untrue?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 34, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18717265129089355}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18717265129089355}, {"body": "Yup, my parents told me growing up that the stock market was rigged and if I invested without a financial advisor I would lose all my money.

It can cause problems. From Natenberg's book;\n\n>Early Exercise Risk  \n>  \n>How concerned should a trader be that an option that he has sold will be exercised early? \u201cWhat will happen if I am suddenly assigned?\u201d Early assignment can sometimes result in a loss. But there are many factors that can cause a trader to lose money; early exercise is only one such factor. A trader should be prepared to deal with the possibility of early exercise, just as he should be prepared to deal with the possibility of movement in the price of the underlying contract or the possibility of changes in implied volatility. Margin requirements established by the clearinghouses often require a trader to keep sufficient funds in his account to cover the possibility of early assignment. But this is not always true. If the trader is short deeply in-the-money options, an early assignment notice may cause a cash squeeze. If this happens, he will need sufficient capital to cover the situation. Otherwise, he may be forced to liquidate some or all of the remaining position. And forced liquidations are invariably losing propositions. In spite of the risk of early assignment, it should rarely come as a surprise. A trader need only ask himself, \u201cIf I owned this option, would I logically exercise it now?\u201d If the answer is yes then the trader ought to be prepared for assignment. If the answer is no and the trader is still assigned, it is probably good for the trader. It means that someone has mistakenly abandoned the option\u2019s interest or volatility value. When that happens, the trader who is assigned will find that he is the recipient of an unexpected gift.\n\nAlso this classic link which is the ultimate in ignoring assignment risk (-1000% trade);\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i\\_dont\\_know\\_when\\_to\\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/)", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Assignment risk on puts only exists if your OTM puts become near ATM.\n\nNo one will assign an ITM leap put, that's just handing OP money.

{"title": "I think I worked out what has had Burry and others worked up about Evergrande. Is this GFC 2.0, featuring our new friend the Orphan SPV?", "selftext": "Ok, so I have done a little research on this topic, and what the fallout from Evergrande could look like. I was bouncing around on twitter and I saw Michael Burry was getting all worked up about Evergrande. Now, I have no background in finance other than a personal interest in learning, but from my limited understanding I could not see anything at first in the information he linked and from other sources to that would point to a widespread collapse like he was claiming. I mean, Evergrande is big, but they hold $300+ billion in assets. Even if they are forced to restructure the losses could not be that bad globally right?  They only have about $18 Billion in foreign bonds outstanding on the international market, how could that lead to a global crash? Sure, the slowdown in China overall as a result will cause pain to some countries, like Australia, but not a global crash right?\r  \n\r  \nSo I did a little more digging, and one of the things the data Burry linked to very specifically in his tweet said to look at the dates, in relation to the bonds starting to devalue in May this year. Well, thanks to the power of google, I learn that in May China started to crack down on 'shadow lending' or 'off the books lending' right when their public bonds started to turn to dog poo.  \n  \nAnd here we go, the rabbit hole. What the hell is shadow lending?   \n\r  \nWell, it all starts with this little policy China introduced in August last year to slow down the growth of their insane property markets. It is called the three line policy. I won't bore you with the details, google exists, go use it if you want. The TL;DR is if developers in China cross these lines in how much debt they have compared to assets, the amount of new debt they can take on is restricted. You cross all three, you turn red and can no longer grow the amount of debt you have. At least not on the books anyway... Evergrande crossed that line last year, it has not been allowed to 'legally' grow the amount of debt it has since then. \r  \n\r  \nBring in the shadow banking system! The orphan special purpose vehicle. From my understanding, this system works much like this. Evergrande spins up what is called an orphan special purpose vehicle, this SPV, if it is based offshore, does not need to follow the laws in place in regards to the three red lines. Evergrande can then use the funds in that SPV like they would a loan, but without having to declare it on their books at all, they don't technically own the debt, some other fake business in say, the Caymans does in return for interest that Evergrande just happens to pay (or not).\r  \n\r  \nSo, what does this mean?! Well... this is what I think Burry and others have been attempting to warn us about. What we know about the extent of Foreign debt in China is only the tip of the iceberg. Evergrande and other developers in China may hold much higher international liabilities than anyone is aware of, these SPV's are off the books, unrelated to Evergrande in any way other than being a source of liquidity for them to use. Who paid in to these SPV's? What is the total value of debt outstanding? If they get restructured will they repay these SPV's? No one knows... Well, some people do, but they are not talking. Ever since they have been restricted from issuing new bonds, or taking out loans, they have had to have been getting cash from somewhere and their asset sales are simply not enough to cover their costs to continue to grow, especially at the discounted prices recently.  \r  \n\r  \nI know this is a wall of text but I think this might be very important and could be why some of the largest international investment funds have been in talks with Evergrande and the CCP. This problem could be much larger than anyone knows. Many international entities may have much more exposure to Evergrande and other aspects of the Chinese real estate market than anyone understands and when they get restructured those SPV investors will certainly be left holding the bag. Is this literally GFC 2.0, did those hedge funds and investment firms get greedy again and try to take a larger slice of the massive $50 Trillion dollar Chinese real estate market with SPVs? Is that what has Burry and others all worked up? Am I being incredibly 'Smooth brain' and missing something key here?

But it is simpler than that.\n\nEvergrande owes a lot of things. They need to build 1.6 million homes or apartments or whatever for customers. Those are liabilities. They owe money to their vendors and their employees. And they probably owe money to private parties in the shadow banking sector too.\n\nNow the counterparties are expecting to get their money back. As a result they are spending thier own money on things. As a result the global economy countinues to move along at a reasonable pace. But if those counterparties start to think that there is an issue, they'll reduce thier spending and rush to get their money back. (Which Evergrande doesn't really have. Not even if they ask all of their employees for all the money each of them has.)\n\nSo this is where you get into the 'lets just give you some of our properties' plan. Well the problem here is that when you start giving these things away, what is it really worth? And even if a property is worth $X, is it really worth that much to vendor or a bank? And if it isn't, then they would have to sell the property to another company like Evergrande. And do you really think those companies are going to be rushing to buy property they know they could get at a discount later? (Assuming these competitors are really that solvent themselves.)\n\nAnd what about the municipalities in China? Where are they going to get funding without more real estate companies pumping money into their cities?\n\nThis was always the endgame. People knew these things were a problem for years. It's just a lot of people just ignored it and put their head in the sand and yolo'd on China stonks.\n\nHere are some experts below talking about China.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NWLb25U5lnA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wR4wSC9hovs\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HKDerjOwHyM\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the potential risks that a default from China does to stable digital money coins. If that paper defaults in there, you'll see those things cut in half so fast, it'll cause problems through the wealth effect. All of these kids who thought it was cool to put all of their money into that crap, will have to actually get a job. If they can find one at that point.\n\nThis could easily spread to the rest of the world. Not just because the debt can be held outside of China. But because once China stops spending as much (remember all of the complaints about Chinese citizens buying assets abroad like real estate in Australia, Canada, US, etc?), then prices and demand for a lot of these things will wane.\n\nImagine if China caught a cold and the average wealthy person there lost so much money that they had to start unloading the house in Toronto or Melbourne ate fire sale prices to pay down debt or whatever. Imagine how much less commodities China would buy if they weren't building as much real estate in the nation. Imagine the shock to global financial markets when China crashes after so many other nations expanded their balance sheets so heavily to get past COVID. \n\nThere is a lot of risk from China. And Evergrande is just the tip of the iceberg. Remember Luckin? That was an absolute dumpster fire of a company. Imagine what skeletons are hiding in Baba and Tencent. Remember Archegos? They were just a family office and they were able to use an insane amount of leverage to put a massive hole in the side of Credit Suisse.

Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there\u2019s an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD\u2019s are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for \u2018meme stocks\u2019 which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don\u2019t know, haven\u2019t investigated that particular theory but there\u2019s plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you\u2019re so inclined. \n\nThe quick point I\u2019m trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question \u2013 and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule \u2013 seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems \u2013 for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**\n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* From an investment into equities point of view \u2013 S&P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month \u2014 other than a slight dip in February \u2014 over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) \n\n* Let\u2019s take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it\u2019s a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   \n\n* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) \n\n* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). \n\n* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)\n\n* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. \n\n* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) \n\n* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) \n\n* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  \n\n* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois\u2019 clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). \n\n* By 2030, there\u2019s expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market. [link](https://gyazo.com/66173e4431b4c6b30ac7ed0662f13f1c) \n\n**Part 2 \u2013 Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**\n\n**Before we look into what\u2019s happened since my last post, let\u2019s go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. \n\nIt is this modular platform that led to Apple\u2019s interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car\u2019s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).\n\nApple wasn\u2019t the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia\u2019s parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as \u2018pretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal\u2026 Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company\u2019 [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). \n\nUltimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo\u2019s chairman didn\u2019t feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn\u2019t factor in the value of Canoo\u2019s IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo\u2019s own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) \n\nRegarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo\u2019s suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo\u2019s approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). \n\nThe use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants\n\n* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nThese enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo\u2019s new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 \u2013 layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) \n\nThe three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:\n\nLifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint.

Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category \u2013 you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  \n\n* Targeted HP \u2013 500+\n\n* Payload Capacity \u2013 1800 lbs\n\n* Range \u2013 200+ mi\n\n* Powertrain \u2013 AWD or RWD\n\nThere\u2019s actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn\u2019t been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). \n\nWe can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It\u2019s important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity \u2013 highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). \n\nCanoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer \u2013 with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 \u2013 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).\n\nTo sum it up \u2013 Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).\n\n**Part 4 \u2013 Recent Updates**\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at some of the hires that the company\u2019s been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).\n\nPartnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US & EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar \u2018is the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.\u201d The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)\n\nDe-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:\n\n* >$250M invested in Beta\n\n* ~1.5M hours of engineering\n\n* ~500k miles of testing\n\n* 13 beta runners / 32 beta properties tested\n\n* US NCAP 5-star overall rating targeted, with simulated, sled and vehicle level crash testing.\n\nUndertaking the Gamma Phase with SOP on track for Q4 2022 [link]( https://gyazo.com/772813dd1ab4b30255dfdfa9674006ce), with key highlights including:\n\n* >12 months of testing\n\n* ~120-150 vehicles will be built and validated\n\n* ~70 crash tests\n\n* 30 sled tests\n\n* Full slate of vehicle tests; no shortcuts\n\n* 80% of all components are sourced\n\n* 63% of all engineering is released\n\n* 54% of tooling is committed\n\nPartnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military. With more than 100 franchisees with experience in delivering for companies like Amazon, XPO, Axlehire and Ontrac, the company, aims to expand that to 300 franchisees by the end of this year [link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network). \n\nSurpassing 9,500 non-binding pre-orders across lifestyle vehicle, pickup track and multi-purpose delivery vehicle [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/second-quarter-2021-results) \n\nShowcasing its vehicles at various events including the ACT Expo and Cars & Coffee (both of which were attended by some of the amazing folks at the canoo subreddit who attended, took detailed notes/pictures and shared it with everyone), and receiving invites to others such as the LA Auto show [link](https://gyazo.com/ff9b83052183c0128970b65c4e05aa55).\n\n**Part 5 \u2013 Financials and Valuation**\n\nBefore looking at Canoo/Competitors, here are some analyst PTs\n\n* R.F. Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) \n\n* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) \n\n* Bank of America - $5 (can\u2019t find the article at the moment but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve seen it somewhere)\n\nAverage = $13, current SP = $6.7\n\nAs of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). \n\nThe company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.\n\nAt a pre-revenue stage there\u2019s not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:\n\n* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders \u2013 which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).\n\n* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).\n\nAs far as valuations go, let\u2019s divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look \u2013 based on their market cap. I\u2019m sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I\u2019ll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.\n\n* Lucid Motors \u2013 $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021\n\n* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 \n\n* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, >17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 \n\n* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 \n\n* Canoo \u2013 $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV \n\n* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B\n\nJust looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven\u2019t done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there\u2019s a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo\u2019s cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/).  \n\n**Part 6 \u2013 Bear Case**\n\nWith anything pre-revenue, the biggest issue is always going to be do we have enough cash to get the product off the ground imo. I could write a really long paragraph but yea that\u2019s pretty much it in a sentence. Since I\u2019m on the bullish side for the company, I\u2019ll lay out a few reasons why I think Canoo won\u2019t be running out of $$$ before it comes to market \u2013 these have mostly been stated here and there throughout this document but I\u2019ll summarize them below:\n\n* As of Canoo\u2019s second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing the Lifestyle Vehicle to market. \n\n* Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility.\n\n* EV funding is a significant portion of the upcoming budget, this is less grounded than the others but there is assumedly some hopium that Canoo would be able to receive some federal support if needed.\n\n* The company could take on debt to assist in getting to production \u2013 H.C. Wainwright in their coverage indicated that they expect $500M to $525M in funding could be raised in debt to 2023. Tony has previously stated that they are looking for as non-dilutive an approach as possible, and given the current SP it wouldn\u2019t make much sense to go the additional equity route.\n\n* In May, the SEC opened a fact-finding inquiry into Canoo as it did with many former EV SPACs, unlike others such as NKLA and (Company A) \u2013 nothing further has come as of yet, nor have any DOJ investigations been launched.\n\n**Part 7 \u2013 SI and Squeeze Potential**\n\nI know y\u2019all have just been waiting for this so I\u2019ll get right down to it. Famously developed by the esteemed /u/pennyether, the SMELL system is going to help us take a look at some key numbers that\u2019ll help understand GOEV\u2019s squeezability.\n\n* Short Interest \u2013 31.8 million shares, 32% of free float \n\n* Market Cap \u2013 $1.63 Billion, not big enough that it\u2019s immovable, not small enough that shorts would be able to cover without investing a decent amount of capital\n\n* Extremely Memeable \u2013 I mean\u2026 GOEV, like Go\u2026 EV, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria\n\n* Low Liquidity \u2013 Average volume per yahoo finance is 2.7M shares, which is 2.7% of the free float so any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/)\n\n* Low Risk (IV) \u2013 Yep, current IV is 77.1% for 9/24 and 10/1 options. Please do NOT consider this financial advice, like at all, but if you\u2019re one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it\u2019s not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There\u2019s not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn\u2019t have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I\u2019d agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.\n\n**Part 8 \u2013 TL;DR**\n\nThe global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. \n\nPresident Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030, to support this EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at <$35,000, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. \n\nCanoo aims to disrupt the current automotive model by taking a piece of the 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit which is generated after the first owner and traditionally ignored by manufacturers. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same. Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.\n\nTo facilitate this disruption, Canoo has developed the world\u2019s flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo\u2019s Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else\u2019s lineup\u2026 take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo\u2019s vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.\n\n* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed\n\n* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants (compared to ~25% on ICE)\n\n* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.\n\nIf we take a look at the funding incentives being proposed for consumers e.g. with the LV, the maximum federal rebate would be $12,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it\u2019s $4,000 rebate \u2013 that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you\u2019re getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.\n\nIf you made it this far, I\u2019d like to thank you for reading this \u2013 I\u2019d like to give a big shoutout to the community over on the canoo subreddit (not sure if I can link other subs so won\u2019t). They\u2019re extremely dedicated individuals who provide a wealth of knowledge on the ongoings of the company \u2013 from driving to HQ and coincidentally finding an unrevealed product to attending EXPOs and other showcase events and sharing vehicle images and detailed write-ups.

Ford slapped an electric motor and some Li ion cells in an F150 and it made national news.  I had a buddy slap an electric motor into a friggin 80s Benz.  Any fool can do it int the garage.  \n\nEVs are gonna look different because they have to be different.   You generate the torque wherever you want.  Right in the wheel of you want.   You put the fuel source wherever you want.  Hell, In The frame if you want.  So now you\u2019ve got all this space that used to be taken up by a piston engine, a transmission tunnel, and a fuel tank.  Yeah,  it\u2019s gonna look.

One possibility is they lied about it. Another possibility, and the one that IMO is more likely is that the guy who came in and took over (Tony Aquila) from the original management/SVP team, the ones who initiated the subscription revenue model, determined that it required way too much capital up front and would take many years to show profits. He decided to change it to more traditional direct sales to consumers and businesses, but it took a while to rejigger everything. Their CFO resigned just weeks before Aquila took over, as well as their CEO, chief legal officer, and head of corporate strategy.

{"title": "$CZOO: Hitchin' a used car ride on the deSPAC highway to tendietown", "selftext": "Waddup gamblers,\n\nWhat a run so far on high redemption deSPACs! Along with the main runners from last week we have new soldiers joining the generals in the deSPAC wars. These tickers have been running even with the broader market tanking, wrecking the accounts of SPY bulls (including me REEEEE). While these plays are still ongoing, the IV has spiked enough in almost all these cases making the fabled multibaggers harder to come by.\n\nI was searching for something that hasn't taken off yet and saw that every single [deSPAC with a redemption rate more than 70% since August](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pkw978/spac_redemption_rate_in_august)  has atleast had a 'pop' in the underlying and IV as people started to get familiar with this new meta for deSPACs and have began hunting for tickers with similar mechanics as the ones that soared before. Well everything except for one which seems to have gone under the radar, CZOO.  \n\n# What is Cazoo?\n\nLet me give a very quick overview of CZOO and why it could be a good long term hold at these levels (unlike many deSPACs running currently). All you deSPAC degens can safely skip this section. \n\n[CEO Alex Chesterman OBE, looks like a guy who knows what he is doing](https://preview.redd.it/x3a9v0m6k0p71.jpg?width=1390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a359fe74a709ca50268b0b288be7f947f296a94e)\n\nCazoo is a European online used car-seller. Similar to Carvana in the US.  Unlike Carvana and competitors, they also provide a subscription service for the same as well. Cazoo is mainly based in the UK and expanded to France and Germany. They are expanding aggressively across Europe and would also use the proceeds from the SPAC deal for the same. \n\nWhen the deal was struck many investors did not like it as they were expecting something sexy like an EV company as those was all the rage back then (we know now how those turned out). Especially since the SPAC was founded by billionaire investor Dan Och and had a stellar leadership. There were also many concerns regarding the valuation as the deal valued Cazoo at $7B. People failed to realize how transformative the pandemic has been to Cazoo's business.  Now that they have a $1B dollar warchest from the SPAC deal (trust + PIPE), they can aggressively go about crushing the competition taking a leaf out of Amazon's playbook. This cash they got from the deal is a moat that insulates them from competition as they rapidly expand and acquire new customers.\n\nLooking back, this seems to be one of the few SPAC deals that have aged well. Since the deal was made, CVNA soared as much as 53% and is now 30% higher. This is in stark contrast to many SPAC deals, where the comps have gone down significantly (looking at you HIPO)\n\n**What do analysts think?**\n\nCazoo is a recent deSPAC and it usually takes a while before analysts start coverage. However, Citigroup has already initiated coverage with a buy rating and a **PT of $11.8 which represents a 32%** upside from current levels.\n\n# The technical setup:\n\nCZOO completed the merger on Aug 27 and had 72.32% of the trust redeemed according to the [8-K filed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1824963/000121390021043739/ea146130-8k_ajax1.htm) by the SPAC. The trust had 80.5M shares leaving behind a tiny float of 22.3M shares. This is not as tiny as the IRNT, OPAD, TMC triad, but deSPACs with larger floats post redemption like DNA, NRDY, JOBY have had impressive runs already.\n\n[Relevant section fom the 8-K regarding redemptions](https://preview.redd.it/7aquv06jr0p71.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=628034901b18453f365822a14d05d814de65282c)\n\nThe PIPE holders have \\~80M shares which are under lockup currently. CZOO hasn't filed the S-1 yet so these shares won't hit the markets anytime soon. Once the S-1 is filed, it is followed by the 424B and then EFFECT following which the shares can sold.\n\nOther deSPAC plays like AGIL, VLTA, XOS are on borrowed time as they have already filed S-1s. On average it takes about 21 days post S-1 till PIPE shares become registered. So these can go on till then. \n\nI couldn't find active discussions on CZOO in trading/investment subreddits so this seems undiscovered.\n\n**Short interest:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x12xbr1sj0p71.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5c1af2d03cd873d904d8a87cb06318799a8c08\n\nThe last exchange reported SI was 2.72M which is 12% of the float. This is based on the Aug 31st settlement date which falls after the merger and hence includes any change in SI post merger. Many people are unaware of this, but shorts are usually closed out at NAV incase of high redemption deSPACs so unless you have post merger exchange reported SI, the various SI tracking services get it wrong. Currently Ortex does not estimate the SI but reports the shares on loan at 5.16M. All  shares loaned out need not be shorted so the max SI according to Ortex would be 23% of the float.\n\nIn addition to this, the CTB has creeped up to 19% and the utilization is at 88.5% which means there is not a lot of ammo left to short this down. The days to cover is estimated to be 10.32 based on current volume.\n\n  \n**Price Action:**\n\nThe PA so far reminds me of how a deSPAC moves before it pops big. The fade on low volume after merger followed by the float up on low volume. \n\n[CZOO](https://preview.redd.it/hi95ckxag1p71.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=42d4279518ecad82d9e07a481df5b58e596a17b1)\n\nThis type of indecisive movement on low volume can found across multiple high redemption deSPACs. Let us consider the example of SPIR, one of the new favorites. It had been trading in the low volume zombie zone since the merger completion and once volume came in, BAM!! \n\n[SPIR. Sorry I had to make a yOu aRe hErE reference.](https://preview.redd.it/lj8ulgnbg1p71.png?width=1231&format=png&auto=webp&s=939b86264be3d3c6174257cd9f0c99153dc5f405)\n\n**Options:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/frhu3gnug1p71.png?width=1523&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4a0141f92ab4693daf4384a04700c2617a6565c\n\nI noticed a curious spike in bullish call volume last week and early this week, which alerted me to the play. Here is the kicker, **CZOO options have one of the lowest IVs for a recent deSPAC with high redemptions**. MMs have ramped up IVs for most of the them to account for the low float deSPAC dynamics.\n\nHere is a general comment on these plays since I know many of you got burned buying OTM FDs at nosebleed IV levels last week. Stop buying 500% IV OTM FDs tards! It may actually hurt the chances of a Gamma squeeze. Once MMs collect those juicy premiums from those way OTM calls, they would be able to offset some of the losses from the calls they wrote earlier and hence maybe to hedge less aggressively.\n\nThe ATM IV for Oct expiry for CZOO sits at \\~97%.\n\nHere is a comparison with other high redemption deSPACs (can't mention many because of low market cap):  \n\n* TMC \\~244%\n* IRNT \\~220%\n* XOS \\~163%\n* OPAD \\~159%\n* SPIR \\~142%\n* VLTA \\~125%\n* CLBT \\~118%\n\n# TLDR:\n\nUndiscovered high redemption low float deSPAC + company that is not trash + low IV -> \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80  \n\n\n# Positions:\n\nOct: 12.5C, 14C\n\nNov: 20C (because 20 strike was not available in Oct and Oct 17.5C was more expensive than the Nov 20C lol)", "id": "pt8lja", "created_utc": 1632320613.0, "score": 173, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|728|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pt8t1u/czoo_hitchin_a_used_car_ride_on_the_despac/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pt8lja/czoo_hitchin_a_used_car_ride_on_the_despac/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=pt8lja)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=pt8lja)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43236440420150757}, {"body": "Didn't read.
