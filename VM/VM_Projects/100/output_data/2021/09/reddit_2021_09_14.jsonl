GDP growing would be a concern, if every other nation wasn't *also* printing money at an alarming rate, but if everything gets inflated together, then nothing really gets inflated, for all intents and purpose, to keep it in lamens terms. \n\nWhen this becomes scary, is when covid gets worse again, and the economy doesn't have more stimulus to lean on, leading to massive deflation as many large corporations default on loans, and become bankrupt. Instead of worker shortage, we have job shortages. \n\nOr alternatively, covid doesn't get worse but neither does the CPI data, indicating *long term* inflation.  FED hikes interest rates and cuts off stimulus. The market feels it like a grenade to the gut. \n\nAs long as our crisis can be attributed to temporary factors, the market won't move, not to say there won't be rotations to different risk levels.\n\n I for one am placing my bet on the side of the world's largest economy.

The Tesla bill for a 10k reman pack was probably driven to that service center that worked on it and guess what? It's comparable to what Rich's shop charged.

Furthermore, there are reports on the Tesla owners club forum of people getting very similar replacement/remanufacture charges at around 20- 24k cost. Mystery solved!

{"title": "Most of you clearly don't understand how a mark crash would happen.", "selftext": "I saw a bunch of these top posts about the market crashing and the market not crashing and I lost more and more brain cells as I read through each one. I will try to explain this very complex issue in a very simple way for you all.\n\nSo here is the circumstances under which the U.S Market could potentially fail, and yes it includes inflationary risk. I am going to preface this issue with the fact that this topic is not black and white it is very complex and includes a lot of factors that would affect a market dump.\n\nFirst off lets look back at the most recent stock market crash, the 2008 housing crisis. I won't delve too deep but the reason this was allowed to happen was because the Government credit rating agencies ignored a very blatant issue and pretended it didn't exist until the tipping point in which people defaulted on their home loans causing the whole market to dump. \n\nNow to the present issue at hand and the main reason the US market could fail. Inflation. For those that don't understand inflation it can be boiled down to, if everyone has a lot more money than they originally had then everyone is going to buy more things and buy them at higher prices. Higher demand means higher prices. One thing many people may not know is how much money the Fed actually printed in the last year and the disgusting scale at which they did it. Since the start of the covid-19 virus, most estimates are showing that the federal reserve printed ***approximately \\~30% of all the US. Dollars that have ever been printed*** were printed in the last 12 months alone. \n\nSo, we now know that more money in circulation + people buying stuff = higher prices for everyday goods and services. But how can we measure this? Luckily for you there is already a metric that keeps track of this regularly and its called CPI (Consumer Price Index). This keeps track of the prices that consumers are paying for goods and services, The most updated numbers release at 08:30AM EST today. So we can just watch to see if the CPI is rising and then we know that inflation is happening right? Not so much, I really wish it was that easy but here is where covid enters the picture.\n\nIf the supply chain of goods and services was unaffected but prices still increased for consumers then this would be due to an increase in demand only. However, thanks to covid this is where the black and white becomes very gray. Covid-19 has affected the supply chains for almost everything sold in the US market, between china lockdowns and shipping issues there is a very obvious supply of goods issue. With this supply chain issue we can expect that prices will rise just due to a lack of supply coupled with the increasing demand, BUT on top of this there is also a **worker shortage** (this one still baffles me but its happening regardless).\n\nThe last factor is the FED. In order to avoid a massive increase in prices across the board due to the hefty increase in USD printed, the FED can implement **Tapering policies.** These are meant to preemptively hamstring the US market before Prices of goods and services get to out of control. If the FED sees inflation being a risk and ignores it like they ignored issues in 2008 then we are screwed and I wish you all the best of luck.\n\nHere's where I wrap things up and the start of the **TLDR;**\n\n  **TLDR;** We have an increase in Demand, a decrease in supply and a decrease in workers, all fueling an increase in prices. The Fed has printed approx \\~30% of all U.S dollars that have ever been printed all in one year. **If the CPI keeps rising after the supply chain issue is fixed, and the Fed doesn't start tapering then we enter an inflationary market for goods where a gallon of milk is $16, causing the market to implode on itself because nobody can afford anything anymore.**", "id": "po0x6u", "created_utc": 1631619001.0, "score": 952, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 327, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7hfgu/citron_research_to_short_clov_save_chamath_dd/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24649138748645782}, {"body": "I find the tldr quite long, can anyone summarize this for me?", "score": 214, "replies": [{"body": "You need to invest in milk futures.", "score": 658, "replies": [{"body": "1.

Not just general intelligence but incompetence in individual fields. \n\nIf you haven't beaten the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you got a bit unlucky. If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. \n\nYou're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. \n\nSo, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:\n\nBurry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   \nAssets under management (AUM): $635 million\n\nDalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   \nAUM: $140 billion\n\nBuffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  \nAUM: $632 billion\n\nWood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   \nAUM: $53 billion\n\n=============================================\n\nIf you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. \n\n Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:\n\n[I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week.](https://preview.redd.it/50kiiie6zbn71.png?width=3010&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c4c7817c548515eae1823cc2f0e986565522ea9)\n\nTake a look at this chart of TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhh5i2tfzbn71.png?width=2492&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c354ae8100a048cf81176d619ddaaa5f51b4dda\n\nAnd compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hngourvbycn71.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9175668887dbb1f5639fd54ce395c38865b0a879\n\nNow with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. \n\n\"Burry is a value-shill permabear\"\n\nBurry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5. [https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html). He has consistently beaten the market in bad years and good years too. \n\n\"Burry is smart but he is wrong about TSLA\"\n\nIf you won't follow Burry, then how about following Wood?[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/cathie-woods-ark-funds-bought-246-million-coinbase-shares-2021-04-15/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cathie-woods-ark-funds-bought-246-million-coinbase-shares-2021-04-15/)\n\n\"Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target\"\n\nWood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of \"do as I say, not as I do.\" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. \n\nAnd lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out. \n\nTSLA JAN 2022 670 PUT\n\nThis is not financial advice, do your own DD.", "id": "po3uzy", "created_utc": 1631629637.0, "score": 543, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 447, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|32 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Buying as much tesla as i can.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28762590885162354}, {"body": "Dalio is losing billions in Chinese stocks", "score": 441, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Everybody knows bags made in China aren't worth shit.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "are you telling me that those LV bags aren't real!?!?!", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "The ones that say Louie Vatton?", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1099703460931778}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5302361249923706}, {"body": "Unless I\u2019m holding them.

Is that a bubble or perhaps it is just a reflection of growing wealth disparity and/or overall growing wealth.\n\nThe stock market, well perhaps a look at the 40 year chart for the 10 Year treasury yields and inflation rates and the combination of near zero interest rates and low inflation (ignoring the temporary oddities that might be supply chain related and will resolve in a year or so) has justified increased cash flows flowing into equities and lower PE ratios than any historic measure would suggest is necessary.\n\nWell then maybe low interest rates are a bubble, well that is necessitated by excessive government debt that does not allow interest rates to be higher without causing runaway debt increase. Do interest rates ever need to go up? Well, 40 years of rates declining towards zero does not provide much guidance here.\n\nWell how about the debt, maybe that is the bubble... Well look at the historical debt, in real or nominal terms, and it is a long-time past any historical levels. In fact, it almost seems the idea of too much debt for the government is a psychological idea rather than perhaps a fundamental economic issue. I mean you can always have interest rates go to 0.0001% and the debt effectively only grows or declines based on gov't spending and revenues.\n\nWell then, just maybe no one will buy the debt, well again, the Fed shows up and buys the debt... But that should mean inflation, but not if the Fed then raises bank reserve requirements or people decide to hold more cash, since inflation is low and returns on assets are low so just have larger cash reserves.\n\nBut what if the market is really a bubble despite any of this being clearly based on fundamental economic principles and seemingly it is a lot of human psychology at play as to what numbers we as a society accept to live with? Ah, but then a bubble is a wide-scale event and individual companies might be great investments regardless. For example, way back in 2000 there was a dotcom bubble and there was a company called Amazon and another one called Apple. Yeah, go check the charts for those companies and you would have been fine buying at the peak back then. Today, there are few investors that can brag they got in at such low prices.\n\nOh, as to TSLA, well years ago, which I presume was before the bubble (or was it a bubble already back then?), was also called way overvalued by many. I  am glad I had the foresight to invest in Elon's vision. My initial investment was around 50 or 60 per share, which was way too expensive back then per the bears.

The robot is something that no serious investor thinks will be relevant for a decade or more (the market cap such a robot would add to TSLA might be tens of trillions... this is way beyond my conception at this time... on the other hand, too far out and risky to invest much based on this). FSD, there are varying opinions but anyone that seriously follows Tesla would know that DOJO will take at least a year to be running properly and then from there add some time for FSD to improve and then be validated. You are perhaps talking 3+ years out. Regardless it does not matter if FSD is ready in 2 years or 5 years or later, what matters is what approach to the problem do you believe is the best, because regardless of when it is solved being the one with the best approach will result in a multi-trillion dollar valuation for FSD alone (oh, wait, TSLA market cap is 740B... it clearly only reflects a bet on FSD and does not assume it is a certainty).\n\nHow about consider things like their innovations in manufacturing, especially the massive step-changes that they are in middle of right now. Their large castings are one example and are still a year or two out before it is implemented in every vehicle they make. Their work on 4680 cells, which seems to be moving closer to commercialization, is another massive step-change that will further cut their costs of building cars and allow them to make better cars for cheaper (years before anyone can volume produce solid-state batteries). \n\nMaybe, don't be aghast, but try to follow what the Cybertruck is beyond just an unusual looking pickup truck (with great specs at better prices than anyone else suggests... although a year or so out from production). The design of the truck is revolutionary as it is not just body on frame. For an EV that is huge. Also such a truck to be economically produced would probably be impossible without new manufacturing processes (single casts, sheet metal being bent, being an EV giving flexibility to the design that ICE does not allow and so on). The problem too many TSLA bears have, is they focus on how much they dislike the design and ignore that the design fundamentally represents a next-gen approach to making pickup trucks. Legacy pickup truck designs you might find out are fundamentally inferior. I suspect that does not end up well for everyone  else.\n\nBut yeah, limit the bull case to TSLA to points that the bulls themselves don't really invest based on.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Yo.\n\nCome join us at the tslalounge", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "One of us!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21548622846603394}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08285652846097946}, {"body": "FSD doesn't require dojo, it will just speed it up.\n\nElon said that once the public beta started it would be about a year from then until it might be ready for regulatory approval.

{"title": "IRNT is the one of the greatest opportunities retail has ever seen", "selftext": "**EDIT:** My most recent post got removed, I didn't delete. Figuring out why right now.\n\n**EDIT:** Many of you are saying that the trade is over. Welp, earnings came in today and were not that great... the stock is currently up above $25....\n\nThis post is going to be about why IRNT presents one of the greatest squeeze opportunities that WSB and retail investors have ever seen. Because the company has only been trading for 2 weeks, it's hard to analyze technicals other than volume. Thankfully, the short interest and float are the main reasons why this stock presents such a great opportunity, so those will be analyzed below.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier. You should talk to a financial professional before making any investment decisions and should do your own research\\***\n\n**Short Interest Stats and Analysis**\n\nTo put it simply, the short interest on IRNT is absolutely insane. Combine that with the fact that it's a newly trading company (and susceptible to more volatility) and has a VERY low float, and you have a recipe for an absolute slam dunk.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at Fintel and iBorrow desk. iBorrowdesk has consistently shown the borrow fee to be over 500% and the available shares to be far below 10,000. Similarly, fintel has consistently showed less than 1,000 shares available to borrow. Though some people don't trust these sites, the similarities in the data help to add credibility\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qubmtqnjxjn71.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e966aee1e3deb1b3f19bb4edfebeb4090e3bb1a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yuuj6skkxjn71.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=97cbe756d2845006ddb0c35e624032935587c4a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0vhzl9lxjn71.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=082680490a232aa61f456c8a4492050d51e5baef\n\nI'd also like to turn your attention to [this post by another WSB user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pnff3b/irnt_gamma_squeeze_with_213_of_float_claimed_by/). This post analyzes how the extremely low float of this stock due to it being a new stock and the insane option OI presents the opportunity for a legitimate gamma squeeze - not some fake hype run up - a legitimate gamma squeeze similar to GME's first run up.\n\nIf you look at websites like Baron's they'll tell you that the SI as a % of the float is only 1.79% (about 700,000 shares). This is correct but doesn't tell the whole story. Because of redemptions and lockups, the actual float is 1.3m shares, which makes the real short interest on tradable shares about 56%. Interestingly, [Ihor's tweet](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1437512870351282177?s=19) shows that the borrow fee is asininely high, which again shows the difficulty of borrowing of this stock and thus the easy possibility of a short squeeze. 56% short interest is an amazing number in and of itself, but that's not the whole story. The thing about this stock that really gets me going is the options activity. The OI on options of this stock is absolutely bananas right now. Remember when I said that there are about 1.3M tradable shares due to it being a new stock post-merger? Well, at a $20 price, almost double that amount is held in ITM calls alone. THAT is why the stock has serious gamma squeeze potential. Remember, both the GME and VW squeezes happened because ITM options OI outnumbered the float of companies that were already heavily shorted - this is the power of a gamma squeeze. Most meme stocks that have been \"squeezing\" recently have been small short squeezes due to retail traders and HFs taking advantage of social sentiment. The reason that we haven't seen a violent squeeze recently is because there hasn't been a stock with options activity like this - until IRNT.\n\nAdditionally, you probably saw that the stock went up to almost $40 last week out of nowhere. Again, this is the power of a low float stock with high ITM call OI. If this stock starts picking up, the low float and call OI could propel it to meme stock legend status.\n\nFurthermore, data from ortex has also consistently shown a SI of over 300% and a cost to borrow over 500%, which is consistent with the sources listed above. Yes, the SI is definitely a plus, but again, the real power here is the gamma squeeze potential.\n\n(The above four paragraph's were heavily borrowed from the originally linked user, so please check out his post).\n\nMany people will probably not believe some of these shorting numbers and will consider them unreliable because of how new the stock is. That's understandable. However, if you're in that camp, let me present to you this: the NYSE's regulationSHO FTD list. Per SEC regulations, stocks that reach over a certain amount of FTDs are placed on regulation SHO's threshold list. This is a very small list and identifies stocks that are grossly over-shorted (FTDs being the evidence of that). GME was on this list for a very long time before it squeezed. So if you don't believe the websites's SI numbers, then you at least have to believe the NYSE's numbers about FTDs. When a stock has too many FTDs, it means that it is extremely hard to locate shares and repay borrowers, which is a sign of over-shorting. Here is the NYSE list:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5q0vbtmxjn71.png?width=2710&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76c960abd9f88936b898b3dbebbf5d82519a9cb\n\nNotice the second to last one? DING DING DING. Though being on the threshold list signifies overshorting, there is yet another thing that we can take from this - forced covering. IRNT has been on that list since 9/2. Per regulationSHO, after 6 TRADING days on the list (9/10), stricter location requirements for shorting are put in place. Take a look at the giant green uptick that we saw on 9/10. 13 TRADING days on the list and forced coverings start taking place where a market-maker is subject to fines and loses his or her market making abilities if this regulation is violated. 13 TRADING days after 9/2 is 9/21. Remember all of those call options I talked about above, well they will be exercised on Friday 9/17. So, let's review what we have: an extremely high reported short interest (you can believe it's 600%, 300%, 56%, whatever), an extremely low an restricted float, ITM options expiring on Friday that outnumber the total float, the stock being on the threshold list indicating over-shorting, forced coverings taking place right around when those options would have to be delivered. Again, this is exactly what we saw with GME. It's important to note however, that this is also an issue of timing - the stock is likely to have a gamma squeeze sometime late this week and through next week. After that, there's a good chance that covering could lead to the stock being taken off of the threshold list.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThink that IRNT is just a squeezable meme stock with no long term potential as an investment? Wrong. The stock is not like most meme stocks - it actually is a good underlying business. According to an article by a website not allowed on here (just copy and past the quote in google to find it), \"With the company\u2019s international expansion, M&A initiatives, and cloud acceleration, under my most optimistic case scenario, the company is worth $55 per share. If IronNet continues to sign agreements with nation states and companies like CrowdStrike did, I believe that the upside potential is significant.\" The article discusses how the company's AI initiatives, cyber security focus, and cloud acceleration, all of which are some of the most important and up and coming technology sectors, poise it to go up in value significantly. Additionally, the company also just reported earnings. Though the earnings were lower than expected, take a look at the after hours activity - the shorts have no juice left.\n\n**Conclusion/TL;DR**\n\nSo there you have it. in my opinion, IRNT is an EXTREMELY good stock fundamentally so I will be holding it long term. HOWEVER, the stock also presents a rare gamma squeeze - short squeeze opportunity that retail hasn't seen since GME. The stock has an extremely high reported short interest, an extremely small float, open interest on ITM call options that outnumbers the current float, is on the regulationSHO threshold list indicating that it has extremely high short interest and possible naked shorting, has been on that list for a significant amount of time, and the ITM options that outnumber the float are expiring right around when shorts would be forced to cover their FTDs. In other words, an absolute grand slam.\n\n**\\*Please note that none of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Investing is risky and high short interest plays are even riskier.
