But, if it's a market that anyone can get in, and there are already a huge bunch of players in it then competition will be strong. Unlike Netflix that created a market on its own, Tesla is just trying to enter an existing market with something new and different. VW group, Toyota group and others that are already in the group, will just switch to electric (or Hydrogen Fuel cells which probably is more environmentally friendly ) and capitalize on user loyalty For example I personally am not buying any car that is not Toyota. I own a Toyota Corrola from 2006. Quite often I forget to change the engine oil, neglect taking it for service and maintenance, take it off road, to mountains, to gravel, to rocks, hit it a few times here and there, scratches everywhere, and I it has 300 000 km on it.\n\nThe service cost is around 100 euros, which I'm supposed to do every 10k km but I usually go at 15k because I forget. Other brands cars would have been dead by now (my friends all switched cars because their previous ones died) or the service cost will be triple, or both (friend of mine, owns a golf, bought it 3 years ago, does the same amount of km as me per year, but obviously a lot less in total, and so far has paid around 10k euros in repairs).\n\nSo yeah, Tesla might be the \"first\" but it will not be alone, it's not even alone now. Netflix started something new, it was alone and capitalized on that.

Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.\n\nThis week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: \u201cOur estimate for Tesla\u2019s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,\u201d In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That\u2019s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.\n\nIn an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark\u2019s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: \u201cIf we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.\u201d A $3,000 share price would put Tesla\u2019s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. \n\nElectrek\u2019s Take\n\nSince Ark\u2019s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk\u2019s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla\u2019s stock price.

To me, it is like you are comparing Apples and stones (or was I supposed to say Oranges here?)\n\nEvery Tesla Auto is an EV, but not every EV is a Tesla. Do cars have 4 wheels? Yes. Do cars have a way to run? Yes, they do. But that does not make any EV Manufacturer a competitor to Tesla. Tesla is a Computer on Wheels that is going to further blow any competition out of the water with FSD (doesn\u2019t matter when it releases to the Public). \n\nTesla has been, is, and will always be ahead of 99% of the Competition. IMHO. \n\nIn my mind, Tesla is spelled like this \u201c**S**-**Y**-**N**-**E**-**R**-**G**-**Y**\u201d.\n\nThe Competition: \n\n(1) Is late in the race by at least a decade;\n\n(2) Is still focused on ICE Cars, for most part, since it is their bread and butter - they cannot just abandon suddenly, what they have been good at doing for close to 100 years (and is still earning them $$$$$$$) and run a race on a totally different track that would add to their Revenues several years/decades (?) down the line to match what they have been making for so long. Most of their resources are still focused on keeping these Revenue streams flowing - and while they continue to do this, Tesla will, as usual, continue to focus all it\u2019s energies to moving forward in the EV-space.\n\n(3) Will be spending their time, effort and money trying to bring down Tesla or to slowing Tesla down - again a distraction from their goal to accomplish FSD.\n\n(4) will be aiming at where Tesla is right now, and by the time years roll by and the competition reaches Tesla\u2019s capabilities, in terms of Range, driving technology etc., Tesla would already have moved further up in these and other new capabilities.\n\n(5) Will continue to sell through their Dealers-with lesser maintenance being required on EVs (compared to ICE), the middleman will try to make more money on each Sale, adding no value  as such, but, at the same time, adding and passing the additional cost to the Buyer. The last time we bought an ICE Car (tho it was also fun at some level, and a good learning experience for my son who was buying it), I hated having to spend 5 hours at the Dealership haggling the price down from $35,000 to $24,000 (which is  68% of the price that was first quoted - I\u2019m really amazed that the ICE Dealerships have that kind of power and those kind of margins!) No wonder the Dealership Association have been up in arms against the Tesla sell-direct-to-Customer model. And this campaign by them has been supported full-heartedly by the ICE Companies and their Unions, since their individual and combined existence is in peril, and they would be willing do anything to stop Tesla\u2019s continued progress.\n\nIt is going to be a very steep uphill journey for the behemoths to overcome the inertia (or the lack thereof) to reach where Tesla is at, and also keep up with the innovation that Tesla has been, and will continue to drive, for it\u2019s \u201cFan Boys\u201d and \u201cFan Gals\u201d - we are (almost?) a cult now \ud83d\ude09. You will not be able to move the needle for me from my love for Tesla.\n\nMy prediction: While all the other Auto Companies continue to struggle to play-catch-up with Tesla, by 2035, I think the Tesla Stock has the potential to rise to $6,000 from where it is now (and, of course, we can expect it to have split further by then).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "dream on, that guy is the biggest con man on the face of the planet, deflect deflect, go to the arabs to get money blah blah. guy is a f'ing joke.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Go make your first lego car before you talk shit about people that bring literally anything on the table for the world", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17848975956439972}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27301260828971863}, {"body": "After what happened in January fuck TSLA, this man is bipolar", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Elon is a scumbag", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3115963637828827}, {"body": "Elon Musk - Troll number 1 \n\nLove this guy.", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4027918577194214}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "but they dont make quality cars...", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "They have nice trim but shit quality control.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "What about EV has anything to do with quality control for body panels not fitting together or inconsistent paint\u2014[criticisms that Musk admits to](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/03/business/elon-musk-tesla-quality-problems/index.html)?", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1380423903465271}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1380423903465271}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1223856508731842}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1223856508731842}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1332208812236786}, {"body": "The value is basically ignoring all the competition they face on the market.

{"title": "Wishful thinking: Is China Fucked?", "selftext": "\n\nHELLO!\n\nI wrote my economics thesis on their bad debt maturities for the coming 10 years, specifically in 'shadow banking' and was wondering what the esteemed commune of WSB thinks of these points.\n\nMy conclusions were that:\n\nIf there were significant defaults in their 'shadow banking' industry the CCP could cover as much as 13 T USD in initial damages to the industry which would raise their risk profile and increase future cost of debt. The worst part about this debt is that is largely it is all OBS, (similar to MBS from the GFC). These 'bombs' are WMP (Wealth Management Products) and are actually highly leveraged instruments that through a web of borrowings with state banks use CCP money to invest in risky business loans.\n\nA lot of which have failed, you can read about the slew of 'shadow banks' failing in recent years with more and more in the past year.\n\nThere is a lot of speculation the CCP is already sterilising a large amount of bad-debts through perpetual loans for these 'shadow banks' to prevent a collapse of the industry and eternal damnation for Xi's finance minister.\n\nThis kind of catastrophe would derail China's economic vision and would cause a long and painful recession around the world.\n\nTo respond to your point about a sterilisation, it's my opinion that they wouldn't be able to cover the onslaught as it would be almost impossible to keep track of defaulting debt. This is because it is completely out of sight and thus the ability for Chinese governing bodies and financial regulators to take financial assistance action is an extremely difficult task in itself.\n\n\nSmoothieman790 out\n\nEdit: I don't have enough karma to respond to comments in my own post, I likened post asset inflation result to Japanese asset bubble as well to whoever was reminiscing on the Tokyo circa 1989. -- This was in reference to the US/CHINA\n\nEdit 2: Someone mentioned the soft colonisation of Africa, and this in my opinion is an economic bondage. These countries are usually tempted with debts that they can't possibly service. However, this is not always true-- Rwanda is an example of a country that has utilised Chinese debt issuance to significantly improve the living standards of their people.\n-- Important to remember that there are never any absolutes.\n\nEdit 3: response to u/RockyMountainSchrute -- Retards are also prone to strokes of genius albeit rarely", "id": "pjf98i", "created_utc": 1630986486.0, "score": 126, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 135, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|13 hours ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Did I read Wish ? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude80", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11297836154699326}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2040795385837555}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 158, "replies": [{"body": "Whenever I need to feel a flash of false confidence in myself I make a quick trip to r/roastme we're a very counter productive species.", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01870284415781498}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.027167899534106255}, {"body": "You should go have a beer with Gordon Chang.", "score": 46, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07582972943782806}, {"body": "Be careful what you wish for...\n\nIn his book, [China: The Bubble That Never Pops](https://www.amazon.com/China-Bubble-that-Never-Pops/dp/0190877405), Thomas Orlik lays out the case for China being able to weather economic storms better than most people expect.\n\nI generally agree that China will continue to dodge bullets in the short term.\n\nHowever, PolyMatter did a great series of videos diving into some of the longer-term structural problems faced by China. If they don't solve these problems, they are likely doomed to decline in a similar fashion to Japan.

Japan remains an important economy, but they are not quite an economic superpower.\n\nPolyMatter Videos (these are great):\n\nChina benefitted greatly from a young workforce and a limited number of older folks.
