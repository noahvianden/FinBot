{"title": "If you could choose 1 stock to buy on the dip, be realistic, with expectations, what would be the ticker, at what price and why? Share ideas to help others gain insight", "selftext": "Good evening everyone and thank you so much for taking your time to read the post. This should be a great exercise for the community so that we can all help eachother get insight into why you would hope for a dip on a certain stock\u2026.. At what price, and what you are looking for.\n\nWe need to try and be realistic because some readers may also look at this idea, do DD and may thank you later. By saying you hope AMZN dips to 1,500, or MRNA to 200, GOOG to 1,000. I am not sure if you are helping anyone, because I believe most would jump in too!\n\nNow if these are indeed a ticker you await a dip, maybe you can set a realistic price and just an idea of where it may go. It is a simple exercise, would be better of course if you actually did own it before, really would buy it back and maybe where you may see it months from now.\n\nI have about 1,200 tickers on 29 watch lists, so I have many to choose from. Some have never heard of this ticker and so it may help many just to get an idea.\n\nZIM, I have been a trader of this since it IPO\u2019d. The company is a cargo shipper that has absolutely beat the last 3 earnings reports badly! They reported earnings over 7 dollars recently with a 2 dollar special dividend. The stock has run to an all time high near $60\u2026..\n\nI hope this dips back to 45, it was there a few weeks ago\u2026 and in a year if they keep executing this can be 75-90. They make cash and can pay dividends. Yes, rates are high now, yes ports are backed up, but they will still beat top and bottom line.\n\nWe would like to hear from you!

Share ideas", "selftext": "Good evening everyone and thank you so much for taking your time to read the post. This should be a great exercise for the community so that we can all help eachother get insight into why you would hope for a dip on a certain stock\u2026.. At what price, and what you are looking for.\n\nWe need to try and be realistic because some readers may also look at this idea, do DD and may thank you later. By saying you hope AMZN dips to 1,500, or MRNA to 200, GOOG to 1,000. I am not sure if you are helping anyone, because I believe most would jump in too!\n\nNow if these are indeed a ticker you await a dip, maybe you can set a realistic price and just an idea of where it may go. It is a simple exercise, would be better of course if you actually did own it before, really would buy it back and maybe where you may see it months from now.\n\nI have about 1,200 tickers on 29 watch lists, so I have many to choose from. Some have never heard of this ticker and so it may help many just to get an idea.\n\nZIM, I have been a trader of this since it IPO\u2019d. The company is a cargo shipper that has absolutely beat the last 3 earnings reports badly! They reported earnings over 7 dollars recently with a 2 dollar special dividend. The stock has run to an all time high near $60\u2026..\n\nI hope this dips back to 45, it was there a few weeks ago\u2026 and in a year if they keep executing this can be 75-90. They make cash and can pay dividends. Yes, rates are high now, yes ports are backed up, but they will still beat top and bottom line.\n\nWe would like to hear from you!

You can book a $2000 suite for a special occasion. You can fly first class internationally (sometimes). You have a very nice house, you can afford any healthcare you need, no emergency financial situation can destroy your life. But you are not \"rich\" in the way that money doesn't matter. You still have to be prudent and careful with most decisions unless you are on the upper end of this scale, where you truly are becoming insulated from personal financial stress. (Business stress exists at all levels). The banking world still doesn't classify you as 'ultra-high net worth'\n\nNet worth of $30mm-$100mm\n\nAt this point, you start playing with the big boys. You can fly private (though you normally charter a flight or own a jet fractionally through Net Jets or the like), You stay at 5 star hotels, you have multiple residences, you vacation in prime time (you rent a ski-in, ski-out villa in Aspen for Christmas week or go to Monaco for the grand Prix, or Canne for the Film Festival--for what its worth, rent on these places can run $5k-20k+ per NIGHT.), you run or have a controlling interest in a big company, you socialize with Congressmen, Senators and community leaders, and you are an extremely well respected member in any community outside the world's great cities. (In Beverly Hills, you are a minor player at $80 million. Unless you really throw your weight around and pay out the nose, you might not get a table at the city's hottest restaurant). You can buy any car you want. You have personal assistants and are starting to have 'people' that others have to talk to to get to you. You can travel ANYWHERE in any style. You can buy pretty much anything that normal people think of as 'rich people stuff'\n\n$100mm-$1billion\n\nI know its a wide range, but life doesn't change much when you go from being worth $200mm-$900mm. At this point, you have a private jet, multiple residences with staff, elite cars at each residence, ownership or significant control over a business/entity that most of the public has heard of, if its your thing, you can socialize with movie stars/politicians/rock stars/corporate elite/aristocracy. You might not get invite to every party, but you can go pretty much everywhere you want. You definitely have 'people' and staff. The world is full of 'yes men'. Your ability to buy things becomes an art. One of your vacation home may be a 5 bedroom villa on acreage in Cabo, but that's not impressive. You own a private island? Starting to be cool, but it depends on the island. You just had dinner with Senator X and Governor Y at your home? Cool. But your billionaire friend just had dinner with the President. You have a new Ferrari? Your friend thinks their handling sucks and has a classic, only-five-exist-in-the-world-type of car. Did I mention women? Because at this level, they are all over the place. Every event, most parties. The polo club. Ultra-hot, world class, smart women. Power and money are an aphrodisiac and you have it in spades. Anything thing you want from women at this point you will find a willing and beautiful partner. You might not emotionally connect, but damn, she's hot. One thing that gets rare at this level? friends and family that love you for who you are. They exist, but it is pretty damn hard to know which ones they are.\n\n$1billion\n\nI am going to exclude the $10b+ crowd, because they live a head-of-state life. But at $1b, life changes. You can buy anything. ANYTHING. In broad terms, this is what you can buy:\nAccess. You now can just ask your staff to contact anyone and you will get a call back. I have seen this first hand and it is mind-blowing the level of access and respect $1 billion+ gets you. In this case, I wanted to speak with a very well-known billionaire businessman (call him billionaire #1 for a project that interested billionaire #2. I mentioned that it would be good to talk to billionaire #1 and B2 told me that he didn't know him. But he called his assistant in. \"Get me the xxxgolf club directory. Call B1 at home and tell him I want to talk to him.\" Within 60 minutes, we had a call back. I was in B1's home talking to him the next day. B2's opinion commanded that kind of respect from a peer. Mind blowing. The same is true with access to almost any Senator/Governor of a billionaires party (because in most cases, he is a significant donor). You meet on an occasional basis with heads-of-state and have real conversations with them. Which leads to\n\nInfluence. Yes, you can buy influence. As a billionaire, you have many ways to shape public policy and the public debate, and you use them. This is not in any evil way. the ones I know are passionate about ideas and are trying to do what they feel is best (just like you would). But they just had an hour with the Governor privately, or with the Secretary of Health, or the buy ads or lobbyists. The amount of influence you have can be heady.\n\nTime. Yes, you can buy time. You literally never wait for anything. Travel? you fly private. Show up at the airport, sit down in the plane and the door closes and you take off in 2 minutes, and fly directly to where you are going. The plane waits for you. If you decide you want to leave at anytime, you drive (or take a helicopter to the airport and you leave. The pilots and stewardess are your employees. They do what you tell them to do. Dinner? Your driver drops you off at the front door and waits a few blocks away for however long you need. The best table is waiting for you. The celebrity chef has prepared a meal for you (because you give him so much catering business he wants you VERY happy) and he ensures service is impeccable. Golf? Your club is so exclusive there is always a tee time and no wait. Going to the Super bowl or Grammy's? You are whisked behind velvet ropes and escorted past any/all lines to the best seats in the house.\n\nExperiences. Dream of it and you can have it. Want to play tennis with Pete Sampras (not him in particular, but that type of star)? Call his people. For a donation of $100k+ to his charity, you could probably play a match with him. Like Blink182? There is a price where they would simply come play at your private party. Love art? Your people could arrange for the curator of the Louvre to show you around and even show you masterpieces that have not been exhibited in years. Love Nascar? How about racing the top driver on a closed track? Love science? Have a dinner with Bill Nye and Neil dGT. Love politics? have Hillary Clinton come speak at a dinner for you and your friends, just pay her speaking fee. Your mind is the only limit to what is available. Because donations/fees get you anyone.\nThe same is true with stuff. You like pianos? How about owning one Mozart used to compose music on? This is the type of stuff you can do.\n\nIMPACT. Your money can literally change the world and change lives. It is almost too much of a burden to think about. Clean water for a whole village forever? chump change. A dying child need a transplant? Hell...you could just build and fund a hospital and do it for a region.\n\nRESPECT. The respect you get at this level is just over-the-top. You are THE MAN in almost every circle. Governors look up to you. Fortune 500 CEOs look up to you. Presidents and Kings look at you as a peer.\n\nPERSPECTIVE. The wealthiest person I have spent time with makes about $400mm/year. i couldn't get my mind around that until I did this: OK--let's compare it with someone who makes $40,000/year. It is 10,000x more. Now let's look at prices the way he might. A new Lambo--$235,000 became $23.50. First class ticket internationally? $10,000 becomes $1. A full time executive level helper? $8,000/month becomes $0.80/month. A $10mm piece of art you love? $1000. Expensive, so you have to plan a bit. A suite at the best hotel in NYC $10,000/night is $1/night. A $50million home in the Hamptons? $5,000. There is literally nothing you can't buy except.\n\nLove. Sorry to sound so trite, but it is nearly impossible to have a normal emotional relationship at this level. It is hard to sacrifice for another person when you are never asked to sacrifice ANYTHING. Money can solve all problems for someone, so you offer it, because there is so much else to do. Your time is SOOOO valuable that you ration it. And that makes you lose connections with people.\n\nAnyway, that is a really long answer, but I have a very unique perspective because I have seen behind the curtain of the great and mighty OZ.

{"title": "\ud83d\udc53 SPAC PIPEs 101: Degens Playing Low Float DeSPACs? The BAG PIPE HOLDERS Are Coming For You! \ud83d\udc53", "selftext": "**For anyone trading these high redemption, low float DeSPAC plays, the gravy train can last for a few weeks until PIPE shares hit the market. What are PIPEs? Read up below:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rxbi3koal6o71.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f755c0f1fa5fd1fcc2888c0f26d09672e4c83b\n\n**WHAT ARE PIPES?**\n\n* PIPEs are Private Investments in Public Equity. PIPEs were a recent innovation in SPACs that allowed\n   * A) sponsors to raise more capital outside of the dilutive sponsor promote,\n   * B) provide a buffer to meet deal minimum cash conditions and\n   * C) most importantly enable the separation of shareholder vote from redemption feature by addressing the minimum cash condition.\n* Those last two points TRANSFORMED the SPAC market in that redemption-led vote failures became a thing of the past (a regular occurrence back in the day).\n* By utilizing PIPEs, sponsors were able to raise enough capital for the target and give SPAC IPO investors the ability to vote for a deal while also redeeming their shares for $10 + interest.\n* PIPE investors used to consist primarily of capital markets / direct investing / arbitrage desks of hedge funds. The goal of these funds were to make some reasonable return with the lowest possible risk.\n* These investors may have demanded a discount to the $10 trust price, warrant coverage, convertible security, etc. These guys were not looking to take a fundamental bet on the company but were purely facilitators of capital.\n   * BTW we are seeing a return of sweeteners for PIPE investors. Some examples: 890 5th Ave Partners / Buzzfeed (convertible notes), Seven Oaks / Boxed (convertible notes), Stable Road / Momentus (1 stock + 1 full warrant)\n* Valuation of course did matter and PIPE investors helped provide a feedback mechanism of what was overvalued (I'M PASSING ON THIS!) and what was reasonable (OK, I'LL TAKE A PIECE OF THIS DOWN).\n\n**HOW HAVE PIPES CHANGED?**\n\n* In earlier years the quality of sponsors and targets was spotty to say the least, however that started to change in 2020 as SPACs started becoming a more mainstream product attracting higher quality sponsors and targets. As a result of this, the structure and composition of PIPEs started to change.\n* Higher quality, longer-term \"sticky\" money like Fidelity and Blackrock along with strategic investors started to participate in PIPEs.\n* PIPE pricing also shifted from discounts/warrants/structured securities towards straight equity of $10 or even at a premium like Lucid or Enovix.\n\n**SO HOW DO THEY MAKE / LOSE MONEY?**\n\n* But hey these PIPE guys are making a lot of money RIGHT?! In good times and/or when they select the right deals, PIPE can be very lucrative. However, there is no free lunch for PIPE investors. While they do benefit from being \"brought over the wall\" to diligence potential SPAC targets before they are known to the public (a good source of those pesky leaks) and help set the valuation--as we've all seen, deals can and do fall below $10 at merger close.\n* Once a PIPE investor makes a commitment to participate in a deal, they are LOCKED and LOADED. That hot electric vehicle company they thought would MEME but on close cratered? At deal close they have to wire the funds they committed and now they're looking at big losses.\n   * \\*Sometimes PIPE holders try to back out causing litigation like TMC where $220M of $330M PIPE investors decided to give the company a middle finger and walk away\n* This may be fine for longer term or strategic PIPE investors, but for fast money hedge funds they will move quickly to cut losses. Hedge funds will look to short stock when allowed by the subscription agreement to \"box\" their long position and limit downside.\n* When can hedge funds short against long PIPE shares? Check the subscription agreement filed (8-K) at the time of deal announcement.\n   * It'll either explicitly state that PIPE investors can't short stock until deal close (most deals) or won't say anything which means PIPE investors CAN short stock anytime (e.g., Genius Sports, SoFi).\n   * There are also hybrid structures out there like Mudrick / Topps (Rest In Peace) where PIPE holders could short up to 50% of their holdings prior to deal close if the stock was above $15.\n* Back when SPACs were all working, these hedge funds may have let positions \"run\" and not hedged their positions. However given the recent market environment they're much more aggressive in locking in profits / mitigating losses.\n   * Another wrinkle to this dynamic is that many SPACs have experienced high redemptions, which means there is no borrow to hedge against, which means further potential selling pressure once the PIPE shares are freely tradable (see below)\n* When a deal closes and nears or breaks $10, perversely it forces the hedge funds to short causing more downward pressure. For the smart investor (such as you), you can take advantage of this technical selling to get into selective situations for cheaply.\n\n**DeSPAC DEGENS READ THIS CLOSELY:**\n\n* PIPE LOCKUP? For a vast majority of PIPEs, there are no lockups. Folks everywhere like talking about \"PIPE unlocks\", but what they are really referring to is when a PIPE is registered, effective and freely tradable. However, every deal is bespoke and some do include a rare lockup like Lucid.\n* Typically, PIPE investors are only limited in selling their physical shares because they have to be registered via S-1 process.\n   * The S-1 process usually goes like this:\n      * 1: Post deal close initial S-1 is filed\n      * 2: A few weeks later an amended S-1/A is filed\n      * 3: Finally a 1-1.5 weeks later you'll see a 424B and EFFECT filed showing that the registration is effective and holders can sell\n   * There may be a few amendments or sometimes the S-1 goes straight to being effective without any SEC comments. The whole S-1 process usually takes 45-60 days post closing.\n\n**WHAT EFFECT DOES PIPE HEDGING HAVE?**\n\n* One silver lining to the hedge funds shorting shares to box their long PIPE position - there won't be as much selling pressure from them once the S-1 goes effective because they're already \"flat\" and will close out their short position by collapsing w/ registered PIPE shares.\n   * But remember, low-float SPACs have little or very unstable borrow which deters shorting to box PIPE shares\n* Shorting prior to the S-1 going effective is not without risk. Borrow can get really tight leading to increasingly expensive cost and risk of recall. Just ask the guys that were short NKLA with unstable stock and covered at +$90 - yeesh. This is why many PIPE investors will seek stable \"term borrow\" and pay annualized rates of 10-30%.\n\n**IN CONCLUSION:**\n\n* PIPE investors are not all committed long-term investors, but they play a critical role in the capital raising function and valuation setting for SPACs. While it may not seem like they are on your side, they are more aligned with you than the sponsors!\n* PIPE investor's role as a price discovery mechanism is part of the reason why we've seen a trickle of deals now, but those that are getting done are at more reasonable valuations.\n\n**REREAD THIS - PIPE SHARES WILL COMING:**\n\n* And to drive this point home, if you are playing high redemption, low-float deSPAC plays, don't overstay your welcome. Once you see the S-1 filed, the days of low float will soon be over after the PIPE shares go through the registration process and the BAG PIPE HOLDERS can finally sell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: RESOURCES**\n\nBE SURE TO FOLLOW SEC FILINGS FOR COMPANIES.

The latter led to a loosening of Communist control over commerce in costal trade cities and the meteoric rise of Chinese merchantilism of the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Some might suggest Tienamen and the rise of an open democratic call is a possible threat, but they (CCP) know what works there. And that is force and violence.

He can nationalize anything he wants to and shutter any business or sector he so chooses, but he must weigh the cost of loss of support of the people. It WAS the peasants that the CCP feared most.  Now though, I would argue that it's the middle class from which the CCP derives their power. \n\nSo, if letting this company (whatever company) die harms the middle class of China, I don't think Xi will let it die.

I do agree that the sentiment has changed a bit since prior to January 2021, but do you even know what WSB is about?\n\nIt\u2019s about finding good trades that can like 5x to 10x your profits which also comes with high risk aka High Risk, High Reward trades \u2026 like 1-0DTE SPY calls or puts.\n\nI\u2019m not pushing $IRNT here, but I\u2019m holding my bag until next week to see what happens. I think with its setup, high OI% for October, high SI%, and high CTB% that there\u2019s something unique to come of it, \u201cpotentially\u201d.\n\nFuck for a lot of you on here, prior to two weeks ago had no idea what a super 8-k was or a company completing a stock redemption from a DeSpac.\n\nI\u2019m in full exceptante of the L\u2019s I take as it was my choice to partake. I can imagine posters of DD getting flack from people not getting \u201cGaINs\u201d or losing a fuck ton of money blame posters or ask them questions like, hey man I just dropped a bag on this stock how fucked am I? No one is going to answer you. That was your choice to play that play.\n\nPeople complaining of stocks in this sub-reddit this week and saying ah man I miss the old days; when 95% of you weren\u2019t even here back then.\n\nYou want to know why the DeSpacs high redemption are being discussed? Because of their Super 8-k (Redemption) and Option Chain activity.\n\nThese types of stocks can lead to gamma squeezes and high return for those who got in early before IV and on the run up when the stock was illiquid and IV is low, if that stock pops off, again, High Risk to High Reward plays, then that make sense.\n\nFor example, until lock up expires for the PIPE investors, I\u2019ll use $IRNT as an example, it still has absurd Option Chain activity for October, high short interest, high CTB, closed at $30 which indicates to me dumb money is still holding strong, and a very small float that moves easily and has been proven to do so.\n\nSo, for me I\u2019m rolling the dice and playing this into next week to see. But here\u2019s the thing, I ChOsE tO tAkE tHaT rIsK \u2026 because I knew why I was going into that trade and if I get burnt that\u2019s on me and me only, there\u2019s no one else to blame but myself and some of you are forgetting that.\n\nDeSpacs are hot right now because some of them have potential to make good money if your lucky and smart.\n\nPlays like $IRNT are unique and if anything remind me more of old WSB rather then the current buy $WISH or buy $CLNE type shit.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of interesting plays out there as of lately, but don\u2019t ever bitch and complain to a Mod or Redditor because your down and didn\u2019t know why you got into  a trade.\n\nThis isn\u2019t fucking Safe\u2014Moon you quacks. If that\u2019s your mentality then go join a subreddit similar to that.\n\nThis is a place where we take bets on trades that have at least some form of logical reasoning as a catalyst to occur.\n\nWhether it be an Option Chain activity, highly shorted with a catalyst, Oversold, Calls or Puts because of JPowws money printer goes Brrrr, etc.\n\nIf you can\u2019t eat a loss based on your own decision gracefully, and go straight to blaming others, then get the fuck out this sub.\n\nSincere regards,\n\nEdit: I want to be clear, I don\u2019t post shit to receive awards or upvotes or any glorification about anything that I post. I post when I feel people don\u2019t understand something or when I see an opportunity etc. I also read other redditors post for the same reasons.\n\nThis shit could get downvoted to oblivion and like I said, idgaf about Karma points etc. This is staying up unless a Mod takes it down. \n\nTL;DR - Don\u2019t blame others for your decisions.

I had no fucking idea what this company did either. But it got me researching, and the information I have found not only impresses me but also makes me hopeful for the future.\n\nRegardless, I was already in and you are too, and if you\u2019re not, here is why you should.\n\nAt the end of the day, we\u2019re here to make money so lets go\n\n2 parts. First, what does this company actually do? Second, why this is the least important question right now.\n\nNone of this is financial advice, do your own DD.\n\nI just learned how to read so if there\u2019s mistakes let me know.\n\n# \n\n# Part 1. metals or something\n\nCheck out the company website. Lots of the information I will present can be found there, including their investor site, and 8K filings.\n\nThey have a film on the home page that describes this with moving graphics and cool shit. Pretty dope.\n\n(Auto mod doesn't like the link, but it's metals dot co)\n\n**The problem:** Humans want shiny stuff and tech. Like cars and big buildings, and iphones to hear intelligent people discuss politics on twitter, or if our big brother AMC is worth 1 trillion or 100 trillion dollars. The issue is how much we\u2019re fucking up our planet to get everyone what they want.\n\n**Solution:** Decarbonizing global energy and transport\n\nWhat do Teslas, and phones, and tech in general need? You guessed it: Pornhub access.\n\nWhat\u2019s the second thing they need? Metals.\n\nCarbon-free systems will take billions of tons of metals to build. And as the population grows, urbanizes, and develops, this also requires\u2026 a fuck ton of metals.\n\nThe cleanest resource for critical metals are [Polymetallic nodules](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0027-0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ushpohm7lao71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fc67ab4fc3a2042435d6451a4f8bc4bdf6b8691\n\nThese ugly fuckers remind me of what my grandma had growing on her elbow before she preceded to cut it off in front of us and bleed profusely. (Her elbow wasn\u2019t the only thing scarred)\n\nBut these little guys, they bleed money.

Which alone is a $12 Billion industry growing at 8.2% rate. By 2027 it\u2019s estimated the battery metal market will be worth $20.5 Billion.\n\nTMC\u2019s main focus is supplying the electric vehicle market with the necessary metals. They do this through **deep sea mining**. They have some pretty neat tech like this thing:\n\n[subsea collector](https://preview.redd.it/47y79v6alao71.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f34d44c47d8aeb948519866613d34ce41c2ee51)\n\nIt goes along the ocean surface floor (with minimal disturbance) picking up the rocks, sends them up a tube to a ship vessel, where it gets filtered and then zoomed to shore. At the shore, inside a plant, they burn the nodules and extract the metals through some refining voodoo magic. The company also uses AI to do this the most efficient way possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The Metals Company now holds rights to exploration contracts granted by the International Seabed Authority via three subsidiaries: Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI), sponsored by Nauru; Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (TOML), sponsored by the Kingdom of [Tonga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw); and Marawa, sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati.\n\nThe NORI area **alone** contains enough metal to potentially supply battery metals for **140 million electric vehicles**. Our studies estimate that the number of polymetallic nodules within our three exploration areas is enough to electrify a **quarter of the world\u2019s** passenger vehicle fleet (**approx. 280 million EVs**).\n\nTo put it into perspective; [Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMimIZJiMp0) is the largest producer of electric vehicles, producing a total of 1.43 million cars as of March 2021.\n\nAnd $TMC is estimated to be sitting on 280 million cars worth of battery metals.\n\nHOLY MOLY\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of rocks.\n\nTheir plant is designed to produce **zero waste** and is run on **clean energy**. In the future they\u2019re looking to recycle the metals from car batteries  and put the metals back into circulation.\n\n[base station](https://preview.redd.it/09tncwkumao71.png?width=2646&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9712be824ec6bd7835de1500b464c009a94a1ce)\n\n>Our aim is to recycle battery metals in a closed-loop system of rental and redeployment partnerships with like-minded EV and battery manufacturers. This circular supply chain will grow over time and, as the need for new metals decreases, recycled metals will become our primary focus.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Our plan is simple and attainable: supply the necessary metals with the least possible impact, building enough metal stock to stop extracting from the planet and enabling society to live off recycled metals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/853cc7udlao71.jpg?width=581&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3237cd820efde72e0b8747b4a290c8072b773ff1\n\nBut Junkyard-Razor74, don\u2019t we have metals on land that we\u2019re mining?

The Company plans to aggressively pursue its available remedies with respect to such investors.\n\n**In summary:** They got cash in the bank. Also, the total number of TMC Common Shares outstanding immediately following the Closing was approximately **224,385,324** comprising\n\n* **203,874,981** TMC Common Shares issued to **DeepGreen shareholders**\n* **11,030,000** TMC Common Shares issued in connection with the Closing to the **PIPE Investors** pursuant to the PIPE Financing\n* **6,759,000** TMC Common Shares held by the **initial shareholders** (which includes the Sponsor, Rick Gaenzle, Isaac Barchas and Justin Kelly) and\u2026\n* **2,721,343** TMC Common Shares held by **public shareholders**, reflecting **redemptions of 27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker:\n\n**The Sponsor Group Holders and the DeepGreen Holders** (**203,874,981** TMC Common Shares) also **agreed not to effect any sale** or distribution of certain equity securities of the Company held by them **during the period ending on the earlier of (a) 180 days after the Closing**, subject to certain customary exceptions, and (b) subsequent to the Closing, (x) if the last reported sale price of the TMC Common Shares **equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading days** commencing after the closing.\n\nCan\u2019t sell them until blah blah blah.\n\n**27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares **redeemed**.\n\n**11,030,000** TMC Common Shares offered and sold to the PIPE Investors are currently **locked up**\n\nWTF is a PIPE investor.
