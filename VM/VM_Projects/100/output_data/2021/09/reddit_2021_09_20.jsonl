I\u2019m trying to understand the fundamentals well before training for real.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "First off, there's no point talking bid/ask. The seller gets whatever premium the buyer pays. There is no spread on an actual transaction. The spread indicates transactions NOT happening, because there's a difference between what a buyer is offering and what a seller will accept. A transaction happens whenever (and only whenever) that gap closes to 0 and the bid equals the ask. (Either a seller drops their ask to match the bid, or the buyer raises their bid to match the ask.)\n\nIf someone has bought a $1 strike call for $5.2, and the stock is trading at anything above $1, and their only other choice is to let the option expire, they *will* exercise the option. Say the share price drops to $3. The buyer already paid the premium. Their $5.2 has permanently gone to the seller. The best they can do is spend another $1 to exercise the option get the stock and then resell the share for $3 (assuming they don't want to keep it). The option buyer had already spent $5.2. They might as well get $2 back (3-1=2). A net loss of 62% (3.2 / 5.2) is certainly better than just losing all 5.2 and getting nothing back.\n\nEven though the seller had to sell their $3 stock for only $1 (the strike), they still made good money on the deal overall, because in *addition* to the $1, they also got the $5.2 *from the premium*. So in reality, the call seller  got to sell a $3 stock for $6.2.\n\nBut suppose that instead of dropping, the share price has gone up to $8. The strike+premium remains 6.2, and the call will still be exercised. Only now, the *buyer* benefits netting $1.8 in value from an original $5.2 outlay. The seller has netted 5 cents from the transaction (6.2 - 6.15, the share price at the time they sold the call). The seller has missed out on a good gain.\n\nSo as you can see, there is zero reason to sell (to open) a deep ITM covered call just before expiration, because you can't capture any time value in the premium. In our case, the time value was only 5 cents. Sure, the seller was protected from loss, but that's it. They gave up any opportunity to make more money from the stock. They might as well have simply sold it.\n\nSuppose they instead sold a $5 strike call for $2. That gives a strike + premium of $7. That means there is a time value of $0.85. If the share price goes to $3. The seller keeps the $2 premium, the call is not exercised, and so they only really lost 1.15 ((3+2) - 6.15) in total asset value. If the share price goes to $5.5, the seller will get the $5 strike and keeps the $2 premium. The seller actually made 0.85 on the deal, but the buyer lost $1.5 overall ($0.5 - $2). Suppose the stock actually went up. The seller STILL made 0.85 on the deal, but missed out on additional gains. But suppose the stock only went to 6.5. The seller made 0.85 instead of only the 0.35 they would have made had they never sold the call. The buyer's breakeven point for making money is when the share price reaches the strike + premium ($7).\n\nIn summary, for ITM calls, the most a seller can make is the ((strike + premium) - original share price). This is not a lot of money, and the closer to expiration they sell the option to open, the more likely this *gain* will be minimal to nothing (because they aren't selling any time value). The worst that can happen is the stock becomes worth $0, so all they have left is the premium.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Note: I can actually think of two reasons to sell a deep ITM covered call instead of just selling the stock outright. \n\n1. You want to continue to collect the dividend. You own the stock, so you get the dividend. However, the higher the dividend (and the lower the strike), the less likely the strike + premium will be higher than the share price. Nobody would pay you $5 now for a $6 stock only to get it 6 months from now and forgo two dividend payments (depending on their size, of course). \n\n2. Taxes. Suppose you've held a stock for 10 months and you've made $10k. If you sold it, you could pay short term tax rates of 25-40% on that gain. But if you held it for two more months, you'll only pay the long-term capital gains rate of 15%. So if you're comfortable that the stock won't go to 0, you could sell a deep ITM covered call which essentially locks in the current price. The holding period will conclude whenever you're assigned and the call is exercised. It could be tomorrow, (or maybe just before the dividend payment). But hopefully, it's after your 1-year period, so you'll get the lower tax rate. But you don't risk anything either way. I just checked, and when a option is *exercised* (as opposed to you buying to close), the holding period for the premium income is considered to be the same as the underlying stock, not just the two months between collecting it and getting assigned. But don't take my word for that. It's just something that I read online, and the law could change. Do your own DD.\n\nA second tax reason would be to delay recording the income from the sale until next year's taxes. Suppose that it's Nov 2021, and you know that you will have a much lower income next year and be taxed at a lower rate. (Maybe you're retiring.) You could sell the covered call to open, and get assigned in January 2022.

Stops on options tend to prevent profit as much as loss. For example, same position as above, but you set a 20% stop loss and the day after you open the call the value has dropped to $.50, so your stop is triggered and you close for a loss. **The next next day**, your call has recovered to $1.25.

{"title": "What is your plan to profit from Evergrande collapse?", "selftext": "Quick summary: Evergrande is a real-estate developer from China that has $305 billion of liabilities and cannot pay of their debt. They are not the only company though, other real-estate companies are also facing liquidity problems and it looks like the property bubble in China is collapsing. Right now, the Chinese government is doing what they can to control the situation (allowing them to default on loans, setting a price floor on property). [https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/](https://www.reuters.com/business/fitch-says-possible-china-evergrande-default-may-have-broader-effects-2021-09-15/)  \n\n\nGiven this scenario, how would you try to make a play here? There are 3 possible outcomes here: (1) Chinese government bails them out; (2) Chinese government step in and guide them to deflat slowly; (3) Full collapse.  \n\n\n(1) I think this is unlikely as there are too many real-estate companies in financial difficulties right now to bail all of them out successfully. Also a bit uncharacteristic of the government to do so.  \n\n\n(2) I believe this is the most likely scenario, but that would transfer the burden onto banks (both Chinese and international) as they will not be getting repayments for their loans to Evergrande. Would shorting bank stocks be a good idea here?  \n\n\n(3) Unlikely for now but could happen if scenario (2) goes badly. If so, the entire Chinese market will be bearish, so $YANG might be a good choice here.  \n\n\nAny other ideas they you can think of?", "id": "prm2st", "created_utc": 1632105927.0, "score": 1559, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 703, "comments": [{"body": "Well with my small portfolio I will just drift along with waves.", "score": 745, "replies": [{"body": "Ah yes, they \"jellyfish\" strategy of investing.", "score": 487, "replies": [{"body": "I image myself as fearless predator \"Portuguese man o' war\" consuming every dip with masterful precision.

Due to the nature of their business, it makes sense them blowing up could really domino, but..\n\nEvergrande is just a real estate developer. Investors will get screwed, sure, but how can this really cause financial dominos like in 2008? The bears seem really excited about this and keep posting articles and charts about how BLK and other US and international firms are the biggest bagolders. But when I look further into this I see that these firms are hardly exposed. It's pennies in their portfolios and probably less than they'd lose on a bad 1 minute candle in the equity markets.\n\nThey quote the $300b worth of bonds that will be worthless, but that's not that much to the global economy, realistically. More wealth is destroyed on a bad day for $AAPL. Additionally these were junk bonds for a long time. Were not talking triple a mortgage bonds that were \"too big to fail\" and unsinkable like the titanic.\n\nThis all also assumes that the chinese government will sit on their hands and watch a crisis unfold, when that seems super unlikely. Say what you will about the CCP, but they're not gonna let all their stellar economic growth crumble when they have:\n1. More power and political will than the US did to tackle such a crisis\n2. The ability to plan their economy to recover from any domino effects unlike more \"free market\" economies \n3. Knowledge of previous global housing crashes/financial crises to draw from\n\nMaybe I'm an idiot but I just don't see how anybody should think this will cause a serious bear market in the US or elsewhere.

This is because the Chinese government imposed strict limits on who can invest in certain types of assets (mostly equities) but lifted almost all restrictions on real estate/housing market. Ergo, many of the middle class started investing in \u201cinvestment properties\u201d and as demand grew, so did the prices. The problem was, Evergrande used the increases in the price of land and began taking out equity on that increase in order to fund more and more real estate deals. They currently account for ~2% of China\u2019s GDP and is the second largest real estate developer (and 30% of chinese gdp comes from real estate)\u2026 yeah a pretty big deal.\n\nNow, how does this shitstorm in China affect the US Markets?

The buyers of these bonds and CP were large large banking + investment institutions: Vanguard, Blackrock, HSBC, Goldman, etc. These institutions then took these bonds, rolled them into mortgage backed securities and sold them to anyone who would buy them. Much like 2008\u2026 everyone believed that if something happened to Evergrande, that the Chinese government would step in. After all, how would it be conceivable that the CCP would let their second largest real-estate developer fail? \n\nThis is where things started gong wrong. Everything was fine until the insiders started getting word of Evergrande\u2019s overinflated balance sheet. But once investors started selling out, Evergrande\u2019s bonds started taking a nosedive. The intl banking institutions didn\u2019t want to be left holding the bag, so my guess is they started deleveraging these toxic assets to any firm willing to buy. How do I know this? Evergrande\u2019s investment grade bonds are now downgraded to junk bonds, and they are trading at 20cents on the dollar. This became such a big issue in fact that these very firms and their executives were in China this weekend to discuss \u201crisk management\u201d \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-wall-street-meeting-focused-092729599.html\n\nNow, the ripple effects would most likely be as follows: banks + institutions will seek to continue to sell toxic investment and decrease their exposure to the real estate sector. The firms that were dumb enough to buy these toxic assets from firms unloading are now left holding the bag. The once \u201cinvestment grade\u201d bonds are now junk, and no one will accept them as collateral. So they get margin called. Firms will all rush to find cash, but the smaller firms will inevitably have to liquidate their long positions in order to remain solvent. This will likely happen in growth stocks and tech stocks with high PE ratios that have continued their bullrun since the middle of last year. As these equities start losing their value, other firms with exposure to these US equities will be forces to manage their risk to the downside and sell their positions, thus further driving the price down. This cycle will probably continue until firms have de-leveraged, defaulted, or until the fed decides to buy the toxic assets from these institutions (much like 2008). \n\nSo in short, the effects of Evergrande defaulting will likely have huge implications to the US + international markets, and if my understanding of the OTC+derivatives market is correct, we have a category 5 shitstorm heading our way that will have 2008 look like a walk in the park. \n\nNot financial advice.", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely possible but for this to happen china would need to not step in at all(who knows what they're going to do) and the derivatives markets connected to evergrande bonds would have to be quite huge that larger firms have to liquidate other assets to meet margin. \n\nWe'll just have to wait and see.

They conducted several share buybacks and issued new share shortly after. In 2020 and 2021 they on avg. payed an premium of 3.5% for share buybacks only to issue new shares at a discount shortly after. They burned a lot of companie's money buy doing this.Additionally, start of the year they repayed some debt earlier than they had to (due date was 2022), decreasing the cash position significantly.\n\n**Sales decline:** Evergrande had a positive sales development until their bankruptcy rumours started.

Vanguard, black rock, all international etf\u2019s and mutual funds that are considered \u201csafe\u201d.

{"title": "Dow futures skid nearly 2% Monday as fear of market contagion from China\u2019s Evergrande intensifies", "selftext": "U.S. stock futures fell sharply on Monday, with those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 500 points, as Hong Kong-listed property companies came under fresh pressure. Investors also were positioning ahead of this week\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\n\n**How are stock futures trading?**\n\n* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures [**YM00,** **-2.01%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/YM00?mod=MW_story_quote) dropped 671 points, or 1.9%, to 33,791.\n* S&P 500 futures [**ES00,** **-1.82%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ES00?mod=MW_story_quote) fell 78 points, or 1.8%, to 4,343.\n* Nasdaq-100 futures [**NQ00,** **-1.76%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/NQ00?mod=MW_story_quote) tumbled 1.7%, or 260 points, to 15,066.\n\n**What\u2019s driving the market?**\n\nIs this the correction that some strategists have anticipated?\n\nA downturn in China\u2019s property market, which suffered heavy losses Monday, with shares of China Evergrande [**3333,** **-10.24%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/3333?countryCode=HK&mod=MW_story_quote) falling 13% in Hong Kong, were threatening to drag stocks sharply lower.\n\nMarkets were closed in mainland China for a holiday, but the Hang Seng [**HSI,** **-3.30%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/HSI?countryCode=HK&mod=MW_story_quote) dropped over 3%.\n\nThe 8.25% Evergrande bond that has interest payments due this week was trading at around 29 cents to the dollar on Monday, according to Reuters. That is as Wall Street investors are poised to pick up where they left off last week \u2014 on a weaker footing.  \n\n\u201cThe dip is due to a variety of causes, including fading earnings estimates, uncertainty related to shifting monetary policy, and instability in the world\u2019s second-largest economy as a result of escalating crackdowns,\u201d said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note to clients.\n\nMarkets will be closely watching for any talk of tapering at the Fed\u2019s two-day policy meeting that begins Sept. 21. The central bank\u2019s ultra-easy policy stance, put in place more than a year ago to help the economy cope with the pandemic, looks untenable to some given spikes in inflation.\n\nThe economy has been giving off mixed signals, though, amid rising cases of coronavirus due to the delta variant. Friday\u2019s losses for Wall Street came as a reading on consumer sentiment held close to a roughly 10-year low.\n\nAnalysts also were discussing the inability, so far, of Congress to increase the debt ceiling.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-drop-300-points-as-china-property-fears-grow-11632121264?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-drop-300-points-as-china-property-fears-grow-11632121264?mod=home-page)", "id": "pru6m5", "created_utc": 1632142143.0, "score": 1187, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 427, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 617, "replies": [{"body": "Looks like somebody has a case of the Mondays.", "score": 153, "replies": [{"body": "You'd get your ass kicked for saying something like that.", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Hey Peter man, check out channel 9....it's a breast exam!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10299486666917801}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15385572612285614}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11567728221416473}, {"body": "I wish my portfolio was large enough to lose $16k", "score": 92, "replies": [{"body": "More money, more problems, and more pain on red days!", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17225877940654755}, {"body": "idk, man. wishing to lose 16k of 16k sounds pretty grim", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "If I had a million dollars", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.077790766954422}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41088247299194336}, {"body": "Except today.

Being unable to pay any of these loan obligations, Evergrande has resorted to offering it's properties as payment, triggering a fire sale.

If Evergrande defaults, it could create an unemployment crisis and panic sale of real investment properties, perpetuating the cycle above, popping the bubble. Millions would be underwater on their mortgage loans (which mind you, is really fucking expensive given the outrageous pricing of the homes) From here, we can reasonably identify the following as potential contagions.\n\n* Holders of Evergrande Bonds maturing soon: HSBS, UBS, Blackrock all have sizeable positions.\n* Commodities / Precious Metals: China is known to hold metal reserves and can/will dump them.\n* Chinese consumer discretionary sector: Consumer discretionary spending in China should fall should a recession hit the Country\n* Chinese financials sector: They are too interwoven into the real estate sector.\n* Chinese real estate sector: Self explanatory.\n* China trade partners (deficit): China has a trade deficit of $140B to Taiwan, $61B to Australia, and $60B to South Korea as of 2020.

However, it may prevent damage to millions of Chinese  homeowners that would stir discontent and weaken the CCP.\n2. The  problem is simply too huge. In the name of development and GDP, Xi gave  Evergrande a free pass and $300B worth of Yuan would need to be printed  to cover them. Not only would this devalue the Yuan but it makes up **2.1%** of China\u2019s GDP. This is simply a case where the concept of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d may not actually be valid.\n3. Even  if a bailout did occur, that\u2019s not a good look. Consumer confidence  would decrease rapidly and other firms would continue to push new market  bubbles under the assumption that a bailout will always be available.  Volatility in prices would increase rapidly as there would be confusion  between how the PRC prices property versus individual developers. This  would reflect uncertainty in the general stock market as well as a  bailout indicating weakness in stocks and the overall economy\u2019s  stability.\n4.

Any excessive overreaction, especially in the semiconductor industry, should recover fairly quick as demand still outpace supply.\n* Bonds, even high yield bonds (e.g. HYG, JNK) may present itself at a discount later and bounce no problem. Search ETF holdings for chinashit and most are devoid of them (some may have MGM Macau in there which isn't much). General risk of contagion in the financial sector within the US should be isolated to accredited investors and high risk fund managers. Your wife and your wife's boyfriend's retirement accounts are safe.\n   * (UNLESS) fund managers are making bullshit assets like MBS within MBS bundled up and hiding them in plain sight and stuffing them in high AUM etfs. If this happens again, good luck folks.\n* We will likely see some recovery this week as JPOW turns on his printer while China burns. China may rally as well on Tuesday. I believe we are in the denial stage.\n* \"Never bet against America.\" - Tupac\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjxfm0gmlro71.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=7960a60695f4f10d96ee2ec29022abb572afc8ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlzj3932mro71.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd81ca4b36fb94b89cd6f4f3802feefcfafc63f\n\nFurther Reading: [https://twitter.com/inartecarlodoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=21](https://twitter.com/inartecarlodoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=21)\n\n# TLDR; I think China is \u6ca1\u529e\u6cd5 / \u5b8c\u86cb for realsies this time, so I'm short China using ASHR, EWH, MCHI, WYNN.

China's RE market is far, far different than the US pre-08/GFC. A lot of Evergrande's RE sales required 30-70% down payments, so a huge cascade of defaults would be the extreme case, & not much of a contagion alone.\n\nThe part EVERYONE seems to be missing is WHY the 'ghost cities' in China were built to begin with. They were built in preparation for the long term trend in China of people in rural areas migrating to cities as the Chinese economy modernizes. There is roughly an equivalent of the whole US population (hundreds of millions) of people in China STILL living in the countryside. These ghost cities were built in preparation for this migration, and a ton of Chinese folks were banking on this happening so they could collect rent from them.\n\nHere's the crazy thing - my view is that folks who wanted to/could move to cities for higher paying jobs have already done so. What's left are a bunch of old people, which is a separate issue; Google China's demographic troubles.. it is VERY concerning given China's economy is mostly manufacturing-based and thus, requires population growth for GDP growth more than other nations.\n\nSo back to the point - the deep underlying issue is exactly that. If China cannot get more rural folks to move to urban areas/ghost cities, the house of cards is going to collapse and any Chinese citizen with investments in this 'sure thing' are going to be the last bagholder.

{"title": "$YANG GANG UPDATE- Banks Blowup, RE Troubles, & The China Contagion - An Evergrande Update - Part 2", "selftext": "Sup fuckers, it\u2019s been about 3 days since I posted **Part 1 of** [**$BEKE, $YANG, $NOAH - Big Profits off the Collapse of Big Brother - An Evergrande DD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp1obi/beke_yang_noah_big_profits_off_the_collapse_of/)**.** Since then, the Evergrande situation has gone even more mainstream, with Finance Twitter increasing coverage and bracing for the potential cascading impacts of the greatest real estate cucks in history. However, media outlets are ironically pretending Evergrande doesn\u2019t exist. Evergrande has also hired the same advisors who \u201chelped\u201d Lehman Brothers and Enron \ud83e\udd21. The movie script practically writes itself. \n\n# Basically, I was right and on time, and the bailout most likely is not occurring. China fuk this morning. $YANG up 15%. \n\nA lot of people were triggered last time that I gave specific tickers and positions so this time, I am going purely for an information dump. It\u2019s unlikely most of you retards will even understand the full scope of this fiasco but that\u2019s okay, neither do I. The only main play I think that would really benefit from this is $YANG calls or $YINN puts and puts on banks ($XLF) tied to Evegrande\u2019s liabilities. \n\nAnyways, this \u201cDD\u201d is meant to build on the previous information, provide some updates, and link all the juicy cancerous news I have been seeing, all condensed into one short post. Most of the data is sourced from reputable news sources that I can\u2019t link in here due to rules, and lots of info derived from a [@kylascan](https://twitter.com/kylascan) Substack post. \n\n# [MARKET UPDATES]: \n\n[Yeah..... we only go down from here bois. That's my TA.](https://preview.redd.it/13ndr1dfjno71.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=f63297e6d8881adbaebed17e4e1a72969df04bd8)\n\n[RIP Real Estate markets](https://preview.redd.it/tzr0gpoijno71.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed9e826856cee7b6f98c065f4f910db93c82386b)\n\n[Ah yes, top GAINERS.......](https://preview.redd.it/plwo5nujjno71.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=68c7fe5148fae824f004f4897136dde0ea3b8303)\n\n# The Perfect Storm: \n\nContrary to what most of you degenerates thought in my previous post, the evidence further and further shows that Evergrande may not receive a bailout but potentially use them as a **\u201cexample company\u201d** while turning their printers on. **Already, China has added 90B Yuan ($14B) liquidity into the banking system.** Although this seems like a small value, adding nearly 100B Yuan of liquidity rarely occurs.\n\n[Will China turn its printer on? Unsustainable.](https://preview.redd.it/einze0umjno71.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce152c6a7699618ecb0c364b2cd6b2624053d92b)\n\n**Based on the latest news and data, I see a perfect storm brewing on a few fundamental factors:**\n\n1. **The China Contagion.** Evergrande is basically real estate COVID and banks are patient zero.  Evergrande isn\u2019t the only Chinese real estate developer at risk. The top 10 alone are at risk of defaulting, more so due to Evergrande (regardless of a bailout or not). Entire sectors will get destroyed too such as construction, materials, and finance.\n2. Tether may be backed by \u201ccommercial paper\u201d aka \u201cChina Money\u201d and other debt that is backed by Evergrande. This would further fuk China and their heavy hand in this year\u2019s Buttcoin run up. \n3. Even if Evergrande wanted to, they can\u2019t sell shit. Consumer and institutional sector confidence is down to all-time lows. A fire sale is largely possible. \n4. Internal panic and \n5. This one\u2019s a meme, but the same advisors that helped the clearly successful Enron & Lehman Broskis were now hired by Evergrande.\n\nIn fact, Evergrande has already begun to repay its investors with \u201cphysical assets\u201d aka property, according to Reuters. Many of these properties are still under construction while others are being destroyed like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/prf8ji/china_demolishes_15_buildings_in_45_seconds/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).\n\n**Contagion 2021:** \n\nCurrently, the majority of news is focused primarily on Evergrande itself, ignoring the several other real estate developers and banks that are also tied in the loop. Over the past decade, we have seen China grow rapidly, spending any resources necessary to grow, grow, grow. At this point, Xinnie the Pooh has been erect for debt for 10 years. What we know is the high **contagion risk** described by Saxo Bank as:\n\n*\u201cA default poses funding problems to Chinese real estate corporates and the Chinese banking sector, which inevitably increased exposure to the real estate giant during the past decade.\u201d*\n\nBasically, RE companies and the banking sector are fucked. The contagion is far worse when you realize many American banks including Citi, GS, and JPM were \u201cattracted like moths\u201d to China\u2019s RE sector just this year.\n\nThe UBS can also be quoted saying, *\"Three weeks ago we did not see any imminent risk of a credit event occurring for Evergrande. Since then, there have been a number of setbacks which have led us to believe that a credit event seems unavoidable\".* \n\nSo, let\u2019s start off with the top 15 RE companies in China currently:\n\n[Damn this debt is THICC.](https://preview.redd.it/kqfrh3lvjno71.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efc0dd2ea0ea48f956acb48f278c5f6ebbcf985)\n\nThe sum of **debt** across these companies is approximately 2.44T Yuan or **$377,532,312,360**. **Note that is not total liabilities, simply debt.** All of the bonds associated with these firms are near default levels due to missed interest payments, and this debt along with other liabilities **amounts to nearly $500B in total liability.** \n\n# Tether Troubles\n\nI\u2019m no Butter or Buttcoin fan, so the downfall of Tether stirs something deep inside my balls\u2026 Anyways, there is a clear case presented by [@TheLastBearSta1](https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1435231303633448963?s=20) on Twitter that everyone should check out. I wanted to go more in depth, but it is late, I have classes and I thought it would be better to provide the sources and you can all make your own views.

{"title": "\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcf6 $ASTS How Douchebag Hedge Fund Bros Will Value AST SpaceMobile w/ $3.7M Position Update \ud83d\udcf6\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "**Douchebag Hedge Fund Analysts = Your Path to Tendies!**\n\n* I'm going to provide a brief overview of how a douchebag hedge fund analyst and his peers will quickly analyze $ASTS after missing out on $10-$20 of upside as the stock likely ramps heading into March 2022 launch of BlueWalker-3\n   * If you don't know much about $ASTS, there are several posts by [/u/thekookreport](https://www.reddit.com/u/thekookreport/) and [/u/faisall1](https://www.reddit.com/u/faisall1/) that cover the company in depth with varying degrees of humor\n\n[Get ahead of these D-bags before Tendy Town](https://preview.redd.it/faccuf61eoo71.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=5474df97754da2492f2cb2ea4be11c5709943474)\n\n \n\n**Assembling Financial Projections:**\n\n* After getting yelled at by their bigger douchebag Portfolio Manager (\"PM\") for missing part of the move up, they'll assemble AST's public forecasts and street estimates:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kr4k034eoo71.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b16d3d1c9247da0ec0c26ac04afbec3c0a1e8c\n\n* As you can see, Deutsche Bank is the most optimistic haircutting AST's 2025E topline by 33% whereas Barclays applies a more severe haircut of 61%.\n* The douchebag analyst will probably take the quickest approach by just averaging the two street estimates to create **\"Street Consensus\"**, which is easy to explain to their PM\n   * Note that AST and the analysts expect steady state EBITDA margins to be north of 96% as the company will be relying on telco partners for subscriber acquisition and maintenance costs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comparable Valuation Analysis:**\n\n* Next the douchebag analyst will pull together a comparable valuation analysis \"comps\". They'll likely select the following companies:\n   * **$IRDM:** vertically integrated, niche global connectivity provider of voice and low-throughput data services (176kbps - 704kps) to bulky proprietary satellite phones. Offers 100 minutes of voice and 100 text messages for $89.99 a month and has 1.6 Million subscribers globally.\n   * **$GSAT:** they'll throw this vertically integrated old school satellite phone provider in the analysis, but it's not really comparable. GSAT has some interesting satellite spectrum that could be utilized for limited regional emergency phone connectivity in future handsets. However the company's satellites are old and need to be decommissioned and replaced with new satellites utilizing a similar approach that AST has patented (high powered, large phased array aperture satellites) to provide anything beyond emergency messaging services. GSAT offers various voice plans starting at $79.99 a month for 150 minutes and has 745,000 subscribers.\n      * Take a look at both Iridium and Globalstar phones, which require large antennas and high power to connect to their respective satellites for voice and low-speed data services. AST\u2019s satellites will allow you to use your current handset for voice and broadband internet!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hzjc1h9eoo71.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=b780be9b64755f2b19be031183ae7003304faf0a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **$AMT $CCI $SBAC:** AMT is an investor and sits on the board of AST. AMT has made it clear that AST's technology could help reduce the need to build out expensive cellular towers in low density areas which could save telco partners significant future capital expenditure $. Once AST's constellation is up and running, the business model would be very similar to wireless tower companies like AMT/CCI/SBAC where they enter into long-term partnership agreements with telcos and provide the infrastructure (towers) that enable connectivity to subscribers.\n   * Tower companies enjoy long-term agreements and predictable cashflows, which have enabled many to convert to REITs as they pass along a steady stream of income to shareholders. Similarly, once AST has invested in deploying its constellation, aside from some minimal maintenance capex the cashflows will be substantial to the point where the AST will likely institute a dividend and/or return capital to shareholders via share buybacks.\n   * Here\u2019s a video of AMT\u2019s Chief Technology Officer talking about AST: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erDOlUoEmnc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erDOlUoEmnc)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loxfvskgeoo71.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcd29da48bf96a69e8b95400a1e1590ef6aab050\n\n \n\n**Probability Weighing the Outcome:**\n\n* So the douchebag analyst has put together valuation \"comps\", using haircut public estimates and peer 2025E EBITDA multiples:\n   * From this comparison, he can support **$100 - $150 per share for AST if it is successful**\n   * Keep in mind that all of these comps exhibit much lower growth rates... if the company can execute the valuation multiple ascribed should be higher\n* Now this is where qualitative due diligence is important. The douchebag analyst may talk to Deutsche Bank and Barclays research to get a feel for probabilities of success. They may also talk to the AST and read reddit posts like this one. *What's the probability for success here?*\n* Deutsche Bank takes an equal weighted approach of 25% for management case, 25% for DB case, 25% for conservative and 25% for zero. The douchebag analyst may take a similar approach:\n   * 33% chance of full success resulting in $100 or $150 price\n   * 33% for partial success resulting in a $30 price. Maybe the service works but is slow or subscribers aren\u2019t as quick to adopt the service \u2026 so you might end up with something like $IRDM, which is worth $6 billion\n   * 33% of total failure resulting in $0. This is pretty punitive given the growing patent portfolio, but zero it is!\n* Based on the valuation analysis above, this is what expected values might look like using forward 2025E EBITDA multiple discounted back 2 years by 15 discount rate to get to beginning of CY2022\n   * **Using $IRDM as a comparable: $32**\n   * **Using Tower Cos as comparables: $45**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb69ua6keoo71.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=93269552f8e09dcdcc842e3e2e0c9feb53aef0ec\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n* Most institutions will likely ignore AST until we get within a few months from the scheduled March 2022 launch of BlueWalker-3 satellite aboard SpaceX.\n   * Once BlueWalker-3 is successfully deployed, it will allow for full scale testing of AST\u2019s technology and service ahead of Phase I deployment for equatorial coverage and service\n* However, once institutions and retail start to focus on this event the valuation exercise that I outlined above will be kicked off at generalist, event-driven, Tech/Media/Telecom and other douchebag hedge fund desks across the street\n* These douches completing their valuation analyses will then lead to FOMO position building in anticipation of BlueWalker-3\u2019s launch which should cause the stock to ramp (who is going to miss out on what could be the most disruptive company in wireless?!?!)\n   * Yes, the effective float here is tiny at 36.9M shares once you remove the 9.2M held by strategics purchased via PIPE.

Lynk is focused on limited text messaging with the hopes of expanding to voice and data.  However their approach of trying to utilize low power, small aperture nanosats will not work for delivering anything beyond intermittent text messaging.  There's physics at play here... if you have a low power, small antenna cell phone like what we use today, then the other end which is a cell tower OR in this case a satellite in LEO needs to have high power and large aperture in order to communicate with that phone. On the flip side, a service like Starlink uses lower power small satellites, to transmit data... but the user on the ground has to use a big, HIGH powered antenna to communicate with the satellite.\n\nRemember, 5G is a standard that utilizes many different bands of spectrum, which also includes cellular spectrum.  AST is utilizing the cellular spectrum of its partners primarily in the 600-900mhz and 1.7-2.2ghz frequencies, which happen to be the best for coverage and propagation.  These frequencies are key for a LEO satellite to communicate directly with an unmodified mobile handset.  Why? Your current handset already works with these frequencies and because of the propagation and coverage characteristics, you will be able to use AST's service in various conditions (rain, obstructions like trees/walls, etc).  Going back to the Starlink example, Starlink is using millimeter (high frequency) band spectrum which is great for data throughput, but terrible at coverage and propagation... which is why you need unobstructed line of sight for best service.\n\n2) AST is utilizing the spectrum, network and billing/customer service of its 20 MNO partners (AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, etc).  AST is compensating these partners by splitting revenues it generates from the partner's subscribers (50/50 or better).  You can go to AST's presentation to see what their ARPU will be for developed and developing markets:\n\n[https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST\\_SpaceMobile\\_Investor\\_Presentation\\_Public\\_12-15-20.pdf](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf)\n\nPage 29 shows that developed markets will be $7.62 / month and developing markets $1.03 / month.\n\n3) Older companies have used this radically different approach because the cost of launching a 2 ton satellite into space was prohibitively expensive ... UNTIL NOW.  The cost of launch has gone down in orders of magnitude, especially with the advent of SpaceX.  There's a reason why I won't invest in Astra, RocketLabs, Relativity, SpaceX, etc. There are more than 200 private and sovereign launch providers in what will be a race to zero.  The benefactors are companies like AST that will be putting up next gen satellites that were unthinkable 10 years ago due to costs to deploy. Those other companies may try to do something similar in a few years time and cannibalize their existing sat constellations. Competition is inevitable, but I like AST's IP position with over 1,200 patent claims (which many hopefully will flip to granted patents). If you want to learn more about AST's approach to delivering broadband to an unmodified cell phone, watch this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ)\n\n4) AST did a reverse test.  They launched BlueWalker-1, which had a mobile phone, into space. They then communicated with that phone with BlueWalker-2, which was a test satellite that was here on earth.  By using this approach, they've been able to continually improve the design of the satellite system which will ultimately culminate into BlueWalker-3, which will be a slightly scaled down but full blown production satellite in March 2022.  \n\nThe company hasn't publicly released the testing results, HOWEVER BlueWalker-1's results were what Vodafone, Rakuten, Samsung and American Tower diligenced and led to their series B investments and ultimate PIPE investments.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the time and effort!\n\nI found the video on youtube as well.

We see the issues the World had with Starlink, these are very, very small at only 5m span, compared to this array...\n\nNext year they will launch the first array. If it is successful, there will be one.\n\nPage 32: Looking at their costs, currently, there is not enough cash on hand to build the first one and launch it. (the exact amount from the SPAC and capital raised to date exactly matches the cost for the first launch???)\n\nLets say that is true, so currently, they have no cash left, right? It has all gone to factory build and the prototype. They claim not to begin revenue generation until 2023...which I am not sure that one array can generate 9 million customers and $181M in rev.\n\nThat is asking alot from subscribers to add another monthly fee to their bill with very, very limited coverage (for many , many years)\n\nIt appears there will have to be a significant offering in Q1/Q2 simply to keep going and keep building arrays.\n\nTo the business model of providing coverage where none exists...\n\nThere are reasons, in many under or un-developed countries why there is no coverage, they simply have no money. Keep in mind, the ASTS fee is in addition to the cell phone providers fee, and of course, there is a cost of the cell phone itself. These cell phone companies provide cell phones and service where there is a market to pay for such.\n\nYes, it is nice when someone visits remote areas to have cell phone coverage, but I am not really sure that this is worth paying the extra costs for (especially with the very limited coverage)\n\nand really, until there is infrastructure in developing areas, I see no reason for a cell company to provide cell phones and service, simply for the ASTS add on.\n\nMy opinions:\n\nIts an interesting concept, but given the shear size and number of the required array, I see a regulatory hurdle. The time required to set up 200 of these is another big issue for me.\n\nI simply do not see the numbers of subscribers ramping up that fast, given that there is one array with limited coverage for a few minutes a day when it is overhead.\n\nAt a current $2.35Billion valuation...this company is at the pre-development, pre-testing, pre-approval and pre-revenue phase....there will be many more rounds of dilution, and the valuation leaves no upside for at least 10 years if even successful.\n\nSorry...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Origami unfolding mechanisms are the future of large arrays which is similar to what AST will be utilizing to unfold its large aperture.
