It was clearly a figure-of-speech.\n\nThe smartphone business is tough. That's why LG left and why margins can be difficult for some companies. But Apple's iPhones have some of the highest margins for any smartphone. It's true, iPhone unit sales are down about 30 million from their highest peak but the recent total of 197 million units sold is the 5th highest ever recorded in a year. They earned $138 billion just off of iPhone sales in the previous year which is the 4th highest in revenue for iPhone sales ever.\n\nIn America, 73.3 million unit sales is the 2nd highest amount of iPhones sold in a year. The decrease overall to their iPhone business is coming from China and that could be due increased competition from budget manufacturers such as Xiaomi and Huawei who have moderately priced phones for great value. Look at Samsung's unit sales for smartphones across the board. They are decreasing far quicker than Apple. Xiaomi and Huawei phones aren't coming to the states by mass numbers so Apple wouldn't be worried about it from the North America/European side. Those sales are largely affecting their China sales which again, is a blunder for Apple but comes with the territory. In fact, I'm surprised it didn't happen much sooner considering China's expertise in assembling smartphones.\n\nBut the big picture you are ignoring is that Apple phones hold up so well over time that more people are using an Apple iPhone than ever... which is the ecosystem I am referring to. You're not upgrading? Fine, but you're still using an iPhone. Currently, there are over 1.042 billion active iPhone units around the world. That rate grows about 5-8% every year... In 2015, there were 569 million active iPhone units. Do the math. Double the amount of users in just five years. In the USA alone, there are 202 million active iPhone units. Again, double what it was five years ago and the highest recorded, ever.\n\nAirpods sold 114 million UNITS in 2020. In 2018, that number was only 35 million units. TRIPLE the growth.\n\nMac sales hit record high in 2020.\n\nBut here is what you aren't understanding: ECOSYSTEM. Every single one of these Apple devices will eventually use an Apple service. Services revenue climbed 45% from 2018 to 2020. Total amount of Apple service users grew from 325 million to 620 million from 2018 to 2020. Apple pay users grew from 389 million to 510 million from 2018 to 2020. In fact, Apple Pay recorded 15 BILLION transactions in 2019 as compared to only 1.8 billion in 2017. Apple Music subscribers hit 72 million in 2020 as compared to 40 million in 2018.\n\nThe services segment will be their biggest area in the future and what has allowed them to capture such a large audience is the fact that people are interconnected into their system. Once Apple hooks you in, very few switch. Most Apple users don't just own an iPhone. They own AirPods, Apple Music, use the AppStore, Apple Watch, etc., Not upgrading your phone? Doesn't matter, you're still using Apple services one way or the other. This segment is the fastest growing while also being the most profitable segment for them with gross margins of 64%... double that of product margins.\n\nSo look, you can say how people will refuse to pay, hate Apple, it's too expensive, etc., all you want but the numbers and data show quite differently. It shows Apple has more users than ever before with a steady rate in growth annually. Failing business model? Nope, that's because you still think all they are is an iPhone business. Notice, none of what you said is data proven. It's all anecdotal evidence. I also have an Android because I honestly love my Google Pixel phone.

{"title": "DD: The most undervalued EV stock $GOEV", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Canoo pickup truck](https://preview.redd.it/76aswan72rm71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=635a1f44992e767571b2291718d2df152b05aecf)\n\nI am deeply attracted by the bold designs by Canoo at first sight even though most of those EVs are designed for business/workers instead of individual customers and really wish that I could own a truck or a van like that in the near future.  Yet shorts seem dominating the SP of the ticker and scare retailers away. There was a small short squeeze (up 30% without news) happened weeks ago but that's not the reason I create the post. I want to share all the knowledge I have about the company to discuss whether it is a good short term and long term investment. Potential short squeeze is of course a plus but that's not what I pursue here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why shorts are hunting Canoo**\n\nCanoo was founded in 2017 by executives from BMW, Tesla, Ford, etc and went public last year. The main reason shorts crowded in is the disastrous earning call in March, where the previous CEO Ulrich (along with chief lawyer Andrew) stepped away and the new CEO Tony took over the company.  The change of executives also triggered a SEC investigation on the company. Meanwhile, Canoo does not have cars in production yet and blew off the deals with Apple and Hyundai. Those negative news hence scared away retail investors and shorts come in and took over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MPDV I](https://preview.redd.it/l21zt3w92rm71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b116f98f8210896dcbec741cd546a055cb9b44c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MPDV](https://preview.redd.it/te2jtddb2rm71.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8fbc02ba2b433c99b2124f970a5e010a2d78948)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why I view the change of CEO positive**\n\nUlrich was later hired by Apple. (FYI, Apple reached Canoo in 2019 and 2020 for acquisition but Canoo turned it down. Canoo said that they don't want acquisition but investment.) Although many people view Ulrich's stepping down as a negative news, I view it differently.  The main disagreement between Ulrich and the board (including the new CEO Tony who invested $75million of his own money into the company), as I understand it,  is the business model and directions. Ulrich wants to create a subscription model for their vehicles (companies subscribe/lease vehicles) yet I don't think the Canoo board agreed. We have to admit that Ulrich contributed significantly to Canoo as Chief Technology Officer yet I don't think he can be a qualified CEO leading the company to right business model.  Tony, on the contrary, has abundant success business records.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What has changed after March.**\n\nEveryone seems keeping those bad memories of Canoo after the earning call and no one really cares about what is really going on under the new leadership.  Facts below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Canoo received $300M incentives from the Oklahoma government to build their factory. FYI, Rivian (pre-IPO which is valued $80B) received $350M from the Texas government. I don't think those state governors are morons. The question is why Oklahoma governments picked Canoo instead of all other 'promising' EV companies out there. (source: [https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar))\n* Canoo received 10,000 orders from FRONTdoor Collective executives (source: [https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network))\n* Canoo has 9,500 non biding orders from individual customers.\n* Canoo has signed contract with VDL Nedcar ( that produced BMW in Europe) source ([https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)) Their first batch of car will be on market in 2022q4.\n* Canoo has been hunting for talents: the number of employees jumped from \\~200 to \\~700 and most of them are engineers. They have the ambassador Josette on board as the new president ( believe her connections can win Canoo government and international orders). (source: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-names-ambassador-josette-sheeran-president-301340683.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-names-ambassador-josette-sheeran-president-301340683.html))\n* Meanwhile, I think that Canoo has some news being held (The CEO mentioned in q2 earning call and there is either no news or big news), they have been actively expanding different markets (pest control, delivery. They attended different expos (ACT expo for example)  and received a lot of interests from companies like UPS for their MPDV type, they speak on Panel at World's Largest Mobility Event, etc.\n* Rumors still stir around about the Apple and Canoo thing. I think as long as the price is seductive, there are always possibilities. I see a more possible situation as that Canoo focuses on hardware while Apple contributes the softwares (autonomous driving).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lifestyle vans](https://preview.redd.it/3u0vhilc2rm71.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d60457126baa2ab77ff155c3846f187939f3af9e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is the core technology behind Canoo**Skateboard technology + versatile/flexible modules. The skateboard technology they own saves a lot of space and create more rooms for passengers.  The modulization gives the advantage of customization and reduce the production cost as well.  Their MPDVs (MPDV I, II and III with different sizes) and Lifestyles Vans are to B while the pickup truck (expected to go to market in 2023) are to C. But I personally would like to customize a MPDV for traveling as well![https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video)\n\n**TL;DR**Canoo has $563.6 million in cash and $300million incentives received from the Oklahoma government. This combines into $863.6 million. The company currently valued at $1.65B (less than 2x of the cash equivalents the companies owned), which is far undervalued compared with its peers. It is like $NIO when it was at $3. Short float reported as 40% but it should be much higher than this.  This is the company that Apple reached for acquisition not a long time ago, and rumors and speculation still stirs around about the collaboration. Their design of vehicles always remind me of the feeling that I first time saw iphone 3gs.  And hopefully you guys can see me driving a Canoo Pickup or Van in the near future.Position: long term holder 2900 @$8.23 (still adding though).

That news comes just as the new US infrastructure package promises billions of dollars in aid and development funding to existing nuclear plants, as well as advanced\u00a0nuclear energy technologies. Small module reactor (SMR) projects are already underway in the US and China, while\u00a0companies like Terrapower plan\u00a0to supplant retiring coal power infrastructure with\u00a0nuclear reactors.\"*\n\n\n The prospects for the global nuclear power industry have improved over the last two years because of \"ambitious decarbonization goals\" that are likely to require significant use of low-carbon nuclear energy, driving an increase in demand for uranium that could be unmet if new mines are not developed soon, the World Nuclear Association said Sept. 8. \n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/090821-decarbonization-boosts-prospects-for-nuclear-industry-uranium-demand-wna](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/090821-decarbonization-boosts-prospects-for-nuclear-industry-uranium-demand-wna)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Uranium is a small market at roughly $6.3 billion in annual consumption (180 million pounds at $35/lb). The spark for this price rise was because SPUT (Trust invests and holds substantially all of its assets in uranium), started buying up & storing physical uranium a few weeks back. \n\nBut why is this important? One of the cleanest & most powerful sources of energy, nuclear power could play a key role in the decarbonization goals of countries. Nuclear reactors use fission (splitting of uranium atoms) to produce energy, making it one of the cleanest and economically efficient energy sources.\"\n\n[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/brave-new-world-what-sparked-a-rally-in-uranium-hedge-your-portfolio-with-farmland/articleshow/86097341.cms](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/brave-new-world-what-sparked-a-rally-in-uranium-hedge-your-portfolio-with-farmland/articleshow/86097341.cms)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" recent price action in the spot uranium market underscores our long-standing thesis that uranium prices had hit a bottom in 2016 and were poised for a substantial, long-term bull market due to a multi-year supply deficit which had formed and is only growing with the renewed interest in nuclear power. \"\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/north-shore-global-uranium-mining-etf-urnm-surpasses-500-million-in-assets-301373449.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/north-shore-global-uranium-mining-etf-urnm-surpasses-500-million-in-assets-301373449.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" Iran\u2019s new government continued to dramatically increase production of highly-enriched uranium while failing to resume full cooperation with international monitors, signaling a new round of escalation awaits officials when they convene this month to discuss the country\u2019s atomic program.
