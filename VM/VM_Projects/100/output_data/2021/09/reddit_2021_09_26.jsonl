This was right about the time where mobile was taking off in a big way in Europe and Asia. My group were largely Europeans, and we were SHOCKED at the state of the US mobile scene. Phones were shit. SMS messages were expensive. \n\nAnd internally, AT&T didn't give a shit. They thought they were inevitable.\n\nI was asked once while there what I saw as the next big things in telecomms. I answered basically that text messaging was huge and growing, and that server/cloud based services like persistent phone book/contacts, vocabulary and patterns for texting and perhaps hosted photos would be a great way for systems designers and providers to differentiate themselves and make their products \"sticky\". The exec looked at me blankly, and said that he found it unlikely that people would pay for sending a bunch of ultra short emails (remember, SMS was fairly limited) every day.\n\nAt that point, more than a billion SMSs or equivalents were sent every week in Asia. He didn't know, or didn't care, and he entirely ignored the hosted services part of the suggestion.\n\nAt that point, the research center was already dying. I think that half of one of the five wings was still in use or something like that. Here they had one of the top teams, if not THE top team in hosted services, speech recognition and synthesis, and [the first widely used chatbot](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016763939700040X) ([a good overview here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220475988_Automated_Natural_Spoken_Dialog), see also [this article](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.298.1699&rep=rep1&type=pdf)). And they were killing it off, because they couldn't figure out a way to monetize it. They were like, NOPE, we've tried everything we've always done, and none of it has brought change.\n\nJust a few years later, AT&T ceased to exist in the original sense. Their [wireless telecomms part was bought by Cingular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Wireless_Services#Acquisition_by_Cingular), largely to grab the name for marketing of mobile services. The so-called assets were otherwise shit at that point.\n\nI spent 2015-2018 working on Siri which was at that point along with Alexa and Google assistant a booming business.\n\nI am currently working for Microsoft on hosted speech services that is one of the biggest growth factors for Azure.\n\nIt could ALL have been AT&T.
