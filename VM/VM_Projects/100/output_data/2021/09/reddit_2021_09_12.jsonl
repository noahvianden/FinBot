It mitigates against someone being stupider than even basic sense.\n\n\n> Because you\u2019ve patronized the absolute shit out of me I guess I\u2019ll do the same. Some investors are what is called risk-averse. \n\nIf you were actually risk-averse, you'd avoid strategies that underperform.  You're driving down a highway with your eyes closed and a blindfold on, while screaming that it's because you're averse to risk.  Uh, ooooookay.\n\n> This means they prefer to avoid risk, and will even forego a larger potential return on their money to make a safer investment. \n\nDCA doesn't avoid risk nor is it safer.  Those are fake attributes you've imbued it with.  \n\n> Are you still with me? \n\nThankfully, no.  \n\n> Because I suspect from your comments you don\u2019t understand the concept of risk mitigation and aversion.\n\nIt's clear you,don't understand the concept of loud and proud oblivious irony.\n\n> I also find it absolutely hilarious that you\u2019re comparing investing in a company to buying cars or cans of fucking soup. What an absolutely useless comparison.\n\nSadly, people like you will spend hours searching for the best price on a can of soup, but for purchases that are a thousand or a million times larger, you defiantly, brazenly, loudly, proudly declare that the risk is meaningless and that you're going to make your purchases with zero awareness, with a blindfold on, and that you're going to commit to pay any price the seller dictates.  Risk averse indeed. (Facepalm)\n\n\n\nTake a calculus class.  DCA only works in one specific curve, a curve in which some security (you've decided is the best of all possible choices) somehow takes a precipitous decline right after you buy it, and that decline becomes steep and prolonged long enough for you to accumulate in multiple tiny purchases.  Never mind that the security you decided was the best in breeds suddenly shit the bed, and didn't recover quickly.  Make sure you don't take off the blindfold to examine what conditions might have caused that, what might have led you to make such an objectively terrible call.  You just plow on.  \n\nNow, that same unpredictable security, the one that went from best to worst, and stayed worst, for a long time, now, that security has to have an epic comeback.  It has to deliver percentage performance gains exceeding the percentage losses it already delivered.  Only after that improbable and sustained long term sequence of events did DCA \"work\". \n\nHow I, and the successful part of the industry work is we watch that security.  If it is indeed quality, and we see it shit the bed with people like you riding its back, we watch and wait and assess why that happened.  We look at the events that caused it, the competition, the valuation, the upcoming catalysts, the landscape of the sector.  We see what the sum of parts are, and what cash per share exist as the now lower level.  We look at if there's a pandemic coming, what the recession indicators might be, what the book to price ratios are, what technicals say and what momentum shows.  Then when we see a nice juicy price, we bulk buy it.  And when it recovers, we've outperformed you by multiple integers.  It feels almost like we're competing in a sword fight with someone who is purposely wearing a blindfold, I guess because we are.\n\n> Get off your high fucking horse.\n\nStay on your disinformation soap box.

I usually shop in chunks, about twice a week.  I dont feel it is unreasonable to spend that amount and am super comfortable with it as I cook and theyre mainly just ingredients. I spend my  own time making things out of it that you usually see bundled up in something you\u2019d buy at a restaurant for like an exponentially insane price based on if you were to separate out the ingredients. \n\nFor example I see things like half a pre made sandwich for 2.78 If you were to make the bread yourself, buy the lunchmeat and cheese yourself, condiments as well you could make quite a few sandwiches on your own, like probable half a dozen or more I\u2019m not sure Id have to break down the numbers.

Using money velocity theory (money velocity is basically a metric for how much people spend). Let me first state some source and then explain the formula I'm using. I'll be doing calculations on rough estimates bcuz it's like 3 over here and I wanna head to bed:\n\n**M2 Money supply (M)**  \nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL the m2 money supply has grown about 5,000 billion since the beginning of corona, or has grown \\~33%. A good part of that growth can be attributed to the (digital) printing of extra money by the federal reserve.\n\n**GDP**  \nand here is the GDP: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP went up by about 4% since the start of corona.\n\n**M2 Money velocity (V)**  \nhere is the velocity of money for that money: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V\\~-20% since corona. people spend less.\n\n**Consumer price index (CPI)**  \nand finally the last one in america: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/ The last time it was this high was 2008. 5.4% up at the moment. (the fed says this is temporary but suppose it wasn't, they couldn't just announce this). But hey the new inflation numbers drop next tuesday so we'll be able to see if powel is bs-ing everyone.\n\n**Money velocity formula**  \nV = (CPI\\*GDP)/M  \nFinal thing before we can fill this bitch in is an understanding of index numbers, some quick examples before I fill this in: that 30% would be denoted as 1.3A -20% would be denoted as 0.8 etc. with that out of the way lets fill this bitch in.\n\n(1.05 \\* 1.04)/1.33 = 0.82\n\nthat's an 18% drop of money velocity roughly the 20 I eyeballed (if anyone want to do detailed calculations feel free to do so this is moreso to give you a general idea)\n\n**Ok so what then?**  \nThere are basically three scenario's here:\n\n1. people start spending more again (more likely) -> money velocity goes up -> (CPI\\*GDP)/M goes up -> unless the money supply goes down (spoiler it wont) the CPI\\*GDP part will have to go up. want back to pre corona levels of spending? (which were already declining for years on end) then CPI\\*GDP would need to be 1.25 (under the assumption they don't print even more money). Figure out for yourself which part of that 1.25 comes from CPI and which from GDP, either way it's going to be difficult to go back to pre covid spending levels without huge amounts of inflation.\n\n2. people will start spending less -> money velocity decreases -> (CPI\\*GDP)/M decreases -> either more money is printed once again (adding to the 28.5T gov debt (GDP is about 22T btw)) or CPI\\*GDP decreases.

A lot of employees have stock grants and have a higher NW than employees at legacy companies ever will.  \n\nI met a Tesla service guy who was in his late 20s and we got to talking and he said he loved the company - gave him enough to afford a house and start a college fund for his newborn daughter.  He said he had hundreds of shares of Tesla that were granted to him and that he was going to keep it for his daughter.  He said other guys he knows are millionaires and still fixing Teslas.  This is in the Bay Area.  Why would you unionize and potentially take away or reduce ownership stake in what will be the most valuable company someday?   \n\nAnyway the long and short of it is that everyone and I mean EVERYONE is out to get Tesla.  The politicians are bought and paid for as we all can clearly and blatantly see.  It\u2019s right there in plain sight.  They are not to be trusted. \n\nJoe Manchin makes almost 1/2 a million on dividends annually from oil and coal stocks.  Biden and most of the party is owned by the unions and must look after their needs since these guys will jump to Trump again in 2024 if they feel like Joe isn\u2019t on their side.  \n\nBut you know what?  It doesn\u2019t matter.  I have never seen a company execute like Tesla.  I mean Elon is running several companies and sub companies all at once and still has time to tweet day and night.  And each single company is run better than most other competing companies.  \n\nI own a Model X and want a Plaid one (if I get it, I\u2019ll probably keep the old X and let friends use it as it has free supercharging for life).  I have a Tesla solar roof and powerwall (almost done finally!!).  I\u2019m getting another solar roof and powerwall for the ADU I\u2019m building.  The install experience is a little rough but Elon will hopefully get wind of it and fix it.  I have about 10% of my NW in Tesla stock and options.  And a 20% drop in price today wouldn\u2019t phase me.  I\u2019d actually sell options and pick up more on the dip.  \n\nIn the end it doesn\u2019t matter what these politicians and other companies do.  They use politics and games to try and stop the obvious transition that HAS ALREADY OCCURRED.  Us early adopters know it.  \n\nTo me, it feels to me like how Google maps came about.  For years Google had the funny cars with cameras and sensors driving around collecting data.  Everyone thought it was neat but didn\u2019t think much of it.  Now it\u2019s the backbone of our lives and no one can catch up.  Imagine a week without popping open Google maps.  The supercharger network is the same type of thing.  A decade in the making and growing faster than ever.  It\u2019s nearly impossible to replicate at scale as no one else is investing in high speed charging at all.  EA is a joke (watch the lasted MKBHD with gas vs Tesla vs Mach E).  \n\nSo for me, the game is pretty much over.  Buy a F150 lightning?  Good luck not getting stranded towing your 5th wheel and jet skis.  Audi etron?  Looks great - where you gonna plug it in?  ID4?  Why\u2019s it so sloooooow and why doesn\u2019t it have a frunk?  Literally WTF?  These guys just took a gas car and did the bare minimum to make it an EV.  \n\nSo my thought is to ignore the noise.  Incentives won\u2019t matter.  Some Tesla models are already sold out through next Feb and counting.  And this is without incentives in the US.  \n\nChoose your car correctly and get a car you can drive anywhere and more importantly FEEL SECURE driving anywhere.  Choose poorly and get a fancy, range-locked paperweight that can\u2019t go certain places or lacks the capability of gas cars.  \n\nThat feeling secure is important btw.  When I first got my Model X in 2018,  I literally drove it to Seattle and back without planning ahead.  Just hopped in and went without planning; trusting the built in map to find superchargers and places with destination chargers.  Last fall, I did the same thing but this time I spent 5 weeks or so driving around the US (nearly 10k miles) and slept in the car most nights.  No planning, just went.  No problems.  Just used the built in map for charging.  \n\nThese legacy automakers literally have no shot because they aren\u2019t competing on the same playing field as Tesla.  Toyota is still actively lobbying to kill the EV credits and investing a paltry sum over the next decade in battery tech (that Tesla is already heavily invested in and is about to leapfrog everyone with next year).

Anyway, it\u2019s a clear and extremely key advantage Tesla has. \n\nAlso, you\u2019ll notice the Mach E hype cycle has gone to zero.  No updates, no news, no more \u201cTesla killer\u201d articles.   Why?  Those were bought and paid for by Ford.  The real story is that the cars just aren\u2019t selling.  The auto press won\u2019t report on this because Ford is one of the big advertises for these guys.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t fandom, although yes I\u2019m a fan and believer.  It\u2019s math, pure and simple.  Im a business owner and investor pure and simple.  \n\nPeople are already regretting MachE and IPace.  I see a few here in the Bay Area but it\u2019s nothing like the numbers of Tesla\u2019s which are almost as common as Toyotas (maybe more so?) now. \n\nSo even with an unbalanced incentive, you\u2019re looking at a Model Y starting around  the 32k range - now you\u2019re getting deep into mainstream pricing territory.  \n\nBut I digress - it\u2019s not about the pricing.  If that were true, everyone would buy the civic or Corolla.  They\u2019re just as functional more or less as Model 3 and 33% cheaper.  Other EVs still have the current federal incentive and it doesn\u2019t matter.  Those who are price sensitive will go with the incentivized purchase of course but they\u2019ll eventually find that their car lacks a reliable charging infrastructure and even regular OTA updates which are both table stakes IMO.  Uneducated buyers will soon be spreading word of how they can\u2019t roadtrip in their car easily or how their car doesn\u2019t have nearly as much storage space as a Tesla.  \n\nHeck the other day I got Disney+ turned on in my car.  At the same time Toyota was making noise about some paltry investment in batteries.  It\u2019s literally ridiculous how behind the curve legacy auto is.   It\u2019s really about the total package that Tesla brings - full ev, performance,  OTA updates, autonomous driving, almost zero maintenance cost, supercharger ubiquity, safety, etc.  \n\nAnyway, I invite you to go pickup a non-Tesla EV.  Go for it if you think I\u2019m the delusional one haha.  All I know my delusion has allowed me to grow my NW several times in the past few 4 years when I yolo\u2019d a significant portion of my investment account into TSLA.  I sold half off after the 8x rise in 2019 and paid off one of my properties. I\u2019m HODLing the rest due to my conviction that the game is no longer afoot and that it has in fact already ended.

The point of the credit was to drive demand for people who might create evs. Tesla has no demand problem and just pocket the tax credit money for the most part. They should probably be exempt from the entire tax credit. \n\nNo offense but I think you have some bias. The Audi and vw were both entirely new platforms from their ICE models. They definitely tried to make a better car. Having driven all 3 and own multiple Tesla's there's a number of reasons for the gap. Tesla isn't anywhere close to where Audi is on quality. Tesla is essentially apple in the ability to drive customer behavior. They know people will buy so why bother with the customer experience or quality. I'm the perfect example. Drive 180+ miles a day in my Tesla. Seats don't compare to Audi, wind noise is so bad I have to wear headphones to make calls, real range vs projected is nonsense....

I\u2019m not really biased but do see a clear line where Tesla has the infrastructure advantage other ev makers do not focus on.  No one else is investing as heavily - not even EA.  \n\nFor sure Tesla has lots to learn but I heard new S & X refresh is getting close.  Much better noise isolation and build quality.  The point is, these things are relatively trivial to catch up on and their focus definitely isn\u2019t on the creature comfort type things (I mean sort of, but not really).  The main focus is on infrastructure and moats - technology and problems that require large investment and breakthroughs to get there.  AI, battery tech, drive train, efficiency - etc.  Other manufacturers are just not putting as much focus on these issues.  Tesla is out investing, out executing, and ultimately will win.\n\nAt this point Tesla is just starving other companies of the top tier talent in each of the disciplines.  AI day was to show off bleeding edge hardware and software that a lot of PhDs will be attracted to.  They want their pick of the best and will leave the rest to work at L their competitors.   Can the competition catch them?  Yes!  If they somehow manage to be a best of breed AI and energy company focusing on  technology and pushing thr state of the art ahead.  But who will do this?  Most are still OEMing ev drivetrain components and whole systems from LG and slapping their shells on top.  Sure there\u2019s work to be done but they\u2019re not investing in the know how.  They\u2019re trusting LG to give them the right \u201cstuff\u201d to make EVs.  We see how the first round of this is going with the Bolt.\n\nSoon catching up will be much more difficult as Tesla starves these other companies not only of top talent but also of profits.  They already have lower margins and way overspend on advertising.  How much is left for real R&D?  Guaranteed these guys will plow whatever money is left into concept cars that will never ship, lobbying, and more ads.  They will NOT invest in technology and infrastructure meaningfully like Tesla does.   I\u2019d love to be proven wrong and I think Elon would love the challenge.  Also think how car makers and dealers make profits.  Car dealers WANT cars to have failure points.  Failures/maintenance leads to more money.  Tesla\u2019s have issues for sure but they\u2019re far fewer than maintenance costs than other car makers. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m fairly certain that Tesla has a strong road to taking huge share in the auto industry along with taking over the solar & stationary storage industry in the next 3-5 years.   I\u2019m just not seeing the push into clean energy infrastructure by anyone else.  \n\nPlus you said it yourself - dollars and cents, Tesla is the best.  Charging - Tesla is the best.  I get it - there are merits to other companies.  The EQG from Mercedes does look sweet but would I be the first to get one?

The US is probably better off if the traditional US ICE makers successfully make the transition to BEVs than if they go out of business. \n\n- Tesla also benefits from the existence of other BEV makers because (1) it forwards Tesla's mission statement to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy, (2) if the other auto makers are making money selling BEVs, then they are less likely to lobby the government to discourage BEVs than they would if they were not making money on BEVs, and (3) Tesla needs other companies selling vehicles to reduce the risk of antitrust actions - Tesla's stated goal is to have 20% of the automotive market, though perhaps they could get to 30% (didn't GM have a larger market share than that at some point in the past?).\n\n- Even though the current wording favors the other car companies, I expect the net benefit would be greater for Tesla than for the other companies, relative to the current situation where most of the  other companies get the $7500 tax credit and Tesla doesn't. And the fact that GM also doesn't currently get the tax credit provides the government with an incentive to drop the 200,000 vehicle limit.\n\n- Tesla does not get to decide whether its workers unionize (the workers vote on that), but Tesla can decide to encourage unionization if they want to. It seems extremely unlikely that Tesla would encourage unionization to get an additional government incentive, especially since such an incentive could potentially be removed by subsequent government action.\n\n- I saw an article last week that appeared to essentially say that the UAW is still pushing to slow down the transition to BEVs (believe it was discussed on this subreddit). And there was mention in the government EV event of pacing (limiting the speed of) the EV transition to reduce the risk of \"stranded assets\", almost certainly put there at the request of the ICE vehicle makers. I hope the unions and ICE makers reconsider - the transition is likely to come much faster than expected, and it would be unfortunate if they put themselves out of business by dragging their feet.\n\n- Wording that has been proposed to significantly limit the prices of the vehicles and the income of the buyers that get the incentive hurts other auto makers more than it hurts Tesla, because Tesla is years ahead on the learning curve for lowering the cost of making BEVs, and the other companies are more dependent on revenue from higher end brands to be financially viable (as Tesla was in its early years). (In other words, Tesla is increasingly able to produce huge numbers of low cost BEVS and make money doing so, and traditional ICE vehicle makers are much less able to do that.) The limits would benefit the fossil fuel industry because they would slow adoption of BEVs, but I expect the traditional ICE makers who are trying to make the transition to BEVs to push to raise any vehicle price and buyer income limits.\n\n- It's encouraging that the incentives are being discussed in Congress, as opposed to being stalled. It's likely that many of the details will change. There has been a slight hint of expressing the union incentives in terms of a threshold of pay and employment benefits to the workers - that might be more likely to get through Congress, and would be less of a problem for Tesla, who already competes to treat their employees well enough that the majority don't want to unionize.", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Tesla workers can always form a union and not join the UAW.

However I looked into it and here are some reasons why the OP is an idiot.\n\nHis argument is that INTC is a good investment because of the automotive chip shortage.\n\n1). INTC doesn\u2019t make automobile chips\n\n2). Neither do the car companies\n\n3) car computer modules are created by companies who then outsource in bulk the components.  So something like Chrysler will buy a module from Bosch who will buy the from the cheapest bidder.\n\n4) there is a chip shortage.  However the current issue is that because it\u2019s outsourced through several rings of suppliers car manufacturers have almost no control over their supply chains and no clout over their actual producer(TSM).  So when they cancelled and then restarted their orders the auto industry set their supply chains back a few months. \n\nThe shortage is that, several months worth of production.  It might sound big for Toyota to make 1.5m fewer cars this year.  But that\u2019s 15%.  It\u2019s not a total shutdown.\n\n5). If this were an EV issue then companies that don\u2019t really sell EVs, most of them (Nissan/Renault, Stellantis, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Mazda, etc) wouldn\u2019t have been hit either, no?\n\nFinally, Ford has what?  100k LiON batteries to put in cars this year?  In their production run of 7m cars?  Ford can try and blame EVs, but the truth is their whole industry blundered bigly.  Ford just blundered worse cause they\u2019re so bad at managing supply.\n\nYou\u2019re arguing a secular increase in chip usage due to EVs.

Foundries are not made overnight. Pat can announce what ever he wants its just an announcement. Intel is lobbying for tax payer money to finance their fabs. First they need to up their game before making chips for others. They have been lying for last 5 years and they have to prove it before I put my money.\n\nThey are undervalue or Id say value trap. Intel is trading at suppressed P/E because they will be growing at very slow pace for next few years. Go check analysts consensus for 2022 and 2023. However I think their revenues have peaked and its downhill from here.\n\nLooking at their current and future offerings. There is absolutely no way they can come on top for at-least 3-4 years. As long as TSMC has lead, AMD will have lead.\n\nAlder Lake their upcoming cpus sure will be competitive against Ryzen 5xxx but at what cost? Its going to be power hog (check out the leaks). Secondly they will be competing against Zen 3D chips that will be first mass produced stacked chip ever in quantities. On the contrary Intel has been demonstrating Feverous for years now and not a single MP chip yet. Yes they integrated Vega GPU with Kaby Lake but they were limited in quantities and only few vendors opted for it due to high price tag.\n\n\nMobile: Current Tiger Lake does not have a definite lead over Zen 3 APUs. It is dependent upon which application you use. Also, Tiger Lake draw 40-50% more power than Ryzen 5000 APUs. Ryzen 5000 series is far more efficient processor than Tiger Lake. Period. Also, there are rumors of Rembrandt APUs already in production already on TSMC 6nm. They will have zen 3+ cores with RDNA2 graphics. Intel Xe in Alder Lake will not have a chance to be remotely competitive. Also, Alder Lake looks like to be a power hog (Thanks to their 10nm renamed Intel 7 node). Lets see how the little cores works because thats the only thing that may save intel in the notebooks. You can\u2019t clock them to draw 200w.\n\n\nComing on to Desktop, Again Alder Lake will consume shit load of power while barely able to compete with Zen 3 in MT while outperforming them in single thread apps. And by the way, Alder Lake competitor is Zen 3D (add 15% IPC) not Zen 3 that AMD has been selling for last 1 year or so. But yes, looks like its much more favorable environment for Intel with Alder Lake desktop CPU. They will be competitive while consuming shit ton of power.\n\nIn data center, Intel will not be competitive until 2024-2025 at the least. Zen 4 Genoa is a big leap. As long as TSMC has lead, AMD will have lead. Keep that in mind. This was not the case before. Intel had process lead even during the Athlon 64 days. And also had the power to manipulate the market. Bribing OEMs and what not. They bought time by bribing OEMS to buy power hog worse performing Pentium 4 over efficient Athlon and deprived AMD from revenue. Remember AMD had their own fabs back then that was a big drag on their business. This is not the case today.\n\nSecret sauce of AMD comeback was Infinity fabric. Intel even after more than 4 years of Zen launch failed to come up with infinity fabric competitor. Sapphire rapids sure will have tiles but they are too big and architecture wise similar to first Generation of Zen Epyc Naples.\n\nFoundry business: Lets see how Intels IDM 2.0 foundry business formulate. Their IDM 1.0 failed miserably. For now its been all talk from Pat.\n\nThe most concerning thing for them is AMD is taking their data center market share fast (4-5 pts this year and accelerating - see AMD earning transcript and question from Vivek Arya) and other businesses have to compensate for the loss in revenue (GPU and automobile). Their GM has already taken a big hit. Its already down from mid 60s to mid 50s. And will continue to slide as their Xeons are not competitive against AMD EPYC\n\nAnd the future also looks grim for Intel by looking at the specs of Aurora super computer. It does not bode well for Sapphire Rapids and Xe GPUs. Aurora will be 1 exaflop super computer while AMDs Frontier will be ~1.5 exaflop but look at the power consumption. Aurora will consume twice the power (60MW vs 30MW of Frontier). Massacre. Not even close.\n\nGood luck in your YOLO.

You need people to quit work, a lot of people, because of the vax mandate. Then the gov puts pressure to on the Fed to stop pumping the markets so the unvaxxed former wagies go back to waging.

But buying into a bearish position on spy requires more than TA. Two months of stagnation last year led to the biggest pump so far. Commodities have basically cooled off or reset except for a few. After last october everything ripped, like everything, but consumer\u2019s didn\u2019t see the prices spike  enough to draw their attention until well into the commodities pump. Then they all started buying WY and LPX late into the cycle. I could see lumber lagging other commodities if another run happens. Inflation was the talk after commodities had cooled off, now, everyone is talking deflation because \u201cseptember is always bad\u201d and muh fundamentals will return to reality.  \n\nBears best hope is that too few follow the vax mandate so the gov asks the fed to help them kill America\u2019s savings account, and this would probably only last long enough to make people get desperate.
