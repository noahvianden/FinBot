Says now is basically an all time high, stimulus is done, winter is coming, covid-19 is still here, and science says a variant will beat the vaccines eventually.

He will take another look at the markets in late winter/early spring.  I congratulated him again and that was the end of our texts. \n\nI'm in dividend earning utilities, that honestly have not done that great.  I also don't have near the kind of gains or money to risk losing.  I know I'm not going to get rich off these stocks.  Hell I'm not even beating inflation right now.  Where I'm at in Michigan the Taco bell value menu is now $1.39...\ud83d\ude31\n\nI also know there's a significant chance there will be huge declines in the markets in the coming months.   I personally could see a 20% down day and that would just obviously shock everybody to have them close the markets early, but to me it would make perfect sense with this economy and environment that we've been living in the last two years.  The fantasy the Fed has built for America can't last forever.  But it can go on a while longer.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis got way bigger than I thought it would.  Nothing here has made me want to tell my brother to buy back in.  I myself am still going to hold on because I said before, even losing all my stock money won't be a big deal for me. \n\nIt is very clear from this post that many people will NEVER sell.  The market has selected for this trait for decades and rewarded it big time, so it should not be a surprise.  What is sad is how many people can't even imagine a situation where they should sell, because they have already decided they never will sell.  Many just assume especially over a long enough time horizon, the market will ALWAYS make them money.  I personally think this is a stupid thing to always assume, even knowing it has been true for decades for the USA.  For other nations...not so much.\n\nFinally, I want to be clear, my bro is not trying to call a top in the market.  He absolutely expects stocks to go up more.  He simply has made enough money and for himself sees this as a good time to sell to lock in the gains he has.  He does not need more stock gains, but the risk of staying in makes him nervous.   Who can argue with that?  We all know stocks take the elevator down.  And so much bad news has been shrugged off.

Generally, low prices benefit consumers. Consumers are harmed only if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock its rivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levels for a substantial time. A firm's independent decision to reduce prices to a level below its own costs does not necessarily injure competition, and, in fact, may simply reflect particularly vigorous competition. Instances of a large firm using low prices to drive smaller competitors out of the market in hopes of raising prices after they leave are rare. This strategy can only be successful if the short-run losses from pricing below cost will be made up for by much higher prices over a longer period of time after competitors leave the market. Although the FTC examines claims of predatory pricing carefully, courts, including the Supreme Court, have been skeptical of such claims.\n\nQ: The gas station down the street offers a discount program that gives members cents off every gallon purchased. I can't match those prices because they are below my costs. If I try to compete at those prices, I will go out of business. Isn't this illegal?\n\nA: Pricing below a competitor's costs occurs in many competitive markets and generally does not violate the antitrust laws. Sometimes the low-pricing firm is simply more efficient. Pricing below your own costs is also not a violation of the law unless it is part of a strategy to eliminate competitors, and when that strategy has a dangerous probability of creating a monopoly for the discounting firm so that it can raise prices far into the future and recoup its losses. In markets with a large number of sellers, such as gasoline retailing, it is unlikely that one company could price below cost long enough to drive out a significant number of rivals and attain a dominant position.\n\nUnless you can prove that Amazon simply joining a market is to 100% eliminate PayPal as a service provider, your argument holds no water.\n\nPayPal losing some or all of its business because of Amazon\u2019s services is NOT the same as Amazon purposely trying to close down PayPal.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Consumers are harmed only if below-cost pricing allows a dominant competitor to knock its rivals out of the market and then raise prices to above-market levels for a substantial time\n\nGuess you didn't read that bit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Riiiiiiiiiight\u2026 but that\u2019s not happening here.

Also HD maps are like training wheels.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a poor argument: The problem with the Bull response here is that it actually only seems to imply that Lidar could still be additionally useful, just not as useful as you may think. However, this may lead people to believe that if cheaper, Lidar could augment cameras in the future. They may think that a Waymo, with both cameras and Lidar, is superior to cameras alone. Also, some people are not clear why Lidar needs HD maps. They may think Waymo could drop the need for HD maps over time.\n\nActual response: Lidar does not provide color information and therefore is worse than cameras. It results in not being able to tell a paper bag from a dangerous obstacle. If you could actually map the camera colors to 3D location, then you wouldn\u2019t need the Lidar. Having Lidar then would actively harm because it provides no additional information at extremely high energy burn, maintenance, does not detect black cars because black absorbs lidar lasers, is expensive, is ruined by fog and rain, and can have interference from other Lidar vehicles from interfering lasers. Also Lidar point cloud data slows down the neural network processing, resulting in slower reaction time by the system. Also, Lidar requires HD maps because the lidar cannot map the road lines to 3D location because it can\u2019t see color.\n\nFUD 2: CATL and other battery makers are selling their batteries to competition.\n\nTesla Bull Misconception: Tesla makes their own batteries. Also, they make some profit from the batteries in Nevada.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a misconception: This bull response is weak because Tesla hasn\u2019t actually sold any vehicles with 4680 cells yet. Furthermore, they make some profit off Panasonic batteries, but not from LG Chem and other batteries. This provides fire for critics who claim that Tesla\u2019s today have no advantage over competition.\n\nActual Response: Tesla buys the individual battery cells (today) from third party suppliers which anyone can get. However, Tesla has unique technologies at the pack level which cannot be replicated. The battery pack handles power charge, discharge, and thermal management. With the same cells, Tesla can squeeze out far more range and power than competition. If you want to see what happens when you don\u2019t innovate at the pack level, look no further than Chevy Bolt fires.\n\nTesla FUD 3: Tesla\u2019s cutting prices. This signals weak demand.\n\nBull misconception: Tesla is just passing costs to consumers and there is no weak demand.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a misconception: That\u2019s just illogical. If Tesla can make more money per vehicle, they would raise prices.\n\nActual explanation: There is probably weak demand at that higher price (obviously, otherwise they would charge more). However, price cuts result in exponential increases in demand, not linear. Therefore, a minor price cut can drastically increase units delivered. Also, there can be pockets of weak demand occasionally, which is to be expected on the short term. What\u2019s critical is that on the long term, Tesla vehicles maintain relatively high prices and profit margins, which they historically do. Note their price increases as well.\n\nFUD 4: Tesla exports their vehicles from\nChina, showing weak demand.\n\nBull Response: No weak demand, just fulfilling deliveries.\n\nActual Explanation: Bulls mostly get it right here. There\u2019s probably a little bit of less demand factoring into lower China delivers. However, overall, Tesla would still make more money deliveries more vehicles to Chinese customers at lower prices because of lack of tariffs. The real reason Tesla takes short term lower profit margins by delivering to Europe is to have some market penetration to European customers who don\u2019t want to complain their Tesla\u2019s took 1 year to deliver. Also, by having a network effect of customers with Tesla\u2019s who had imports from China, this will hype the populace for the Berlin opening and massively increase demand for Tesla\u2019s. Once Berlin opens up, Tesla can make a small price cut in Europe and China while simultaneously skyrocketing demand.\n\nFUD 5: Tesla is just a car company.\n\nBull misconception: Tesla is not just a car company. It\u2019s an energy, insurance, Robotaxi, and AI company.\n\nWhy it\u2019s wrong (kind of): Energy is still very low revenue, and even if revenue of energy matches their car business, it\u2019s not clear (or likely to be high margin). Insurance is also just a peanut at the moment, and Robotaxi\u2019s aren\u2019t guaranteed (IMO). Tesla Bot is still too early as well. The problem with the bull argument is it makes it sound like Tesla is overvalued looking at cars alone, and Tesla Bulls are just praying for these things to evolve to fruition.\n\nActual explanation: You don\u2019t need energy, insurance, and robotaxi to justify the valuation. Even with all those at zero, Tesla as only a car company is immensely profitable because they command high margin (28% automotive margin) which is steadily increasing. Even without all those other revenue streams, if Tesla was purely a car company selling 10-20m cars / year at 30% margin with 35k ASP, the company would still be worth trillions on that alone. Even without robotaxis, a licensed FSD subscription costing 100 dollars / month is also worth trillions, even if a human driver was needed. Robotaxi, energy, insurance, and Tesla bot are just massive cherries on top, which just need more evidence before we can add them to the modelling.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": ">The real reason Tesla takes short term lower profit margins by delivering to Europe is to have some market penetration to European customers who don\u2019t want to complain their Tesla\u2019s took 1 year to deliver.

Further, they can move the supply from one part of the company to the other if demand changes. More car demand with better profit, they take from Tesla Energy.

I agree that Lidar can\u2019t do object perception, but that\u2019s because of lack of color. Object perception happens at the neural network level. For example, cameras alone without a neural network have no object perception. They just output RBG values. Perception happens at neural network level. Cameras can do this because they have color, which provides insight into the type of object being detected, while Lidar only provides the depth map. Cameras can show texture, shadows, reflections from water, etc. No amount of neural network with only Lidar scan can differentiate a paper bag or a brick. Also, Lidar data is so might higher dimension in size that passing it through a neural network blows up network size, resulting in weak object detection if they want the network to run efficiently.\n\nLidar does need HD maps to localize. HD maps allow matching Lidar scans to line up with the HD map, which comes prelabelled with lane lines. Lidar needs this because Lidar sensors alone can\u2019t detect lane lines. Cameras are only used to confirm that the the HD map lane lines can match the lane lines of the camera, reprojected from the camera POV. I agree, the only way you could dump HD maps and use lidar is if you had a vision system as good as Tesla\u2019s.\n\nNow that being said, if Lidar did not burn so much energy, was free, and didn\u2019t risk harming people through its lazers, Tesla could very slightly benefit because then the extra data could help slightly to confirm the neural network depth estimates.

Essentially, arguments that bulls commonly have difficulty responding to, and then my take on the actual correct answer.\n\nFUD: Lidar and HD Maps provide more info than cameras alone.\n\nTesla Bull Misconception: We don\u2019t need Lidar. Cameras alone are fine, and Lidar is expensive. Also HD maps are like training wheels.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a poor argument: The problem with the Bull response here is that it actually only seems to imply that Lidar could still be additionally useful, just not as useful as you may think. However, this may lead people to believe that if cheaper, Lidar could augment cameras in the future. They may think that a Waymo, with both cameras and Lidar, is superior to cameras alone. Also, some people are not clear why Lidar needs HD maps. They may think Waymo could drop the need for HD maps over time.\n\nActual response: Lidar does not provide color information and therefore is worse than cameras. It results in not being able to tell a paper bag from a dangerous obstacle. If you could actually map the camera colors to 3D location, then you wouldn\u2019t need the Lidar. Having Lidar then would actively harm because it provides no additional information at extremely high energy burn, maintenance, does not detect black cars because black absorbs lidar lasers, is expensive, is ruined by fog and rain, and can have interference from other Lidar vehicles from interfering lasers. Also Lidar point cloud data slows down the neural network processing, resulting in slower reaction time by the system. Also, Lidar requires HD maps because the lidar cannot map the road lines to 3D location because it can\u2019t see color.\n\nFUD 2: CATL and other battery makers are selling their batteries to competition.\n\nTesla Bull Misconception: Tesla makes their own batteries. Also, they make some profit from the batteries in Nevada.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a misconception: This bull response is weak because Tesla hasn\u2019t actually sold any vehicles with 4680 cells yet. Furthermore, they make some profit off Panasonic batteries, but not from LG Chem and other batteries. This provides fire for critics who claim that Tesla\u2019s today have no advantage over competition.\n\nActual Response: Tesla buys the individual battery cells (today) from third party suppliers which anyone can get. However, Tesla has unique technologies at the pack level which cannot be replicated. The battery pack handles power charge, discharge, and thermal management. With the same cells, Tesla can squeeze out far more range and power than competition. If you want to see what happens when you don\u2019t innovate at the pack level, look no further than Chevy Bolt fires.\n\nTesla FUD 3: Tesla\u2019s cutting prices. This signals weak demand.\n\nBull misconception: Tesla is just passing costs to consumers and there is no weak demand.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a misconception: That\u2019s just illogical. If Tesla can make more money per vehicle, they would raise prices.\n\nActual explanation: There is probably weak demand at that higher price (obviously, otherwise they would charge more). However, price cuts result in exponential increases in demand, not linear. Therefore, a minor price cut can drastically increase units delivered. Also, there can be pockets of weak demand occasionally, which is to be expected on the short term. What\u2019s critical is that on the long term, Tesla vehicles maintain relatively high prices and profit margins, which they historically do. Note their price increases as well.\n\nFUD 4: Tesla exports their vehicles from\nChina, showing weak demand.\n\nBull Response: No weak demand, just fulfilling deliveries.\n\nActual Explanation: Bulls mostly get it right here. There\u2019s probably a little bit of less demand factoring into lower China delivers. However, overall, Tesla would still make more money deliveries more vehicles to Chinese customers at lower prices because of lack of tariffs. The real reason Tesla takes short term lower profit margins by delivering to Europe is to have some market penetration to European customers who don\u2019t want to complain their Tesla\u2019s took 1 year to deliver. Also, by having a network effect of customers with Tesla\u2019s who had imports from China, this will hype the populace for the Berlin opening and massively increase demand for Tesla\u2019s. Once Berlin opens up, Tesla can make a small price cut in Europe and China while simultaneously skyrocketing demand.\n\nFUD 5: Tesla is just a car company.\n\nBull misconception: Tesla is not just a car company. It\u2019s an energy, insurance, Robotaxi, and AI company.\n\nWhy it\u2019s wrong (kind of): Energy is still very low revenue, and even if revenue of energy matches their car business, it\u2019s not clear (or likely to be high margin). Insurance is also just a peanut at the moment, and Robotaxi\u2019s aren\u2019t guaranteed (IMO). Tesla Bot is still too early as well. The problem with the bull argument is it makes it sound like Tesla is overvalued looking at cars alone, and Tesla Bulls are just praying for these things to evolve to fruition.\n\nActual explanation: You don\u2019t need energy, insurance, and robotaxi to justify the valuation. Even with all those at zero, Tesla as only a car company is immensely profitable because they command high margin (28% automotive margin) which is steadily increasing. Even without all those other revenue streams, if Tesla was purely a car company selling 10-20m cars / year at 30% margin with 35k ASP, the company would still be worth trillions on that alone. Even without robotaxis, a licensed FSD subscription costing 100 dollars / month is also worth trillions, even if a human driver was needed. Robotaxi, energy, insurance, and Tesla bot are just massive cherries on top, which just need more evidence before we can add them to the modelling.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "\ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\udd25 \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This market can be moved very easily, and its fully underway.\n\nThe industry has been killed by the utility companies who has been buying cheap Uranium, well guess what\u2026.that is over now.

The thing is... because the stock market is a 2 dimensional representation of a time sequence, it does have solid dynamics which can be used to inform price action on specific events. For instance, here's an example where I didn't use TA and fucked up:  \n\n\nThe other week when SPCE got grounded I got excited and bought puts right after the news, thinking it would continue to collapse. Had I done TA beforehand and not given in to FOMO, I would have saved myself a couple hundred bucks because I would have seen that the stock had already landed near the last strong support point. If I had done the TA beforehand, I would have noticed that the support point was unlikely to break in the timeframe I had selected.   \n\n\nI just got excited when I saw AAPL crashing.

The key is to know when the statistics matter and when they don't, which can be difficult.

People assume the patterns are magic, but the truth is that you have to understand how a stock trades in order to understand the chances of a pattern realizing, and that's all about whether people or computers are the dominant force, and whether the catalyst is technical or human. If someone is applying a technical argument to a human process (like a crash) without bridging a technical catalyst in (like, say, a securities packaging, rating, and hedging scheme that had significant systemic risk that wasn't accounted for based on the poor assumption that housing would be stable even if people couldn't afford it, like in 2008) that has a predictable outcome, then that TA is not valid.  \n\n\nAnd these are all sins committed in the original post.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1284911334514618}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2220258265733719}, {"body": "I like eating jumbo shrimp at my home office while looking at valid technical analysis.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I like garlic mini scrimps", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2698264420032501}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5150313377380371}, {"body": "*hands you a cigar\nMy friend, it's time to let ya in on something\nValid technical analysis is a shitpost, literally just a meme,  but that's OK, cause it works anyway", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6905410885810852}, {"body": "Valid TA just they decided to meme it and draw and alligator on it haha", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23032790422439575}, {"body": "ofc this is completely valid TA\n\nthis is financial advise", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27498823404312134}, {"body": "That crocodile looks pretty legit to me\u2026", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14634166657924652}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7164884805679321}, {"body": "Wouldnt that just further prove that TA is bullshit though.\n\nOP\u2019s entire post pre much sums up to \u201cyeah it can either go up or down\u201d\n\nNo shit sherlock.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "and thats not really TA tho, more like macro indicators... kinda", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13181644678115845}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43155577778816223}, {"body": "Wanted to upvote,...but Ima leave it at 666", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13549865782260895}, {"body": "Dude this is not bullshit but a beautifully drawn crocodile with some modern art thingy.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22203780710697174}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12758108973503113}, {"body": "Lol they\u2019re going to put this on CNBC", "score": 673, "replies": [{"body": "Then, the Cramer\u2019s ass is first on the list.", "score": 206, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)", "score": 153, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4266)", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "I love you Reddit.\n\n*punches wall*", "score": 38, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1519842892885208}, {"body": ":42ohno:", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1469135582447052}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000003576278687}, {"body": "I JUST CANT UNSEE THIS!\ud83d\ude16", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19523726403713226}, {"body": "Should I be ashamed of myself for knowing the original image this is based on?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I am a clean slate who knows not of what that image is and unfortunately curiosity is sinking in\ud83d\ude30", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Remain pure; don't try to find it.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3558511435985565}, {"body": "Clearly you don't have friends that like to send you shady links.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18822979927062988}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39255455136299133}, {"body": "Retardo Myloss?", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19086332619190216}, {"body": "We all must acknowledge our traumas", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2601534426212311}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16865096986293793}, {"body": "\ud83d\udca6 the only acceptable emoji ever", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22479046881198883}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08691408485174179}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2242182195186615}, {"body": "inverted pp tail alligator chart the najarian brothers don't know about yet.

{"title": "Affirm call earnings YOLO/DD (bull spread)", "selftext": "Affirm reports earnings tonight and is expected to report USD 226m in revenue, which would be a decrease from their Q1 revenue of USD 231m. Guidance for Q3 is expected to hit 233m. I think the expectations are lowballed and Affirm will outdo them. The price has cooled down a bit since its recent jump, and this stock has already seen a lot of volume at higher prices than it is at today.\n\n**Increasing consumer adoption**\n\nWhen Afterpay started becoming successful, Affirm started attempts to move towards being a consumer company in a similar vein, which seems to be paying off now. Their app downloads this Quarter were the best they have ever been, and much higher than in the same quarter of last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6acfw397jhm71.png?width=1615&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee1c355673cb256324d8a2ebd159b03fbf0a510e\n\n**Partners outdoing expectations**\n\nAffirm's biggest customer is Peloton who just had a mixed quarter. However hardware sales were still solid and I don't think the product recall will be taken up by too many people. Walmart and Target both just had big quarters, as well as the travel industry were travel bookings were up bigly in Q2 (although the outlook of those is a bit more mixed now with the Delta variant), Bestbuy, Figs, etc.. Referrals to Affirm's website from partners (what happens when you click on the \"Pay with Affirm\" button on e.g. Walmart's website) increased steadily since the beginning of this year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf7lxywtkhm71.png?width=1349&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c83faf99687fef4a1efc8b446181f461123a4fa\n\n**Industry trends in BNPL favoring Affirm**\n\nWith partnerships with Amazon and Shopify, Affirm is now a fixed player in ecommerce. Those companies prefer to keep the number of payment options low, so it is unlikely they will ever add more BNPL companies/loaners or replace Affirm. Affirm is now tied to 4 out of the Top 5 ecommerce companies and just launched a Canadian partnership with the 5th one (Apple). Affirm is probably the only pure play BNPL provider that can't be commoditized away. There will be some more consolidation to come for sure and I think these markets are pretty hot right now.\n\n**Positions**\n\nSince IV is quite high for my taste, I decided to go with a bull spread for this play. I'm pretty confident that numbers will be good and the stock price will at least be stable. I reach my maximum profit if Affirm is trading over 90 by expiry. Maximum profit and loss are both 24k. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulq92qy77im71.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc3fe5c68aa32c1c7ee84ca049707382bd233a39", "id": "pl14me", "created_utc": 1631204654.0, "score": 190, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 263, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|186|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pl14me/affirm_call_earnings_yolodd_bull_spread/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3bw0u/do_not_fomo_into_wish_next_quarter_will_be/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/peieai/puts_on_zoom_zm_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pfztvg/chewy_chwy_earnings_put_yolodd_35k/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf7hnw/calls_on_pvh_earnings_tonight_pvh_maker_of_calvin/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf7kfy/calls_on_pvh_earnings_tonight_pvh_maker_of_calvin/) \n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43182995915412903}, {"body": "Congrats to everyone who played along!
