{"title": "Blown up account advice", "selftext": "I officially blew up my account, deserved for messing with AAPL on news and being way too confident. it was mostly stimmy money so could be worse.\n\nNow to stop this in the future. Does anyone have any advice for discipline in the markets? videos for me to watch to become a better trader? YouTubers to watch? YouTube playlists? Books? I want and need every single thing. this blowing my account up makes me not even want to mess with trading anymore, but I\u2019m not stopping. Any and all help is very much appreciated!\n\nEdit: Everyone is amazing! I will be sure to do my due diligence into every comment!\n\nGood news, I was so stressed that my account was wraps I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Optionstrats calculator bases off EOD value, not open. I was able to close out and still have a little over $250, if I would have held longer into today I would have made a lot of it back but my stop loss hit before it took off in value. Btw I was buying puts for the pullback, not because I am truly bearish. if I waited to buy them at close I would have printed today, even if it still lost, I would have lost WAY less (as I would have had a WAY better average). \n\nFor everyone calling me stupid. It wasn\u2019t a bad trade idea. if I just waited it would have been a 70% trade overnight, It was poor execution, terrible entry, ignorantly ignoring stop losses, and terrible position sizing. Which I guess that makes it a terrible trade, but the puts on AAPL idea, despite news was not a bad move, just poor execution. I should have won this trade, and I will in the future.

Like I said, be patient.\n\nAnd, ok, if you want to trade AAPL, here is a high probability set up... Wait for a pullback (earnings miss, maybe), allow the pullback to stop, AAPL may go sideways for a while. Then when it starts to go up, go long. \n\nIn particular, AAPL has a product announcement next Tuesday. The stock has been on a recent tear. To me, this seems like it might be a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" story. I am on alert for a possible pullback after the announcement. If there's a pullback, wait for the drop to stabilize. It will probably go sideways a bit and then start an earnings run. You go long when the up draft starts. Long calls should have Jan or longer expiry.

Been there, almost.  People joke about buying the tippy-top of a trade.  You're looking at a guy who market bought KODK with 100% of my account at $59 last summer.  Market sold out of the downhalt for the fastest $13,000 lesson ever: the market doesn't give two shits who you are, it just wants your money.\n\nI took almost a full year off trading, and I just watched.  This is probably too extreme, but I devoured everything I could.  I tried every indicator under the sun, listened to trade psychologists, paper traded everything I could until I had a system that works for me and my style.  \n\nWhile I am still trading and learning every day I have narrowed down my styles of trades considerably from when I first started.  Hopefully these can help guide you a bit:\n\n1) never risk more than 1% of my account per trade.  Only exception is on the Wheel strategy because of the nature of that strategy (i.e. \"never sell for a loss\" is kind of built into that) because there is always a way to generate some sort of income on your position be it writing covered calls against your shares or by writing more cash-secured puts to average down.  You are always \"moving\" and generating profits somehow.  \n\n2) Never, ever break your rules.  When you break your rules as a trader, you are not a trader but a gambler.  \n\n3) Breathe.  Missing a trade that coulda been sucks but missed money is better than lost money as I once heard.\n\n4) Use a stop loss. Always.  No questions asked.  Don't be that person that blows their account two, three, four [..] twenty times because they are too proud to use a SL.  If your stops keep getting tagged, they are too tight for the volatility.  You can fix that, easily.\n\n5) As best as you can try to stay away from just dumb trades that make no sense/things look like they could get ugly.  For instance, I wrote a short condor on AMC today with a short call at $53.  That close on AMC scared me a lot.  Straight up slapping the ask.  I closed the position for a $33 loss.  I didn't want to get stuck in a naked short that I couldn't close AH if it just ripped up over my strike.  I will probably regret it come Friday but I'd rather lose $33 on nerves than lose my whole account because of being stubborn.  \n\n6) Relax.  It happens to the best of them.  It sucks, but you are already on the right track by asking for help instead of just funding a new account and doing all the wrong things again.  \n\n7) That famous quote: the market can stay unreasonable longer than you can stay solvent rings true 100% of the time.  Never try to predict what is going to happen, and try to trade with the prevailing trend more often than not.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "This is some genuinely good stuff.

However, you can turn that short leg stop out (if you use one), into a profitable trade if you jam the protection strike close enough.  Here is an example I gave in another thread:\n\n\"It does have some utility if the strikes are closer together. Let's pretend the $125 is sold-to-open at $1 premium and then the OP buys-to-open a $124 put for $0.50 premium. If AAPL drops 20% (to $120) at expiry, the OP is assigned 100 shares at $125, costing them $12,500 - $100 premium received + premium paid for a net debit on the whole trade of $12,450.\n\nIf the OP has no problem holding AAPL long term, and doesn't want to take the $100 loss on the shares and exercise the $124 put, they could theoretically close out the $124 put just before expiry and use the (probably massive) profits to help offset the cost of the entry. Whatever the appreciation of the $124 put is over top of $0.50 they could, in theory, use as further reduction to their average share cost. Staying with our example, and say the $124 put goes to $5/contract when they decide to close it. The trade would then look like this:\n\nOP buys 100 shares of AAPL at $125 for $12,500\n\nThey received $100 in premium but paid $50 premium for the put giving them a net credit of $50. They now have a cost basis of $124.50.\n\nThe put profits are $450, giving them now a cost basis of $120.\n\nThe open PnL on their shares position is -$500, but they have already made $500 on this trade though from the combination of premium received and the appreciation of the put. They are now break-even on the trade as opposed to closing the trade out for a $100 loss and exercising their $124 put.\"\n\nThat was a Wheel Strategy example.  If you took the Stop Out on the short leg of say 100%, so you lose $100 because the short put when to $2 in premium, but left the long $124 put running and it went to $5 as in the above example you are now a net profitable trade:\n\n$100 credit on sell-to-open - $50 debit on buy to open = net credit of $50 (+$50 on account)\n\nYou get stopped out at $2 on and buy-to-close the $125 put = net debit on the account of $150 (-$150 on account)\n\nYou let the long $124 put run to $5 (example only) = net profit on the trade of $250 (-$150 loss + $450 gain)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35568884015083313}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4858468770980835}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7340788841247559}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6203233599662781}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4571738839149475}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7705668210983276}, {"body": "\u201cYou don\u2019t trade Apple you own it\u201d they say.

And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.\n\nMy thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?\n\n* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few\n* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and [40+ other companies.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/)\n* If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.\n* There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn't a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That's moat. Self-driving doesn't seem to have moat or network effect. It feels like self-driving is a must-have feature that eventually all car makers will add.\n* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.\n* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.\n* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla.

Competitors also have cameras with Deep Learning that identify hazards, but they use sensor fusion to combine that data with lidar and radar to get better awareness.\n\nConversely, visual systems are putting all your eggs in one basket.

The cost of doing home grown chips is crazy, when NVidia is way better at making chips for deep learning, and has much more scale and a bigger developer ecosystem to support development of the models. Like, you can go to Nvidia's website right now and find video to 3D scene models. Tesla had to spend millions to get that, and you can have it for free and run it with an off-the-shelf GPU.\n\nLike I said, they have an advantage for the next 5 years, but their small team of engineers can't compete against industry wide adoption of tools and technology. Their custom chips aren't cost competitive with what NVidia can offer right now. If you're a growth company with investors that believe you don't have any competition, it doesn't matter. Which would be big, if true.\n\nAll I'm saying is that their tools aren't THAT novel. Every self driving car on the road today has simulation systems and software that takes real world data and converts it for their simulator. The automotive industry has been doing that for 25 years, long before self driving cars were a viable concept. They're using deep learning with perception models, nothing you can't get from NVidia. Tesla's main advantage is that they're willing to put drivers' lives in the hands of experimental technology because they needed investors to stay afloat, and they had to sell this technology company angle. Without that, they're just batteries and motors in a luxury trim.\n\nYou're deluding yourself if you think Tesla's technology is more than a couple years ahead of this: [https://comma.ai/](https://comma.ai/) and that's a project with almost no funding. For $2200 you can get something like the publicly available auto-pilot Tesla has for the highway.\n\nOverall I DO like Tesla, but as an engineer that's spent some time coding and simulating these systems, I don't see their lead as a real moat. Other car companies have self-driving cars, but they have a much higher threshold to release features to the public until they're \"safe\".

Feeding more sensor data, and multiple time steps, into convolutional networks is a known practice. One of the things this guy was impressed by (mapping all the objects around the car as a grid) comes from a paper published in 2017 (Large Scale Transportation Network Speed Prediction, Ma et al). \n\nAll the other SDC companies also have simulators and data collection systems. Most of them built the simulators before they even had a vehicle. Here, you can go start developing your own SDC with this free open-source simulator: [https://carla.org/](https://carla.org/)\n\nMy main point is that with deep learning, what was novel and seemingly impossible 2 years ago, is accessible and off-the-shelf today. Look at deep fakes. The first model for that was an auto-encoder that took 2 days to train to convert from one face to one other face; and that was all it could do. Now, you have real-time StarGAN2 that can take almost any 2 faces and do a realistic deep fake, and can also swap animal faces. And it's all open source, you can download these models and do transfer learning; expect nothing different from the pure-deep learning strategy Tesla is taking. This didn't take a leap in processing power, this was accomplished by discoveries in Deep Learning.\n\nDon't get me wrong, they are good at taking research and making usable technology. I really love what they've done, but this idea they have no competition, or that this advantage lasts for more than a few years is where I really question it.

Between massive amount of engineering required to find proper NN architecture, massive amount data required to acquire and store and massive amount of compute needed to train and validate solution, very few companies can actually do that. Not to mention, it will have to pass regulatory validation before allowed to be recognized as autonomous, which is another roadblock. It will be exactly as with semiconductor manufacturing - it will be concentrated in hands of 2, maybe 3 companies.\n\n> Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and 40+ other companies.\n\nThis license will be only available if licensing company cannot manufacture it's own cars - otherwise why resign from additional income? Not to mention, licensing autonomous driving means dropping biggest margin product that will be associated with cars and handing it over to other company. That's not good for any company you want to invest in.\n\n> If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.\n\nOn contrary. If multiple companies attempt something and still fails to deliver, it is hard problem, not easy.\n\n> There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road.

It is sign that it is good use case (easy to understand, resonates with personal experiences, provides visual feedback etc.) to teach basics of computer vision and AI / ML.\nAtomic bomb is good use case to teach effects of physics - clear sequence of parameters and events, visible output, provides visual feedback on amount of released energy.

But in cases where there is a distinct lack of proof, you must rely on tangential subjective evidence.\n\nIn terms of technical factors, OBV has been consistently high since January despite the stock's volatility, suggesting that the price does not match the volume. And then there's the FTD volume. High FTD volume suggests that the shares needed to close the position are not available to borrow or buy, meaning not only are bona fide trades going unfulfilled, but any naked shorts - including bona fide sales above and beyond the available float - are also going unfulfilled. There's currently no distinction in the FTD data, so it's impossible to say with absolute certainty in either case, it is supplemental information used to form opinions about other tangential data.\n\nSpeaking of tangential data and subjective information, there's more that needs to be weighed than just the stock's specific data. Reviewing the broader market for patterns consistent with other stocks in a statistically significant manner, along with other market behaviors, has led to some very enlightening conclusions. By narrowing your pool of evidence to that which is strictly available about the stock itself is missing the forest for the trees.\n\nUltimately, while there is no absolute, definitive, concrete proof that naked short positions are still open, all the surrounding data and evidence heavily supports the theory that there are indeed open naked short positions.

Top competitors in that section, I believe averaged 70 mph.\n\nLTM promised crash testing, they passed the crash testing - They could have also promised bonfires, because they did that as well. You know who else did some crash testing? GOEV. This means little.\n\nLTM promised demos at Investor week, the demoed at Investor week - Yeah, these are betas. They were limited to a maximum speed of 40 mph... Sounds more like a joke to me.\n\nLTM promised new CEO, we got great CEO - What makes him great? He is being paid very nice, so I guessing he was one of a few people more than willing to take on the job at no personal risk. Not like he had to invest in shares of the company, instead he was granted shares. Elon Musk, personally risked between SpaceX and Tesla just about every penny he had.

They are the [pick & shovel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pick-and-shovel-play.asp) play of a rapidly growing sports gambling segment ([gambling record $44bn in revenue 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/willyakowicz/2021/08/10/us-gambling-revenue-to--break-44-billion-record-in-2021/)). They have 4 competitors (large moat) but only Sportradar offers any real competition. GENI has deals with NASCAR, MLB, NBA, NCAA and the English Premier League amongst others. They are also the [official data partner of the NFL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/nfl-agrees-to-data-rights-deal-with-genius-sports.html) holding exclusive rights; dump truck sized moat.

Their primary claim is that Genius is a \u201cmiddleman\u201d with an \u201cinferior business model\u201d saying the stock could fall 60% to 80%, so a PT of $3.25 to $6.50. Well first off Spruce, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/uk0m1vhlxbm71.gif\n\nWith that being said, Spruce is so so so wrong.  Given Spruce\u2019s history of abject failure I would go further and say this report is baseless FUD. So, why would Spruce put itself in the path of a runaway train like Jenaay? Seems crazy tbh. Welp they\u2019re known as a [\u201cSmash & Grab\u201d short seller,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-jolts-activist-short-hedge-funds-into-adapt-or-die-mode) so these guys give friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public, profiting from the panic.  Spruce\u2019s hit piece was released Aug 5th, the stock rose the entire day and it\u2019s been in a legit uptrend since then, no panic lol. If this is Spruce\u2019y bois M.O. they just fukd their company and their friends with another horrible call. [It seems like Sprucey\u2019s gone into hiding, hoping this all blows over. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/enqy9vfmxbm71.gif\n\nNow it\u2019s Cathie Wood\u2019s/Ark Capital turn to polish off Spruce\u2019s beautiful thighs.

More importantly however, is this rising floor Cathie is building into the stock price. She is known for having strong convictions and sticking to them. She\u2019ll buy the triple layered guacamole sized dip & take the ride.\n\n[But don\u2019t take my word for it. Check out this big, green, dildo. Cathie, you bad.](https://cathiesark.com/arkw/trends)\n\nIf you need any more proof, let\u2019s take a look at the near-100%-of-float institution rate. It\u2019s almost as if GENI has an unconscionably small float that\u2019s being aggressively bought by diamond handz Cathie while the MM buys remaining float shares to hedge calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qtw0aerxbm71.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b125abc619b0d2f3f96966ac63eff445603328cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ipnyrecsxbm71.gif\n\n# Part 2: Fundamentals\n\nGENI is the backbone/infrastructure play on sports betting since they supply the  data that major gambling companies use.  GENI offers a suite of four products:\n\n* **GeniusLive**: this is a vertically integrated video service that allows teams or sports leagues to launch something like NBA League Pass. So the platform supports payments, live statistics, advertising, live streaming, and video on-demand, without having to buy a bunch of extra software/hardware.\n* **Sporttech:** Data capture, management and analysis tools that help leagues run their sport, unlock new revenue streams, and protect the integrity of their competitions. This is essentially the shit that has turned Facebook from some site used to scam on girls in  college into a company with revenues of over $10B a year. GENI collects all the data from degenerate bets, and provides the information gathered from them to their partners for future use.\n* **Sportsbook:** GENI provides the capability (but not requirement) to build out an entire sportsbook platform for their partners.  This provides all the benefits of having a sportsbook with none of the risk of spending capital on a field GENI partners are unfamiliar with.\n* **Media & Engagement:**  GENI has the platform capabilities to allow their partners sports betting experience to enter into the world of social media.  You can chat in real time with other sports betters and complain that Nick Chubb stepped out at the 1 yard line and completely boned your 3 bet parlay. Through this platform GENI can leverage their fan engagement capabilities to drive advertising revenue and also promote future bets that may be to your liking based on your prior activity.\n\nAs  mentioned Genie\u2019s only real competition in this space is Sportradar, but Sportradar\u2019s [SPAC merger fell through](https://www.casino.org/news/sportradar-filed-for-a-highly-anticipated-ipo-on-tuesday/) after GENI swooped the exclusive rights to the NFL from under them -- ya know, the ole\u2019 Bulgarian ambush perfected by Vlad.\n\nThe NFL deal is pretty significant so let\u2019s dive into it:\n\n* **Expensive af**: Genius will [pay the NFL $120 million a year over six years](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/), with half paid in warrants making the [NFL own roughly 5% of GENI](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nfl-stake-genius-nearly-15-215504358.html).\n* **Locked in profit**:  Sportradar was pulling in 1.5% to 2% of in-play gross gaming revenue (GGR) on NFL wagers \\[[source](https://sportshandle.com/sportradar-genius-nfl-data/)\\].  Genius decided to go the opposite route by jacking up rates; asking for around 4% of operators\u2019 pre-match NFL betting revenues and 6% of in-play \\[[source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)\\]. Operators are big mad about this:\n\n>*\"They don\u2019t really have anything new,\u201d said another operator exec. \u201cThey are charging 4x for the same dataset.\u201d*\n\nThese guys are forced to use Genie\u2019s official NFL Data either because they are official partners of the NFL (FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesar), state regulations require use of official data, or the TV networks force them to subscribe to Genie data to advertise.  As of now, [DraftKings has already partnered with GENI in a multi year deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/draftkings-partners-with-genius-sports-for-sports-betting.html?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_content=Main&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1628161383), PointsBet, WynnBet, BetMGM, Caesars, and Fox Bet have also signed deals w/ Genius ([NFL names Fox Bet, PointsBet, BetMGM and WynnBet as Approved Sportsbook Operators](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/12973/nfl-names-fox-bet-pointsbet-betmgm-and-wynnbet-as-approved-sportsbook-operators)).  This leaves only Fanduel as yet to be disclosed, but likely already signed with Genie. Senior operator exec\u2019s legit crying that [its a monopoly.](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/)lol. Sucks for them, great for us.\n\n* **Sticky**: The Sportradar deal was inked in 2019 and they got cucked in 2021. Sad. GENI is proactively making moves to make the deal last longer than 6yrs by hiring a good amount of NFL vets. Including [Steve Bornstein](https://www.sportico.com/personalities/executives/2021/genius-sports-steve-bornstein-1234637226/), he now leads GENI\u2019s US business. Mans spent a decade at the NFL managing the media strategy, and spent multiple decades at ESPN and ABC.  He also was the CEO of ESPN for a cool min.\n* **NFL shills for GENI**:  This cannot be reinforced enough: the NFL\u2019s chief concern is the integrity of the data provided, and they are entrusting GENI, and ONLY GENI, with that.  They will also force anyone who wants to do business with the NFL to adhere to the NFL\u2019s core integrity policies by [agreeing to license all Official League Data from GENI](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-announces-agreements-with-four-approved-sportsbook-operators)\n\nTo put this in simpler terms: the NFL is telling the world -if you want us, you\u2019re gettin\u2019 some GENI.   GENI also issued warrants to the NFL (5% stake in GENI)  meaning when GENI is successful the NFL is successful so they are locked in and incentivized to push GENI to anyone who wants to work with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/l3e1xpncxbm71.gif\n\nThe reason I\u2019m bullish on Genie and jacked with shares/options other than the regular \u201c*it could squeeeeez*e\u201d play which I know, love, and bang the shit out of, and will explain this angle later, is because Genie secured the NFL deal at the perfect time. So, 3 yrs ago the supreme court overturned the ban on sports betting. The NFL has responded by moving its business model towards generating significant amts of revenue through betting. Sucks for Sporttrader, since for most of the time they held the  exclusive rights to NFL data, the [NFL actually considered gambling to be threat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)**\ud83d\ude31**, what a bad position to be in going into the gambling golden age.\n\nThe NFL expects to make $270m in revenue from sports-betting this yr, and  NFL execs are super bullish about their future sports betting revenue, here\u2019s a quote from one:\n\n>*You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade.\\[*[*source*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)*\\]*\n\nThe ideal sports-gambling legislation, the NFL concluded, would include substantive licensing requirements creating clear and transparent markets that protect consumers. Bets needed to be resolved using the league\u2019s official data (GENI!! - fuck you, pay me.)\\[[source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/08/25/nfl-sports-betting/)\\]\n\n***So, when I invest I try to think of analogies that speak to me. This lets me invest in a more  logical and clear headed way. I compare this situation to the girl that sat next to you pre-OnlyFans. She used to eat ramen for lunch. A couple years later she has a poodle, a G Wagon, and goes by \u201cCyrstal like the champagne\u201d instead of Bernice. Yah, she twerking on cam because she found a money printer, the NFL will twerk to online-betting.  Analogy.***\n\n*The whole industry will be twerking.*\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s a month before she started yolo\u2019n on Jenaaay estimated x10 increase in domestic sports betting handle (the amount of money wagered by bettors is called \u201chandle\u201d), to $180 billion by 2025 , with revenue\u2019s for the sector projected to sky at a 31% CAGR.\n\nOne reason for this bullish prediction is the New Jersey example; since NJ legalized online sports betting mid-2018, they've seen online handle moon to $15 billion, 1/2 of this took place in 2020. (*Don\u2019t know why people would yolo on sports and* [*not options*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pg9jpn/why_doesnt_everyone_only_trade_options_0_dte_spy/)*, but to each their own lulz*).\n\nSportsbetting is picking up so much steam, ESPN keeps their own tracker for up to date info on which states are going to let you yolo rent $ on Appalachian State vs Syracuse:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g68ri70exbm71.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=95e3af4ca366eb8d64ba23ac0f970d51bdac69b8\n\nThere are only 3 states (Utah, Idaho, and Wisconsin - which btw if you live in any of these places - move the fuck out) that do not currently allow for sports betting and/or are in the process of allowing it.  Ground floor opportunity here.\n\n[Earlier this month, Wyoming Awarded Genius Sports Inaugural Sports Betting License - upping the number of states GENI can operate in to 15. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wyoming-awards-genius-sports-inaugural-213000130.html)\n\nSo clearly Jenaayy is a growth stock but let\u2019s look at the fundamentals & also how Genie compares to the competition. (Genie, Jenaayy, GENI, Genius \u2026 lol sorry I\u2019m  dislexic). Ya so  Sportradar (Genie\u2019s rival)  is slated to go public this year and will likely trade in the $10-12B valuation range \\[[article/source](https://www.sportico.com/business/finance/2021/sportradar-ten-billion-valuation-1234623092/)\\].\n\nSportradar filed its S-1 a few weeks ago which provides historical financial performance.  Making some simple assumptions on continued revenue growth (based on historic CAGR) we can figure out Sportradar\u2019s valuation multiples which we\u2019ll compare to Jenaayyy\u2019s.  I\u2019m also throwing in Draftkings in the comparison as a high growth (but unprofitable), pure play sportsbook leader.  You can see below how the financials compare:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f6alqkfxbm71.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c25a5c75f0ca5b4498d9883053284138e273ec7\n\nI would argue Genie and Sportradar should trade at a premium to Draftkings as they have an effective duopoly on the sports betting data market.  Draftkings\u2019 sports book market is getting more competition from new players, which is causing customer acquisition costs to skyrocket.  HOWEVER, as more of these players enter the market, they\u2019ll have to buy all their official sports data from Jenaayy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fk2cxfmgxbm71.gif\n\nLet\u2019s get serious for a sec,, below is a valuation comparison and as you can see Genie trades at a discount to DKNG and at a premium to Sportradar\u2019s expected IPO pricing valuation of $26-29 or $7.4B - $8.2B. It\u2019s expected that Sportradar will trade in the $10B - $12B range once it starts trading.  Genie should probs trade at a premium to Sportradar valuation given the enormous potential of its exclusive NFL deal over the coming years. Vauling Genie at a premium would imply a conservaitve estimate of $25 to $30 price per share based on the company\u2019s CURRENT projections..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f75x253ixbm71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a6d0efe77944fcd133102ba7e3424f6b93b026\n\nGenie reported Q2 earnings on 9/8 which beat estimates.  Revenue was $55.8M and EBITDA $5.2M vs. street estimates of revenue $53.8M and EBITDA $1.7M.  Genie tightened its FY2022E guidance to $250M-$260M of revenue (which was increased in Q1 from $190M) and EBITDA of $10M-$20M.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for i though, Wall Street analysts agree with their Price Targets:\n\n* Benchmark BUY $33 PT\n* Oppenheimer BUY $32 PT\n* Goldman Sachs BUY $31 PT\n* Craig Hallum BUY $30 PT\n* Needham BUY $28 PT\n* Singular Research BUY $28 PT\n\nThese 12-month price targets equate to an average $30.33 or 43 % upside from the current stock price.\n\nSome other data points:\n\n* GENI is in a $330M net cash position\n* Does it pay a dividend? Of course not\n* Free cash flow is absolutely atrocious - the company is in reinvest and GROWTH mode\n* Holy fuck is price to sales looks steep based on 2020A at 27.9x, but gets cut in half by 2022E at 12.3x due to massive growth\n* Positive seasonality outlook, very volatile but shows recently strong performance\n* Sales forecast looks great, with a forecasted growth of 126% from 2020 to 2022\n* First quarter group revenues of 52% year-over year\n* First quarter group adj.

Other redditors have come up with extensions of the general idea. I\u2019m going to do a breakdown of similar data from past analysis, including FTD rates and float comparisons, institutional ownership and recalculation of all this data (differs from online).\n\nAs of now, the outstanding shares listed on Yahoo and sites such as [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/geni/statistics/) is 191.51M shares. \\[However, the float varies, with Yahoo listing it as 63.36M and other sites listing it as 58.66M.\\]\n\n\\*\\*The current float can be calculated as follows:\\*\\*SPAC IPO:    27.6M shares\n\nUnlocked PIPE:   33M shares\n\nFollow-On Offering:   22M shares\n\n**Total tradable float:**   **82.6M shares**\n\n**Lock up:**\n\nManagement (34.9M shares / 18% ownership) lockup expires on 11/17 and the SPAC Sponsor lockup (6.825M shares / 3.5% ownership) lockup expires on 10/17.  Apax, the private equity owner of Genius (60.2M shares / 30.9% ownership) lockup will expire on 10/17.

Lets see.**\n\n**Begin Math:**\n\nGiven **191.51M shares outstanding** as the general consensus across various financial sources, we can look into the overall preferred shares and institutional buyouts across several 13F filings and aggregated data on Fintel and StockAnalysis:\n\n**Top 3 Institutional Holdings:**\n\n1. Caledonia Investments - 16,305,582 shares\n2. Fred Alger Management - 15,046,102 shares\n3. Dmy Sponsor LLC - 6,825,000 shares\n\nThese top 3 holders combined have 38176684 shares or about 19.93% of the shares outstanding.\n\nThere are 137 other funds that also own shares directly, for a total of 63694543 shares or about another 33.26% of the shares outstanding.\n\nTherefore, institutional ownership alone is around (19.93% + 33.26%) or 53.19% of shares outstanding.\n\nNext we can take a look at the insider transactions. This has a general consensus of 19.25%, indicating that a total of 72.44% of the outstanding shares are owned currently.\n\nNow lets take a look at merger deals, ETFs and ownership through mutual funds.\n\nWe can see that the top holders for Q2 of 2021 in aggregate own 17,422,176 shares or about 9.10% of shares outstanding.  \\[source fintel\\]\n\n**Our total ownership of outstanding shares becomes 81.54%.**\n\nHowever, now we need to account for any institutions holding shares through these funds and for this reason some ETFs are excluded. Fred Alger Management has 15,046,102 shares of GENI yet through the ATFV Alger\u2019s ETF, they end up owning approximately\u2026 oh wait.. Lol\u2026 approximately an equivalent of 75 shares of GENI. Okay so looking at these ETFs looks like they have negligible impact on the float.\n\n**TLDR; The float for $GENI is about 35,352,746 shares or about 18.46% of outstanding shares.**  **With 4.14M** shares shorted this means that approximately **11.7% of the float is shorted.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvse6w5vxbm71.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab367a73760c2e67324adb2459b7797512f474f7\n\nFrom the FTD angle we see that nice giant spike with the price staying stable/bleeding up.

The smart money has been betting on the price increase continuing.\n\nThe option chain: there are only monthly options, and the options chain itself is somewhat condensed to near the money strikes.

{"title": "$MVIS - Microvision is more bullish than a Lambo", "selftext": "While I know most of you smooth brains won't be able to get that reference I'm just gonna go over some quick facts.\n\nWebsite for reference [https://www.microvision.com/](https://www.microvision.com/)\n\nMVIS has many uses for it's technology but the two main verticals are Automotive Lidar & AR/VR.\n\n**Automotive Lidar -** Microvision just completed what they claim (with good reason) is their \"Best in Class\" Long Range Lidar unit. It is an actual product that they are track testing and showing off at the IAA Mobility Conference in Germany. Look at the live demo they have up vs. our competitors:\n\n* Luminars Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/c8v23x](https://streamable.com/c8v23x)\n* Continental Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/gyee85](https://streamable.com/gyee85)\n* Velodyne Lidar Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/lhtsw2](https://streamable.com/lhtsw2)\n* Microvision Live Demo: [https://streamable.com/paywxe](https://streamable.com/paywxe)\n\nAs you can see by the point cloud and refresh rate MVIS sure looks best in class. MVIS is currently on the path of scaling for production and looking for partners.\n\nMarket Size - The global lidar market size is projected to reach **$6.77 Billion by 2026** and virtually every car company is investing/looking to utilize Lidar in the future for assisted and automated driving. It could be in every new vehicle. Luminar (LAZR) the inferior product as you can easily see by the videos above IPO'd last year with a market cap of $8.1 Billion.\n\n**AR/VR** \\- Microvision produces the MEMS Laser Beam Scanning display engine found in the Microsoft Hololens 2. It was confirmed through a tear down before and just officially via MVIS's last ASM. Also, since Microsoft produces the IVAS (rugged Hololens 2 for military use) it is highly speculated that MVIS is the engine inside that also.\n\nMarket Size - According to a comprehensive research report by Market Research Future (MRFR), \u201cGlobal AR and VR Market information By Technology, By Component, By Device Type and Vertical - Forecast till 2027\u201d the market to reach **USD 766 billion by 2025.** Also, Microsoft just won an army contract this year **worth up to $21.9 Billion.**\n\nGoogle the Hololens 2 or IVAS units to see all the cool futuristic shit they can do. I'm not gonna spoon feed you everything.\n\n**Stock Info**\n\nCurrent Market Cap = $2.24 Billion\n\n52 Week High = $28\n\n52 Week Low = $1.38\n\nEstimated Short Interest = 29.75m or 18.29% of FF\n\nQ2 2021 shares held by institutions: **42,174,027 (25.7%)**\n\n**Summary**\n\nSince Sumit Sharma took over as CEO he continues to deliver on his promise to increase shareholder value. The company is open for a buyout, strategic alternative, or going it alone with it's amazing technology. Whatever will be the best route to **INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE**. At it's current share price we are way **UNDERVALUED.** There is more DD out there on the technologies, different verticals, and how we are at an inflection point for these things to pop. Go look at the MVIS subreddit and the meta thread there of DD I can't link.\n\n**Edit -** Thanks for all the internet points you POS I'm gonna take a screenshot and hang this on my fridge. Seriously though this was just a quick bullish summary I put together, there's way more going on if you're interested all the info is on the line and with some in the comments.", "id": "pkhgdk", "created_utc": 1631129368.0, "score": 520, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 188, "comments": [{"body": "Holding 40k shares.", "score": 79, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1321830451488495}, {"body": "only a genius would hold microvision", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "Why yes, that would be me (these bags are heavy af)", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11612151563167572}, {"body": "Ok I won't buy then I guess", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20766915380954742}, {"body": "I downvoted cuz u had 70 upvotes", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13613435626029968}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.317409485578537}, {"body": "Added 200 more", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Added all I could afford and lowered my avg... today was a good day", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5566815137863159}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.010358023457229137}, {"body": "ALL IN", "score": 60, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19056379795074463}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "\ud83d\ude02 was waiting for you to do it...even upvoted your comment", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14029909670352936}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08348334580659866}, {"body": "No Competition.
