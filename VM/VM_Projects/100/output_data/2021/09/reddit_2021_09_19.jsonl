{"title": "My Coinbase analysis", "selftext": "# Should I Buy Coinbase Highlights\n\nCoinbase was one of the most highly anticipated IPO\u2019s on the NASDAQ in 2021. The company has over $180billion of assets on the platform and over 68 million users worldwide.\n\n**About**\n\nCoinbase is one of the go-to platforms for people wanting to invest in crypto the easy way. Coinbase was one of the first platforms to make cryptocurrencies easy for people to buy and sell.\n\nThe previous method prior to Coinbase involved terminal commands and remembering lengthy codes. A slide from one of the companies pitch decks illustrates this perfectly.\n\n**Coinbase Stock Price**\n\nCoinbase is listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol COIN (COIN:NASDAQ) and currently trades on a market capitalisation of US$51.26 billion with a stock price of $243.\n\n**Coinbase IPO Price**\n\n* **What was the Coinbase IPO Price?** Coinbase completed its direct listing on the NASDAQ with a reference price of $250 when it IPO\u2019d back in April 2021.\n* **What date did coinbase IPO?** Coinbase IPO\u2019d on April 14 opening at $381 before briefly topping $400.\u00a0\n\n**Coinbase Latest Financial Report**\n\nThe group in the quarter generated over $2.0 billion in net revenue, including $1.9 billion in transaction revenue and over $100million in subscription and services-based revenue. Net income for the quarter was $1.6 billion and Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion.\n\n>**As volatility and crypto asset prices are highly correlated with trading**  \n**revenue, the crypto market environment heavily influenced our Q2 financial results.**  \n*Coinbase Q2 FY21 Report*\n\nThe above quote from the group seems to indicate that a period of volatility also means that trading volumes will be higher, it is assumed that the group means both highs and lows in the underlying crypto\u2019s encourage users to trade more often.\n\nIn the groups, 2Q21 report to the market Coinbase points out that As of March 31, 2021, Assets on Platform totalled $223 billion, representing 11.3% of the total market capitalization of crypto assets.\n\nAs the industry develops over time, we expect this to increase as Institutional companies will start committing more of their funds into crypto. We are only really at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to institutional participation in crypto. \u00a0\n\n**Coinbase Income Statement 2Q21**\n\nCoinbase has increased its key metrics from revenue, gross profit and net income across the board since releasing its first set of quarterly results in June 2020.\n\nThe AGR on Coinbase Income is over 4000% since their first set of quarterlies, whilst we can\u2019t see this continuing we see no reason why income cannot grow at large double-digit multiples until at least 2023.\n\n**Is Coinbase Reliant on Bitcoin?**\n\nIn group financial reports the dependence on trading volume in relation to Bitcoin has decreased over time with trading volume in other crypto-assets now higher than Bitcoin. Interestingly Ethereum Trading volumes as of 2Q21 have now also outstripped BTC, this is potentially due to the higher volatility of the crypto.\n\n**Coinbase Fundamentals**\n\n* **PE ratio (TTM):** 17.91\n* **Price to Book (PB):** 13.80\n* **Price to Sales:** 10.4x\n* **PEG Ratio:** 0.99x\n* **EPS (TTM):** 13.58\n\nThe company has a PE ratio of 17.91x and a price to sales ratio of 10.4x. The PE ratio of 17.91 sits below the average NASDAQ PE Ratio which is currently around 28x, the group P/S ratio, however, sits above the NASDAQ Average of \\~5x\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\nSquare and PayPal currently trade on P/E ratio\u2019s of 249x and 67x respectively. COIN stock for comparison is trading on a P/E of 17.91x. Coinbase Stock is also trading at a similar P/S ratio, however, generating significantly more EPS than SQ or PYPL.\n\n**Coinbase Stock Competitors**\n\nCoinbase has a number of competitors internationally:\n\n* Binance\n* Robinhood\n* Blockchain\n* Bitrex\n* Bitfinex\n\nCoinbase has no publicly listed competitors in which to compare their valuations other than Robinhood (however these companies are also generating revenues in significantly different ways).\n\nInterestingly enough, although Binance is not a publically listed company we can obtain data through the companies \u2018burning\u2019 of their BNB token.\n\nOutlined in the original Binance Coin whitepaper, the company pledged to burn BNB tokens equal to 20% of its quarterly profits. With BNB tokens valued at $390 million burned this quarter, Binance should have made close to $2 billion in profit since April.\n\nWe see an advantage in COIN Stock being the only publicly listed company on the list with a focus directly on crypto. Our reasoning for this is around institutional and high net wealth individuals and the perception of trust in the company.\n\nWe see as more and more institutions look to invest in the crypto-economy they will seek stability and trust in whom they are conducting business with, as COIN Stock is publicly listed we believe this creates a higher perception of trust.\n\n**Should I Buy Coin Stock \u2013 Key Business Risks**\n\n1. Coinbase may not be able to trade every asset on our centralized exchange for regulatory reasons\n2. Erosion of the companies transaction revenue due to increased competition\n3. Declining interest in crypto-economy, however the reverse is also COIN Stocks key upsides.\n4. Hacking of the system\n\n**Key Upside Opportunities**\n\n* Increased growth of the crypto-economy as a whole (think of Google in the 2000\u2019s, as the internet grew, so did google)\n* Subscription based revenues to continue growing at large rates\n* Release of NFT platform on Coinbase (Potentially buying OpenSea)\n* International Expansion into Japan and Germany (Flagged in Q2FY21)\n* Increased traction of Coinbase USDC (StableCoin)\n\n**Ownership Structure**\n\nCoinbase stock is owned predominantly by the General public at 40.9% with individual insiders and institutions taking up the next largest slices of the structure at 23.6% and 22.5% respectively.\n\nCEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong is the largest individual holder in COIN stock with 17.12% of the float. Co-Founder Fredrick Ehrsam also continues to hold large portions of Stock. Other notable holders include **ARK Invest** and the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe only real negative we hear around the investment community is the risk of new participants into the space, however, we believe Coinbase is potentially 5-years ahead of any competition based on the below:\n\n1. Coinbase Cloud, allowing devs and users to intergrate and develop platform ontop of COIN\u2019s ecosystem and hooking directly into the platforms API\u2019s\n2. The trust of Institutions in Coinbase, as more and more institutions seek exposure to crypto assets, they will typically rely on the most trusted solution.\n3. As the only publicaly listed crypto company of this nature we believe institutions will be attracted to the perceived \u2018security\u2019 of COIN Stock over other competitors\n\nCoinbase Stock has continued to generate significant growth in revenues and earnings over the past 8 quarters, with a significant turning point in the last year. We believe Coinbase Stock will continue to surprise the upside and see the potential for significant growth from institutional demand in the crypto-economy in the near term.\n\nCOIN Stock has spent over 7 years developing systems and overcoming challenges that the company now plans to commercialize through the use of the Coinbase Cloud Platform. We see this move as the Amazon of the crypto world and will provide the tools required for other companies to build products on top of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know your thoughts and if ive missed soemthing", "id": "pqyjww", "created_utc": 1632014267.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "I just don\u2019t see how coinbase stock could be a better investment than just buying bitcoin itself.

The one thing that I've noticed, is that the stock can trade in a pretty wild range compared to similarly priced stocks (not market cap but just share price). The daily spread of the stock is quite large, and therefore, it's actually a somewhat decent daytrading opportunity. It also tends to gap up or down every single morning to some degree. Jumping into COIN a few minutes before close can be nicely profitable, because you can often get a gap up the next morning, of course, it can easily swing the other way as well.\n\nOne strategy I was thinking of employing with COIN because of it's continued volatility, is to basically merge both a daytrading and longterm investing strategy with the stock. Combining daytrading, swing trading as well as long term holding. How does this work? Well, basically you daytrade or swing trade as you normally would, but you simply don't worry about taking any losses.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you convert to a longterm investor if you're down in the stock. Now...   Certainly you'd only want to do this type of thing, if you're really willing to \"ride or die\" with Coinbase long term. So, if you feel like you'd be perfectly fine owning Coinbase stock for the next 5 years, why not take full and total advantage of all the daily and weekly volatility? You can buy and sell, over and over again. Will the stock ever drop dramatically hurting you in the process? Yes. So...  if you don't like seeing paper losses piling up, then maybe this isn't the stock for you.\n\nHowever, my counter is that the stock dropping in price isn't actually the most dangerous thing that could happen. The 52 week low is $208. If it drops anywhere near that, it's a tremendous buying opportunity, so in my opinion, harsh drops should be welcomed as accumulation opportunities, or a chance to lower cost basis. Or both.\n\nThe real danger, is that you happen to jump out of the stock, and the moment you jump out, it goes on a tremendous explosive run, and you feel like you just can't get back into the stock. Then, it moves into an entirely new trading range, never to see the 220's, 230's, and 240's ever again.

If you think what I have said so far is too risky and is not diversified enough, then  you should buy as many shares of FORD common stock as you are comfortable with, paying all cash, and put the shares away for two years.  If you can handle a little more risk, buy maybe 700K of FORD common in a margin account putting up the 400K. For me, and I would never recomend this strategy to anyone else,  I would buy FORD January 2023 Calls, 15.0 strike price,  and write covered calls against that position for two years, taking the premiums and buying more calls going out as new options became available, staying deep in the money. I would spend the next two years studying maybe 100 stocks, and putting together a \"life plan\", and make the next step in about three years depending upon where the country is economically and politically,  and what your personal situation is then.  I would also read books about compound interest and watch YouTube videos by Cathie Woods.  I personally would never invest in a lot of stocks she does, but having said that, I like the way she thinks, and her approach.  For instance,  Tesla is her largest holding.

{"title": "Evergrande FUD, What the China property market really looks like, what the CCP does, and why it will be a NON issue in general", "selftext": "From [r/baba](www.reddit.com/r/baba):\n\nThere are ~30 *major* China property companies. Guangzhou R&F has the most leverage. Actually, of the China government's 3 \"red lines\", G R&F is the worst off. \n\nThese are the CCP's policies. Evergrande can *still* increase debt by +5%\n\nHow did Evergrande get into this position? Due to my former life as a equities PM, I've been investing in China property for 13 years. \n\nEvergrande diversified into non-core businesses, like healthcare, water, sports, tech. They've had the among the higest debt for *many* years.\n\nWhy is it being singled out by the media now?\nBecause while Guangzhou R&F, Greentown have higher debt, Evergrande's margins and profits are worst.\n\nAlso profits have fallen off the cliff  at -$1.2bn losses 1H'21. (vs -3% year-on-year growth estimated for the sector)\n\nWhat happened in the past to high leverage property companies? They were quietly \"faded out\" to a non-event\n\n1) Anbang - $310 bn assets including Waldorf Astoria (NY). Failed restructuring. China government seized control. $5bn valuation at the firesale, vs #Evergrande $4 bn now\n\n2) HNA - purchased prized property assets in debt fueled growth,including investing in Hilton & as the top investor of Deutsche Bank. $200bn debt it couldn't pay. Chairmain Founder 'fell' and died on holiday\n\n3) Dalian Wanda - China's largest mall developer, bought Atletico Madrid & AMC. $6bn debt due 2020. Tycoon (former richest Asian) lost -$32bn salvaging the company\n\nMoral of the story? Nothing dramatic happens. These companies get \"managed\".\n\nIn China, the largest banks are State Owned Enterprises. These issues are gradually resolved with moralsuasion or a phone call from the CCP.\n\nIn the West, the government doesn't have these \"one phonecall\" tools. This is what Western media doesn't grasp.\n\nThe CCP is extremely smart and will do anything to ensures social and financial stability.\n\nCredit Market impact: As in the past, the CCP will \"manage\" the deleveraging process. Just like the media FUD on Anbang, HNA, Dalian Wanda -- likely no shock waves are going to happen in China's credit markets.\n\nFinal comment: I spoke to 2 Bloomberg reporters last week. Their bonu$ was dependent on how much their stories could impact a company's stock price. \n\nSo don't believe everything you read.\n\n[Original tweet source](https://twitter.com/asiahodl/status/1439523847305302017?s=20)", "id": "pres5t", "created_utc": 1632080104.0, "score": 168, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|303|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=pres5t)||", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35548457503318787}, {"body": "There are some major difference here between Evergrande and Anbang. \n- Anbang bought up a bunch of valuable companies from all around the world that actually made money.
