{"title": "5 Stocks for the rest of your life", "selftext": "If you had to pick only 5 stocks to trade for the rest of your life based in what you know now, what would they be?\nMeaning you can only buy and sell those only.\n\nNo Index funds, no ETFs, no mutual funds. Single stocks only.\n\nMine are:\n\nMSFT- My favorite tech stock by far. In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Balmer, management is on point. (Edited for spelling)\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds. And only about 25% of my portfolio is in blue chips. But thought it'd be fun to see what people choose and they're reasoning.", "id": "puk10y", "created_utc": 1632490906.0, "score": 124, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "msft, amazon, google, apple, nvda", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "I really hope you hung to those stocks.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10988474637269974}], "tickers": ["amzn", "msft", "nvda", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Oh yes, Disney.

Not so much because they suck, but rather because they reached an evolutionary peak. Consider MagSafe, it's a far superior technology to EVERYTHING in the PC space. But once you've made the innovation, how do you improve upon it? Well, it turns out you really can't make the same gains, everything becomes marginal improvements until finally the company decides to remove innovation for the sake of change and improvement of profitability. Customers be damned.\n\nBut the customers didn't care quite enough to leave for alternatives. Quite frankly, all of the alternatives suck!\n\nConsider the iPhone. It was a breakthrough product culminating in the iPhone 4 (the best-engineered) and the iPhone 5 (pinnacle of usability compared to previous models). Later generations only improved marginally, and even that is debatable. Ultimately they became more fragile and more expensive, for not that much more improvement in terms of usability. The iPhone X was the next hotness, a return to what made the iPhone great. But that was still not enough to convince me to scrap my 5s. Are the marginal gains and inflated prices worth it? Again, the alternative is decisively worse for Apple power-users or people who have lots of Apple gear.\n\nBut alternatives are getting marginally better over time to close the gap. They aren't nearly as innovative in the sort of real-use way that Apple was in the 90's and 00's, but they suck less than they used to. For me, nothing beats the old Macs, but I almost bought a Razer because I needed an upgrade and it hit all the right features that were non-negotiable and had a lot of things I really wanted. Ultimately I just couldn't get a guarantee that it would be functionally better than my old Mac without actually using one for myself. The touchpad being the real kicker, nothing even comes close to Apple in that regard.\n\nApple has a serious problem with innovation in general, it's not something you can crank out at industrial scale. That's just not how inspiration works. To me, Apple has nowhere to go but down because they have stagnated and can't work themselves out of that situation. They really do need something new, fresh, and exciting; world-changing technology we've never seen before. That's how they retain their edge. Otherwise they are just a dinosaur, and I'd rather throw money at Microsoft.\n\nService revenue can only last as long as you retain customers. Customers are becoming more conscious and can't or won't stay in the ecosystem indefinitely without compelling reason to do so. Competitors have everything to win and Apple has everything to lose without an edge. Apple has some edge left, I'm probably going to buy an M1, but I'm not interested in their phones or tablets or music or cars. It's just a computer company to me that happens to make laptops that are the most functional. When PC manufacturers get their shit together in the ARM space by ditching UEFI/uboot they'll thrive.\n\nThen all Apple will have left is the superior touchpad. And when that day comes and goes I'll wave goodbye to my Macbooks. I'll probably keep my Mac Pro just because it's a dual-Xeon workhorse, but eventually it'll also get replaced by some superior AMD build.\n\nThis is only a segment of their revenue stream, but it's what got them to where they are. Take that away and you can say goodbye to half their market cap. Apple is just not that impressive, and it would really cast a massive shadow to lose the computing edge. Apple products are supposed to be about function dictating form (bad form inherently implies bad functionality, fyi), not the other way around, and above all else they should be more useful and usable than the competition.

{"title": "Should you follow insider transactions? - I analyzed 4000+ insider trades and benchmarked the return against S&P 500. Here are the results!", "selftext": "There is an old saying on Wall Street.\n\n>There are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.\n\nIf you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up!\n\nIt\u2019s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO\u2019s, VP\u2019s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon?\n\nIn this week\u2019s analysis let\u2019s put this to the test. **Can you beat the market if you follow the stock purchases made by company insiders?**\n\n___\n\n**Data**\n\nThe data for this analysis was taken from **openinsider.com**\n\nit\u2019s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 \\[1\\]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.\n\n* Only transactions done by CXO\u2019s, VP\u2019s and Presidents (people who have a significant view of the company strategy and operations) are considered.\n* A minimum transaction value of 100K\n* The transaction should be purchase (Not a grant, gift, or purchase due to options expiration)\n\nThe financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.\n\n___\n\n**Analysis**\n\nFor all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months & 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&P500 over the same time period.\n\nMy hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.\n\n___\n\n **Results** \n\n**Return Comparison - Companies with Insider Buying vs SPY**\n\n|Time Period|Insider Purchase Stock Returns|S&P 500 Returns|Alpha|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1-Week|1.9%|\\-0.3%|2.1%|\n|1-Month|3.6%|2.0%|1.6%|\n|3-Months|11.3%|6.6%|4.7%|\n|6-Months|17.0%|11.9%|5.1%|\n|1-Year|39.7%|22.1%|17.6%|\n\nSurprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year.\n\nI have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.\n\n___ \n\n**Limitations to the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.\n\n* The data I collected has a lot of small-cap companies which are inherently more risky than a large-cap index like S&P500. Given our returns are not risk-adjusted, the alpha we are seeing here might just be due to the higher risk you are taking on the trades \\[2\\]\n* The analysis is limited to the last 4 years of data during which the markets were predominantly in a bull run (except the Covid-19 crash)\n* Finally, this assumes that you will buy an equal amount of stock whenever a company insider does a trade which might not be practical given our inherent biases and apprehensions\\[3\\]\n\n___\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUsually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it\u2019s time to get out of that market.\n\nThis analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information \\[4\\].\n\nYou may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing all the data used for analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cxj5FDxbCikjuS4w14PXnm2QDwIxHGaJANPjjF-R6wA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nUntil next week\u2026\n\n___  \n\n**Footnotes and Existing Research**\n\n\\[1\\] SEC Form 4 is what an insider file when he/she makes a transaction. It\u2019s expected to be filed within 2 days, but I observed more delay than that in many cases. For the purpose of this analysis, I have considered transactions that were reported no later than 10 days.\n\n\\[2\\] [Estimating the Returns to Insider Trading: A Performance-Evaluation Perspective](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/tprrestat/v_3a85_3ay_3a2003_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a453-471.htm) : The study published by Leslie A. Jeng and Richard Zeckhauser of Harvard found that insider purchases beat the market by 11.2% per year. Even after adjusting for the risk using the CAPM model, the returns beat the market by 8.5%\n\n\\[3\\] Very few people have the ability to keep their emotions away from the trades when a significant chunk of their money is at stake.\n\n\\[4\\] You can filter for the role of the insider (for eg, if you want to track only the CEO purchase/sales), industry, percentage ownership change, the current value of stock owned, etc. There are thousands of permutations in which you can do this analysis to find some alpha.\n\n\\[5\\] Multiple research papers over the last 3-4 decades \\[[eg.1](https://jbepnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_3_September_2017/5.pdf), [eg.2](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/the-insider-trading-anomaly-recent-academic-studies-591/)\\] have shown that insider purchases significantly outperformed the market", "id": "puhzzv", "created_utc": 1632483775.0, "score": 1357, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "Can we get an ETF that mirrors the insider trading?", "score": 508, "replies": [{"body": "Sure!

ADRs. There is nothing special here another than that ADRs are an instrument that allow foreign equities to be traded on US exchanges by having a issuer hold the actual shares in question. There are many ADRs and most of them aren't even Chinese. If you buy BP or RCEHY, etc which are UK listed companies on NYSE you are buying an ADR.\n\nADRs have issuers, these are large financial entities that hold the shares on behalf of the ADR owners. In BABA case this is Citibank.\n\nOk, so ADRs aren't scary at all. The thing you are really worried about but don't know the name of is VIE, or Variable Interest Entity.\n\nVIEs look scary and in the classical sense do carry some risk because they were developed explicitly to enable investment in areas the Chinese government has yet to approve (or has explicitly disallowed) foreign investment. They were first used by the Chinese telecom companies, namely China Telecom to expand their network and grow rapidly despite China banning direct foreign investment in telecommunications infrastructure. \n\nSo VIEs are definitely a gray area but there are some very important factors to take into consideration when looking at BABA in particular.\n\nFirstly the Caymans holding company isn't just some empty shell company as FUDsters would have you believe. It actually wholy owns the vast majority of the ~600+ entities that make up Alibaba, including all of it's non-China assets (Lazada, etc) and the vast majority of it's on-shore assets (Taobao, TMall, etc).\n\nHowever some parts of Alibaba's business are under investment restrictions, either due to holding sensitive licenses or IP. These portions of the business have VIE contracts with the Caymans holding company and sub-license the IP and licenses etc to the actual profit generating entities.\n\nSo in effect buy buying HK listed shares OR the NYSE ADR you have direct equity ownership in about 80% of the Alibaba entities (which account for about 99.99% of the profit) with the remaining 20% being controlled via VIE.\n\nAs for VIE legality itself there has been a lot of indications recently that VIE will either be moved out of the gray and regulated directly by Chinese authorities (see the new data security review mandate for foriegn listings) and the recent Shanghai IPO of Megvii which uses a VIE structure.\n\nSo yeah, VIE FUD is a complete nothing-burger at this point unless soemthing -very- drastically changes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Whoa.

The only thing they are ahead on by any kind of significant amount is having everything in one package. The Porsche Taycan is within spitting distance as an electric vehicle. Waymo has better actual FSD and has proven that they can actually achieve L5. Their charging network is significantly better but Elon has also made comments about opening it up to everyone. So there goes that advantage. Or are you now skeptical of what Elon says when it might hurt Teslas advantage?\n\n>Teslas are a lot cheaper than The premium brands you mentioned, the PAM is 10-100x bigger. Tesla has to spill some beans if theyre gonna want to meet demand (in regards to quality control)\n\nThe Lexus IS250 starts at $40k. The Model 3 starts at $40k. Porshce is more expensive, sure. They also have the largest margins in the industry and people shopping in the high end segment are unlikely to choose a Tesla over a Porsche.\n\n>Tesla has amazing margins in relation to their price and relative premium quality.

Go look at a detailed analysis where they split out things like regulatory credits, energy storage/leasing, etc. And yes, but Teslas don't feel premium. Lexus feels premium. Porsche feels premium. Tesla feels cheap. A lot of the plastic in them feels about like my parents Honda. Except the fit and finish isn't even as good as their Honda. Apple never would have got to the point they're at if their quality control was as bad as Teslas.\n\n>Porsche or Lexus is where with developing full self driving?\ud83d\ude02 How much data ? \ud83d\ude02 bruh.\n\nToyota has L2 out in Japan, the same level that Tesla is at. If Tesla was at L3/L4/L5 while everyone else was at L2, that would be a huge advantage. Toyota and VW also have 100x the vehicles on the road as Tesla. That means they can collect the amount of data in 1 year that Tesla can collect in 10. It's also funny that this is only an argument I hear from people who have never built a neural net, random forest, etc. Having massive amounts of data isn't some end all be all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So whats the problem with Tesla fans again?\n\nThat they overstate literally everything, are ignorant of the technology they talk about, and extremely dismissive of any flaws that people point out. Elon says something about FSD? They take it as gospel despite his prevalent history of broken promises and outright lies. Some other car company CEO says something about them developing EV or self driving? Dismiss it as a lie. I can only imagine if Toyota build an EV with the quality control issues of a Tesla. Tesla fanboys would be shitting on every little thing while not realizing that Teslas have the same problem. They'll brag about the Tesla charging network (which I can easily admit is a legitimate advantage) while then ignoring the fact the Elon has made it clear they intend to open it up to non Teslas.

Ford's Mach-E and Lightning, in particular, are finally giving Tesla real competition from the budget-minded, while Mercedes's new EV offerings will attract would-be Tesla buyers at the top of the market.\n\nD) Tesla's self-driving feature isn't as groudbreaking as it once was. Every luxury vehicle these days has some kind of semi-autonomous driving. Some are worse than Tesla's, but others are *better*, at least in some ways. And that tech is even filtering down into other automakers' less-luxurious offerings.\n\nE) Downmarket Teslas and Teslas showing up on the used market is eroding the once stellar brand image. The brand isn't quite as *aspirational* as it once was. They don't turn heads and start conversations like they used to. It's no longer the coolest greatest thing that everybody wants to have. (Don't get me wrong, they still have a *good* brand image, but it's nowhere near as stellar as it once was.) And as the premium/exclusivity factor dies down, the persistent build quality issues loom in the background as a reason to make their cars less desirable than cheaper and better-made competitors, including competitors that have had longstanding aspirational brand image, like Mercedes. (Tesla's slow-to-evolve styling also plays into this. Most people who aren't 'car guys' or Tesla nerds can't really tell the difference between a 2014 Model S and a 2021 Model S. So if you were buying it to impress people, why would you spend $90k on a new one when a $40k used one gets the same reaction from most people?)\n\nF) Tesla is starting on a trend of making choices unpopular with consumers. It started with getting rid of the gauge cluster and now has progressed to getting rid of the shift lever. For all how it's 'futuristic and minimalist' and for all that it saves production cost, a lot of consumers still want physical controls for all the car's basic functions. It's another reason to choose a traditional automaker's EV competitor rather than a Tesla, especially for the kind of consumer who isn't already fully on-board the Tesla hype train.\n\nNow, maybe their other activities like energy storage and stuff will pull them through ... but at least from the auto manufacturing side, I think Tesla has been set up for a *major* fall in the next few years, when a lot of the points I mentioned above combine into a perfect storm all at once.", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla", "bubble"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Toyota because they\u2019re too stupid to make an electric car.

The way I look at it, worst case scenario I stay at this job for life, get a full pension at 56. \n\nBest case scenario, I create capital, find a new career that doesn\u2019t require me to work 9-5, stocks go \ud83d\ude80.\n\nBut I just don\u2019t know what I want to do, and what I can do\u2026 I don\u2019t know how else to make money (other than the additional 10k annually I make by hustling to make the 80k). \n\nI could grab a second job on the weekends right now - but it would hurt my fitness, health and mental well being.

I've got a bit more than a decade on you, so here's my take:\n\n1) stay at your current job unless there's something pushing you out or something better - 80k at 23 rising to 130k is very good, if you stay there a few years that's not a bad thing.\n\n2) keep maxing your TFSA, and whatever RSP room your pension doesn't eat up\n\n3) live cheaply, don't let you expenses grow to match your income. Cars and rent/housing are the top two ways people screw this up. Eating and drinking at high end places can also get you off track at this age.\n\n4) don't get a second job - use your weekends to learn new skills, stay fit and healthy, date, and have friends. \n\n5) get fit. It only gets harder after your early 20s and will pay dividends on who you date, how you feel, and bring balance to your life.\n\n6) have as much sex as you can. Seriously - your 20s are a golden opportunity. I don't mean be reckless or be disrespectful to others, but have a bunch of different relationships and try not to get trapped in one too quickly (unless they really truly are amazing). You'll learn what you need in a relationship, how to be a better partner, and find a better match in the long run, which is absolutely key to financial, career, and emotional success in the rest of your life.\n\n7) if it were me I'd pay down the student loans.
