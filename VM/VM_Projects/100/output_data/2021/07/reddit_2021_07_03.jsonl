{"title": "I Accidentally YOLOed Half My Portfolio After Doing DD", "selftext": "tl;dr at bottom\n\nSo after using DD from [u/Criand](https://www.reddit.com/u/Criand/)'s \"The Bigger Short\" post (link in comments), I became pretty confident that there are some shady investment ~~banks~~ companies that are going to fail sooner rather than later. I wanted to find one that preferably:\n\n1. was founded after 2008\n2. had experienced insane growth in the last 10 years\n3. wasn't too big to fail\n\nand *most importantly;* most likely over-leveraged themselves using Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS)\n\nAfter sifting through investment banks, Ladder Capital seemed to be a good fit. And added bonus, the CEO, Brian Harris, has close ties to Adam Weisselberg - the Trump Campaign CFO who just got indicted for tax fraud.\n\nSo I'm ready to make my *sound* investment on Robinhood. I was looking to buy $1500\\* worth of puts on $LADR that would expire in 6 months to a year. I felt like I knew $LADR was fucked, I just didn't know when they would go under. So the more time I give myself the better.\n\n*\\*Note that this $1500 is more than half of my portfolio, took me 3 years to save up for, and I have been saving it for a long term, riskier investment.*\n\nSo anyways, any put outside the money for $LADR sells for $0.01, so I put in an order for January of 2022. At the end of the day, it expired. I realized my mistake, and created a new order, but \"good until cancelled\", and put it in after hours. The next morning,I was notified that someone had sold me +300 contracts, and I excitedly went to look at the riskiest investment I've made to date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\*notice 7\\/16](https://preview.redd.it/8pxu9wwu53971.png?width=1390&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfec9ce5cb59d65c61de9bfac5f3bd905de2b4d)\n\nMy heart sank when I saw the expiry date. So now I have two weeks for $LADR capital to dip under $10.00, otherwise I'm out of more than half of my portfolio that i've been building for 3 years. My lesson from all this? YOLOing your portfolio is actually pretty exciting.\n\ntl;dr: I put the wrong Expiry Date for a put order that I had done DD on, and essentially yeeted 3 years of my savings.\n\nEdit 1: looks like I just paid $1500 for a crash course on puts", "id": "od97ek", "created_utc": 1625356538.0, "score": 512, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 280, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|4 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Walker_C, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[https://preview.redd.it/8pxu9wwu53971.png?width=1390&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfec9ce5cb59d65c61de9bfac5f3bd905de2b4d](https://preview.redd.it/8pxu9wwu53971.png?width=1390&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfec9ce5cb59d65c61de9bfac5f3bd905de2b4d)", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "you still have a market value of 300 USD just in case you think your bet will not happen!!\n\n![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flushed)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0806339755654335}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21620450913906097}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2902519702911377}, {"body": "When the brain is smooth the whole body suffers.", "score": 107, "replies": [{"body": "can someone ELI5 OP's error?", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "Omg", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09939644485712051}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0680493637919426}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09282708913087845}, {"body": "Welcome home retard", "score": 328, "replies": [{"body": "He needs to call his homeowner insurance and see if they cover these losses since it happened at home.", "score": 139, "replies": [{"body": "Can homeless people get home insurance to recoup their losses?
