When trading options, just as when you\u2019re trading stocks, it\u2019s critical to control your emotions. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you need to have ice flowing through your veins, but fear and greed should not be the driving force in your trading decisions.\r  \nAlways have a trading plan, and always stick to your plan. And no matter what your emotions are telling you to do, don\u2019t deviate from it.\r  \n**How you can trade smarter**\r  \nPlan your exit on winning trades, and cut your losses when your trades go wrong. You should always have an exit plan, period \u2013 even when a trade is going your way. You need to choose your upside exit point, and downside exit point in advance.\r  \nBut it\u2019s important to keep in mind, with options you need more than upside and downside price targets. You also need a keen awareness of time, which is a key factor in options trading.\r  \nRemember that Options are a decaying asset. And that rate of decay accelerates as your expiration date approaches. So if you\u2019re long a call or put and the move you predicted doesn\u2019t happen within the time period expected, get out and move on to the next trade.\r  \nTime decay doesn\u2019t always have to hurt you, of course. When you sell options, you\u2019re putting time decay to work for you. In other words, you\u2019re successful if time decay erodes the option\u2019s price, and you get to keep the premium received for the sale. But keep in mind that this premium is your maximum profit, if you\u2019re short a call or put. The downside is that if you sell naked options, you are exposed to potentially substantial risk if the trade goes awry.\r  \nThe bottom line is that you must have a plan to get out of any trade, no matter what kind of strategy you\u2019re running, or whether it\u2019s a winner or a loser. Don't hang around on profitable trades because you're greedy, or stay way too long in losers because you\u2019re hoping the trade will move back in your favor. Cut your losses and move on.\r  \n**What if you get out too early and leave some upside on the table?**\r  \nThis is the classic trader\u2019s worry, and it\u2019s often used as a rationale for not sticking with an original plan.  The best goal is to try to trade consistently and make a profit. So you need to reduce your incidence of losses, so you can sleep better at night.\r  \nTrading with a plan helps you establish more successful patterns of trading, and keeps your emotions in check. Sure, trading can be exciting, but you don\u2019t trade for excitement, you trade to make a profit. So make your plan in advance, and then stick to it like super glue.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "This is all really great advice! Thank you!

Commodity anything are cyclical as they ramp up production when the expectation is that the economy will grow. This then leads to overproduction and ultimately low prices due to supply and demand. Take a look at the MU chart the past decade (or even longer) to get an idea of this. Granted, the memory industry is now an oligopoly, and some would argue we are in a multi-year up-cycle due to technological advances, so the cycles may be much more contained. \n\nI would advise looking more into the companies you listed. The fact that you list these stocks together kind of hints to me that you don't really understand them other than that they are in the semiconductor industry. I see many posts suggesting a stock because of how great their quarter and guidance are, but please remember the market is forward looking; chances are that great guidance is already priced in. \n\nIn regards to your MU, TSM comment, just realize that there's probably a reason they are lower valued. My two cents for why they aren't trading at multiples like the others are: MU - commodity products as I mentioned in the first paragraph. As such, you can't expect them to trade at a growth premium like AMD since they don't control their price. DRAM by Micron is not better than DRAM by Samsung. People pick which to buy based on price. TSM - may be accounting for the political risk of China invading Taiwan. TSM is also an independent, pure-play foundry. Their entire capacity is already being utilized so you could say their growth is capped and already priced in. For them to grow more, they would have to increase capex and build more foundries. This takes months/years to complete.\n\nTL;DR: Not saying MU, TSM can't rise more, but not for the argument you mentioned.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Memory demand still an up trend to at least mid 2023, like you said the market is forward looking, do you think Micron 90% forecasted growth next year is already priced in ?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I have no idea how much is priced in. But some things to think about: \n\n1) The memory demand uptrend you mentioned is a view widely held. So I would think that it is mostly priced in, discounted for uncertainty. If this was not a widely accepted belief, then perhaps I would not say it is that priced in. If you want to make safe investments you have to catch things before others know about it, not after. Granted, it could be that in reality the uptrend is actually even greater, in which case you would also be right in investing now.\n\n2) How sure are you of that uptrend all the way to 2023? Can anyone even be that sure? If the uptrend fails to materialize, what is the downside risk? Put simplistically, let's say that 80% of this uptrend is priced in. Yes, there may be another 20% of the uptrend that isn't priced in, but what's the downside risk? It could be pretty significant relative to the additional upside. Why chase this one stock if the risk/reward is not favorable?\n\n3) Let's just say the uptrend holds true. But as a commodity product, it's price (and indirectly its earnings) are set by supply and demand. The memory companies are not going to maintain current production levels if they are confident of that uptrend. So really you also have to consider how much supply will be increased as well. If one of the memory companies overproduce, they can completely eliminate the benefits of the demand uptrend. There is no OPEC equivalent to manage the supply to stabilize prices (not that I'm aware of, could be wrong).\n\nPlease don't take this as me saying not to invest in MU, I have not done the research.

In addition, the Endurance\u2019s brake pads and rotors are expected to last longer than those in internal combustion engine pickup trucks, due to regenerative braking from the hub motors on all  four wheels, representing another maintenance cost saving.\n\nThis design is expected to enable us to take advantage of an agreement we have entered into with GM that provides us with access to certain non-customer-facing GM parts, including airbags, steering columns and steering wheels.

{"title": "SOFI- Why now is Finally time to buy...", "selftext": "SOFI seems to have hit a bottom around $17.25 today... and with PIPE selling exhausted- is ready to move much higher. (and what little selling may occur from employees- is a drop in the ocean compared to retail buyers... considering SOFI has less than 1000 employees). \n\n\nCramer just included SoFI as 1 of the post merger SPACs to buy now. SOFI has all buy ratings from analysts- with an initial $30 price target.  SoFI also has one of the highest short float % at around 45% (which meaning many Millions of shares have to he bought to cover those short positions). \n\n\nAnd with a market cap under $14B, SOFI is extremely undervalued (consider Robinhood going public later this summer around $40B.. likely to be $60B after 1st day of trading).  Buying SOFI anywhere near current prices- will definitely be a winner going forward.... and if SOFI gets several days of sustained volume... it is very likely to have a big run/squeeze combo in the immediate future. But its a definite big winner either way.  Not to mention a 2 for 1 deal... as Galileo will be worth just as much as SOFI- and an option to spin off in the Future (similar to EBay & Paypal)\n\n\n**Summary of SOFI Becoming a Fintech Behemoth**\n\nFintech is becoming the next big disruptor- and Sofi is being positioned to be the real leader in this category (and currently- the dinosaur banks have market caps of 300B, $450B, etc). Not only is SOFI the only internet bank with the full slate of financial products...\nthey also have Galileo for the platform/\nSoftware fintech play... just look at the top quality leadership team SOFI is attracting... Anthony Noto as CEO.. CFO came from Uber... person in charge of Galileo from Google,etc.\n\n\n**Overview of Business **\n\nSoFi acquisition of Golden Pacific will make it a\nnational bank, like JPMorgan Chase. This will\nallow SOFI to take direct deposits & make\nloans based on those deposits, rather than\nacting as a re-seller.\n\nSofi also offers Credit Cards & recently\nannounced it deal to offer auto loans. Also,\ntheres SoFi brokerage, which competes with\nRobinhood.\n\nThen add to the mix, Galileo, a payments\nprocessor (ie Stripe, Square ) it bought for\n$1.2B. Galileo dominates the Banking-as-a-\nService (BaaS) ecosystem. Galileo offers\nbanking platform for over 90% of all digital\nbanks in North America. Over 70% of Top100\nFintechs globally are clients- including Chime\nand Robinhood.", "id": "of9h8o", "created_utc": 1625623701.0, "score": 1264, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 484, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|16|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|14|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obnirr/sofi_pipe_selling_has_been_exhausted_in_the_170m/) [x](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/sofi-technologies-rosenblatt-buy-initiation-price-target) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuie7f/sofi_is_primed_for_a_big_move_upinfo_of_how_sofi/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntyj57/sofi_bullish_signs_for_monday_valuation/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sold \ud83e\udd1d Best of luck to you all!", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17584443092346191}, {"body": "u/SCmoderate post those positions.

Don\u2019t think we go much lower than mid $17\u2019s, handle forming.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5VQLBkVoAkK7I6?format=jpg&name=900x900\n\n\n\n**naashonomics:** $SOFI forming a huge handle right now, but it needs to break 21 for best confirmation\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5MIS8kVkAciYWm?format=jpg&name=4096x4096\n\n\n\n**dlukose:** Sofi getting ready to move up past $25. I believe a cup and handle is being played out. Sofi needs to stay above $17.89, then it can break past $25. IMO\n\nhttps://s3.tradingview.com/s/sT7zGgmK_mid.webp\n\n\n\n**Cup and handle formations tend to lead to huge breakouts:**\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/thmb/evSyy5RpEPEKDHBzkqo-JZRmDiI=/6250x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/CupandHandleDefinition1-bbe9a2fd1e6048e380da57f40410d74a.png\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp\n\n\n\n\nALSO...\n\n\n\n\n**korinek_trades:** High probable reversal area (A=C ~17.88-17$ area)\n\nAs long as this grey box holds, stock should see another high above 25$ to complete a 5 wave structure.\n\nLooks good here!\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5ktMIhXEAMvvb3?format=jpg&name=large", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "> yesterday's low was quickly bought up and never re-visited\n\nYou can say this for basically every single day for the past week by the way.

{"title": "Why Biden's Infrastructure Plan is NOT a ticket to tendie town", "selftext": "Im an engineer, but Im also an idiot.  I literally almost flunked out cuz i was too dumb. I ended up in construction because i couldnt do anything else engineering related.  Take this opinion at your own risk because I might be talking out of my ass.  \n\nI'm in construction, specifically on the municipality side (yea im *that* city worker) so I'm the one administering the federal infrastructure funds at the ground level. To date I've administered millions in federal funds on \"infrastructure\". Infrastructure is by definition the least sexiest thing.  Everyone shits, but we'd all prefer to not deal with it, that's infrastructure.  Here are a bunch of very common sense reasons why this isnt going to cash in. \n\n* I see a lot of posts about steel, concrete and other raw materials.  Clearly these are from people who know fuck all about infrastructure.  I'd argue that if you're looking to invest into Biden's infrastructure plan you should be looking at the other end of this supply chain.  Who do you think is more profitable, the no name company that supplies the raw material for 1 component of an iphone or Apple? If youre looking to jump onto the infrastructure bandwagon, I'd be looking at construction companies or engineering firms.\n* But companies are also not a great bet. contractors and trades are specialized.  The company that paves the street is not the same one that does traffic signal upgrades.  An electrician is not going to do laborers work.  Large companies will need(either by choice or requirement) to subcontract out certain specialized portions thus diluting overall tendies. not to mention that profits are capped.  markup % is often literally defined.  \"Oh no Mr. Contractor you have a problem?  fuck you, sucks to be you\" (this is one of my favorite parts of the job). Not to mention that projects are parsed to all the states and from there into certain sizes in order to further dilute the tendies.  State and local governments may have additional requirements that even further dilute the tendies.  The government is trying boost an industry and the economy at large, not a few companies.  The literal idea of the plan is to trickle money across the country.  If you look at this fountain that slowly trickles down, if you place your cup in any one spot you're just gonna get a few drops. \n* Infrastructure means nothing because it means everything.  It could be streetlight poles in which case steel is very very relevant, or it could be a fucking sidewalk in which case steel is not important at all. If you just open your eyes when you go outside (huge ask i know) you will see that infrastructure is extremely varied. \n* Many of us with ties to the industry are feeling delays and back orders, but this is logistics related.  These issues were around before the infra plan and will remain after. I think the idea behind these \"DDs\" on raw materials is because they think this infrastructure plan will increase demand on an already limited supply thus driving prices and profits up.  Nevermind the contracting aspect of this money(a lot of it is fixed for a certain amount of time), Supply and demand still rules, but solving the global supply chain logistics will also increase supply. The supply chain logistical issues are a larger and more importantly, independent, factor.  \n* Also surprise surprise Biden's infrastructure plan, while maybe bigger, isnt special. Trump had infrastructure plans and so did Obama.  Infrastructure is ALWAYS happening.  As i said, everyone shits and it doesnt stop.  Infrastructure never stops, you can try to clench your sphincter closed and it'll work for a lil while, but eventually you shit.  Its the same thing with infrastructure spending.  Biden's plan is not the big demand surge people think it is. \n* I think a lot of people underestimate the timescale of infrastructure.  it takes time to build shit and it takes even more time to renovate shit cuz you cant just blow it up and start over. Most people cannot shit on command and those that can dont do it instantly. This aint China.  We're not gonna build a covid hospital in 48 hours( mostly cuz our work isnt made out of garbage tofu-strength concrete but that is another topic). This shit is going to take YEARS. I will see Biden infrastructure money at my level 1-2 years from now and will start spending it 3-5 years from now. Think about this, after the money is secured someone gotta design the damn thing, someone gotta the draw the picture so my dumbass who cant read can knows what is supposed to be built.  Those assholes always fuck up too and they are the smart ones!!!  This isnt even mentioning how raw material suppliers, product suppliers, construction companies, design firms, are only a part of this timescale. \n* One dude can only use 1 shovel at at time, can operate one piece of equipment at a time. The pipe maker can only make pipes so fast and those pipes can only be installed so fast.  There is no exponential factor in infrastructure like there is in tech.  An app can be downloaded millions of times in a single night. You only shit one poop at a time. \n\nTl;dr.  Infrastructure is like pooping. Everyone does it, it is always happening. Trying to cash in on infrastructure is trying to cash in on pooping. You can only poop so fast and so much, the supply demand is capped. You only shit one poop at a time.  Sure you get diarrhea sometimes but even then it has its limits. You cant cash in on analogous dry heaves. Infrastructure is regular, so in the long term investing in this industry is probably a smart move.  As long as humans are alive they are going to shit and if there are more humans tomorrow than there are today then there will be more shit, but if that is your tendie making strategy why are you even here?", "id": "ofcwca", "created_utc": 1625637222.0, "score": 317, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11923732608556747}, {"body": "So calls on porta potties?", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 tldr porta potties and dumpsters?", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5993402600288391}, {"body": "For a good time, call OP", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.397350937128067}, {"body": "Not a bad idea if there\u2019s any publicly traded port-o-stonks", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17944133281707764}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1729455292224884}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "We must construct additional porta potties", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "I actually LOLed", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05256427079439163}, {"body": "We require more natural gas.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2793119251728058}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09727925062179565}, {"body": "why would i lie about that", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Not a lot of people would, but on the internet nobody knows you're a dog.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.344586580991745}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2598904073238373}, {"body": "Lol.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27215680480003357}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.046145178377628326}, {"body": "Loading up on poop", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "Calls on poop", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "My portfolio is all poop already.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, you're long poop?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3900790512561798}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43317240476608276}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4843188226222992}, {"body": "I\u2019ve always been long on poop", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37358421087265015}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16165189445018768}, {"body": "This should be re-flaired as a shitpost.", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1315511018037796}, {"body": "This guy says essentially that if someone needs more money his favorite part of the job is to say fuck you, i need more money so I\u2019m wondering if this post is a big fuck you?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Infrastructure run by unions = no real infrastructure built; just lots of spending into unions to buy the votes from them for the next tally round.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Not sure why this was downvoted.

{"title": "Didi took $13 billion in cash from American investors and days later the Chinese government shutdown the app.", "selftext": "And, to top it off, the CCP is now discussing scrapping the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure through which foreign investors have \"invested\" in Chinese companies. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china\\_considers\\_closing\\_loophole\\_used\\_by\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/)\n\n(For a primer on the VIE structure and the risks it poses to American and other foreign investors looking to invest in China, see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets\\_getting\\_infiltrated\\_by\\_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets_getting_infiltrated_by_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3) )\n\nWonder if American and other foreign investors will \\*finally\\* get the memo with Didi here. If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company\u2019s operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K?\n\nSomeone lied. It's either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let's be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like).\n\nThis lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court).\n\nUnless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip\\_jack/gi0cl58/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/); [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla\\_gang\\_heavy\\_sigh\\_of\\_relief\\_dont\\_want\\_to\\_get/ghuxevt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/)). The risk is just not worth it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why\\_nio\\_will\\_be\\_the\\_next\\_apple\\_and\\_the\\_leader\\_of/h38v0qm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why_nio_will_be_the_next_apple_and_the_leader_of/h38v0qm/)\n\nEdit: oh, right! I forgot to mention all the widespread reverse merger scams that plagued the markets a decade ago: \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_21st-century_Chinese_reverse_mergers\n\nINB4:\n\n1. Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they've been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, \\*including\\* by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one.\n\nTell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud?\n\nThere is no reciprocity. And that's the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and \\*there is nothing you can do about it\\* (unlike foreign investors here in the US).\n\n2. Ohh, silly person, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps) . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.\n\nEdit\n\nINB4 no. 3: You and this post are racist. It\u2019s racist to point out that either the CCP or Didi is bilking investors here of all ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, this is a common wumao tactic often used on social media. They\u2019ve learned they can deflect from the CCP\u2019s misdeeds by crying any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist.\n\nEdit edit:\nHell, let\u2019s go even further! Assume I am indeed a racist (I\u2019m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of *anything* I\u2019ve said here?\n\nEdit edit edit: \n\nINB4 no. 4: You can take Chinese companies to Chinese court for securities fraud. All right. Now consider the following: A big reason for this latest Didi fiasco is, the US demanded that Chinese companies comply with typical US disclosure requirements. And this reluctance on China's part to disclose is because of the way the government has permeated the larger companies, so it refuses based on national security grounds. https://www.ft.com/content/feb85200-a7f1-4cab-bc8e-f02cd6fd0590\n\nGiven this linkage between the state and enterprise, and given the state's preoccupation with national security, an injured foreign investor likely wouldn't be able to obtain the information in discovery needed to make his case; it would all be withheld in the interests of safeguarding information related to \"national security\". The courthouse doors may as well be shut given such flimsy process. Not so here in the US, where there is no such outright permeation of the government in publicly-traded companies.\n\nEdit Edit Edit Edit: I do not have a position in Didi--have not bought or sold a single share or contract.\n\nEdit x 5.

Now my mans Zhitao He is a bitch, straight up owned by the Bank of China, in the filling it explicitly says Zhitao pledged all his shares as collateral so he wouldn\u2019t get double tapped. So that\u2019s 60.91% of the shares that we really don\u2019t have to worry about, even though we never really had to worry since lock up ends in November. Fred Chang is a boss, probably counting down the days when he can sell his shares, travel to Tulum, and start drinking soy milk latte\u2019s, do ketamine, and  meditate and be zen while sporting his Jesus robe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8313lpmzt971.jpg?width=794&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65cb39022acd9cb74d657c77dcdd30e082bd84c5\n\n# What about the squeeze\n\nSo we have verified that the float is between \\[2,729,755, 3,465,683\\], which is the smallest number I\u2019ve actually ever seen for a company. How squeezy is it? Well I came across this company doing a completely different analysis. I was interested in failure-to-deliver data that the SEC provides and what it could tell me. You see recently there have been alot of seemingly random stocks popping. Me and some others share the opinion that it\u2019s due to NSCC-2021-002 being implemented a couple weeks ago, and rule DTCC-2021-005  being implemented a couple months ago. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/user/jn_ku/comments/m4fnfg/gamestop_moass_no_tinfoil_hat_required/) to see it\u2019s significance for all the meme\u2019s we know and love. So I got all the FTD data from the SEC from 08/2020 - 06/2021 (1st half of June) from the [SEC\u2019s website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), and calculated FTD/Float for all the meme stocks we know and love, and some rando stocks that popped recently as well. For $NEGG I calculated the float to be the midpoint of average of the two number, 3m.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[i meant 6\\/15\\/2021  whoops](https://preview.redd.it/vypk6jmnzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d2574130393469dc40d032dbd92d62d9aff4ef0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[i meant 6\\/15\\/2021  whoops](https://preview.redd.it/a6mvd6nnzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6ede5517207f88c05781718371d6ec37428b6a6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI gave the outliers colors, and all the other stocks grey scale. So yup your hunch is correct shit has become more volatile after cooling down a bit after the GME squeeze. Outliers usually are the most volatile stocks, GME/AMC  ftd data was screaming \u201clook at me\u201d before the actual pop in shortly after. $NEGG is screaming the same thing right now.\n\nLet\u2019s consider Ortex data and its relation to FTDs. Ortex doesn\u2019t have a API and if it did I don\u2019t have time to look at it so I\u2019m doing a spot check. So let\u2019s pick a random stock say $SENS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnrmnlyozt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4babb5f83a72ccdb9fcf1470c7beb0b6090f8d04\n\nThe average loan age hit one of it\u2019s peaks on June 7th at 54.23days,  so a good amount of loans were taken out on around April 14  (*54days before June 7th*). Go back to the FTD graph search for $SENS, the peak of \\* \\`FTD as a percentage of Float\\` almost exactly lines up\\*. Let\u2019s try another one, $GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf9dy4rpzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e2186f0090584cb6efa7aa170577533fcc5f18\n\nPeak of average loan age at Jan 25 2021 of 85days, placing the date on Nov 25th, the FTD graph shows this as well. Ok, last one let\u2019s check $UWMC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jm3pzeqzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2219785964acacb666a42e2e77e707838a59a93\n\n$UWMC had a peak of avg loan age on Jun 10th, subtract 41days from that day and you get April 29th lining up pretty well with $UWMC largest FTD spike.\n\nOk so I\u2019m basically saying that for stocks without data on ortex you can get a sense of where the shorts have opened positions by looking at the peaks of ftds. I only checked stocks with relatively large peaks as a percentage of float idk about others. So basically for $NEGG there has been a considerable amount of short positions opened May 15 - Jun 15, these guys are underwater.\n\nNext notice that GME FTD spike wasn\u2019t the day that the tendie god turned on the money printer that magical January, it was actually in November. Every stock that has reach GME level of \\`FTD % of Float\\` moons later, the spike never really lines up with the dildo to heaven. It could happen a week later, months later, days later, but it seems that for the outliers its going to happen. $NEGG is in the middle of a squeeze and its FTD spike rival stocks that have gone +200 to +400% during the moonshot. The smaller the float and the higher the spike, the more the pop. I haven\u2019t quantified this.\n\nIf you checked interactive brokers during the day you would have noticed that $NEGG had 0 shares available to short, and the borrow rate is >50%. At peak squeeze borrow rate usually spikes >100%. Lastly, in the last two days the short volume ratio has gone up by a factors & volume has gone up as well\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k32u8odrzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8700f42420fd701af7899bffd6551844984163d\n\nOne thing I failed to mention is that the stock is already expensive to buy -- $20 -- ensuring that doubling down on shorting requires substantial capital. Looking at iborrowdesk.com we see that nice juicy slow creep up of borrow rate, and reduction of shares available to borrow, while the price slow bleeds up. So $negg is expensive to double down on and it expensive to borrow. Now look at your fave stock that has squeezed borrow rate   > 100% rn $negg borrow is a moderate \\[50%? Need check\\]. So basically what I\u2019m saying is that $NEGG is in the beginning to mid part of a squeeze. Not a squeeze perpetuated by a hardened group of loyalist and propelled by whales. A squeeze caused by a <3.5m shares float, while all the exchanges having the wrong information, the realization is happening that there were barely any shares to begin with. This will be like a bank run, and I don\u2019t have a logical price target. It could go up to $70.\n\nLastly, for squeezes price instability is needed aka liquidity is drying up. If you\u2019ve been watching the intraday movements at all, with wide bid/ask spreads and limited orderbook. This plus increases in historic volatility indicated price instability/liquidity drying up.\n\nLiquidity/ price instability is one of the main characteristics in which you can identify a squeeze; in general it indicate future volatility either a big move up or down, (too many buyers smashing the ask button, or too many sellers smashing the bid button) but we have enough information to identify the direction\n\nSee this wrinklebrain comments for more info about liquidity:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o37n9h/weekend\\_discussion\\_jun\\_19\\_20/h2idegc?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o37n9h/weekend_discussion_jun_19_20/h2idegc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o83chk/weekend\\_discussion\\_jun\\_26\\_27/h39t83c?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o83chk/weekend_discussion_jun_26_27/h39t83c?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nNote that if I had something better than thinkorswim I would be looking for the barcoding [candlestick pattern](https://www.google.com/search?q=barcoding+stocks&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS908US908&oq=barcoding+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0j46i175i199j0l7.2849j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) oh well, have close enough approximations that indicate that its happening.\n\n*Asking around for ActiveTick data to see if this pattern exists, to be continued\u2026.*\n\n# Technicals\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/as1fpqlszt971.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=513c1003e2662c1276386a8c019371a931b23708\n\nThis Cup and Handle makes me get a little chubby dude.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nThis is the part i care least about,but it feels good to not yolo on a shit company (sorry $RIDE hodlers).\n\nNewegg has been a one stop shop for PC building for years.

I love Newegg as a company, and I'm freaking amped that they're public, so full disclosure, I've got biases. That being said, I think it's a solid buy. It seems only one analyst has really put a price target on it. I don't know who the analyst is, but any google search for a price target pings back the same, beautiful, 44$ prediction, spread across all of our favorite market commentators. (WSJ, Market Watch, Yahoo) If that's not enough to get you excited, we go to their financials. In 2016 they made a measly 13M$. 2017 came around, and they made an abysmal 1M$. 2018, though? 2.15B$. Mind you, they went from making 1Million dollars... to 2.1 BBillion. 2019, and 2020 were both in the 2 Billion dollar range. (Via WSJ) And now? GPU prices are inflated to high hell, son! Despite that, Newegg seems to be able to Earnings announcement is going to be fantastic! Lastly, let's take a look at technicals. Yesterday and the day before, NEGG had a huge run up! Literally having doubled its price at one point. (Ran from 10$ to 21$ before coming back down.) In that time, it showed strong support at 13. I thought we might see 13$ again today. Besides that, it showed support yesterday, at it's first dip, at 15$, bounced from there up to 19.5, before getting rejected. After it's rejection, it showed support at 16.75 for AH/PM, at 15.75$ for the intraday low. AND THEN IT BOUNCED BACK TO 17.75! If we break down under 15$, We might see 13$, again. Right now, it's gearing up to retest 21$. A rejection from that will likely put us back in this 17.75 range. If we break that 21$ resistance? Then we might get a test of 22$. We might see another gamma squeeze as brokers start hedging for the 22.5$ Calls.\n\n*(btw he\u2019s off about the gamma sqz; options just got introduced, everything else is interesting)*\n\nIt also has some recent good news: [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/neweggs-new-pc-building-service-might-hold-stock-on-rare-components-behind-pre-assembly-paywall](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/neweggs-new-pc-building-service-might-hold-stock-on-rare-components-behind-pre-assembly-paywall)\n\n# Positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/no2woixuzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=04fa15e546fc8ae511df1879c0e5833437cdf097\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykjovwnvzt971.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca9370ca929c3ecec2f8b46ad4bbeb70c711442e\n\nI\u2019m risky af probably better positions out there, took out 20k yesterday (Jul 6, 2021), positions above are as of of pre-market July 7.\n\nThe 13 $30 calls bought Jul 6, 2021for about $3 a pop, end of day they were $6.3, high of $8.1.

Given that it opened at $27 this volume seems reasonable. When I entered i think 35c was the highest option I could get (maybe 40) but it definitely wasn't 80.\nmaybe the disconnect is that the option chain keeps getting added to everyday, and this was not a pump by retail. Once $NEGG became basically in the news options for the furthest OTM 80c priced out alot of people, most likely because the price was already at 70.

{"title": "$WKHS: Exciting Things in the Coming Months!", "selftext": "I know Workhorse has been mentioned a lot on this board (& it deserves to be!) This company in the tail-end of 2021 and 2022 will truly breakout. I believe much of Wall Street only considers WKHS as yet another EV company (which explains the high short %) but it's so much more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDrones:\n\nToward the end of this year, Workhorse will likely gain FAA approval for their drone usage. This is monumental as not only a first-mover in the space but as a company that has been testing with federal/[local governments](https://dronelife.com/2021/06/08/nuair-leads-the-way-for-safe-drone-operations-over-people-workhorse-and-avss-collaboration/) and [UPS](https://www.fleetowner.com/covid-19-coverage/article/21129382/ups-and-workhorse-test-drones-to-help-covid19-response). UPS has been testing Workhorse drones for about 5 years now as they are preparing to get into drone delivery - in fact, they have purchased [950 trucks](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/). With Workhorse's PATENTED drone technology to fit their electric truck landing space, this will be a huge asset to the company. I digress, back to drones. Ark Invest  estimates that at some point during the next five years, drones will deliver more than 20% of parcel shipments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6sg0mhe35u971.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=36d3b200d027430e698a69499204a03beaf6be31\n\nRefrigerated Trucks:\n\nOnline food delivery sales grew more than 40% globally in 2020. As of their last earnings call, Workhorse announced that they will begin prototypes for refrigerated delivery trucks this year.  Workhorse was approached by some LARGE companies inquiring about the possibility of a REFRIGERATED version of their giant 1000 cubic foot Zero Emission Electric Step Van the C-1000.  The Workhorse COO is the former Director of Fleet Operations for Sysco, whose 14,000 vehicle fleet is largely 1000 cubic ft Refrigerated Trucks.  Their HQ is right next to Kroger's HQ btw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, I think Workhorse is in the first inning of their growth stage right now. I truly see this stock retesting its highs by early next year. There are a lot of first mover advantages and spaces where there is NO competition. As they continue to develop, go through the legal processes and progress their product line, they will gain market share and big name customers.
