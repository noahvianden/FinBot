When talking about option contract value, you always have to include time to expiration. Your question makes no sense unless you say how many days until expiration. The greater the number of days, the larger the premium will be, all else held equal/zero, *including the underlying stock price*. If the stock could stay at $100 for 90 days, the 60 day OTM call will have a higher value than the 30 day OTM call at the same strike. You can see this clearly in the BSM equation. This is a natural consequence of the observed statistical distribution of price outcomes for the underlying. The larger the time interval between now and the final time, the wider the distribution of outcomes. There is a good video [here](https://youtu.be/ca7oC70BnTg) that explains this in more detail.\n\nYou can see this in real life option chains (when the market is open) for OTM calls. Find the current month's expiration call and compare to the following month's expiration call for the same underlying where all else is as close to equal as possible: strike, IV, risk-free rate, $0.01  price increments, etc. The far month will always have a higher bid than the near month, unless one or both have a zero bid.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5625286102294922}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4864976406097412}, {"body": "How does theta get priced in during intraday Friday?\n\nIs it usually a bad idea to buy options on a Friday because weekend theta gets priced in during the day?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Theta is a hypothetical predictve  number.  \n\nMarket makers do attempt to bend prices on Fridays to reduce the cost of their inventory over the weekend.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "so you agree that I should not buy on Friday to avoid risking losing value immediately after buying from theta decay?

Setting the order to market value means you want the order filled *at any price*, including $0 (if selling) or infinity (if buying).\n\nIf you want a quick fill, set the limit at the bid if you are selling or the ask if you are buying. You can do better than the bid or the ask usually, but if all you care about is instantly filling the order even if you lose money by doing so, set the limit at the bid or ask as detailed above.\n\n> and used the same \"Market Value\" option for the price limit. I saw that the order was filled at the price of 0.55 instead.\n\n0.55 instead of what? What was your target price? Since you had a 50% gain, I'm assuming something like 0.13, which is half of the 0.26 credit you collected?\n\nSo there's a lot to unpack here. First, do you know what a broker's posted 50% gain really means? Do you know what it is based on? That was probably based on the **midpoint of the bid/ask** for that contract at that time. It's important to understand that the gain% shown by your broker *is only an estimate*. It's not what you may actually fill an order for. The true value of the position is discovered by the market completing trades. Since your broker can't know the true value until the trade is completed, it estimates by averaging the bid and the ask together. What this often means is that the gain% your broker displays may be overstated, because your actual fill may be less.\n\nSecond, 0.55 was probably at or close to the ask of the bid/ask spread for the contract at that time. When you use a market order, you're lucky if you get just the asking price when buying. It could have been a lot worse. If there was only 1 contract on offer at 0.55 and 100 contracts at offer for 5.69 next in line in the order book and someone else snatched that 0.55 contract before your order got filled, you would have ended up paying 5.69 instead for a massive loss. Which, again, is why you should never use a market value order.\n\nMore details about how do trading orders properly here: \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/maufwg/monday_school_your_orders_are_not_as_good_as_you/", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0204948540776968}, {"body": "I'm only getting started on options myself with IBKR, but I have a feeling their P/L for short puts is calculated in an unexpected way for beginners.

The SPY has moved more than its expected move and established new highs over the past few weeks, while its implied volatility (and expected move) has compressed as moves have mostly been in one direction to the upside.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing about a **0.7%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. That corresponds to about **$429** as a *bearish consensus* and **$437** as a *bullish consensus*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX was lower into the holiday weekend, closing at around 15. That\u2019s the lowest levels of market implied volatility since pre-pandemic. In January 2020, before the Covid sell-off, the VIX was as low as 12. Its historical mean is near 19 but that incorporates long periods of time of low volatility (and the VIX in the low teens) with occasional bouts of extreme volatility and spikes in the VIX.\n\nLooking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22. In other words, near-term options are compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.\n\nThose looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.\n\nExpected Moves for This Week (via **Options AI**):\n\n* SPY **0.7%** (was 0.8% last week)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nAs markets made new highs meme stocks were once again some of the most actively traded names, yet their implied volatilities (and expected moves) have tended to compress from a few weeks ago.

The TL:DR version is that options have a hard time pricing a steady move higher, but that could create some opportunities for those looking to scoop options on the cheap side, particularly hedges. It also means that individual stock volatility can sometimes overshoot to the cheap side, especially if it has some idiosyncratic event coming up (like earnings). On the short premium side, if the trades are near term, it's basically a battle between low implied vol and realized vol (actual moves).

The short answer is yes (with a caveat) and is exactly how I would look at things. Stocks tend to stay inside or at their expected move about 60-70% of the time.

This would be similar to point spreads in football, like if Alabama is favored by 45, versus when they are favored by 7, it would be expected that they would beat the spread more often when it is low. (I don't know if this is the case in sports betting but I would assume it to be, it is the case in options because of several variables on the market maker side). \n\nHere's the caveat. In order to do that with IV low (moving farther OTM) it requires risking a lot to make a little (IOW picking up pennies off the train tracks).

A 14 /yo in Pakistan taking a job at a shoe factory is just trying to bring home the bacon to a household that would otherwise not eat that night.\n\nThis is the same that happens with cheap Asian labor in many areas. China's economy has grown a lot in the last 20 years, but back when we first started exporting all our factory labor to China, it was the same deal, people working for wages near slavery for every American company moving their production to China. This is not because Americans forced quasi-slavery conditions, it's because the lives of those people were horrible and taking the factory gig for an American company was better than the other horrible options they had available. This is the reason we moved production to China in the first place, we found a place where people were so miserable that they would do anything just to eat.\n\nSo when you say \"factory X has been caught paying very little to workers and using a workforce of desperate people\", you are not describing American companies, you are describing what it is like to be a human in underdeveloped nations.

Well, divide that by $110 per share and you\u2019ll have to sell about 1820 shares for the down payment alone. Would you rather be paying $75000 extra in taxes, or $45000 in taxes?

{"title": "Get In Loser, We're Saving America or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love $CRWD", "selftext": "Hello I am an Ivy League Econ major who does not know how to talk to attractive women. As I type these hallowed words, I am wearing Sony XM-4s and bumping my 7 TeraByte folder of Playboi Carti leaks. Please see below my thoughts on the cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike, which trades on the Nasdaq as $CRWD.\n\nThe Kaseya ransomware attack this weekend affected 17 countries and 200 businesses. Cyberattacks are growing more and more frequent. Surely you've seen the news reports. Cyberattacks are also growing more and more sophisticated, so much so that they can even infiltrate American government agencies. The $750B the Pentagon gets every year wasn't enough to prevent that.\n\nThe consequences include breaches of sensitive user data and trade secrets, operational shut downs, and millions lost to paying ransoms. So, clearly, preventing these attacks is in the best interest of everyone from CEOs to Presidents to Winnie the Pooh looking ass dictators. Clearly they need to spend more. Cybersecurity products and services are going from \"nice to have\" to \"gotta get it\" status real fucking quick.\n\n**Business Model**\n\nCrowdStrike is the first of its kind among cybersecurity companies. Incumbents like Palo Alto Networks, Symantec, and even FireEye (FireEye has a lot of respect in the public sector) are all Dotcom era dinosaurs. \n\nThat's because CrowdStrike is a cloud-native SaaS that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent attacks. That enough buzzwords for you? \n\nForrester, Gartner, MIT, and Google (an early investor) and many other reputable sources have called CrowdStrike leader in endpoint protection. The cloud-nativity has allowed it to strike partnerships to integrate with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=f4fb055a-5333-4b6e-8d8b-a4143ad7f6c7) and [Google Cloud](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiuodTa-srxAhXaAnIKHcIlAPQQFjAAegQIBhAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Fpress-releases%2F2021%2F0506%2Fcrowdstrike-google-cloud&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GTGScrx6huf5ULshEqTDA). CrowdStrike can just piggyback off their explosive growth.\n\n**The Bull Case**\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global [cyber security services market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cyber-security-service-market?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ICT_13-Apr-21&amp;utm_term=cyber-security-service-market&amp;utm_content=rd)\u00a0size is expected\u00a0to reach USD 192.70 billion by 2028.\n\nI say the true opportunity is even bigger, because they haven't factored in all out cyberwar between America and the evil trinity of Russia/Iran/China. State-backed cyberattacks are nothing new. Remember North Korea and Sony back when the JamesFranco-SethRogen masterpiece *The Interview* came out?  Or remember when [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/09/10/cyberattacks-us-elections-trump-biden/) reported that foreign hackers were trying to compromise the 2020 elections? Remember when [China agreed to invest $400B](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/27/world/middleeast/china-iran-deal.html) in Iran's tech sector?\n\nWant more proof? Just look at the [FBI's webpage](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber/news) for cyberattack press releases, there's a fuckton. [Recent research](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252499042/Nation-state-cyber-attacks-double-in-three-years) estimates that state-backed cyberattacks have doubled in the last three years.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. Geopolitical tensions will of course continue to heat up. This is because humans are just a bunch of glorified, nuclear-powered apes. We will see stronger legislation mandating that businesses armor the fuck up. We will see outsized and reactionary government spending on cybersecurity. We will also likely see tax-payer funded incentives and subsidies directed toward cybsersecurity firms.\n\n**Management**\n\nWhen I worked in venture capital for a summer, I realized just how important the management team is to potential investors. And CrowdStrike lives up to all expectations in this area.\n\nGeorge Kurtz, the CEO and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike has a track record of CyberSecurity success. His startup Foundstone was acquired by McAfee in 2004, after which he worked his way up the ranks to become the CTO of McAfee. Clearly, this guy knows what the fuck he's doing. He's no sleazy salesman, he's a princely technocrat.\n\nThe Chief Strategy Officer used to be the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. I'd bet my house that this white male has many white male friends in high places. Friends who'd gladly toss him a contract or two.\n\nThe rest of the C-Suite are all cyber veterans, even the CFO. It's a who's who of hacker nerds who saw the light.\n\n**Financials**\n\nWho the fuck cares.\n\nOkay fine, I care a little.\n\nHere's an overview of Q1FY22 results: Revenue increased 70% YoY, which reflects 82% growth in subscription customers. They had a net loss of $85M only because they are investing aggressively in growth and R&amp;D. At the end of the day they have $1.7B cash on hand to weather any shitstorms.\n\nThe customer relationships are deep and broad. Recurring revenue is over $1B. Furthermore, existing customers end up buying more and more products from CrowdStrike as time goes on. 64% of customers have now adopted four or more CrowdStrike products into their subscription. And it's not like companies who need to cut costs are going to get rid of their cybersecurity provider.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhy buy a shitass SPAC for upside? $CRWD is a litass business with the world at its feet.\n\n**TLDR:** Lick lick lick my balls\n\nSources: Most recent 10-Q, company website, Cybersecurity news reports on Financial Times, my friends in tech and the public sector, *Mindfuck* by Christopher Wylie, *1984* by Georgei Orwellovski, *The Communist Manifesto* by Karl Marx, and -- most important of all -- the tingling in my balls\n\nPosition: Shares for now because all my liquid savings are going toward rent, but I've got a sweetass summer internship and I promise to YOLO my next paycheck into this. Buy calls, shits finna rip Tuesday.\n\n[I only wish I'd bought more](https://preview.redd.it/0v9d19giva971.jpg?width=827&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a11021f2072a291cad5d491ce9b1e15592aab7)", "id": "odygun", "created_utc": 1625453929.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|363|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Calls on that are pretty expensive rn", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04912595450878143}, {"body": "I was overwhelmed by buzzwords a few sentences in.

Q1 broke records with a 93% YoY and a 6% q/q growth, bring in a cool $3.5 Billion in revenue all while maintaining a flat gross margin of 46% YoY and up 1% q/q(if you\u2019re retarded, this is great news).\n\n**Some other quick glance numbers**\n\n\t- OCF - $898 Million\n\t- FCF - $832 Million (Record)\n\t- Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments- $3.12 Billion\n\nNow we\u2019re going to look at a lot of numbers (if you\u2019re brain lacks wrinkles please skip to the end)\n\n**Below we\u2019ll see the growth of revenue for each quarter** \n\n2021Q1     2020Q4      2020Q3      2020Q2      2020Q1    2019Q4   2019Q3     2019Q2    2019Q1\n$3.445B   $3.225B     $2.8B         $1.932B      $1.786B    $2.127B    $1.8B         $1.531B     $1.272B\n\n**So what ca we take away from these quarterly comparisons?**\n\n\t- AMD broke revenue records 6 quarters back to back (fuck meek mill)\n\t- I\u2019m too lazy to put all the numbers here, AMD was up on everything q/q except gross margin which remained flat and they reduced debt, GROWTH EVERYWHERE \n\t- AMD hit a rough patch in 2013 - 2015, where its slow but steady growth started. With the release of Ryzen, AMD began climbing from the depths in 2016 and started it\u2019s steroid cycle in 2019.\n\t- Historically Q3 has been AMD\u2019s best quarter by far, the fact that AMD crushed it in Q420 w/ $2.2 billion in q/q growth and then beat out Q420 by another 2 billion in 2021. \n\t- AMD has achieved these numbers DESPITE fucc boi COVID-19 and significant shortages/ manufacturing challenges.\n\t\n**The Balance Sheet Quick Glance**\n\t\n\t- $3.116 Billion in cash/ cash equivalent, up $826 Million q/q and up $1.731 Billion YoY (LOL GAWT DAMN THAS SUM GROWTH)\n\t- Debt $313 Million, down $17 Million q/q and down $175 Million YoY\n\t- Inventories $1.653 Billion, up $254 Million q/q and up $597 Million YoY\n\t- Accounts receivable $2.178 Billion, up $112 Million q/q and up $487 Million YoY\n\n\tAMD has a very strong balance sheet and continues to grow as a company, further proof that AMD is well on its way to the moon.\n\n**Financial Outlook Quick Glance**\n\n\t- 2021Q2 expected earnings $3.6 Billion, historically they beat their estimates by a small bit\n\t- 2021 expected earnings is 50% YoY Growth ($14.65 Billion) \n\t- Gross margin for YoY is not expected to change\n\t- Operating expenses are expexted 27% for the year\n\n**Q1 and Beyond Thoughts**\n\n\tAMD has been doing tremendous and has done nothing but grow as a company since Lisa Su took over in 2014. AMD\u2019s last 1.5 years are a sign of what\u2019s to come, I believe they will be on this incredible run for the rest of year and possibly into next before they start to slow down.

I'm not passing this on as financial advice, just my opinions:\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\n\\- This one is the most obvious. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and [also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The [expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. \n\nBeing the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact the supply and demand of semiconductor chips, [which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts).\n\n**$NVDA Stock Split**\n\nFuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to compare the two tickers compared to $AMD $95 and $NVDA $800. \n\n**Innovation**\n\nI'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help.  IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean cmon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that [market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processers? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source just facts. \n\n**Price Outlook**\n\nIf I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and barely enough psilo, so it's whatever. \n\n\\- Short term I'm, playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. For a quick swing I try to enter in anywhere under $85.\n\n\\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance->support.\n\n\\- Long term, $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hodl until I retire. No selling on the dips. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, that's about it. Great DD u/TheTendilorian. $AMD to the moon, not a financial advisor, blah-blah-blah.

{"title": "How to play the upcoming market crash", "selftext": "So, the market is going to crash harder than a Boeing without updated software soon.  It doesn't really matter what awesome thing you think you've stumbled onto, it's going to go down, hard.\n\nThe Fed has put the market on easy mode ever since the COVID crash, but that's coming to an end soon.  So if you don't want to lose all your tendies in the coming storm, listen up.\n\nOh, what's that you say?  There won't be a market crash?  Hang on, lemme drop a little knowledge on you.\n\n1. the RRP numbers.  RRP is the Reverse Repo Program the fed runs where banks and other institutions park money at the fed overnight in exchange for Treasuries, then swap them back the next day.  This usually spikes at the end of quarters and the rest of the time is super low.  Over the last few months it's been skyrocketing to all time highs.  It hit $991 Billion this quarter end, then after the Q2 checks ended it fell all the way to.. $731 Billion.\n\nWhy is this bad?  It means the banks either need collateral so bad they're putting this much up overnight to get it, or they'd rather get an annualized return of 0.05% than anything else, at a time when inflation is officially running at around 5%, and unofficially as much as twice that.  This means they \"the smart money\" think a guaranteed loss of 4.95%/year is the best they can hope to do.\n\n2) The housing market is about to go boom in the bad way.  Right now we've got increasing prices, tons of supply under construction, combined with decreasing sales.  That's basically the perfect indicator of a bubble about to pop.  Also, the end of the eviction moratorium is still waiting around the corner to dump millions of houses on banks that really don't want them and will be very \"motivated sellers\".  This should have already happened, but when Team Sleepy Biden got a look at the amount of doom coming, they quickly punted the ball, and emergency extended the eviction moratorium by another month to the end of July.  Kick that can all you want, it's still there and just getting bigger.\n\n3) The commercial housing market is basically in the same place today as the residential market was in 2008, and banks are loaded to the tits with bad CMBS products.  If you're confused how this could happen, again, only a few years later, it's pretty simple, all the guys who did the MBS nonsense in '08 didn't face any penalties, so they moved over to CMBS and started inflating  the income of the businesses renting properties.  Now, what has the pandemic done more than anything else?  Killed the small businesses and retail stores that make up the majority of tenants in said CMBS loans.  So you've got a bunch of companies that Amazon just put out of business not paying their rent anymore, which means the places they were paying rent to are no longer paying their mortgage.  Combine that with many companies reducing their office footprints with hybrid work from home setups, and... CMBS go BOOM in the bad way.\n\n4) The signs, they are the everywhere.  Every company that can is going public right now, regardless of whether they make money or not.  This is one of those classic \"the top is in\" signs.  Retail is fomoing into the market in a big way.  Remember the line about how a guy knew the market was done when his shoeshine boy had stock tips?  Now it's your Uber driver and Pizza delivery guy.\n\n5) Margin debt is around $860 billion right now.  And that's just what's disclosed.  Remember Bill Hwang lost $20 billion and even more for Credit Suisse and Deutsche and Nomura?  Yeah, none of that leverage was disclosed because it was all in swaps.  You think he's the only family office out there pulling stunts like that?  And don't even get me started on how much margin is tied up in the funny internet money.  Hell, Binance lets people margin at 100 to 1.  That's beyond insane.  So yeah, huge amounts of margin mean whenever things take a turn for the worse, they spiral really, really fast.\n\n6) When in doubt, zoom out.  We've had people posting hundred year and twenty year charts and the stock markets channel for months now.  They all show the top of the channel that makes the bad bounce down happen is being touched.  Elliot Waves and other kinds of TA all show the same thing, we're about to go down, way downtown, like 1929 down.\n\n7) All time highs, but 50% of stocks are under their 50 day moving average.  That's happened in six of the last seven trading days.  It's never happened in history more than 3 out of 5 days before, and every single time was shortly followed by a massive, massive crash.  The crash has already started for the smaller fish, but the indexes are being propped up by the big names because money is de-risking by fleeing to them, hoping they'll survive.\n\n8) Student loans.  The moratorium ends on September 30.  Meaning that in October all of a sudden the people most likely to spend money in the economy (young, mid to low level disposable income) will see that spending ability completely wiped out all at once.  This is tens of millions of Americans who immediately won't be spending money at businesses.  And you know what the most common month for financial crashes is?  October, which is right after September.\n\nFinally, you don't just have to take my word for it.  Here's a list of some prominent financial types calling for doom soon.\n\n1. Dr. Michael J. Burry\n2. a whole bunch of other assholes who don't have his track record but are echoing it\n\nSo how you do make money on the collapse of the market?  Don't try to pick companies and buy puts, if you do that you have to root on stuff failing.  Buy calls on SPXS, SQQQ, and SDOW, then you get to root for things going up.  I don't do posts very often, but my first DD on the oil markets made a whole lot of you a bunch of money.  Here's another chance to do it again.\n\nPositions:\n\n10x HYG 7/23 80p\n\n10x SPXS 7/16 40c\n\n10x SPXS 7/16 55c\n\nHonestly I don't know if these will print or not.  But on the day they expire I'll just roll them or buy more another month or two out and will continue to do so.  If you want to just buy and forget, Jan 2022 calls are the safest thing I can think of.  Maybe this can gets kicked out past the summer, but there is no way it makes it past this fall and the student loan spending cliff.\n\nEDIT and TLDR:  Market go boom in bad way.  Bet against market to make tendies.  Money printer no work no more, printed too much money make liquidity trap - RRP evidence of liquidity overload.\n\nEDIT2:  First, a lot of people in the comments don't like my positions.  I've had them for awhile, and they have a very good chance to expire worthless, but as I said, I'll keep rolling them because I did the math and it's cheaper to keep rolling them than to just buy Jan 2022 calls.  The options markets prices don't make sense a lot of the time, so I really recommend doing the math on buying calls and puts at various points instead of just blindly picking a date and rolling with it.\n\nSecond, the banks are being propped up by bullshit.  For those of you who didn't know, the \"stress test\" they recently passed a couple weeks ago so they could start issuing dividends?  It used data from October 9, 2020.  That's fucking insane.  There's an interview with the head of BofA where he's talking about something else and mentions, completely unprompted, \"assuming we pass the stress test\" and he looked stressed as fuck while saying it.\n\nThere's no way on god's green earth that Bill Hwang was the only one being as fucky with hidden leverage like swaps or who knows what in the funny money markets with things like tokenized stocks to hide naked call and put and swap positions.  I don't know what domino is going to start this rolling, but I see a lot of those motherfuckers teetering.\n\nThe market right now is the Titanic, and I'm telling you people, there are a bunch of goddamn icebergs out there.\n\nEDIT 3: since I've been getting some questions about what's wrong with the banks and the CMBS market, here are two articles, one from the Atlantic last summer [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/coronavirus-banks-collapse/612247/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/coronavirus-banks-collapse/612247/)\n\nand one from the Intercept published in April [https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/](https://theintercept.com/2021/04/20/wall-street-cmbs-dollar-general-ladder-capital/)\n\nAn excerpt from the Intercept piece:\n\nIn a [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) released last November, they sampled almost 40,000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019.\n\n\u201cOverall,\u201d they write, \u201cactual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5% or more in 28% of loans.\u201d This was just the average, however:\u00a0Some originators \u2014 including an unusual company called Ladder Capital as well as the Swiss bank UBS, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley \u2014 were significantly worse, \u201chaving more than 35% of their loans exhibiting 5% or greater income overstatement.\u201d\n\nThis is just the same thing as the NINJA (No Income No Job Application) for residential mortgages in 2008 applied to commercial loans.\n\nEDIT 4: Since I'm getting a lot of requests both in comments and DMs about it, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) is a follow up post that explains exactly what the fuck is wrong with the housing market and why it's going to blow the fuck up soon.", "id": "oe9ruu", "created_utc": 1625499121.0, "score": 3339, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 1496, "comments": [{"body": "How to play the upcoming market crash\n\n1.

My thoughts on 08 vs today.  *A crash is coming, maybe a decent sized one but not an 08 level crash*.\n\n* Biggest parallel is commercial real estate bubble vs housing bubble.  I have friends who I respect that work in risk management for commercial real estate lending (not extroverted dumbasses in suits, some of them tirelessly work for stupid people while they get the glory but they are not stupid themselves, at least when it comes to credit risk).  The biggest bubble is debt funds and non-bank lenders.  They have the riskiest stuff and are the least regulated.  Yes some of this is passed on through to banks but it's no where on the scale of 08 where literally every single piece of shit was wrapped in shiny giftwrap and sent to someone else.  The banks really are more tightly regulated and if anything they have too much cash with nowhere good to put it.  They are stress-tested to a much higher standard than 08.\n\n* RRP's are indicative that loose monetary policy leads to absurdity but it's not a sign of immediate doom.  Part of it is a sign that at least some of the players are being extremely careful.  The FED can and will keep the party going for longer than 2 weeks.  Probably at least through end of year.\n\n* Historically high savings and people ready to buy the dip.  The big crash doesn't come when the system is flush with cash.  Too many people are still fully expecting a crash and waiting on the sidelines with cash.  It's when the bears are fully discredited, and it feels like the market is truly immortal when the giant dip comes.\n\nThe rest on historic margin is spot on.

The government has backstopped even the most reckless companies, fending off defaults where they were arguably long overdue.\n\nBut those days are now drawing to a close as Beijing forces more accountability on its weakest companies to reduce moral hazard. The defaults are coming.\n\nIn China, the current default rate is around 1%; in more developed markets, it\u2019s closer to 2% to 3%. Removing government support in order to close that gap is a delicate process. Allow too many firms, or the wrong ones, to fail, and investors\u2019 faith in the overall market will wobble, triggering precisely the crisis that Beijing wants to avoid.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s China Credit Tracker is one metric by which to evaluate this high-wire act. By using public and proprietary data, it shines new light on stress in the riskiest corners of the country\u2019s onshore and offshore credit markets.\nIt\u2019s a barometer that shows whether one of the most ambitious plans to reshape capital markets is going as planned\u2014or whether cracks are starting to show. Put simply: The higher the score, the more troubled the companies and skittish the investors, relative to historic averages.\n\nSo far, policymakers have avoided prompting panic. The stress in both the onshore and offshore markets is in the middle range, according to our overall gauges, a sign of market resilience despite fears of a looming debt restructuring at state-run bad-loan manager China Huarong Asset Management Co. and serious doubts over the long-term health of China Evergrande Group.\n\nWhile the monthly gauge showed stress remained elevated in the domestic market in May, it eased last month. These scores draw from Bloomberg\u2019s proprietary database of onshore defaults and from yield spreads that show it\u2019s becoming cheaper for even risky borrowers to sell debt.\n\nThe data also suggest that spillover pressure from Huarong and Evergrande has remained relatively contained in the local market. The firms are the latest in a string of borrowers once considered impervious to default that are now seen as vulnerable.\n\nIn the $860 billion market for Chinese dollar bonds, where global investors are most exposed, stress is higher. Investors are turning sour on junk bonds, pushing yields to their highest in more than a year and pressuring monthly returns.\n\nDefaults aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. The pace of missed payments has reached a fresh high in 2021, crossing the 100 billion yuan ($15 billion) mark for a fourth year in a row several months earlier than last year. Notable pockets of risk include property developers and local state-owned firms.\n\nDive into the methodology behind Bloomberg\u2019s China Credit Stress Tracker\n\nA ramping up in credit stress can be seen since February, when monthly defaults reached their highest levels relative to historic data, though the pace has since cooled off a little.\nA host of defaults related to failed conglomerate HNA Group Co., once the poster child for China\u2019s debt-fueled overseas acquisition spree, has led to rising number of failures in the southern province of Hainan.\n\n**Provincial Breakdown**\n\nHainan topped onshore corporate defaults in the first half of 2021\n\nNote: Map shows Mainland China\u2019s onshore bond market. Figures are in billion yuan.\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nWhile elevated defaults are likely to continue through this year, authorities were expected to ensure financial markets remained relatively stable as the nation approached the politically sensitive 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party on July 1.\n\nFirms that could face pressure repaying their debts need to deal with some 121 billion yuan that comes due through 2022.\n\n**Tracking Trouble**\n\nMonthly maturities for Chinese firms that could struggle to repay their debt\n\nNote: Figures are in billion yuan.\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nEven if stress does increase, that\u2019s not necessarily negative.\n\nIn fact, for China, more deliquincies are a crucial part of developing a mature, efficient market. Ultimately this will help reduce the country\u2019s longstanding moral hazard problem by forcing buyers to reprice risk, push authorities to improve transparency and help attract long-term investors like pension funds and insurers from overseas.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2981294095516205}, {"body": "You've also heard multiple times, consistently that they would not alter the plan drastically - if it's posted for 2022, 2021 would catastrophic and the USA loves fucking around with its economy as long as it benefits them ultimately.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4440915286540985}, {"body": "It doesn't matter what they want.

Biden administration had a chance to put a stop at this but they continue to ignore the risk and letting feds to keep printing money.  \n\nHere is their end game and how it will be played out: they would want to secure house and senate majority by hook or fake votes.

Big wallstreet firms and oligarchs will already know about this.  Goal is not to hurt em or their wealth as they need re-election funds in 2024. Goal is to hurt medium size firms,  mom and pop business,  landlords etc. Take their money and give it back to lower class,  poor minorities,  illegal aliens to make them permanent voters of democratic party.

You should have enough ammunition by mid 2022. Look at market indices and all financial data.   Notice trend change.  \n\nNext step is tricky: after mid term,  first sign of weakness,  load up on long puts few months out. Use only 20% of ammunition. Monitor.  If market makes one more ATH, unleash Next 20% in long puts. This is worst case scenario.  All will crash and burn after that.

Worst case, lose it and it\u2019s like you never got it, oh well. Especially since the third, and biggest, payment came around the time GME blew up.\n\nSecond, and way more impactful IMO, is that student loan debt has not been collecting for over a year now.

{"title": "FB & WISH Drops After Their IPOs 8 1/2 years apart", "selftext": "Earlier, I wasn\u2019t able to navigate creating a  DD post correctly to show the similarities between how FB and WISH were manipulated downward to shake weak hands off the stocks with massive long term gains ahead.\n\n1. Compare FB July 2012 through Mar 2013 to WISH Dec 2020 to Present?\n\nMarket insiders who drove enthusiasm through the hyped FB IPO and the run up of WISH after its IPO make it their business to punish early investors with eyes on short term gains. They make huge profits on IPO run ups followed by shorting the very same hyped stocks mercilessly.\n\n2. Why is this important?\n\nIn the case of FB then and WISH now you see two stocks - one that got punished then and another that has gotten punished recently such their valuation levels made no sense. Both companies had post IPO had very little debt while experiencing rapid growth but their market cap dropped precipitously and in the case of WISH, to around 1.4 x sales.\n\nWhen valuations get out of whack like that and losses on individual investors force them to sell out of their positions, big investors always jump in to take massive long term stakes in which they reap massive gains.\n\nThis then says to me that you should be patient in your investing. You could carefully invest using a number of strategies to make money without losing your position in a long term winner. Here are a few approaches:\n\na. Average in your largest buys around large institutional investor buys as seen on level II trades\nb. Join the shorts with with PUT orders when algorithmic selling or manipulative downward price action is evident\nc. Sell LEAP covered CALLs if they are profitable\nd. Balance trading on margin to avoid margin calls\n\nOver time all that matters is that your trading account and positions in it are funded and not vulnerable to margin calls. A good early investment will usually prove to be one within two years.\n\n3. What does this mean: Contrast manipulation vs value?\n\nFirst, understand that in the long run valuations matter. To get the best value an investor should pay the lowest price for a promising stock. When a stock price drops while the fundamentals of the company is improving like WISH who reported 76% YoY revenue growth but fell to $7.52 after hitting a $32.85 high you have to wonder why. Well a buyer at $32.85 now has the worst value given the stock is now worth $11.78. A buyer on the other hand who bought at $7.52 or near about like I did has the highest value especially knowing that the company\u2019s revenue is significantly increasing.\n\nSecond, we as investors must learn to follow the money. Big buy orders that we have seen since the 52-week low of $7.52 has produced massive trading volume. Massive trading volume with increasing price per share and algorithm-based pullbacks are signs of extraordinary long term gains as seen in FB. And, if you go back to AAPL in roughly 2004 and 2005 you see similar price action and volume followed by the enormous gains that APPL has since produced.\n\nManipulation is to me disingenuous price increase or drops against valuation. At either end whether through hype or unfounded bashing the unsuspecting and inexperienced investor is bound to lose.\n\n4. Why did I deem FB and WISH price drops as manipulation?\n\nWhen a disruptive technology enters the market and is run up early only to reverse and drop over  50% and sometimes down 90% there to me is no other explanation that big investor pump and dump market manipulation. I do not claim this to be scientific analysis but rather common sense. To make one feel as though their initial investment was a bad one only to later reveal sometimes 200-fold gains is similarity someone telling you your winning lottery ticket was a loser. To me it should be criminal when big investors colluded with unscrupulous Law Firms who file fake lawsuits and post them all over every brokerage site or financial website and paid bashers are employed to drive down a stock price to encourage individual investors to sell their stakes at a loss as I believe is being done in the case of WISH.", "id": "oeeiik", "created_utc": 1625513545.0, "score": 283, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|4 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/oecec5) \n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2788497805595398}, {"body": "Bro, I\u2019m decently well off and I buy shit from WISH.", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "More for tendie time", "score": 19, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04939663037657738}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2081938534975052}, {"body": "Some folks have only iterated that it's a trash company or app because they heard it from someone else they haven't actually experienced it themselves.

{"title": "NIO - a trillion dollar company. Here\u2019s why\u2026(DD with a sprinkle of formulated opinion)", "selftext": "This company is revolutionary, not just on products but it\u2019s service.\n\nHave any of you even seen NIO day and the enormous mass following on this company? Its walking in the footsteps of Apple. There are some people VOLUNTEERING to be a part of this. \n\nFrom its beginnings NIO has established epic foundations. Winning formula E and developing a super car (EP9) holding a lap record around the Nurburgring, more than once, might I add. Take a look at NIO House in Beijing - it is the epitome of what NIO represents. It\u2019s a lifestyle beyond the car. \n\nNIO cars will soon have a 1000km solid state battery and incase that isn\u2019t enough then feel free to visit one of the 300+ battery swap stations (increasing every day), 300000 fast charging stations over multiple cities in China or simply use power home 2.0. A swap station will have a fully charged battery in your car in 3minutes. They have now competed well over TWO MILLION SWAPS! This tech, while slower to scale than super chargers, is exactly what the EV market is lacking. This is one the greatest stigmas for EV, having to WAIT on your battery charging and worry about degradation. Imagine the continued scope for new service plans and flowing revenues with this model. EYE WATERING. You can walk into a NIO Space and save yourself 11k straight off the bat. We live in a subscription generation folks. Oh, and don\u2019t forget a healthy tapped 2nd hand car market. Encore - Sinopec. \n\nAs for the new ET7 sedan - Nio Partnered with NVIDIA to put their DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer dubbed ADAM into their car. This supercomputer, will feature four high performance Orin SoCs in each of its EVs to achieve an industry leading performance of 1,000+ TOPS!!  Let  me translate: that\u2019s equivalent to 7, yes you read that correctly - SEVEN -Tesla FSD computers. \n\nA total of 11 8MP cameras, a 1,550nm LiDAR sensor, five mmWaveRad, 12 USS and two GPS / IMU as well as one V2X and one A.D.M.S sensor are installed in the NIO ET7.\n\nAquila, is the name for the first high resolution camera (8 MP) that is installed in the vehicle. In comparison, Tesla uses a 1.2 MP camera. The higher resolution and display enables the NIO ET7 to recognize objects and obstacles at a greater distance and to let the system react accordingly. NIO underpins this with numbers, so the system is able to recognize vehicles at a distance of 687 meters; Tesla at 229 meters. Traffic cones would be seen at a distance of 262 meters (Tesla 87 meters) and people at a distance of 223 meters (Tesla 74 meters).\n\nAs I said before, you also buy into a service as much as a car with NIO. LIFETIME FREE ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE. LIFE TIME FREE CAR CONNECTIVITY. UNLIMITED ON THE SPOT TYRE REPAIR AND BACKUP CHARGING CALL OUTS. LIFETIME WARRANTY WITH NO MILEAGE LIMITS. Oh, did I mention NIO house? What\u2019s Tesla doing? **tumbleweed**\n\nAs for the market - do any of you truly understand how underpinning the success of a company is with the power of the Asian market? It\u2019s ENORMOUS. It\u2019s economy is now bigger than America, 30-40% of Tesla cars are sold here and with good reason. The demand is unprecedented. The supply simply can\u2019t meet it. There\u2019s room for both but Nio will dominate China and make waves in Europe and America. Heck, it would be immensely great with the Asian market alone. They now have over 1.5million active users on the NIO app, which was recently ranked No. 1 with the highest score of 4.5 stars on a list among 20 other mainstream automakers. This is a beautiful community. NIOs relations executive - Chavin Shens thoughts: \u201cBuying a car is a less frequent activity than taking a flight or shopping at a supermarket. So we need to create more everyday activities to keep customers in touch.\u201d\n\nLoyalty and rewards, my friends. \n\nTesla is severely lacking in build quality. Off-set panelling, windows not fitted properly, seats that wear down faster than toilet paper and some dodgy paint jobs along the way. JAC motors builds NIO cars and they are well renowned for quality being associated with VW. NIO has research and development, design, manufacturing and offices in San Jose, Munich, London, Shanghai as well as eight other locations. They are employing and working with some of the greatest talent on this planet. Kris Tomasson - NIO VP of design - This guy was literally a global director at Coca Cola. GLOBAL. AND the Head of exterior design at BMW. What a complete powerhouse (no pun intended). \n\nBTW - Yes, NIO isn\u2019t Tesla. NIO is taking on its own completely different stance. It\u2019s NIO within its own right. \n\nBelieve or not I do love Tesla, I\u2019m a massive fan! Elon is a visionary and I\u2019d love to be riding shotgun to Mars one day! But don\u2019t let that blind sight you from the uprising of perhaps one the biggest companies in the world. Infact...it already is. \n\nTo summarise folks, what we are witnessing here is the best EV and lifestyle company in the making, bar none, that offers cutting edge technologies and innovations along with customer experience and satisfaction at its core business objectives. The impact of double shifts at JAC will start coming into fruition and before you know it NEO park will have eye watering production. Imagine 500k to 1million NIO cars/year. The Chinese government has backed NIO in more ways than one - subsidising AND bailing them out in times of birthing need. The writing is literally on the wall for ICE cars. NIO will keep delivering, keep breaking records and keep bringing world class innovation. \n\nFurther translation for smooth aped brains out there: THE STONK GOES UP. \n\nFurther translation for super smoothed aped brains: Rocket ship to the moon.\n\nFurther translation for super smoothed aped brains that lack several cognitive abilities such as literacy and the ability to plan, solve problems, think abstractly and comprehend complex ideas:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\u2026.\ud83c\udf13", "id": "oehww2", "created_utc": 1625524142.0, "score": 196, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Hey OP, the bot already asked but I didn't see you reply with them anywhere: where are your positions?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No doubt he\u2019s a bagholder.
