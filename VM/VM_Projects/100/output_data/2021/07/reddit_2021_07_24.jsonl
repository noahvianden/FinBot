{"title": "Some big mover earnings next week. $AAPL, $TSLA, $SBUX, $GOOGL, $AMD..... It's a big week, let's talk strategy folks", "selftext": "1) Strategy\nI recently was introduced to how to properly make use of a credit spread around earnings. It's the only viable options play I can come up with that ends up either being indifferent to IV crush or benefitting slightly from it. From what I understand you can also go deep ITM and survive the crush just fine as the closer your Delta gets to 1 the less effect it has on you. I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down. Correct me if I am wrong but straddles and strangles get crushed along with straight calls and puts, correct?\n\n2) Plays\nBased on past  moves and general market sentiment, especially predicted move base on option pricing, here are my thoughts on plays I'm hoping will print for next week. I appreciate all constructive feedback. Or even non constructive. \n$AAPL DOWN 4%\n$TSLA DOWN 5%\n$SBUX UP 3%\n$AMD DOWN 1% then UP next day 4%\n$GOOGL ? %2\n\nI have some light DD on these I am willing to debate with people, brings on your thoughts or any other juicy looking low hanging fruit for next week. I don't have a large account for next week's plays so I will probably pick the 2 I think most likely to print from different sectors and maybe a small call or put on an index containing one of them. Or maybe a collaborative play on QQQ going down as a lot of the names I am interested in are tech companies.\n\nEdit.. after some more DD I'm gonna throw $F in the ring for at Down 4%. This is based mostly on looking at big news items that effect collaborative stocks (Tsla, gm, nio, etc.). While the others seem to have a reaction to news, $F seems to be immune from good news giving it a boost. To date the shares of $F have done fairly well this year, especially considering their recent financial troubles the past couple years.

Every market day I journal extensively.  Prices, events, news, thoughts, emotions, theories, analyst projections, ideas, you name it.  \n\nWeekends are when all the past journal entries can be assimilated and considered without much time pressure or confusion.  \n\nI'll make certain trading plans for the coming weeks and days.  Last weekend, for example, I made plans to sell a lot and raise a lot of cash on Monday, assuming prices cooperated.  The plan was to redeploy that cash into any dips, as I had a sense a correction was coming.  I ranked things as to what I expected to sell into strength first to last.  I knew which earnings were coming and journaled my own expectations for those, making plans of which I might hold regardless, and which I might want to sell on a rise into earnings.\n\nTurns out I was off by a day.  The morning dip only accelerated. The correction had come early.  Even as you're losing value, it can be heartening to know your instincts aren't bad.  \n\nSince I'd freshly assessed my whole portfolio, I could pivot right away.  The vix instrument I'd expected to sell later become top priority, so I sold that at pretty much peak to raise the cash I'd wanted.  And instead of waiting, I saw the momentum equity I wanted had crashed below my shopping list price, so I snagged that and it's already up over 15%.  Net-net, I'd added the name I wanted, and used vix money to do it instead of selling a solid equity.  I don't like riding vix instruments for too long, so this ended up being a better outcome.\n\nI had some aggressive prices on the week's shopping list, so if the sell off continued, there were a number I wanted to buy.  A second day sell off would have done the trick, but instead the bounce came immediately.  No loss, The powder can just stay dry.  Maybe opportunities were missed, but there will be others.\n\nFrom the weekend strategizing, I reaffirmed my long term goal to hold financials at least until the rate climate gets more normalized.  So then it's easy to fully blank out any concerns as I see them rock and roll along with treasury blips.  Having a plan helps isolate some things from being a distraction.\n\nThe weekend also helps to ponder China stocks, and to be ready for inevitable news that always drops Sunday evening.  Was the previous fear mongering overblown?  Or getting worse?  It felt like worse, so I made a plan to stop loss out of DIDI, which was fortuitous.\n\nNext was to wait on the bets I'd made on TWTR and SNAP back when they were being sold down as overvalued.  The weekend plan was to watch and see if they rose too much before earnings.  They didn't, so I followed through on the plan to hold.  One of them suddenly approached my long term PT of $80, so I floated a bid to see if an easy $79 fish was out there.  It was, so I took some profit, which is a key discipline.  Might I miss a straight leg up? Quite possibly.  But I'll take a guaranteed large gain over a non-guaranteed extra large.  Worst case scenario I have capital to buy something else that's attractive.  Better than beating myself up if $79 retreats to $72. It didn't.  It finished $78, so maybe it has more to run.  That's ok.\n\nAnyway, the point of the story is that weekends don't have to be the boring time, especially if you approach them with intent.  There's infinite numbers and situations to study.  It's like visualizing for goals.  Long ago I used to just have limited positions and big, year long macro views.  \" I hope oil goes up this year\" or \"maybe this is gold's year\".

While stocks and casinos are entirely different, there are a lot of similarities when it comes to losses and profits and the human brain can't always differentiate between the two. I'm not trying to be judgmental and it's entirely possible that I am wrong but, if you think that you may have a problem, you may want to speak with someone about this.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I like this comment. It\u2019s more constructive than most of the rest. Here\u2019s my answers:\n\n1. No. While I wish the markets were open 24/7/365, I know that markets close and there\u2019s no point fussing over them. One analogy I can think of is driving with music. I always listen to music when I drive - it gives me something to focus on when driving gets boring and it\u2019s fun to sing along. That\u2019s similar to the enjoyment my investments bring me. Most people seem to be under the impression I\u2019m sitting at my computer watching charts move. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m outside living my life and every once in awhile (every hour or so maybe) I\u2019ll pull up my portfolio on my phone just to check how things are going, and then I continue with my day. It\u2019s like driving without being able to listen to my favorite song/album/artist. I have other things to keep me busy, but I can tell something is missing and I would like to have it if I could.\n\n2. Sometimes I get busy with life things that require more of my attention. Like I\u2019ve said in previous comments, about 99% of my investments are automated through recurring investments and reinvested dividends. If I don\u2019t have the time to check for a day, or for a week, I won\u2019t die. I\u2019m confident in my portfolio and I can afford to lose the money. It\u2019s nice to get back to it, but if for some godawful reason I couldn\u2019t check my portfolio for say, 10 years, I\u2019d live my life without it.\n\nLast of all, I\u2019m young. I\u2019m 19 and in college. And while I\u2019ve been in the market for a couple years (I purchased shares through my dad\u2019s account for a few years before I turned 18) I know I don\u2019t know everything about investing. That being said, the majority of my friends do similar things with less lucrative hobbies. They can spend hours looking up prices for limited edition sneakers or rare designer goodies. I feel that\u2019s been normalized for teens and young adults around my age. At the end of the day, I\u2019m just a teenager and I like to believe I\u2019ve taken that consumerism urge and funneled it into a better long term play.\n\nThanks for the comment :)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It's good to hear that it's not an addiction and I'm happy for you that you were able to get interested in investing at such a young age. Hopefully it'll provide you a nice nest egg for whenever you are able to retire. You are correct in that a majority of younger people are focused on the urge for consumerism and, honestly, putting money towards investments is a much more wise choice. \n\nWhen I first started investing, I was completely redirecting my gambling addiction from the casino to the stock market and I'd be checking my portfolio every 5 minutes or so.

{"title": "Manipulation, girls do it, shit posters do it, whales even do it", "selftext": "I am an experienced and seasoned trader, who has proudly turned a small $5,000 investment in January of 2019 into a fortune worth over $5,102. Most of my profits came from following the excellent DD on this sub, realizing I had lost nearly all of my money, and then getting really lucky playing biotech stocks right around COVID. At the height of my investing career I had turned that $5,000 into around $10,000 plus or minus $5,000.\n\nYesterday a realization dawned on me. I looked back at my comment history on a since deleted account and found that I had credulously bought into hundreds of plays based on TA and hype from ostensibly honest posters - people who positioned themselves as men of the people who wanted us all to succeed. I had to ask myself *if all of these people wanted me to succeed, why did I keep _losing money_ every time I followed their advice?*\n\nThe realization was this: I, boy genius, had been had by a pack of charlatans. These posters were not in fact benign and kind hearted genius day traders with brilliant plays based on scientific and technical analysis. Their DD may have been long and full of many colorful charts with arrows and candles and awesome phrases; but their hearts were empty and their premises were naught but lies!\n\nRather than trying to make *me* rich, they were fattening me - and people like me - up for the proverbial slaughter. Like so many suckered before me, I had nodded my head, opened my wallet, and bought whatever they told me: PLTR, AMC, NIO, GLD, SLV, AAL, the list goes on.\n\nSure *maybe* my account would become turgid for a few glittering moments but it never climaxed into a blizzard of cocaine and Benjamins as the posters promised. Usually I was left watching my options bleed on the daily as the initial frenzy of interest by retail mongoloids diminished and the dumb money flooded into the next frenzied promise.. time and time again.. time and time again.\n\nSo now that I have wizened myself to this treacherous game, I want to know. How do you identify the GOOD tips from the BAD tips. How do we know when a poster on here has the goods?\n\nEdit: does the wholesome award mean you think I'm dumb?\n\nEdit 2: I guess, obligatory this has blown up. I am forever thankful to live in an age where a post that took five minutes to write can touch so many lives. To everyone who appreciated my writing style, thank you! I have been honing my writing with a strict regime of alcohol infusions directly into my brain cells, having explosive writing sessions on the toilet between 3 and 7 am, and of course many, many shit posts here and on yahoo answers.\n\nMost of you have heard my earnest and sincere call to stop the shills and been supportive and kind. For a subreddit where we proudly call ourselves disabled, coke addicted, lower order primates; this is truly high praise. I would be remiss if I failed to mention that I really believe WSB is one of the last bastions of what I consider the spirit of the internet. A place where pale nerds can role-play being whatever they want.. maybe you're a successful trader or a busty Japanese sailor.. it doesn't really matter and we will support you either way. \n\nTo the many people I earnestly offended with this post and to those who had their ability to recognize _any_ satire surgically removed so you could memorize more shitty tickers to shill; bite it. Nibble it a little but then just chomp down on it. At this point it is mostly calloused raw hide anyway. If your jaw gets tired from chewing on this dick call your mother and ask her why her own jaw is wired shut. I'll give you a hint, it's not because she fell off a chair when she realized her son was a rage addicted internet badass. I'm not sure exactly what happened but I really hope she gets better soon. If I can do anything let me know. \n\nMy only hope is that we can keep this fantastic community together - not as apes but as unaffiliated degenerates who lose more than they can afford and occasionally win more than they deserve.\n\nNow as for me, I'm going to be spending the rest of the afternoon finally learning how to trade options, which thanks to dozens of posts I now realize I totally suck ass at trading. \n\nGod bless you and may you all get exactly what you deserve. \n\n- PayMe2Shill4U", "id": "oqngq7", "created_utc": 1627122498.0, "score": 5641, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 655, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|55|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe only tangentially related, but there's a rise in cheerleading.

Most of them are down between 30 to 90% Most of my money is invested in real estate or in private businesses that I have a stake in But with the pandemic I decided to learn more about investing in stocks and options both for the excitement and for the possibility for rapid gains. But first I had to learn that it also means possibility of rapid losses. Cheering for a stock that you hold and are hoping to make money\n regardless of any actual underlying fundamentals is fun for me. I\u2019m already holding the bag so I figure well at least get some thrill out of owning it. Like I paid hundreds of dollars for a good seat at the game.\n\nI learned a lot from this about how to figure out when people are pumping something or making the DD fit their thesis. Often in the comments section I will get better hints and leads on ideas. I often find these commenters are the most reserved and brief.\n\nSome of the DD would be someone who did not get a lot of upvotes or positive comments. Those he did I would look at their post history as well. I would look up the company they\u2019re talking about and they\u2019ve never really been mentioned here but the poster has a history of posting DD in advance of what turned out to be a good play and then got more buzz, as did their positive commenters. Of course more buzz only once it started printing and then from people with a much more checkered history.  AVPT is a recent example.\n\nSo now I feel like my moves started with reading maybe an hour a day or two of this place per Move to sifting through a much higher ratio to get one idea that I pursue. Trying to find decent videos on YouTube that are not hype but didactic / instructional. Doing some reading and studying to understand things beyond a superficial level. Compared to how I started, more recently I have at least broke even and some that have done very well by which I mean up 20 to 50% 2-6 weeks. \n\nOf course I would like to be able to or consistently get similar gains in a shorter timeframe and occasionally a big gain But my mindset has changed from somebody\u2019s going to tip me off here to Seeing 10%, 20%, 15%, nice 30%, With a lower ratio of similar losses to at least once, woah! 1000% . I am up to 80% invested 20% still in cash but despite the early severe losses in my first option plays and bag holding some stock overall I\u2019m up 24% since March.

Haven\u2019t done the math yet but here\u2019s my basic thought process. 5% allocation into leveraged inverse ETF LEAPS or leveraged VIX could provide the same downside protection as 10% into regular VIX LEAPS or long dated SPY puts.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.058492086827754974}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.058492086827754974}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04981160908937454}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3452454209327698}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32920145988464355}], "tickers": ["bubble", "recovery", "crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25882115960121155}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5223265886306763}, {"body": "I haven\u2019t fact checked this but I read that every year there is an average of at least three 5% pullbacks and 2021 has not seen 1 yet", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "It's actually 7 20% pullbacks, 4 30% increases and one pull out on your mom's ass", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "You never pull out of the ass, puts on your sex life", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Dude the ass is like nature's condom.

From under $6 a share to over $90 a share is a huge achievement, especially in this market.\n\nAs we all know that AMD has been eating away at INTC server market share for a while now. It's about time that things should start getting accelerated, especially how INTC has failed to overcome their challenges with 7nm process etc.\n\nAMD's ER is coming up on Tuesday, and I am against playing a binary event. There are simply too many factors in play. For instance, the FOMC meeting is in the same week, J Powell is speaking on Wednesday, which usually means a red day for market before the event.\n\nI really think that AMD is long overdue for  a boost to $100+ and it should happen soon after their ER.
