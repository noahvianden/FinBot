Basically its the level of particles in the water. Tap is usually just chemically treated (fluoride) to kill bacteria. This is the minimum safety standard for drinking. Reverse osmosis removes some minerals but not all and is between 95% and 99% pure h2o (gets worse as filters clog and such). Fully purified is basically 100% water and is temperature treated (boiled).\n\nTap and reverse osmosis pretty much taste the same, at least it does to me. Purified however tastes very different. Which one you prefer is up to you but in terms of safety, purified is by far, the safest form of water and no, you cannot achieve that with a reverse osmosis system.\n\nTap water is usually fine, especially for cooking, but the problem is its run by government... government is not always reliable precisely because their lives dont depend on it. They get paid no matter what and that makes them lazy. There is no profit and loss to worry about. Not trying to scare people from government water, historically they have done a great job, but even in the USA, there have been times when water is tainted, most recently in Michigan not too long ago.\n\nBasically some politicians wanted to cut costs and shift money to some other businesses (who likely paid them), and they did that by cutting funding to water because they felt it was a waste of money... End result was a disaster and poisoned water. It happens. Even in 1st world nations. Sometimes its an accident. Sometimes its a business dumping toxins in a nearby water source.\n\nDont know about you, but I have a wife and 3 kids. I am not going to gamble on their health over $30/month... Ill take the purified water. Also, as matter of opinion, it tastes so much better to me. Though for the record, I actually think tap water tastes better in coffee and I use it for cooking.

You can get big reusable bottles instead of small disposable bottles. \n\nBut if you are going out you need small bottles and thats true regardless of what you are drinking. So unless you are always bringing your own drink, then its either plastic or glass or aluminum and between them, plastic is least dangerous and highly reusable and recyclable too.\n\nSo in other words, your problem isnt with the plastic per se, its with the people who litter. Take the fight to them. Removing plastics will not change what these people do. They will always litter. These are the same a-holes who throw their cigs and paper wrappers on the floor, let their dogs poop anywhere and dont clean up, dump their car oil in the drain, and throw their old couch on someone elses property. These people are the problem.\n\nAs for reverse osmosis filters, they are great but again, its nearly impossible for that small thing you put on the faucet to be as effective as what you get in commercial bottles. Its just not reasonable unless you spend a good amount on a reverse osmosis system and even then, you will not get distilled level purity and you really need to be on top of replacing the filters and we both know that on average, people forget them. \n\nAgain, back to risk vs reward.

{"title": "Amazon is Officially Lobbying on Cannabis", "selftext": "On June 1, Amazon became the largest and most mainstream company in the world to support the end of federal cannabis prohibition in the United States.\u00a0\n\nThe company [announced](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/06/08/amazon-human-rights-watch-push-for-more-act-%e2%80%a2-washington-regulators-ok-joints-as-vaccine-incentive-%e2%80%a2-more/) that it would stop drug testing its employees for cannabis use, unless they hold positions under the purview of the Department of Transportation, and that its \u201cpublic policy team will be actively supporting The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act)\u2014federal legislation that would legalize marijuana at the federal level, expunge criminal records, and invest in impacted communities.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday, *Cannabis Wire* has found, the company has officially put its lobbying muscle behind these statements. Early Wednesday morning, \u200bAmazon.com Services LLC [registered](https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/532894c6-bc65-4e48-b7e9-8c2747fa5426/print/) to lobby, among other topics, on: \u201cIssues related to the Equality Act (H.R. 5 / S. 393), the Justice in Policing Act (H.R. 1280), and marijuana reform, including the MORE Act of 2021 (H.R. 3617).\u201d\n\nThe MORE Act was reintroduced in Congress in May, as [*Cannabis Wire* recently reported](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/05/28/more-act-bill-to-end-the-federal-criminalization-of-cannabis-reintroduced-in-congress/). The House passed the previous version of the Act in late 2020, as [*Cannabis Wire* reported at the time](https://cannabiswire.com/2020/12/04/in-historic-vote-us-house-passes-more-act-to-end-the-federal-criminalization-of-cannabis/).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCannabis reform advocates have largely shifted their energy toward the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA), announced this month by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden. While both MORE and CAOA would end the federal criminalization of cannabis by removing it from the federal Controlled Substances Act, MORE offers little else in the way of regulation. Conversely, as *Cannabis Wire* [recently reported](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/07/14/sens-schumer-wyden-and-booker-release-most-comprehensive-cannabis-reform-proposal-yet-here-are-the-details/), CAOA is the most comprehensive cannabis reform proposal to-date in Congress. The Senators have also taken the unprecedented approach of releasing a discussion draft of their bill, which provides specific regulatory details, ahead of drafting the final legislation.\n\n*Cannabis Wire* has reached out to Amazon to learn more about its lobbying priorities related to cannabis, and will update the story accordingly.\n\n[https://cannabiswire.com/2021/07/21/amazon-is-officially-lobbying-on-cannabis/](https://cannabiswire.com/2021/07/21/amazon-is-officially-lobbying-on-cannabis/)", "id": "oovo6t", "created_utc": 1626891423.0, "score": 1257, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "Amazon about to start delivering weed through prime.", "score": 930, "replies": [{"body": "Should they not test this in Canada first.

Possibly with Genre and the ability to mark things to remove eg watched and don't watch.\n\nAlso a list of new content added.\n\nThey also tend to have a messed up favorites. like I would scroll down the list and add items to a watch queue. Can't do that either. You have to manually remove things from the watch queue after watching them and for series if you complete them. the would loop back to the start be in the queue. So you would remove them only to have to figure out manually again then the new season of something was released. Rather than just have it pop-up into the watch queue again.\n\nAnother problem I always noticed was the signal to noise ratio. They are laid out as a thumbnail grid. Typically 4 rows and 4-5 columns wide. That means you only get 20 titles max per page. Often with duplications between the rows and things you have already seen.\n\nI can understand why some people need big thumbnail etc... But there should be options in the to display more per page. It seems to be forever scrolling to look for stuff.\n\nI actually found it faster to use an external site. Then search directly for the item i wanted rather than use their UI. When people are doing that in a system it should be setting off alarm bells and their end of things.\n\nEither way I have detatched from the film industry mostly these days. I havn't actually watched anything on TV or a streaming service in about a year. It wasn't like I decided one day that was going to be the case. I simple got bored and did other things.... The modern content is pathetic and boring mostly (netflix price increases didn't help their case here either). Went down the route of games for entertainment. Mostly very complex simulation games and lots of multiplayer. So things like farming simulator, truck simulator, racing games, combat simulation, complex puzzle games like satisfactory.\n\nI doubt netflix will be able to deliver games like these in a new platform other than a reseller. But for these games even platforms like the xbox / ps5 ain't going to run a lot of the engines. They simply are not powerful enough.\n\nThe main difference there is the price per hour is way better value as well. Some of the games are working out at consumer prices of less than 1p per hour etc... also you get to interact with you story line all the time. You become part of it in most cases. In other cases you are the story line or you get to make the story lines for others and in return they make a story line for you to play out.

This article was written 5 years ago. It's not like Tesla knew they were going to release subscriptions in 6 months after this was written and has done this all to screw people out of $1,000.

And that has resulted in a public backlash in the couple of years. It resulted in a drop of subscribers on this platform and giving easier competition to other services. However, Netflix also makes great shows (1:10/20)  that gains bigger audition - Seaspiracy, The Medici, Witcher etc. But my gut tells that Netflix is not going to stop with its liberal ideology and propaganda and that will cause bigger drop of subscribers, thus drop in the price per share;\n3) New mastadons have joined the game with enormous projects - Disney+ with Marvel shows and movies that will gain millions of subscribers in the next couple of years, Amazon with its LOTR project - if it will succeed, it might turn into the greatest success story, HBO+ with Game of Thrones universe - if they also succeed and actually make those shows, they could easily surpass Netflix in popularity and subscribers. \n4) What I want to say, is that if Netflix doesn't get a grip and doesn't come up with something mind-blowing (one Witcher is not going to be enough) in the next 1-2 years, it will get outshined by everyone else which will simply take over the market and people (one GoT alone). \n5) So, while your prediction is somewhat right, 1-7 years is far too big window to plan any investments.

It is how you short a stock. You would borrow them and sell them to market (which pushes the stock price down) then you buy shares back at a lower price and return the borrowed share pocketing the difference as profit. There are only so many shares available to borrow. The institutions that loan out these shares charge an interest rate that increases as the shares become scarce. That is the Cost to Borrow. When a stock becomes over shorted interesting things can tend to happen when the price goes up. The shorts would lose money if they sell high so they tend to hold until the price goes back down. But they have to pay that interest rate for holding the borrowed share. If the price keeps going up they may decide to cut losses and buy back at a loss adding to buying pressure and helping the stock price rise. If there are not many shares available to buy or not many people are looking to sell you can end up in a short squeeze where the price rockets upwards as hedge funds that were shorting the stock panic buy out of the trade.

{"title": "How to ALWAYS GAIN in options, proven my math and science.", "selftext": "\nHere is some mathematical model to always win on option plays no matter how dumb you are if you follow these simple rules: \n\n1) when you are at a loss, you need to average down. To do this, just keep buying the same dates strike over and over until you are the only volume in that strike and have total monopoly to price it however you want it. (Bonus: B***inga writes \u201cunusual option activity at $XYZ\u201d article)\n\n2) if you don\u2019t win playing \u201csafe\u201d bets on blue chips where you are convinced your 10% OTM $AMZN option expiring in 8 days (thus technically being a LEAP rather than weeklie since week is 7 days) just simply accept your failure and go back to where you truly belong: $SPY FDs\n\n3) doing DD helps you make better choices. So do just that- I\u2019ll show you scientific way to do the best DD. 1) open RobinHood, 2) click \u201csearch icon\u201d, 3) click the \u201cdaily movers list\u201d, 4) buy the stock with biggest green number. This way you are alway buying the best stocks. \n\n4) good motivation is key to success. filter out all the gain post in WSB and only look at loss porn. Be glad that you\u2019re only down 8k and not 27k like the retard\u2019s post. This gives you sense that \u201cat least I\u2019m not that bad.\u201d\n\n5) make sure to alway have a stop sell at -10% and watch the underlying just kiss it to trigger sell before having the greatest run to hit ATH.\n\n6) make sure to have a limit sell at 100% and watch the underlying go past it like butter on knife and somehow feel bad about loss of penitential profit over the gain for few days where you get FOMO and end up losing that 100% gain.\n\n7) make weird random rules that you almost never follow and when you get a massive loss day- simply blame that \u201cI didn\u2019t follow my rule and lost\u201d. This gives you excuse to how you can still make money with your non existent rules and you\u2019re lack of actual DD was not the problem.\n\n8) refuse to post any loss on WSB and wait until you get 10% gain on your losing position before posting the image proudly as \u201call in YOLO no fear!!!\u201d Everyone will know if you made gain or loss depending on if you post a a update or not. \n\n9) POV: you learned what options were 3 months ago and have pretty good idea of what \u2018strike\u2019 means and you\u2019re pretty sure something called \u201ctheta gang\u201d is the bad guy making you lose. But anytime a noob asks \u201cwhat\u2019s option guys?\u201d You will be the first to answer: \u201cit\u2019s a right but not a obligation to buy...\u201d\n\n10) POV: you are a veteran WSB retard that lost account password and had to post pictures of cats and dogs to beg for karma for new account to have threshold for posting.

Forget stop losses and short term thinking. I have just 2 steps to success in options:\n\n1. Buy options - but only, I repeat only when Bloomberg officially announces that we\u2019re in a recession - officially per definition. By then we\u2019ve already been in a recession for a few months. \nException - when something unusual happens to an individual company you\u2019ve been following for 10 years, like say BABA being so cheap, or ADSK having an implied volatility in the 20s while they\u2019re set for immense growth. \n\n2. Only buy calls, only 2year OTM LEAPS. Buy half or third position. 100% percent guaranteed that the value of your options will be down about 50% shortly after you buy, this is my guarantee. When that happens buy the second half of the position for half the price. It might go down again, you could then double down or just wait. It won\u2019t matter in 2 years.\n\nThere is just one more thing - and this is the most important of all. Only buy for a company that you\u2019ve been following for 5 or 10 years, and only a company not susceptible to new tech disruption and in a market  that it dominates by 30% or more so not susceptible to competition, with a competitive advantage stronger than carbide and a competitive advantage that no one knows about fully. During the course of a decade there will be an amazing deal in plain sight and it will go unnoticed for months to a year. You can then feel confident to keep doubling down because their earnings and revenues are growing double digit. You will really feel the pain in options when price falls. But with this approach you will instead be filled with excitement when the price falls because to you it\u2019s just marked down on sale. Because as it posts double digit growth, the price action won\u2019t matter.
