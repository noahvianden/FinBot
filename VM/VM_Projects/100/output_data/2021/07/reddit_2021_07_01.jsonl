Opened three contracts of QQQ 07/16/2021 345.00 350.00 DCS on various dates\n2. Closed the first contract of QQQ 07/16/2021 345.00 350.00 DCS to ring the register @ Cr 3.75, when the total cost of the three QQQ 07/16/2021 345.00 350.00 DCS was Db 3.50. Thus, I am up 0.25 on closing this alone, since it paid for all three contracts\n3. Rollout the second contract to QQQ 07/09/2021 360.00 365.00 DCS, where I get a Cr 3.18 (Cr 3.78 to close - Db 0.70 to open). Did a rollout up and *in*, in order to make a bigger bet, since it is a free bet\n4. Rollout the third contract to QQQ 07/16/2021 360.00 365.00 DCS, where I get a Cr 2.67 (Cr 3.76 to close - Db 1.09 to open). Did a rollout up, since I don't get the gamma upside from the ITM 345/350 spread\n\nEven if the last two contracts go to $0, my net is $6.10:\n\n* Cost: Db 1.48 + Db 1.27 + Db 0.75 = Db 3.50\n* Gain: Cr 3.75 + Cr 3.18 + Cr 2.67 = Cr 9.60\n* Net: 9.60 - 3.50 = 6.10\n\nIf QQQ keeps melting up, then it is all gravy for me.\n\nRollouts are in net no different than closing and opening a new position, with two distinct advantages:\n\n1. One commission fee per rollout vs. two fees to close and open\n2. You are guaranteed the price, thus reducing the risk of losing to arbitrage\n\nSchwab StreetSmart Edge makes this even easier because of the *Walking Limit* feature. When I did those rollouts, I started from Cr 4.00 and had the computer cancel and resubmit a new order 0.01 lower, every two seconds, so that I always get the best price at that time\n\n^(DCS = Debit Call Spread, Db = Debit, Cr = Credit)", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Great example.

As such, if you both take profits and cut losses at 30% (and anything less in either direction doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 taking 10% profits on options may not even cover what you lose to commissions and bid/ask spreads) you will slowly but surely blow up your account. \n\nBut let\u2019s say that, instead, you make 10 trades, investing $100 in each for a total investment of $1000.

Insomnia had 54% of 2020 revenue come from e-commerce. KK had 18%.We don't know how big Insomnia's revenue is (from S-1: \"\\[KK\\] consolidates the financial results of Insomnia\"), but this ape has a couple wrinkles in his brain to do some quick math:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Insomnia sold 65 million cookies in 2020. KK sold 1.3B donuts, or about 20x the donuts vs cookies.\n* However, Insomnia charges $21 for a basic dozen cookies, vs $7.99 for a dozen at KK. We'll call this 3x the price for easy math.\n* 20 / 3 = KK has \\~6.7x more revenue than Insomnia, or 13% of revenue is Insomnia.\n* This ape thinks is a low estimate because it doesn't take delivery or shipping revenue into account, so let's say that Insomonia Cookies are \\~15% of $DNUT revenue.\n\nWhy is this important to other apes? Because Insomnia Cookies are going to the moon, even if the donuts aren't. From DNUT's investor presentation: \n\n>Insomnia Cookies opened 17 locations in 2020 and has plans to open 30 stores in 2021. The company locations offer delivery up to 30 minutes. The company plans to offer next-day delivery in the future, covering a larger percentage of the U.S. market.\n\ne-Commerce capabilities also give a company ability to drive lower margins than 100% traditional brick and mortar. And with KK is investing heavily into their most e-Commerce heavy, growing brand (Insomnia Cookies), this could help growth both their revenue growth and bottom-line performance.\n\n**TL;DR:** Apes buy the DNUT but  hold for the cookie.\n\n^(edit: formatting)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6187803745269775}, {"body": "anyone buying puts on Krispy Kreme?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4616182744503021}, {"body": "If they sell them through school fund raisers that should say something in itself.

{"title": "The BEST Palantir Analysis Around!", "selftext": "**Valuation: Undervalued**\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary:***\n\n\u00b7 Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactly what Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.\n\no I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.\n\n\u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.\n\no The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.\n\n\u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual.\n\no There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section.\n\no Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.\n\n***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***\n\n[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.\n\nHowever, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.\n\n*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d.*\n\n[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find \u201cneedles in thousands of haystacks\u201d. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus\u2019 business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled \u201cPalantir Foundry\u201d.\n\n[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.\n\nPalantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.\n\nLastly, Palantir has stated \u201cWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.\u201d\n\n***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***\n\n*Palantir Foundry:*\n\nFoundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry\u2019s platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.\n\nFoundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.\n\nFoundry\u2019s front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.\n\n*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*\n\n**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**\n\n*Palantir Gotham:*\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.\n\nGotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.\n\nThere is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d.\n\nLastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi Scheme).\n\n*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*\n\n*Palantir\u2019s Approach:*\n\nPalantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.\n\nPalantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.\n\nPalantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.\n\n*Palantir Success Stories:*\n\n**BP:**\n\nPerhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP \u2013 British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)\n\nBP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.\n\nPalantir\u2019s Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)\n\nThis increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir\u2019s software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.\n\nThis type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir\u2019s best chance at becoming the next \u201ctech giant\u201d comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).\n\n**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS):**\n\nPalantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.\n\nThe NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH\u2019s), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.\n\nPalantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan\u2019s NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.\n\nBoth of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir\u2019s software.\n\n*Sources:*\n\n[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)\n\n*Strengths:*\n\n**Built-in Privacy Controls:**\n\nBy having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their \u201cOperating System\u201d, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.\n\nPalantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.\n\n**Government Grade Security:**\n\nAs we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.\n\nThis is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**\n\nThis level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.\n\n**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**\n\nPalantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.\n\nPalantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.\n\n*Government Contracts:*\n\nDo you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.\n\nBetween 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir\u2019s commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for \u201cbigger bucks\u201d, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients \u201cleft, right, and center\u201d.\n\nThese contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.\n\n*Business Model:*\n\nPalantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.\n\n1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.\n2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter.\n3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%\n\n*Financial information:*\n\nAll of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.\n\n\u00b7 **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%.\n\n\u00b7 **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.\n\n\u00b7 **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.\n\n\u00b7 **RSU\u2019s:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).\n\n\u00b7 **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.\n\n\u00b7 **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.\n\n*Explanation of Share Dilution:*\n\nOnce again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).\n\nOn September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir\u2019s convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.\n\nWithout these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.\n\n*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*\n\nPalantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?\n\nFor starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.\n\n*Competition:*\n\nIn order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.\n\n[**$ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).\n\n[**$SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.\n\n[**$SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients\u2019 data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.\n\n[**$TYL \u2013 Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.\n\n*Q1 2021 Updates:*\n\nAll of the below information can be found in [Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).\n\nRecently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir\u2019s financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir\u2019s trajectory even more.\n\nFirst and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.\n\nFurthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC \u2013 Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)\n\nIn Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.\n\nLastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.\n\n***$PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation:***\n\n*Comparable Analyses:*\n\nI decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nThis is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.\n\n*Average Comparable:*\n\nBy taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.\n\n***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***\n\nMy plan for this investment is a little different from usual.\n\nI see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.\n\nHowever, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.\n\n***Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR:***\n\n\u00b7 **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.\n\n\u00b7 **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir\u2019s reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir\u2019s stock could get hurt as a result of it.\n\n***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir\u2019s Stock Price:***\n\n\u00b7 **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.\n\n\u00b7 **Financial Performance:** Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.\n\n\u00b7 **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.\n\n\u00b7 **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.\n\n\u00b7 **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports.\n\n\u00b7 **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.\n\n*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&utm_medium=B&utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*", "id": "obn698", "created_utc": 1625150253.0, "score": 685, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 216, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|20|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obn698/the_best_palantir_analysis_around/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzmrc9/everything_to_know_about_workhorse_and_why_you/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzn4k0/everything_you_need_to_know_about_workhorse_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzmwyg/everything_you_need_to_know_about_wkhs_and_why/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0egp9/nio_is_currently_properly_valued_and_has/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0elga/nio_is_worth_looking_in_to_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4vlbp/the_hype_around_amd_is_very_understandable/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1xk4z/everything_you_need_to_know_about_tsla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1xnop/everything_you_need_to_know_about_tesla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxgi6s/nakd_is_not_for_bares_dd/) \n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3932788074016571}, {"body": "This confirms my bias even more. \n\nI would give an award but all my money is in PLTR", "score": 197, "replies": [{"body": "I don't mind, respect goes out to you!!", "score": 35, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17982076108455658}, {"body": "Just put 19 grand in pltr", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "I had 19k when it was at 44, now I have like 6k", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15504081547260284}, {"body": "Thats a lot", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17644350230693817}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13007104396820068}, {"body": "OP does have some decent [timing](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:Lost-Guarantee229) on meme stocks, a true connoisseur.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "I also exited some of those position, which you can see on my Utradea account [here](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&utm_medium=B&utm_campaign=PLTR), it gives a better idea of my total returns based off of these ideas.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "This is also just one of my many accounts on their platform, the other one with more reddit type stocks is \"WallStreetWhale\"", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33342862129211426}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24885378777980804}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09708492457866669}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19411727786064148}, {"body": "People are fucking retards...

{"title": "Calling all underwriters/mortgage people who were working in 2008", "selftext": "Everyone is saying housing bubble. I don't think this is the case. This seems like dispersion of populace to me to greener pastures. Rates were so low that even if people bought at 50% markup, they got a good deal if they hold 10 years+. The real question here is: how many of the mortgages you came across looked sub prime to you? Are we repeating history again or did most people have reasonable incomes working in stable jobs like tech? If we are not giving out subprime mortgages like candy this time around, then the housing bubble is just starting. Many older people saw their 401k's and portfolios go 2x-4x since covid. Many people will be retiring early and leaving the major cities for slower rural life with the occasional remote consulting gig. It feels more like a populace dispersion than a housing bubble, the real bubble was renting in major cities.

{"title": "The Fed in a Box, Part 2: They cannot end Quantitative Easing: The recent fall in long-term rates may have been by design and is probably transitory", "selftext": "This article first appeared on SchiffGold on Monday and also appeared on ZeroHedge this morning.\n\n# 3 Key Takeaways\n\n1. If the Fed tapers QE, it may reveal waning appetite for long-term treasuries\n2. The Treasury may have used its cash balance reserve to anchor inflation expectations\n3. If inflation persists, the Fed may have to increase rather than decrease QE\n\n*Note: By definition,* ***inflation*** *is an expansion of the money supply. In this article inflation will be used interchangeably with rising prices (usually as a result of money supply expansion)*\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhen the economy was shut down in March 2020, the government responded with massive fiscal and monetary support. The fiscal stimulus totaled $4T+ in relief packages. All of this spending was paid for with debt being issued by the Treasury. The Treasury mostly issued short-term debt. With rates being held at zero by the Fed, and strong demand for short-term debt, it made sense to quickly raise cash using Treasury Bills as interest free loans.\n\nThe Fed monetary policy was two fold, slash short-term rates to zero and inject $1.5 trillion into the long-term debt treasury market. The effect was to bring down interest rates across the entire yield curve. After the initial debt binge, QE changed to auto-pilot, buying about $80B a month in long-term debt (plus another $40B in Mortgage debt). Over the last year, the Treasury has continued to issue long-term debt, averaging more than the $80B the Fed has been buying. This has caused long-term rates to rise.\n\nAll of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost. Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation. The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation, but this is not true. This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices. To actually fight inflation, the Fed would have to increase short-term rates above the rate of inflation. [Part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/) of this series went into detail about how US short-term debt has doubled from $2.5T to $4.5T. This makes even small changes in short-term rates an immediate risk to the federal government, not to mention the much higher rates needed in a true inflation fight.\n\nIn theory the Fed could leave short-term rates at 0% but end QE and even shrink its balance sheet, pushing long-term rates up to combat inflation. In the short/medium term the Treasury can mathematically handle higher long-term rates because it takes time for the higher rates to work its way through long-term debt. See the chart below that shows how the last tightening cycle worked its way through the average interest rate across debt instrument. Specifically look at Notes compared to Bills. The average weighted interest rate on Bills moved very quickly where the rate on Notes barely had time to increase before rates dropped again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 1: Source - Treasurydirect.gov  ](https://preview.redd.it/y67gsfsntn871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=03abb3684cd9e77a39a9b9a8d66aed14eeb5de4b)\n\nAlthough the Treasury could handle rising long-term rates (even if the economy and mortgage market cannot), the Fed has another problem. Rising long-term rates send an important message: rising inflation expectations. While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy, higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem. This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory. They need to keep inflation expectations low! If inflation expectations were to rise, especially at this critical juncture, it would be game over for the Fed, as they would have to raise short-term rates (devastating the Treasury and economy) in order to save the dollar and squash inflation.\n\nWith the economy opening up in March of this year, things were getting very precarious as inflation was rapidly rising along with surging long-term rates. Remember that rising long-term rates indicate rising inflation expectations. This could cause transitory inflation to be much less transitory.\n\nIn summer 2020, the Treasury issued enough debt to build up a significant cash reserve. In response to rising long-term rates in Q1 2021, it appears the Treasury strategically used its cash reserves to slow down the issuance of long-term debt. With total short-term debt outstanding already so high, the cash balance gave the Treasury ammunition to decrease debt issuance just as a $1.9T stimulus bill was passed and inflation was set to explode higher. This would have been perfect timing to support the Feds narrative that inflation is transitory to keep expectations from snowballing out of control.\n\nIf inflation doesn\u2019t slow in the coming months, the Fed may be forced to step in. With the Treasury poised to issue more debt, it can no longer rely on its one time use of excess cash reserves. This will put more pressure on the Fed to clamp down long-term rates by increasing rather than decreasing QE. Yes, the Fed may decide to print more money (leading to higher prices) to fight rising inflation expectations (higher long-term interest rates).\n\n# Understanding recent fiscal and monetary maneuvers\n\nLast year when the pandemic hit, the US Government started spending Trillions of dollars. Massive spending plans were approved in the name of stimulus and Covid relief. Because the Government does not have much money on hand, and taxes cannot quickly be raised, the Treasury issued trillions in debt. The markets can easily absorb short-term US Treasury Bills, so when the Fed abruptly cut rates to 0%, the Treasury responded by issuing short-term debt to the tune of $2.4T from March to June 2020. See figure 1 below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 2: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/9mj1tldztn871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3333ceed4af61368ecdae363a6282ec42ef8af63)\n\nIn tandem, the Fed bought up trillions of dollars in US Debt, but the Fed was buying on the long end of the curve while the Treasury was issuing debt on the short end. This caused long-term rates to collapse. The Fed purchased enough long-term debt to absorb more than a years worth of long-term debt issuance. The chart below, shows how the month over month and cumulative change in the Feds balance sheet compared to the Treasury Debt Issuance of long-term notes and bonds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 3: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/txm25ha3un871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4928c449ceb56b5143bc6dcbd9ae805748c193a)\n\nThis action by the Fed had a massive impact on long-term rates. The chart below shows the difference between the two bars above, specifically the difference in Fed Buying and Treasury issuance of long-term debt for each individual month since Jan 2020. These values are not cumulative. The right Y-Axis shows the the month-end interest rate of the 10 year bond. Looking at this chart shows something extremely clear: When the Fed buying exceeds debt issuance, rates are flat or falling; however, when long-term debt issuance surpasses the Feds buying, rates rise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[  Figure 4: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/2kmvdvo5un871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8560cdd7a3c67c78c185c9d847265a4d578c24e0)\n\nThe impact of the Fed can first be seen as interest rates fell from 1.5% to .6% during the initial buying spree. After the initial burst, the Fed put QE on auto-pilot, buying \u201conly\u201d $80B a month in long-term treasuries. However, because the Treasury was issuing more than $80B a month as depicted by the positive bars starting in June 2020, interest rates started rising.\n\nThis trend started to accelerate in November of 2020, as long-term debt issuance was outpacing Fed Buying by around $200B. Things really started to escalate in the first quarter of 2021 as Treasury Debt issuance surpassed Fed buying by $286B in March right as interest rates were crossing above 1.7%.\n\nThen, suddenly, long-term debt issuance started falling in April and was almost even with Fed buying in May. This consequently led to a fall in long-term rates, which are now hovering back around 1.5%. How did this happen just as Biden was pushing through a $1.9T stimulus package? Unlike 2020 when short-term debt issuance was used to plug the gap, Figure 1 above shows that Short-Term debt issuance was actually turning negative (blue bars). What gives?\n\nOne look at the Treasury Cash Balance sheet in the chart below tells almost the entire story. This was first highlighted by a [SchiffGold article](https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/why-are-us-treasury-bond-sales-are-about-to-spike/) published June 16. The chart below shows a massive surge in Cash reserves by the treasury last year. Since March of this year, the cash balance has plummeted by over $1T.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 5: Source - Treasurydirect.gov ](https://preview.redd.it/stucdov9un871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=44c7ce2c570ed26e4db39863bf1cfd6a2d5f3bdc)\n\n# Inflation Expectations\n\nWhy such a massive and sudden draw down in the cash balance? In truth there could be lots of reasons, but it does seem extremely sudden. One would think the Treasury, led by Yellen, would be very deliberate and thoughtful about how to use up $1T+ in dry powder. For the past 3 months the Fed has been shouting from the rooftops that inflation is transitory. At the June FOMC press conference, Powell stood up and explained how long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. A proxy for inflation expecations is long-term interest rates.\n\nHad interest rates continued to rise similar to the recent trajectory (climbing from .8% in Nov to 1.7% in March), this would have been a difficult narrative to push. The Fed *needs* inflation expectations to remain in check or else inflation will be anything but transitory. Thus, the perfect time for the Treasury to pause issuance of long-term debt would be April-June 2021 just as the economy is re-opening and the Fed is forecasting inflation to be at its worst before coming back down.\n\nWhile this is speculation, it would be a very strategic move from both Powell and Yellen. Regardless of the intention though, the problem is that the Treasury has now spent its large cash balance. It could return to the short-term debt market, but the outstanding balance is still sitting above $4T (see [part 1](https://schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/the-fed-in-a-box-part-1/)). It needs to be converting that short-term debt to long-term debt while long-term interest rates are still low and the Fed is still buying. But the Fed is simply not buying enough at $80B to convert all that debt!\n\nIf inflation persists beyond a few months, then interest rates are going to rise in a hurry as the market demands higher rates. Adding fuel to the fire will be the Treasury debt issuance overwhelming the $80B Fed buying as it did from November to March. Then what? Who is absorbing the long-term debt to keep interest rates from returning to the upward trajectory from Aug 2020 - Mar 2021?\n\nInternational creditors have had little appetite for US Debt lately. The chart below shows the total outstanding debt held by foreign governments. In the past 15 months, while the Treasury has issued over $4T in new debt, **the net amount bought by foreign governments is close to zero**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 6: Source - https:\\/\\/ticdata.treasury.gov\\/Publish\\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/7lm5dzscun871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ebeca942362107b6f17d075ce583ee230ac7206)\n\nTo zoom into the exact amount of change since the massive debt issuance, see the chart below. In total, foreign creditors have absorbed $120 billion of $6T+ or **less than 2% of total issuance**!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 7: Source - https:\\/\\/ticdata.treasury.gov\\/Publish\\/mfh.txt ](https://preview.redd.it/9zn0ir0hun871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e1186004030730c8e67e5ce1e60333577c8b324)\n\nHow are rates going to stay low if the Fed keeps the treasury buying cap at $80B? The Treasury will have to issue more than $80B in long-term debt to continue funding all the massive spending. If inflation expectations stay low, maybe the market will have enough firepower to ingest some of the new debt, but not all of it. With the Fed planning to begin tapering at the end of the year, someone will need to fill the void of $80B. This does not even consider the possibility of shrinking the Fed balance sheet, which should be considered impossible at this point.\n\nThe chart of the international holders above brings to mind the image of the Wiley Coyote running off a cliff. With 10 year interest rates hovering near 1.5%, one could argue there is strong demand for long-term Treasury debt. Unfortunately, foreign creditors have turned off their debt purchases. It took decades for them to accumulate \\~$7T in Treasury debt. The Fed alone has accumulated more than half that (\\~$4.5T) over the last decade. The Fed is making the market seem strong, but as shown above, there might be nothing but air if they were to exit the market. With a thumb on the scale, no one is getting an accurate reading of true demand for US long-term debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 8: Source - Warner Brothers ](https://preview.redd.it/c90czu1jun871.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c75ecab43d725082df87a58081ba667a4a51fd20)\n\n# What about short-term debt markets?\n\nAs highlighted several times, the demand for short-term debt seems to remain very strong. This makes sense as T-Bills mature in less than a year so these investments are perceived as nearly risk free. In fact, it could be argued that the recent Treasury Bill issuance hiatus (Figure 1 - blue bars turning negative) could be causing the stress in the Reverse Repurchase market. The chart below shows the current Reverse Repurchase market. Based on past quarter end data, it\u2019s very possible that Reverse Repurchases could exceed $1.5T by this coming Wednesday June 30th before coming back down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 9: Source - https:\\/\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\/series\\/RRPONTSYD ](https://preview.redd.it/op6xhqplun871.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=770a48e742389cd11f51e10aee5a2bcc8ef31983)\n\nMany articles have been written to explain this phenomenon, without providing exact clarity on what\u2019s actually going on. The current understanding seems to be that the banks are awash with cash. So much cash, they are hitting the limits in terms of how much cash they can hold on balance overnight. This is cash that should be invested on behalf of money market funds, but with so much cash in the system, if it were to all be invested in short-term debt instruments it could drive rates negative. To avoid negative rates, the Fed is lending banks assets on its balance sheet overnight in exchange for cash. It is critical to avoid negative rates to ensure money market funds **never** experience a loss and result in [breaking the buck](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breaking-the-buck.asp).\n\nMaybe this is a leap too far, but it seems another solution to the Fed reverse repurchase activity could be for the Treasury to issue more short-term debt. So why has the Treasury been drawing down its cash balance and letting short-term debt mature when there seems to be strong demand in the market? The Treasury must recognize the risk in having too much debt in short-term instruments and is trying to lengthen the duration of its debt outstanding. Unfortunately, this abundance of cash in the Repurchase market is in search of low risk *short-term* debt so will not provide demand for long-term debt.\n\nIf this is the case, it has created quite the pickle for the Treasury. By issuing too much short-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to **not** raise short-term interest rates. However, by issuing too much long-term debt, the Treasury is by default putting pressure on the Fed to maintain or even increase Quantitative Easing. To reiterate, this is why it is *imperative* the market believes inflation is transitory. The Treasury cannot stop issuing debt, which leaves the Fed unable to raise rates or taper QE without wreaking havoc in the bond market. Additionally, if the Fed has to fight inflation, then it\u2019s not just the Treasury facing its Wiley Coyote moment, but the entire US economy.\n\n# Wrapping up\n\nWith the economy reopening, the treasury deployed its cash balance at the most opportune time, unless of course inflation numbers continue to increase (which based on all the data, anecdotal evidence, and liquidity in the Repurchase market seems like a strong possibility). Unfortunately for the Fed, the Treasury will have to begin re-issuing debt again. Will it lean towards short-term debt hoping the Fed keeps interest rates low, or long-term debt hoping the Fed will expand QE?\n\nThe Fed may be constrained either way because it has its own problem though. Powell must be praying that inflation readings come in low AND job numbers *disappoint*. If both don\u2019t occur, then tough questions will be asked to justify more stimulus. Yellen and Powell may be best buds, but simple coordination will not be enough. They will need magic and luck to keep the course steady heading into 2H 2021 and 2022.\n\nIf the Fed is lucky enough to get low inflation readings out of its rigged CPI it may provide cover to begin tapering. Rising long-term rates won\u2019t have the same compounding effect on inflation expectations in a \u201clow\u201d inflation environment. Unfortunately though; long-terms rates will not be tenable over the medium term as the government has to finance more and more debt. As the market this year has indicated, when issuance surpasses Fed buying, rates have gone up. So what happens to rates when the Fed leaves the market entirely? Presumably, they go up a lot. How high will the Fed let rates go before re-entering?\n\nJust because something is inevitable (US Debt spiral) does not make it imminent; however, the next six months of data may shine a bright light on all the irresponsibility over the last 12 years if inflation proves not so transitory. Chances are, the only thing transitory will be \u201ctalking about talking about\u201d tapering.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "obufn3", "created_utc": 1625171233.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "#Transitory inflation since 1913", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "FACT!", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10434996336698532}, {"body": "ohh look at the OP\\`s account.

{"title": "Why I'm bearish on $CLNE", "selftext": "Fellow retards,\n\nI don't have a position in $CLNE, so don't honestly care one way or another if anyone reads this, but I work in the natural gas industry for a larger utility company, and have first hand experience with RNG so thought I would share my insight.\n\nRNG is like the crackhead Craigslist of natural gas. In the state that I work in we purchase RNG from 6 suppliers for our gas distribution system, 2 landfill reclamation locations, and 4 large dairy farms, so the cow shit variety. Ever since it was introduced into our pipelines we've had nothing but problems with it.\n\nBiogas comes out dirty as hell, and needs a lot of work to refine and remove contaminants, before it's even usable RNG. It has to have excess moisture and particulate removed, processed to remove carbon dioxide, dinitrogen, organic compounds, siloxanes and a bunch of other gross shit we don't want in our gas.\n\nFarmer John don't know shit about the chemistry of gas, and neither does your trash man. They just know that garbage and cow farts smell like money, and wouldn't know what a gas chromatograph was if they caught it plowing their wife. They open the valve and get the meter spinning on their shitty gas flowing out into the system.\n\nImmediately we started getting water in our gas pipelines due to their poor attempts at meeting the required moisture levels in the RNG. Next was the high levels of sulphur, which fun fact, when combined with the water turned into sulphuric acid, that started eating our steel pipelines from the inside out. We ended up having to replace a few miles of pipeline closest to the worst farm because it caused so much damage before we realized it was happening.\n\nNext came the siloxanes, which turned into this hard white shit when high volumes of the gas were burned. We found this out the hard way, when our largest customer ($CLF) started having plugged orifices on some of their furnaces. I'm not one to kink shame, you can plug whatever orifices you want, but CLF was super not into it, and threatened law suits until we signed an agreement to never send RNG into their systems again.\n\nTLDR: If natural gas was an eightball of cocaine you bought from a dude who only spoke spanish in Miami, RNG is an eightball you bought in a trailer park in North Dakota. It still sort of gets you fucked up, but it cost twice as much and has so much baby laxative in it that you shit your pants the first time you tried to fart.\n\nBearish on cow farts\n\nEdit: well damn my messages blew up with some big mad bagholders. Like I said I have no skin in this game, I was just trying to share the other side of the pump based on RL knowledge about the product. My company is still using the RNG in some of our systems, but it's only because of the carbon offsets it gives us with the government (the offsets let us burn more coal in our power plants). I assume the carbon offsets will be a selling point for large companies like AMZN, etc. \n\nBut if it wasn't for the government giving carbon credits, nobody would want this product. I don't see this ever being something smaller companies or private consumers would ever want.", "id": "obxjxp", "created_utc": 1625180771.0, "score": 133, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Big bag holder here \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab this thing will moon\u2026the absolute need to pull the methane out of the atmosphere is upon us.

Even though I am 95% in CLNE, this is a well thought out critique for the bear case. \n\nI want to say though my one thought that runs a bit counter to this: isn\u2019t part of the recent movement related to amazon\u2019s stake as well as their deal for refueling their trucks. \n\nI can see there\u2019s potential drawbacks to using RNG in a pipeline that it can potentially corrode causing miles of pipeline to need replaced. \n\nBut wouldn\u2019t that perhaps have been priced in prior to the amazon deal. I think the uptick is because of the use in vehicles. This would be different because I imagine it is significantly easier to repair and replace an engine or fuel line than gas pipes. Assuming Amazon has enough of a fleet of trucks and logistical support to repair and maintain the trucks, I would think this is a safe deal.\n\nWill admit I\u2019m Bull so probably a bit bias but food for thought.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Mister Clean Mister Clean !", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11985976248979568}, {"body": "What's that?
