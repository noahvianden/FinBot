Reason is YouTube is growing so much faster than Netflix.\n\nhttps://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=0cd3d78\n\nTake Android. Google offers for totally free.

Just a couple of dollars and billions goes to the bottom line with no material additional expense.\n\nAnother place is the ad blockers with YouTube. Google could end that any time they want. YouTube TV for example it is not possible to skip ads. But still has targeted ads. Google has let it go because they wanted YouTube to grow. But that is no longer necessary and can take away the ad blockers when they want. I think they will do it slowly.\n\nBut the biggest is search.

I\u2019m not worried and you shouldn\u2019t be either. \n\nI would assume that most people finding themselves in this scenario aren\u2019t index fund or \u201csafe\u201d investors.

Out of those, here are the ones I\u2019m currently negative in - BABA, ZG, PSFE, PLTR, SOFI, DKNG, MTZ, and GE. Besides GE, the rest of those are more speculative and more or what I would consider high growth. That\u2019s what has been getting hit as of late. I\u2019m not worried because I am confident these companies will do well long term and the stock prices will inevitably go up. In the short term, I\u2019ll continue to average down through DCA. I\u2019ll grit my teeth through the risks of inflation and rising interest rates. Short term it may be rough, but long term I think it will pay off. I will not sell any of these companies.

Almost all of the stores are in the United States with a few in Canada and even less in the UK so international expansion is still wide open for them. \n2. Piper Sandler came out with a teen survey ([report](https://www.pipersandler.com/1col.aspx?id=6216)) that said Chipotle was one of the restaurants they would choose the most, alongside Chick Fil A and Starbucks. The majority of Chipotles customers are under 34 and an even greater amount under 24. Their customers are expected to provide a greater lifetime value than a McDonalds or other competitor with aging clientele. Young customers also prefer to pay for healthier, quality food versus overly processed foods. [(demographics)](https://snapshot.numerator.com/retailer/chipotle)\n3. The switch to digital as well as the addition of drive thrus boosts profit margin. Mobile ordering also helps stay connected with the younger customers along with data collection  to know the customer better. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they dip a toe into dark or ghost kitchens to move into areas where the financials of spending a 1-2 million dollars for a physical store don\u2019t make sense. These dark or ghost kitchens will have huge margins. \n4. Great management, great financials, no long term debt. Enough cash to pay off any remaining debt. FCF increasing. The physical stores typically pay for themselves around a year and a half. \n5. Inflation and price hikes don\u2019t affect the customer loyalty as customers are willing to pay for quality. Furthermore when chipotle increases the price they often add a new item like the brisket. When they added Carne Asada, they increased the price .25 cents and saw \u201cno degradation\u201d in demand \u201cat all.\u201d Price increases affect McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and other competitors much more because of their entire business model is to sell the most food for the cheapest price. \n6. The brand value itself. When new competitors arise they are typically ,\u201dthe chipotle of\u2026\u201d Along with the brand value is their insistent reinforcing the commitment to quality which aids to everything said above. \n7. The food poisoning issue seems to be behind them. Almost all large food chains have had their share of food poisoning issues (KFC, Jack in the box, Burger King and more) yet their all still around. Chipotles was three years ago, which led to a new CEO with Brian Niccol who came from Taco Bell and is used to running large food chains and has since cleaned up the food illness problems. But the fact that you and probably others are still holding this against them makes me feel good to know that their future growth isn\u2019t priced in yet. \n\nRisks that I see (I may miss something but I don\u2019t trust DD without risks listed) \n1. Like Apple\u2019s insistent demand of quality, any food illness problems will hurt their brand value more than others. Food illness is a risk for any restaurant but I believe the news is much more likely to make a big deal about chipotle\u2019s problems than a Taco Bell or other company because they commit themselves to quality. This will in turn crush chipotles brand loyalty. \n2. The drive thrus are capital intensive and they haven\u2019t been proven to be successful yet. \n3. The demand for superior ingredients are subject to hired risk from the suppliers prices. \n4. Competition from other quick service restaurants. \n\n\nI believe chipotle is a very underrated growth story.

{"title": "Why $XPO is your next 5-10x bagger", "selftext": "**TL;DR: XPO is spinning off a company - $GXO that will begin trading on NYSE on August 2, 2021.  Once spun off, GXO will become the largest pure play contract logistics provider in the world on day one. Every large company spinoff in the history of trading has unlocked huge value for shareholders. This combined with upcoming earnings on 28 July, makes this a potential multibagger, considering the stock is consolidating for last 3 months**\n\n**Company Summary**\nXPO is a global provider of transportation and supply chain solutions. It operates through two divisions - Transportation and Logistics.\n\nTransportation provides freight brokerage operations that matches shippers freight with trucking companies and last mile operations including a network of ground, air, and ocean carriers. Transportation makes 60% of company revenue.\n\nLogistics provides warehousing and inventory management services and generates 40% of the revenue for XPO.\n\nXPO is positioned to capitalize on rapid growth of e-commerce and logistics outsourcing. For last 6 quarters XPO has grown sales yoy by at least 10%\n\n**Catalysts**\n**Company Spinoff** - XPO Logistics Inc. (XPO) has announced a distribution of (New) GXO Logistics, Inc. (GXO) Common Shares. The distribution ratio is 1.0 GXO share for each XPO share held. The record date is July 23, 2021; the payable date is August 2, 2021. The NYSE has set August 2, 2021, as the ex-distribution date for this distribution\nOnce it becomes a standalone company, GXO will be the largest pure-play contract logistics provider on day one and its customers include companies like Apple, Nike etc.\n\n**Company Earnings** - 28 July after market\n\n**Why it is 10x Bagger**\nThere are 2 upcoming catalysts - First is earnings on 28 July and second is $GXO spinoff on Aug 2. Now you know, company would not have announced a spinoff just 2 days after earnings if they were not confident of hitting it out of the park. \nAnd you all know what happens when there is a stock split or spinoff, there is never a successful company out there that did a spinoff, and it did not rocket.\nAs per the CEO, post spin off, the parent company will trade in $100 - $120 starting range and spin off company $GXO will trade around $65 - $70 range.\nAs per Deutsche Bank - GXO will be around $70 out of the gate.\nThat gives an upside of at least 20 - 30% post spin off. \nCramer loves it too, what is there not to like about a logistics company especially during this ecommerce boom.\n\n**What will happen to current Options?**\nThe current options will become XPO1 and will trade by adding the price of both the companies. The strikes will remain the same.\nXPO1 = XPO + GXO\n\n**Play**\n-The stock has been trading range bound in between $140 - $150 for last 3 months and right now it's at the lowest of that range that is $140.  You can buy shares for a potential of 20 - 40% upside in next 2-3 weeks.\nor\n- You can buy $150 - $160 calls for 20 Aug for a potential multi bagger. By Aug 20 both earnings will come out and the spinoff would have happened and both companies will have decent time to do a runup. \n\n**My Position**\n $160 Calls for 20 Aug. ($79k) (700Calls)\n\n\n**Warning**\n I am degenerate like you all and I don't know shit. Do you own DD and don't trust anything from a stranger on internet.
