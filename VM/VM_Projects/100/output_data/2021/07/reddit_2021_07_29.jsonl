Given Biden's agenda, will long term capital gains treatment even exist in the future?  Does it make sense to wait until January 1st to sell and move the taxes to tax year 2022?\n\nLikely the movement in the LEAP will be dollar for dollar. Does it make sense to just hold on to it? Downward moves are of course likewise.\n\nAny money available to exercise it? Not that there is a huge advantage right now to holding the shares as opposed to the contract but it makes me less jittery.  This also comports more closesly with the notion of \"time in the market is more important than timing the market\".\n\nIs there another investment that is catching your eye? Would you want to own something else?\n\nYes AMD broke out nicely, but do you think there is more upside? Some of the charts are showing strong breakout that last for weeks.  Sadly \"some\" doesn't include \"all\". FOMO can be a bitch.\n\nAny familiarity with using \"Trailing Stop Loss Orders\". \n\nDo you have an Uncle you can ask? LOL But seriously, might someone give you a perspective and say, \"Yes! Sell now! That's Janey's tuition for a year!!\" Reality can help shape things.\n\nWhat was your initial exit thought when you purchased it? Has that goal been achieved? There is nothing wrong with reviewing that and acting upon your prior decision. The next step is then focusing on what should be your exit plan the next time around. \n\nGoing forward I feel it is important to take a look at what went into this trade. How did you come to make this investment? What lead you to this investment? Ask yourself what did you do wrong with this trade?  Yes the money is terrific but... how could it have been different?

On the growth side, Google has most of it\u2019s revenue from ads (147 of the 182b) same as Facebook. Amazon is just getting into building this income stream out! And they have much better data for targeted retail advertising, so the potential is incredibly huge. On top of this, they lead the cloud market, prime video is becoming more popular than netflix, they own Twitch TV (e-sports are getting huge) and they are innovating and entering new sectors like crazy!\n\nIf you consider this, Amazon has a reliable, recession proof (but low margin) stream of income from e-commerce and a huge growth potential in high margin cloud and advertising. And it\u2019s still valued lower than other tech companies today!\n\nOn the technical side, even the cautious wall street price estimates are about $4500, but some go as high as $6000! And I think even that is too cautious. Moreover, there is a clear support line at around $3000, meaning that something horrible would need to happen to have a lower downside than that. So the upside is huge with limited downside.\n\nOn the antitrust issues: Amazon has no monopoly in any single industry. They are large because they have their hands in many things, but if you consider one industry, there is no monopoly, clear as day. And they have a team of lawyers and unlimited money to fight these allegations.\n\nAlso, the end of covid will not affect sales as much as people expect. Not many people who got used to next day delivery will go back to waisting half a Saturday just to get their stuff from a brick and mortar store.\n\nI could keep going on about why the Amazon share price is clearly undervalued today, but I won\u2019t because if you can\u2019t see it yourself I\u2019m not gonna be the on who should convince you.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "amzn", "nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn", "amzn", "amzn", "aapl"]}

Setting achievable goals and realistic expectations is very important so that your customers and \"fans\" don't get disappointed and you manage expectations\n* There's lots of good reasons why we don't have reusable rockets\n* EVs and sustainable energy don't really make sense from an environmental or economic standpoint and that's why they haven't taken off. And even if they did make sense, it's impossible to convince people to actually change their ways and buy an EV\n\nAnd the list goes on and on.

If all other stocks, besides $AMZN, in the index stay completely flat (theoretically, of course), then shouldn't $QQQ (and /NQ) go down 0.6772% ? At least that's my understanding of a portfolio, if 8.465% of your portfolio goes down 8% in a day and everything else in your portfolio stays the same (0.00% change), your whole portfolio would go down 0.6772%.\n\nObviously, /NQ and $QQQ (AH) went down much more than 0.6772%, likely because many of the other big names in the index went down in sympathy with $AMZN in after hours trading.

Although apple was slightly up in post-market trading yesterday and I think MSFT was basically flat. Tech stocks are highly correlated with each other but they don't trade with \"sympathy\" to other stocks. That's not how it works. The majority of trading swings in one direction or the other, which is why down days and up days are somewhat correlated across all equities. \n\nPre- and post- market trading is very low volume. This is why it's not a very good predictor or indicator. It also only lasts about 30 min. The futures on the other hand trade hundreds of thousands of contracts per day.

Let's assume this is \\~90% revenue, I think this is conservative considering Tesla's prepaid expenses are $112M and not much of this likely applies to FSD. We also have to take into account the increase in revenue recorded on new FSD sales (after city streets is released). This might be $50M per Q.\n\nAdditionally, Elon's CEO compensation expenses are likely to fall over the next months. There is currently $501M remaining of Elon's compensation plan. From the 10-Q: \"For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $176 million and $475 million\". If we assume that all the remaining expenses are recognised over the next 12 months (conservative), there will be a roughly $450M net income benefit in the next 12 months compared to an annualised 2021H1 rate.\n\nSo Tesla's net income will increase by $1.84B over the next 12 months solely from accounting adjustments and the FSD-wide release. For reference, Tesla's TTM GAAP net income is $2.15B. If Tesla repeats Q2 for 3 more quarters Tesla's net income would be \\~$6.2B. At today's market cap this would be a \\~100 P/E. I also think it's quite possible that Tesla improves their core profitability over the next 2 quarters as they further ramp Shanghai Y, Fremont 3/Y and Fremont S/X. The best case scenario could be \\~$10B of profit over the next 12 months, assuming \\~$2B profit per Q + the additional $1.84B of accounting adjustments.\n\nThere is also the wildcard of deferred taxes which could add $1.5B-2B of net income, but this is a one-time thing and is purely an accounting adjustment. Would reduce the P/E that many use as a 'sense-check'.

{"title": "TSLA is still Undervalued", "selftext": "Tesla Stock still has huge growth potential.\n\nListen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple.  I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PE Ratio**\n\nThe PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.\n\nFor a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&P is something like 15.\n\nWe have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.\n\nNow the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.\n\nTSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \\~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.\n\nSo 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.\n\n(I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)\n\nAnother way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.\n\n$622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \\~135\n\nThis is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 \"per car\". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.\n\n**Future**\n\nDoes anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?\n\nOf course not.\n\nWith Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year.  So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.\n\n3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.\n\nHow about with $8,000 per car?\n\n=$24Billion\n\n$24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap\n\nHow about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.\n\n$24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's try that again for 2028\n\nAssume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.\n\nThis gives an annual earnings of $72B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.\n\n\\-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.\n\n$120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.\n\n\\-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**\n\nThis would be a stock price around $2200 per share.\n\nIf Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nIt is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \\~ $2T.\n\nEdit: No matter what you think about 'FSD', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn't matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.\n\nDon't listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fxvjbopra5e71.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f7562c3ea2991c9e9c8de406b1d76d40d9780cf", "id": "otwk5v", "created_utc": 1627561887.0, "score": 195, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 208, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|54|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14477409422397614}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "Petition for Cathie to start an onlyfans:", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "All proceeds go to Tesla shares. infinite money glitch.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m getting a raging nostalgia boner reading this DD and comment thread.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I was thinking the exact same things. people called them crazy when they said this at 8-900 pre split.

The EV market worldwide in 2020 sits at around 3 million cars. It has been growing fast, and the 19>20 change in sales comes to a bit less than 30% growth. (That number also inlcudes plug-ins and hybrids electrics). While the global EV market has been booming, Tesla has not been able to keep up. Its global market share has dropped from 29% to 11%. This means that not only has tesla not been able to keep up with demand, but that competitors are eating away at its dominance. With companies like Ford and Volkswagon saying they are going hard into the EV market, Tesla has some major headwinds. Your estimate of 3 million cars per year by 2024 assumes several things:\n\n1) TSLA can do it (how many years did it take to get its first factory to 900k again?)\n2) If TSLA goes back to its 29% market share, 3 million cars would assume a total market of above 9 million. That would be a 300% increase in three years, or a 45% annual compound growth in the market (much higher than what we have been seeing). If TSLA can only keep its 11% market share, the total EV market would need to be like 27 million cars per year, and require over triple digit  growth a year. (to give an estimate of how insane that number is, currently total new car sales worlwide are only about 17 million per year).\n\n\nYour contention that Tesla comes roaring back DESPITE an environment that is more competitive is a pretty rosy picture, especially that you are basing it only on automotive side assumptions.\n\n(fyi I am LONG in TSLA)", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "This right here.

Forward P/E for WMT is 23, TGT 22, KR 13, HD 24.\nAs for AMZN, without having done extensive math - just from a common sense perspective: I somehow doubt they could instantly become *that* much more profitable. Margins for retail are slim and if they raise their prices too much, people will shop elsewhere. Plenty of competition by now - much more than just a couple years ago, thanks to the pandemic. Most of their profits are from AWS and AWS is already *insanely* expensive to a point where it has become a running gag among my clients as to how expensive a project can get if we'd just deploy it on AWS. If they make it even more expensive, customers will start migrating to MSFT and GOOG sooner or later or just run their own datacenters like in the earlier days.\n\nBut back to the numbers:\nAMZN does 420B in revenue, at 250B cost of rev. and 170B gross profit resulting in 27B net income or around 54 EPS. Their R&D expenses are 45B - fair enough, that's a whole lot. Let's say no more R&D, at all. Not quite sustainable but whatever. For simplicity sake add those to the net profits, divided by 512M shares outstanding, resulting in 158 EPS if didn't mess up. That's still a P/E of 21 at $3350 (post crash) or 23 pre-crash but now you have a company with zero growth since no R&D at all. Also, way oversimplified of course - you'd have to be somewhere in the middle, keep at least some R&D to keep the lights on but I assume you get my I point.\nI'm not arguing that AMZN is a shit company, far from it. I love the customers experience for the most part. But I'm not seeing how they could squeeze that much more money out of their customers that easily or somehow become that much more profitable in an instant. They're a behemoth and change takes time and is hard once you're that big. Also, I think it's fair to assume that they're already optimizing every single bit they can find pretty much all the time - that's how they've become that big and successful. How much room for improvement is left if it's simply the customer base that decides to spend their time otherwise instead of shopping online?
