America's real power comes from USD, which is key currency, and does not have to be back up by Gold, meaning that US Fed can print as much as it wish. And perhaps, that's why widening gap is overwhelming at this points, but let me ask you this. Is America ready to give up USD as key currency? Can gold back up US dollar? This means so much in many meaningful ways, socially, culturally, economically, diplomatically, and politically. \n\nThis also means that all US key stock markets such as DOW, SPY will go back to  levels in 1970s when US defaulted on USD gold conversion. I dont think anyone, including the rural Americans, is ready, and clearly, I dont think Republicans would want to do that for their own financial interests. \n\nAnyhow, I have no problems that Republicans taking power back to be honest, because it will only help me to build my wealth and I can always take advantage of the deplorable, hard-working Americans, who will always vote for Republicans like today, where Fed announced that no tapering will occur at least for a while.

Chinese lock down worked fine so is many countries around the world. Personally, I do not agree the way Chinese enforced, but it's, at least, effective enough that pandemic such as COVID19 occurred only in free world. It's up to your views because I believe life is more important than principles, and if a state can save one more live, which it should, I would rather prefer it that way, instead of leaving it to individual choices.\n\nWell as for keyboard warriors, I dont agree that I am, as I have other jobs, but perhaps, you are, as your response is instant in a min when my comment is posted.\n\nAmerica is one of the countries suffered the most victims from COVID19.

I dont judge on your potential claim, but in either ways, then, how does someone can explain American life expectancy dropped significantly in 2020?\n\nLooking at the popular votes. Since 2000, no Republican presidents were not able to win the election if it was solely popular votes, which is most of Democratic nations around the world do. No need to go through turmoil whether election is stolen or not. It will simply guarantee undemocratic, fascist political party like Republicans wont be able to maintain majority, nor it can take power back in WH if it's simply popular votes without taking into EC.\n\nAnd great to hear that some opportunities were given to you during T's time, and I have no problem with that.

Tesla has said that $1 per mile would be the aimed cost of their ride hail network.

Price in food shopping etc, you're talking about $150-$200 a month transportation costs. That's what people pay for insurance and gas. There is a high percentage of people that will simply not own an EV/Car... And even for those who do... Right now it would cost me $40 round trip to go to my best friends house and back 5 miles away, or to my favorite bar. I would love to go get smashed at either, but I don't because it's just not worth $40. It absolutely is worth $10. When you reduce the cost of transportation by 75% due to no paid driver and electric over gasoline, you change the way the world looks at the viability of frivolous transportation. It's a supply/demand issue. Like... Right now it's $6 a drink at my favorite bar. It's alot, but I do it once or twice a month. If It cost me $10 to go instead of $40 I would go more. But to put it in a different perspective.... Imagine if drinks there were 4x... $24 a drink. I would never go. Few would even consider it. Imagine country where that was just the cost of drinks and in a night it all went down to $6. One could imagine that would 10x the amount of drinks they would sell... Perhaps more. That is what this does... For friend visits... For bars... For people who struggle to own cars. For the 10s of millions of Americans who pay $75 a month for a bus pass that takes them an hour and a half from when they leave home to get to work because they have  to walk to the bus the best bus for them which is likely 30/40 minutes ahead of when they could catch a lyft, get ~3 city miles with 30 stops to get to work... and spring for a Lyft once a week to make that trip take 10 minutes instead.

You can let your Tesla run wild if it has FSD 5 and be a robotaxi when you're not using it. 100 miles costs you less than $5 in electricity, and you can easily get that when not using your car every day. Tesla will take 20 percent of the profit of the hailing business... But that leaves you with $75 a day... Or $27,375 a year...  Even if that adds $7,375 a year in costs to your EV (which the 35k miles it would cost would cost you way less in wear on a Tesla) you're talking about a cool $20k a year raise because you could afford your car. Elon has said when it comes to FSD 5 being complete he would consider charging up to 100k for it, as it's basically a business that can make upwards of 50k a year for those who leave it on full time, and assumes the majority of people will simply use the subscription service, which no doubt most will do as $4800 a year is a small price to pay to net 20-45k.\n\nAlso, don't you worry about Robotaxis being around.

{"title": "PTRA: The Play of a Lifetime", "selftext": "If you haven't heard of Proterra, it's an EV company that actually makes vehicles (looking at you Nkla). Proterra makes electric buses which I know isn't the most sexy of vehicles, but man are they profitable. EACH bus costs around $750,000, and Proterra has sold over 1,000 of them with over 16 million miles driven on Proterra buses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProterra went public this year and got roughly $650 million, and what do you think they're putting this money towards? Growth. The EV Bus market is about to explode with the coming infrastructure bills. The 600B bipartisan bill alone contains 7.5B for electric buses and 7.5B for EV infrastructure. And who do you think the government will invest tax payer dollars in? Proterra's main competition is BYD, a Chinese company. However Proterra is an American company and their buses are made in America. Of course this money is gonna go towards Proterra, any smooth brain should be able to figure that out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's also look at what allies Proterra has in the current administration. First, there's Jennifer Granholm, the current Secretary of Energy. She was a member of Proterra's board. Then there's Biden himself, who visited Proterra's factory as part of his big EV push back in April. What company do you think these two are gonna pump once the infrastructure bills pass. Did I forget to mention that Proterra already has over 50% of the EV Bus market share in the US?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut Proterra doesn't just make the buses, they also make electric powertrains and fleet level EV chargers. Who would buy the powertrains and chargers? How about Daimler, the largest commercial vehicle maker in the world. Daimler and Proterra already have a strategic partnership AND Daimler invested in Proterra back in 2018.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nQ: Wow Proterra has been selling off hard lately. Whats up with that?\n\nA: PIPE investors (Private Investment in Public Equity) had their lockup period expire so they're taking profits. Nothing to be scared of, just a great dip to buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: I'm a boomer and will only invest if Analysts from big banks say a stock is undervalued. What are the Analysts saying?\n\nA: Eww, value investing. You're still in luck. Citigroup announced a price target on Proterra of $16 just two weeks ago. This is the same analyst who gave Tesla a price target of $117 so if he's saying Proterra is undervalued, it is REALLY undervalued at today's price of $10.60\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: What's Proterra's market cap? How high could it go???\n\nA: Currently Proterra's market cap is 2.32B and its price is $10.60. Compare that to its 52 week high price of $31.06. You can see what a crazy huge investment the 15B from the smaller infrastructure bill will be for Proterra.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: I won't invest unless someone from the internet shows me some crayon drawing of why a stock will moon. What you got for me?\n\nA: Ok smooth brain. Let me drag out my Crayola crayon set...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krj1bidz4sd71.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c570ec16c9ed45168a4aa29dfcdbec780f0c11e", "id": "ospq7a", "created_utc": 1627401752.0, "score": 373, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 243, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2vn0r/gme_dd_because_there_wasnt_enough_of_it_already/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/trey5642, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hey auto mod, fuck you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/X1IctZS", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23155085742473602}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20090855658054352}, {"body": "Been watching this one for about 6-7 months, thought I had missed my opportunity when the SPAC market overheated in February but with the latest drop I bought 200 shares at $11.

{"title": "Thoughts on Chinese companies right now.", "selftext": "Most of you monkeys are probably jacked to the tits to be buying the dip on a market that isn't even down a full percent today. Well given the current evaluations on American/Canadian tickers currently I think this is a mistake. \n\nYou have companies like AAPL and MSFT trading at absurd multiples. So maybe be a bear you might ask? Well bears have gotten crushed all year long so I would argue it's to early to be a bear. So what the hell are you supposed to do? You can't buy, you can't sell and you just did three lines of cocaine and want to gamble. \n\nThe answer: Chinese stocks, the Chinese stock market has recently corrected and seems to have found support at these levels. I think Chinese stocks are where one can find value currently. The TA looks good and if the numbers aren't cooked to oblivian you might even find some good long term value in BABA and other Chinese big cap stocks. \n\nSo ya the summery is if you wanted to buy Chinese stocks in the last 2 months you will had a hard time finding value up until now. I think over the next day or two these stocks find a bounce to indicate a move higher. Just make sure the company you bought has been recently investigated for Fraud as these companies are probably less likely to try and cook the books in the short term with regulators breathing down their necks. \n\nThis entire post is just confirmation Bias for me buying WISH today.
