I know someone that ordered a $300 product that arrived late, and they got the entire order comped.

I get some movies split genres, but give me an option to reduce repetitive titles while browsing. Sometimes I get so frustrated from seeing the same crap I passed on numerous times before, I just quit out.\n\n\nTheir descriptions and teaser previews are utter garbage. What's this movie about? Well it stars these three people and .... I guess that's all the written description I get. Let's see whats happening in the teaser video. There is a large city. Looks like sunrise. Man walks past a dumpster, there is a flower nearby. A dog barks in the background while we see his feet walking on a sidewalk. Must have been the highlight of the movie. Next.\n\n\nTheir ROKU issue, where the menu just grinds to an abrupt halt, forcing me to exit out of the app and go back in and start again. Its clearly an issue with their app since I do not have that problem on any others. They refuse to accept that this is an issue despite lots of other ROKU users having the same issue.\n\n\nTheir rating system is completely rigged. I'll not be convinced otherwise. 5 stars on netflix but IMDB gave it 40%. Something seems off there. \n\n\nAnimation and foreign language. I'm glad they put movies on for all walks of life, but why can't they say the movie is Swedish and subtitled. Its rarely apparent from their video teaser as well, something that strikes me as being very intentional.\n\n\nTheir content, which has gone downhill tremendously, is actually the least annoying of my gripes. I never go in there expecting to be delighted, minimizing the impact of disappointment.\n\n\nThey need to seriously reinvent themselves before it's too late, if its not already too late.

Between early 2014 and late 2019, a period of about 5.5 years, TSLA had basically zero gains and a lot of volatility.  However, I thought that Tesla as a business was great and that the company was building a tremendous foundation of technological and manufacturing expertise.  I believed that this foundation would set the stage for success at some point in the future.   This occurred in 2020 as Tesla became profitable, paid down debt, and entered the S&P 500.  \n\nMy shares of SPY (S&P 500 ETF) have returned about 250% over the past decade.  This is excellent.\n\nBut my TSLA 10 years total returns are approximately 11,000%.\n\n**I am willing to own shares in a great business with outsized future potential,** ***even if that means going through years of underperformance*** **because the market disagrees with me.** \n\nOne key point is that I did not know exactly when the markets would reward Tesla with a higher market cap.

Maybe I'm overlooking something, I dunno. \n\nInstead of paying their own money to build more charging stations, they could sell them to businesses or malls to set up in their parking lots. These would be kinda like those ATMs at convenience stores which charge just a little extra to use, and provides some revenue to the owner of the store. Now obviously business owners wouldn't want to just fork out a couple thousand dollars for it, so they could \" sell \" it to them with a payment plan which only uses the profits that the owner would receive from the slightly higher fee. Once its paid off, the additional revenue goes to the owner. That way instead of TSLA considering it a cost to set up, its regarded as a sale, and the owner gets a free charging station which will generate them money in the future while also attract additional customers to their stores. It's a win-win\n\nI'm not sure about the costs here to feel free to use more accurate numbers. I'm guessing a charger could cost about $2000?
