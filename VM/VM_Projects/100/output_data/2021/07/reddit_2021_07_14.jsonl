{"title": "I analyzed the performance of companies in the \u201cbest places to work list\u201d over the past 10 years and benchmarked it against S&P 500. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world. The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees.\n\nI wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market. My hypothesis is based on two assumptions\n\na. An employee would create his/her best possible output when they truly love the place they work\n\nb. Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals.\n\nI feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns.\n\n**Data:** There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list. I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years. Their survey sample size is also very high (more than 5,00,000 anonymous responders), which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives.\n\nFor this analysis, I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years (2012-2021). But, not all the companies on the list are public and listed. So, the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed.\n\nAll the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis Methodology:** Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February. I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work\n\na. You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year\n\nb. You invest in the company and hold (This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list, it\u2019s a good long-term investment)\n\nReturns from the above strategies are then compared to the S&P 500 returns \\[1\\] over the same period.\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az6njh8qp6b71.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a50a203b345c28a33c2ebed9f8928b4c3d77521\n\nThe companies in the best places to work consistently beat S&P500 in stock returns. There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work (Rank-1) beating the market comfortably by 9.5% every year! \\[2\\]. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/8m3qajdsp6b71.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=538425ee2af64fd84f88833f4c3420b22f262b3c)\n\nThe difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term. Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131.5% more than the index over the last 10 years. This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term.\n\nNow that it\u2019s out of the way, we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/k1c3smbtp6b71.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0de66bf0af94c3a84f8af06e06372f9a59bfe30)\n\nThe best long-term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe! The stock has returned 1762% over the last 10 years. As expected, tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft, Google, and Adobe all present multiple times.\n\nFor our final analysis, we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hkrqje8up6b71.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=393b458f8b3f1d6edf3c281c4f9f064fac942cd9)\n\nI think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis. As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years (80%) of our analysis timeframe. Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market, the difference between the returns was negligible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders.\n\nI think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent. Both of these in turn would lead to market-beating shareholder returns.\n\nNow you know what to do when the next year's results come out!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing the data and my analysis: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NF48A0p6L4V_79XkJVdOCT_jAdP1vKlC3ix5e44xXXM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I have considered the benchmark as S&P500 as the Best Companies to Work for list contains companies across industries and I think that S&P500 is a fairer representation of the overall list.\n\n\\[2\\] 6 out of the last 10 years, the top company to work for was Google.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.* Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s analysis.\n\nIf you found this insightful, please share it with your friends :)\n\n[WhatsApp](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/whatsapp?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&linkname=) | [Facebook](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&linkname=) | [Twitter ](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&linkname=)| [Reddit](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketsentiment.substack.com%2Fp%2Ftop-companies-to-work-for-stock-returns&linkname=)", "id": "ok4yfe", "created_utc": 1626271260.0, "score": 1297, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "I have a sub r/market_sentiment where I post a similar analysis every week.

That being said I don't personally care enough to look it up myself but if I was to do your test I would be interested in testing more to verify the results.\n\n1) it looks like you are assuming you should be using s&p500 as your benchmark. As you have stated there seems to be a larger proportion of tech stocks in your list. This makes your assumption about good place to work meaningless unless you test against similar market breakdown. Others have suggested qqq and I would venture to say the outcomes could look fairly different if a more tech heavy benchmark was picked. Would be interested to see if this would hold up to qqq.\n\n2) it sounds like you got caught up in proving yourself right vs trying to objectively find your answer. Comments like \"no matter how you slice it\" (could be showing) a bias to prove to yourself and others that good culture is equivalent to good company, perhaps it was pure luck for you that Adobe was one of the picks.\n\n3) If you did decide s&p500 needed to be used I would be interested in finding out if it still stood up with the removal of some or all of the tech stocks, perhaps a weighting similar to s&p 500 if you want that as benchmark. As mentioned you didn't have all the data so companies were missing, that alone could have results in different results.\n\n4) I understand everyone is looking for an edge, let's be honest if this was so simple we would be seeing more ETF's built around this model, or simply companies or individuals already doing this. Perhaps this is my own assumptions creeping in, but I would say a meaningful edge long term over the market, is probably more complex then pick from forbs best companies.\n\nTakeaway seems to be you set out to prove something, intentional or not, could have come up with wrong conclusion just trying to justify your theory.

Maybe by selling covered calls, in which case you're running the wheel on $TSLA - nothing wrong with this, but how sure are you that this will beat just buying and holding the stock, given $TSLA's demonstrated potential for big jumps to the upside, which you could miss out on with covered calls? And what do you do if $TSLA keeps dropping below $500? After all, many people argue that $TSLA is currently massively overvalued. \n* Suppose $TSLA rises back up to $800 or $900, maybe quickly after blowout earnings or maybe gradually over several months. By then, you're most likely not going to get as much premium on a $500 strike put anymore - what do you do then? Do you stick with the same strike and accept the lower premium, in which case you're netting ever less premium per week? Or maybe you sell a higher strike put - you're happy to own $TSLA at $500, but are you happy to own it at $600 or $700?\n* Otherwise, if $TSLA stays rangebound for an extended period of time, it's very possible that IV will start to decline, given the lower observed volatility.

If your point is that there are always high IV stocks, sure, but OP may not be willing to own them at prices that provide premium at the level that OP has been getting from $TSLA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Stick to the point, he's running the wheel.\n\nYou should reread OP's original post - he doesn't ever mention running the wheel or selling covered calls at all. I brought up the wheel as a hypothetical strategy in a scenario that I suggested OP should consider.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The wheel is always effective. \n\nAgain, the wheel is a fine tool for consistent income generation, but there's no guarantee that it preserves or grows your overall equity. If the underlying tanks, e.g. in an extended bear market, you get assigned and lose value on the shares as the price drops.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Saying it isn't effective because IV shrank on a stock is asinine. What does he do when IV shrinks? He does the exact same thing he's always been doing and when you make good money off high IV you don't set that as the bar for your standard of living, and if you're not using the money to live on then who cares? \n\nAgain, the wheel is mostly off-topic from the OP and my previous comment. But even so, if OP were using the wheel to generate his desired return, IV shrinking certainly affects his strategy since it reduces the return that he's getting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Good investing isn't sexy, doesn't take much thought and a moron can do it.

Uh, what? Did you read this out loud before writing it? You're saying the wheel is great at generating income but not great at building equity, which I am guessing you mean owning the underlying asset? Is that what you mean by equity? So you're saying if the stock tanks, even though the wheel is great at generating income...I can't build equity because the stock price tanked? Lol...do you understand why I am questioning your perspective? \n\nIf the wheel is great at generating consistent income, but the OP is trying to grow his account size, and you're saying he should do that by building equity...why can't he just take the consistent income that is being generated and oh I don't know...buy shares? You're saying OMG, what if the stock price tanks? Newsflash, that is the exact same risk you're going to have by simply owning the stock. So no, the stock price doesn't matter if you believe the stock will recover and you actually want to own it.\n\nAgain, the stock price doesn't matter, in your attempt to play devil's advocate you exposed your lack of understanding of the wheel. If you're selling covered calls and you think the stock is bullish then you should anticipate that by selling far out of the money covered calls. What is the difference? If you get assigned you literally turn around and sell a cash secured put. \n\n\"You could want to own a stock at a certain price, but be unwilling to move that price up if the underlying price inflates to levels you think are even more unreasonable.\"\n\nThis is where I have a big issue and there is a giant divergence in our perspectives. On one hand you're telling me you really like the stock, you've done the research but through your research you've determined that $500 is the absolute top dollar you're willing to pay for Tesla, not a dollar more, no not even $500.50, you ain't buying it. Now on the other hand you're saying you think Tesla is a strong company and you're long on them because you know they'll do big things in the future. SO why the fuck are you quibbling over a fucking dollar? Over $20 a share? Over $50 a share? It ass backwards thinking like this that drives me up the wall. Now I'm saying \"you're\", and \"you\", but I'm speaking about the OP.\n\nSince we've established that the OP really has no idea what he wants to do then creating a hypothetical where there are no high IV stocks he wants to own is pointless.\n\n\"**I would be fine owning 200 shares of $TSLA at $500**\"\n\n\"**A few days ago I sold 2 $TSLA $500 puts and when $TSLA had a nice day**\"\n\nSure sounds like the beginning of the wheel to me and I'm sure that is why you brought it up. IV shrinking doesn't effect his strategy, altering your strategy to hit some arbitrary return is the epitome of bad investing. You hit 1% consistently every month but IV shrinks and now you're only hitting 0.5% a month, does that mean he should get out of Tesla position because he went from 1% a month to 0.5% a month? No, because as we've determined he wants to own Tesla. The entire basis for every strategy in my opinion is this simple question, do you truly, actually, want to own this stock? Not for some ridiculous price you have in your head, do you think it's a good company, do you think it will grow? That is what it boils down to and that is what I am hammering you for because all your advice doesn't matter the moment someone actually wants to own the stock.

This includes the value of the shares in his account, as well as the cash generated from selling options. It doesn't matter if he's using the premium income to buy shares, it's all part of his total equity. Again, this is what OP stated he cared about - this is presumably the number that he wants to increase when he says he wants to \"grow his account\". If you're not clear on how equity in this context is related to but different from income, I would suggest looking up some basic accounting principles. \n\nThe rest of your post is about the wheel. Neither OP nor I have said anything about whether we use the wheel or how we apply it, so you're arguing with thin air. OP didn't mention the wheel at all.

So how is equity defined?\n\n\"Equity represents the value that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the company's debts were paid off. We can also think of equity as a degree of residual ownership in a firm or asset after subtracting all debts associated with that asset.\"\n\nDo you see why counting the cash from premiums isn't equity?

Time will tell as you diversify through trades.  1000 trades will most definitely average out to the top of the lognorm curve and you'll see not only if you're profitable, but how profitable in the long run.  You might get a good estimate after 100 trades even (as long as the strategy has gone through multiple kinds of market conditions).\n\nIs there a better option?  Yes.  Your account size is large enough to be on portfolio margin.  With portfolio margin you'll get at least 6:1 unless you're doing something risky.  Unfortunately, trading can be far more volatile so you can't just up your margin to the same level as a mixed strategy (buy and hold + trading), so what is ideal is buy and hold index funds on 200k (100% of the account) and then continue your strategy using margin, say eg 100k of trading.  If you're using 1.5:1 you're barely tapping into your margin.  PM done right can double your income.\n\nUsing PM you'll need to mix strategies to minimize your volatility to profits ratio.  The lower the volatility the more margin you can safely use and the more profits you can make.  So eg, in theory mixing 3 strategies is even better than mixing 2 strategies.  Ofc this assumes all 3 strategies print consistently and print well.  If 1 of the 3 strategies sucks, maybe 2 out of 3 is better.  A buy and hold index fund strategy is guaranteed to not suck, so it's a freebee strategy.\n\nbtw, my strategy prints more than 3k a week per every 200k about, and it's pretty consistent when applicable (I can't do it every day of the year, it's opportunistic.), so if you want a more in detailed approach just let me know.

In theory, having something like this in place would eliminate the need to immediately delta hedge in smaller corrections, would be potential insurance for flash crashes, and in a true market downturn if you chose to neutralize your Delta anyway using short futures you could actually get convexity on the downside returns.\n\nAlso, just to make sure I'm not misunderstanding your strategy \u2013 running this on /ES, each 250k allows for one open contract position.

I was too initially.  250k allows for a one contract *cascade* of 6 contracts at different strikes, with a seventh for recoveries. Only three ever on going up though.  So, for example, assuming I have exactly 250 K US right now I might set up for a 4380, 4385, and 4390.  As 4390 actually approaches 4380 will close for $250.  Then I'll set the 4395 but not before 4380 closes.  You only go three to the upside in the five point increments.  Moving down we add in ten point increments. So one at 4370, 4360, etc.  We stop cold when six total are active.  Each of these positions is a single contract.  This is what changes at 500k.  At that point each member in the cascade is 2 comtracts, at 1M it's 4 (so in total 4 contracts * 6 positions = 24 contracts for the entire cascade at 1 million US dollars).\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nKerina", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.761122465133667}, {"body": "I do one contract per position per 250k.

{"title": "Why the Housing Market is Likely Fucked", "selftext": "**TL;DR: Almost all the key signs that caused the housing market crash in 2008 are back stronger than ever. Mortgage debt is at ATH, consumer debt is 2x higher than ever, lumber futures are down 60% but physical lumber isn't moving, unemployment is still 50% higher than in 2009, housing starts are double what they were in 2008, and median house prices just broke $300,000 for the first time ever, inflation adjusted. All of which are bearish indicators for the economy. Houses r fuk**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.) Mortgage Debt and Consumer Debt is at an All Time High**\n\nHaving high mortgage debt makes your house a debt and not an asset. It is sitting right above **10 trillion dollars.** If it goes any higher, we are at an extreme risk for higher foreclosures. However, consumer debt may be a greater issue. It is currently nearing **2x what it was in 2008.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.newyorkfed.org\\/microeconomics\\/hhdc.html](https://preview.redd.it/rhy0xeife3b71.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=31eedce488849fd4b9c956a4fea74ecb0cda4881)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.) Lumber Futures Have Fallen, Physical Has Not**\n\nAnother way to tell if we are in a bubble is by comparing the futures market to actual prices. When there is a large gap in these two, it usually indicates people are still willing to pay much higher prices for a large supply. It doesn't make any economical sense. People still feel that lumber is in extremely high demand, and will buy lumber (which isn't in high demand), and buy as much as they can anticipating the price to continue going up. It's artificial price increases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.nasdaq.com\\/market-activity\\/commodities\\/lbs](https://preview.redd.it/2z24wwlmf3b71.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=a326e28b9e16725f41c0df7375d549441afeb22d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.) Unemployment is Still Extremely High After COVID Restrictions Lifted**\n\nUnemployment numbers are still 50% higher than they were in 2019. There's no reason to go back to work for \\~2% of the population, because the stimulus checks and unemployment add up to more than minimum wage. This money has to come from somewhere, a.k.a money printing. This in turn adds up to more inflation, which is my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/1316\\/us-national-unemployment-rate](https://preview.redd.it/6nxq3o6lg3b71.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33a45e21fbb24f61bd30f779b8ca38280b2af86)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BRRRRRRR](https://i.redd.it/9gi3ygssg3b71.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4.) Inflation is the Highest it has been in 31 Years**\n\nJpow, our lord and savior, announced today inflation was above expectations of 5%. This has not happened since 1990. Hmm. [AP article](https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-government-and-politics-business-3539110d1ebe308e6aa11b3e1ca77c9e#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20economy,at%20a%20congressional%20oversight%20hearing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/2497\\/historical-inflation-rate-by-year](https://preview.redd.it/htltaykaj3b71.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac29899854ff5c947344c1634c14c0a0ba1c19f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5.) Housing Starts are Double What They Were in 2008, Nearing 2005 (Peak) Levels**\n\nHousing starts measure how many houses are being built. It is currently at around 1,500 a month. They are still recovering from 2005 but quickly approaching 2005 levels. More houses being built means that there is more supply flowing in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/1314\\/housing-starts-historical-chart](https://preview.redd.it/q6rimkr2l3b71.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=669ba69ad13396b8b0ef5b9a2fa0a6e95df02c84)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6.) Median House Prices are at $300,000, Up Nearly 100% From 2012**\n\nAlthough the housing crisis ended around 2009, the bottom for housing prices was in 2012. Since then, housing prices are well above their 2008 levels, even adjusted for inflation. This is a bad sign for the housing market. Having high housing prices means more debt, which leads to more defaults.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/dqydj.com\\/historical-home-prices\\/](https://preview.redd.it/da8skqgxl3b71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e630b436031fea554fe587ee362c8df29136d43)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7.) 30 Year Fixed Mortgages are at an All Time Low**\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad sign for the housing economy, but it means if we were to have a recession, it could be really bad. To fix recessions, the fed usually lowers interest rates, which is like turning the economy off and on again. It works most of the time. The grey bars in this picture are recessions. Notice how about halfway through each recession, the interest rates decrease, and the recession shortly ends.\n\nInterest rates are already incredibly low, so this may not be an option for the next recession without making interest rates negative. Having negative interest rates triggers more panic buying houses people can't afford, which results in more defaults. It will quickly become a chain reaction of hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/2604\\/30-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-chart](https://preview.redd.it/txtovqi5n3b71.png?width=1091&format=png&auto=webp&s=245b5c47fe23bb69b6753ee2eb6b399dcc6e5e6a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is my first DD, hopefully it's decent. I will be responding to comments.\n\nEdit: due to the high number of comments, I will not be able to respond to most of them. I did not expect this post to get this popular. I was anticipating being called a retard (which around half of you are).\n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n1.) This housing market is not really like 2008. It's more secure today, or at least what we know is.\n\n2.) Lumber prices really indicate a bullish position on the housing market. I was wrong about the gap between the futures and physical. I have also been told that was worded poorly.\n\n3.) When you really put effort into a post, it does well.

{"title": "I analyzed the performance of companies in the \u201cbest places to work list\u201d over the past 10 years and benchmarked it against S&P 500. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** Every year Fortune publishes the top 100 companies to work for in the world. The results are based on an anonymous survey conducted on over half a million employees.\n\nI wanted to check whether companies where people are the happiest to work produced better returns for their shareholders when compared to the market. My hypothesis is based on two assumptions\n\na. An employee would create his/her best possible output when they truly love the place they work\n\nb. Companies with excellent culture would create a feedback loop to attract top talent by word of mouth and referrals.\n\nI feel that both of these factors would contribute to the company innovating over their competitors and creating outsized investor returns.\n\n**Data:** There are a lot of players that create the best companies to work for list. I chose Fortune as they are the most established company and have been doing this over the past 20 years. Their survey sample size is also very high (more than 5,00,000 anonymous responders), which would give us a fair representation and minimize the chances of false positives.\n\nFor this analysis, I took companies present in the best places to work for list in the last 10 years (2012-2021). But, not all the companies on the list are public and listed. So, the current analysis will only focus on the companies whose shares are listed.\n\nAll the data used in the analysis is shared in a Google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis Methodology:** Every year Fortune publishes its result on the 2nd week of February. I have considered two different ways to invest in the best companies to work\n\na. You invest in the company as soon as the list comes out and hold for 1 year and then sell and repeat this every year\n\nb. You invest in the company and hold (This is based on the assumption that company culture does not change year over year and once the company makes it into a list, it\u2019s a good long-term investment)\n\nReturns from the above strategies are then compared to the S&P 500 returns \\[1\\] over the same period.\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fxgwbdq9m6b71.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a26a48dd0922c14776c97a6fab8ba706315aadd\n\nThe companies in the best places to work consistently beat S&P500 in stock returns. There is a noticeable difference in return as you move up the list with the best place to work (Rank-1) beating the market comfortably by 9.5% every year! \\[2\\]. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uxfqsqebm6b71.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=93e4c7d47160e3accf8fbc845417413ef3e367a4)\n\nThe difference in returns becomes more noticeable if you buy and hold the company for the long term. Here we can see a steady increase in returns as you move up the ranking ladder with the top company returning a whopping 131.5% more than the index over the last 10 years. This also validates our assumption that companies having great cultures create superior investor returns over the long term.\n\nNow that it\u2019s out of the way, we can dive deeper into the data and find out which stocks made the best returns and how your returns would have faired over the years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4s97sp3dm6b71.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5aa6f005cc1f72f5acb30c5f15180567ac27a0)\n\nThe best long-term return among the top companies to work for was generated by Adobe! The stock has returned 1762% over the last 10 years. As expected, tech companies have generated the most amount of returns with Microsoft, Google, and Adobe all present multiple times.\n\nFor our final analysis, we can check if the returns were consistent throughout the years or was it just a few years that are contributing to the overall positive results.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/tcry8ieem6b71.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=48368f25abadca99ca2f9e7ba0184b10b3b45d13)\n\nI think this graph shows one of the most important takeaways from this analysis. As we can see best companies to work for have beaten SPY by a considerable margin in 8 out of the 10 years (80%) of our analysis timeframe. Even in the years that our strategy did not beat the market, the difference between the returns was negligible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo matter how you slice it, the above analysis shows that companies that are exceptional places to work create exceptional returns to their shareholders.\n\nI think this ties in nicely with our initial hypothesis that companies having great culture will have happy employees that create the best possible results and also would attract top talent. Both of these in turn would lead to market-beating shareholder returns.\n\nNow you know what to do when the next year's results come out!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing the data and my analysis: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NF48A0p6L4V_79XkJVdOCT_jAdP1vKlC3ix5e44xXXM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I have considered the benchmark as S&P500 as the Best Companies to Work for list contains companies across industries and I think that S&P500 is a fairer representation of the overall list.\n\n\\[2\\] 6 out of the last 10 years, the top company to work for was Google.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.* Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s analysis.", "id": "ok4l9c", "created_utc": 1626270121.0, "score": 704, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|52|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|184|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6wr4/does_index_inclusion_positively_affect_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kl4ixe) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/nobjos, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4973367750644684}, {"body": "Hey guys,\n\nIts u/nobjos back again with another analysis.
