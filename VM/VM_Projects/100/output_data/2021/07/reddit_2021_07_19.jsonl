Suppose you are short the 440/435p and SPY expires at 436. Your short 440p will be ITM and will get assigned, so you'll have to buy 100 shares a $440, even though they are only worth $436. Do you have that kind of cash to be able to cover that assignment?\n\nWeekly trades are also too risky for a beginner, IMO, since you often have to hold them to expiration and experience risks like the one above.\n\nWhat we recommend beginners do is use a paper trading platform and limit your account size to your actual real dollar account size. Paper trading platforms often start you out with $50k or more of fake money, but if you only have $5k of real money, that will distort your learning experience, so just pretend your account is $5k or stick the difference in a cash ETF, like MINT, and forget about it.\n\nMore info in the links at the top of the page for how beginners can get started.

Time costs money and the longer you hold something, the greater the opportunity cost. Also, the greater the risk of losing your gains.\n\n[Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hg8ce9/risk_to_reward_ratio_changes_over_the_life_of_an/)\n\n> Why I haven\u2019t sold yet is because the \u201csqueeze\u201d is near blah blah blah and I wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on those profits if it were to happen.\n\nMore people have lost more money by holding a little longer than have lost by missing out. So holding for some WSB narrative that is speculative at best is usually the dumbest of ideas. Before opening your trade, set goals. What is your profit goal? What is your loss limit? Then close the trade when either of those goals are met. If you think there is more upside because of some squeeze narrative, **open a new trade**.

Options are always evaluated against both underlying price and time (and volatility as well, plus a couple other things). The answer for expiration is different from the answer before expiration.\n\nBefore expiration, that situation is usually a loss, but it could be more than max loss or it can even be a small gain, depending on IV and strike skew.

Low volatility stocks stay close to the expected curves. High volatility stocks don't. Which is why meme stocks like GME and AMC are really bad for spread strategies.\n\nThe only guarantees are at expiration, where there is no longer any extrinsic value. But that doesn't mean always hold spreads to expiration, that would be dumb. It means that you stack the deck in your favor as much as possible when you open the spread, so that the most likely outcome is that the P/L tracks to the expected curves. A good rule of thumb to achieve this is to never open a credit spread for less than 1/2 the max loss. So if the spread is $3 and max loss is $2, you must get at least $1 in credit for that spread. That balances risk/reward over the life of the spread. Another thing is to look at IV Rank or IV Percentile on the short leg and try to open credit spreads when the short leg is above historical averages in IV. That increases the probability that IV will decline, though there is no guarantee of course.\n\n> Did you mean to say that it's less likely to be max loss when you're closer to expiration?\n\nNo. If you have a 4 point spread and the current stock price is between the legs kind of halfway but there is still weeks to expiration, it means you have a loss on the short put, but it might not be 100% of the credit, because there is still some probability that the short leg will be OTM at expiration. Similarly, the long put will still have some extrinsic value. That value may track exactly to the loss on the short leg, or be slightly higher, reducing your net loss, or be slightly lower, increasing your net loss. But the interaction of the long and short leg values is dependent on time and the more time to expiration, the larger the extrinsic value of each leg will be, which means the net loss probably won't be 100% of max loss.\n\nPlay around with the Option Profit Calculator and put some 30 DTE or 45 DTE credit spreads into it. If you look at either the Table or Graph view, you can see that the value of the spread rarely is 100% of max profit or max loss before expiration when the stock price is between the legs, and the further you go away from expiration, the less dark red or dark green the P/L is.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.026582539081573486}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0012054024264216423}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0012054024264216423}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13185575604438782}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You would sell the stock short to cover a short put.  \n\nYes, it can be a trade  \n [buy stock for short calls, sell stock short for short puts]   \nto cover the short options.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "A reason is that you might want to lock in the gain on the put and you aren't sure the gain will be retained by expiration.

With this in mind, it seems like this should become more profitable when IV drops for some other reason. What am I missing?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> would a Call debit spread protect against IV crush?\n\nThat depends on how high IV is and what the net vega of the spread is. In general, the net vega of a spread is less than the long leg by itself, so in that sense, the spread has less exposure to IV crush.\n\nBut as the other reply noted, very high IV with strike skew can create an exceptional situation where net vega is large enough that the spread gets crushed almost as badly. This is not uncommon for meme stock spreads.\n\n> For some reason, I see a debit spread as almost a theta gang strategy where I only profit after I grind off the uncertainty in the position. \n\nWell, there's some truth to that, since a spread after all is part long and part short. Thetagang is all about grinding down the value of the short position through theta, so sure, every spread has a thetagang component to it. But the difference is that you aren't making your profit from the short leg, you're making it from the long leg, and that you want to appreciate in value, despite theta. The grind on a debit spread is about reducing the cost of the insurance you took out against the long leg moving against you.\n\n> With this in mind, it seems like this should become more profitable when IV drops for some other reason. What am I missing?\n\nThat's like saying your real estate investment in a house should make more money by your house declining in value, because the cost of fire insurance on the house will be less.

{"title": "Here are the major factors contributing to a very possible market correction soon", "selftext": "I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it\u2019s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: \n\n**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. \n\n**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. \n\n**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. \n\n**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. \n\nObviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don\u2019t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: \n\n**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.\n\n**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. \n\n**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  \n\n**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the \u201cbase effect\u201d and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it\u2019s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed\u2019s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.\n\nFurthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED\u2019s 2% threshold by a wide margin. \n\n**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. \n\n**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. \n\n**China\u2019s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. \n\nAll of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don\u2019t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. \n\nIt\u2019s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. \n\nA crash on the other hand is a much larger event that\u2019s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. \n\nThere are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. \n\nMassive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. \n\nSome argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like.

Thanks for sharing your knowledge", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In addition to what u/ClassicG676 has said:  \n1 - If the SP is below $1000 at expiration, you are almost guaranteed going to be assigned those shares, because the holder can make you buy the shares at $1000 but they can buy them on the market (to sell to you) for <$1000.  But as long as the SP is above your break-even price, you'll still be making money.  \nLooking at the first $1000 June 2023 Put I sold, the SP at the time was $624.50, the Premium was $474.25, and the break-even was $525.75 (so the Premium is about $375 Extrinsic Value, plus ~$100 Theta). I get the Premium immediately (settlement is T+1).  Note that the break-even price is significantly *below* the then-current stock price.  The buyer of the contract is paying you to buy cheap shares.\n2 -   Yes, this locks up a lot of Buying Power for the duration of the contract.  Your broker will 'hold back' a certain amount of BP/cash/margin because they have no intention of being on the hook if you get assigned and can't make good on your end of the contract.  However, since you haven't actually spent that BP, you aren't charged any interest on it (if using margin).  Since these are 'American Style' options, I can buy them back at any time before expiration (and in theory I can be assigned at any time).  So lets say that in December, with Texas opening and Berlin about to, the SP rockets to $1200 and my profit has risen to 80% because of IV, Theta, etc; I might decided to take my profit then instead of waiting another 18 months to get the remaining 20%.  \n3 - Long term Calls are often called LEAPS.  You can do the same selling Calls but in that case you *don't* want to the SP to rise: you want it to stay under your Strike .  If I were selling LEAPS I'd be putting doing it via a vertical credit (sell a Call at say $1500 and buy a Call at say $1600).  This reduces your max payout but it also puts a cap on your losses.  \nBasically, when selling Puts you want to price to go up, when selling Calls you want the price to go down.  Kamikaze Cash over on YouTube has a good series of videos which should help you\nPersonally, I tend to stick to selling weekly Puts on Tesla.  I was doing weekly Calls as well for a while but it feels like it's just building pressure now so I've been put off them a bit.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so so much /u/SheridanVsLennier \\- This is the most information anyone has ever provided on this subject.

{"title": "Here are the major factors contributing to a very possible market correction soon", "selftext": "I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it\u2019s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: \n\n**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. \n\n**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. \n\n**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. \n\n**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. \n\nObviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don\u2019t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: \n\n**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.\n\n**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. \n\n**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  \n\n**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the \u201cbase effect\u201d and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it\u2019s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed\u2019s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.\n\nFurthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED\u2019s 2% threshold by a wide margin. \n\n**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. \n\n**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. \n\n**China\u2019s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. \n\nAll of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don\u2019t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. \n\nIt\u2019s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. \n\nA crash on the other hand is a much larger event that\u2019s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. \n\nThere are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repurchase facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. \n\nMassive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. \n\nSome argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like.

The flight is good, and $AMZN rallies cause people are stupid as hell and don't realize that Bezos has nothing to do with Amazon anymore. Also the market has been red for 3 days straight and JPow wont allow that to happen so tomorrow will be green regardless. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : The Rocket Ships Blows Up In a Big Fiery Inferno Ball of Death**\n\nThis scenario may initially come across as bearish, but is actually the complete opposite. With Bezos dying, 30% of Amazon's entire float would vanish into thin air since he controls most shares. A dead guy cant sell his shares, so we could technically treat this event as a giant 1 Trillion dollar $AMZN stock buyback, which would happen instantly. Bezos dying in a rocket explosion would wipe out a large chunk of Amazons outstanding shares.
