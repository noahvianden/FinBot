The answer to this is really complicated. Like way too long for a Reddit comment. But let me give you some basic examples that could be helpful.\n\nLet's say you're selling something simple that is pure hardware. So not like an iphone, but like a dongle or something. The standard for recognizing that revenue would be when the product is shipped to the customer. However, some contracts have special provisions that state the buyer won't take ownership until a later time. Examples include when the item is received, when the item has been examined and approved, or when the item is tried for 30 days. There are many other examples of contingencies as well, but you get the point.\n\nOk now let's talk about software. A lot of the time revenue here is recognized over the time of the contract. So let's say you buy the license to use software for 3 years. You would recognize 1/12th of that revenue a quarter. This isn't always true though... In addition to contingencies, you have things like ELAs that can require specialized accounting treatment. \n\n\nThen you have the iphone..it has components of hardware, software (ratable and up-front), warranties, ect \n\nTl:Dr revenue recognition for tech companies is an absolute shitshow.

Let me bullet my responses.\n\n* I have around 300 shares, but net worth (including equity and cars) is probably around 900 to 1m rn. Joint income of \\~275-290k a year. Only about 20% of net worth is in Tesla (limited due to 401k/annuity/wife's ESPP + property/cars).\n* I would love to be proven wrong, but I highly, highly doubt that even with full sun that the silent yacht will sustain 7 knots with 17kw of solar. MAYBE. And the sun isn't always shining. I hear you, that it has a sail, but at 7 knots you're also talking about a really, really long crossing, and crossings fucking suck from what I gather. Secondly, to expand on my doubt, I HIGHLY doubt that in full sun the 17kw will feed both 7 knots AND all your onboard needs. MAYBE if you have good wind and are under sail, but does the SIlent Yacht have a sail? Again, unless there is some data/tests to show this, I really doubt it. I think the big advantages of 17kw of solar is, like you say, being able to meander around islands in florida at low-speed and recharge for AC/energy needs at-sea, rather than doing an Atlantic crossing--sorry to hop topics, but your reliance on solar during a crossing is also a major safety issue. You need to know your speed so as to take advantage of good weather / get out of the way if something is coming up from far away. Lingering and waiting for the sun to shine to push 7 knots is really really not ideal from what I would imagine.\n   * Structural batteries will absolutely be a thing for ships. Think about the 4680, then imagine the amount of firm-structure needed to construct a trawler or cat.\n   * I think comparing the net efficiency to a car is a mistake. Your metric should be cost per mile vs gas, and depreciation over time. Using electricity will be immensely more cheap than filling up on diesel. Once energy density + structural batteries advance enough, electric trawlers will be viable, and will have huge total cost of ownership advantages.\n* In 20 years with solid state (ideally), your energy density will be huge. Your costs will be low. You'll be able to gun it across the Atlantic at higher speeds (perhaps, who knows, 15-17 knots). This is guesswork. I haven't done the math.

In another country similar games will play out.\n\nSo all the potential economic shut downs are still there.\n\nWhat is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping.\n\nThe extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow to valuations\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)\n\nshows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high.\n\nNote also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9.\n\nA book by O'Shoughnessy \"What Works on Wall Street\" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.\n\n[https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales)\n\nshows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average.\n\nThe market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Not the Russel 2000 declined recently.\n\nHere are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N](https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.N)\n\nuse .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ.\n\nprice to sales:\n\nMSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5\n\nThese clearly can fall and still be overvalued.\n\nSome have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote.\n\nInflation ----------------------------------------------\n\nA large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE.\n\nWe think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is \"bad enough\" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as \"having a heart\" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops.\n\n  But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly.\n\n  Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase?\n\n  The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time.\n\n  I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start.\n\n  The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing.\n\n  What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now.", "id": "optda9", "created_utc": 1627008976.0, "score": 915, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 401, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|38|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/optda9/bear_case_top_economies_have_covid_cases/) \n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Brett-_-_, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In what would you be interested?

Delta will not be a repeat of the OG Covid Crash. Completely different circumstances. Covid in 2020 blindsided the market and the world; we had no defense against this strange and unknown virus, except to shut down the world basically. Delta? First, we have vaccines that work against it. Perhaps slightly less effective at preventing transmission, but still enormously effective at preventing death and severe disease. Second, everybody knows everything there is to know about it. We know it will cause infections to tick up, like in the UK. Yet, the UK case surge appears to have slowed, without the need for extremely draconian measures like with OG Covid. It would take a black swan to blindside the market again; a new variant that completely evades the vaccine and sets us back to square one. Delta isn't that.\n2. This one I can agree on. Valuations are extreme, and will eventually come down. We just don't know when though. Could be next week, next month, or next year. You can sit on the sidelines in cash and miss out on the blow off top, or define your risk and invest what you are comfortable with losing a portion of.\n3. I don't believe the inflation narrative for a second. The 5.4% YoY increase is due to temporary issues. Supply chain havoc? Not a long term problem. Stimulus money? Saved, used to pay debt, or invested. Either way, banks end up with that money and they don't spend it in an inflationary manner, i.e. by buying groceries and cars. Another round of stimulus will not happen unless we get another black swan event. Most of that inflation is probably just prices recovering from when they tanked in 2020. Remember oil? Prices collapsed in March 2020, I hadn't seen gas so cheap in decades. Now it's back to its normal price and everyone's losing their minds over inflation. It's easy to set a growth figure so high when your base level is zero. We're still in the same economic paradigm as we have been for the past few decades; namely, defined by a stagnating and aging population and labor force. Interest rates have been on the decline for decades, any increase would be temporary. In order to create economic growth in this economy without structural growth, we just print more and more debt, and kick the can down the road. We're not about to stop doing that now. I am very confident that YoY inflation in 2022 will be much lower than what we've seen this year.\n4.

Is he protecting himself against inflation?", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "> Q1: How do shit-tier companies get the money if Jerome is buying HYG shares? Do they own HYG shares?\n\nBuying a bond from a company is fancy money man talk for loaning a company money. A bond is an IOU. When payments are made on the loan, whoever is holding the IOU gets paid. The IOU can be sold to someone else. This is what people are talking about when they talk about the *bond market*- the buying and selling of those IOUs because bonds are an asset. This is what fancy money man bond traders do when they aren't fucking hookers and snorting coke.\n\n> Q2: wtf is HYG? I googled it and it talked about some complicated shit.\n\nHYG is an ETF - exchange traded *fund* - that owns and buys junk bonds from companies. Just like SPY is an ETF that owns and buys shares from companies. Owning a share in the HYG fund is like owning a small piece all of the bonds that the fund owns.\n\n> What happens to Jerome if HYG goes way low? \n\nHe gets yelled at by Congress because a bunch of companies go bankrupt because they can't afford to borrow money, mass panic spreads to the markets for less-shitty bonds causing nobody to loan anyone any money, not even good companies, and our debt-based economy collapses.\n\nWhy? Well, you need to understand how bond yields work. TL;DR is bond prices go down -> interest rates on loans go up. Super high interest rates mean companies go bankrupt. Skip the next two paragraphs if you don't want the explanation of why.\n\nAn investor buys a bond from a company for *less* than the face value of the bond. Let's say a company sells a $1 million bond at auction, and an investor buys it for $0.98 million. They'll profit $0.02 million by the time the loan is paid off. For simplicity's sake we'll assume the bond is paid off - *matured* in fancy money man speak - after 1 year. That's a hair over 2% interest on the initial 980k loan. A 2% loan is pretty dang cheap. Fancy money men call that interest the bond's yield. \n\nBut what if there is no demand for this bond? What if everyone thinks a global pandemic is going to cause the world economy to shut down and nobody can tell who is at risk of bankruptcy? Investors are going to want a huge potential upside in exchange for that risk. In this scenario the most someone will pay for the bond - aka lend the company - is, perhaps, $900k. That's a (roughly) 11% interest rate. That's mad expensive. Companies wouldn't be able to get capital to run their businesses. This is exactly what happened in March 2020.\n\n> What's his incentive to go brrr and buy more? \n\nOne of the Federal Reserve's jobs is, simply stated, to keep the \"debt-based\" part of our \"debt-based economy\" from falling apart. Jerome is the head honcho at the Fed. He gets yelled at by congress and probably fired if he fails to do this. In March 2020, the bond market froze up, prices crashed, borrowing costs skyrocketed. Jerome stepped up, declared that the markets weren't functioning properly and that he was cranking up the printer. \n\nJerome also owns a fuck-ton of SPY and pumping bond prices also pumps stonk prices, so he personally profits. Thousands of WSB bears were Thanos snapped out of existence when he announced the Fed was buying bonds back in March 2020. But that's not the *official* reason.\n\n> How the fuck does it relate to companies getting money? Why does he care about owning HYG?\n\nLike I said before: The higher the price of bonds, the lower the interest rate on loans. The reason Jerome gave for buying HYG instead of individual bonds is because he wanted to pump the price on all the junk bonds he could - in other words make it cheaper for as many companies as possible to borrow money - as soon as possible, and buying the bonds themselves would be slow and cumbersome.\n\n> Edit: won't he break even at worst?\n\nIf a company goes broke then they aren't paying their debts.\n\n> Is he protecting himself against inflation?\n\nWhy would he? This isn't his money. He has a money printer. He's actually trying to *cause* inflation by doing this.\n\nTechnically the Federal Reserve isn't allowed to lose money, but all that means is that the taxpayers have to bail the Fed out.", "score": 199, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019re the ducking best.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Duck yeah bro", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Ducks fly together!\n\nQuack\u2026 quack\u2026", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.486407995223999}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6210460662841797}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14438985288143158}, {"body": "Legend answer", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.051398709416389465}, {"body": "Debt jubilee?

My friend thinks the company is slightly more likely to go tits up than me, so he didn't buy the bond when the yield difference was only 2% between the treasury and my bond. But now that the difference is 4%, he thinks that the company isn't super likely to go tits up, and he wants a better return than 1%. So he comes to me and says, \"I'll pay you $110 for your bond.\" I think to myself, \"that's a 10% return on my investment, so that sounds nice. Okay.\" And I sell it to him. Now, that bond gives him $5 per year, but he paid $110 for it, so that's a 4.5% yield. The bond price went up, so its yield went down, because the return it provides per year is fixed, and its price went up. The opposite process happens when the treasury yield rises; junk bond prices drop and their yields increase.\n\nThe same kind of thing happens with existing Treasury bonds/notes when the yield on their new bonds/notes changes.\n\nDoes that make sense?", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Not the person you're replying to, but, this is one of the best explanations I have ever read", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17924804985523224}, {"body": "This is a great explanation.

{"title": "An unbiased take on the Robinhood IPO: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly!", "selftext": "**Preamble:**  Let\u2019s just say that Robinhood has seen better days. A vast majority of us absolutely hate Robinhood right now. I feel that it\u2019s justified given the blatant disregard they had for retail investors during the GME saga. Adding to this, most of their revenue is driven by the extremely controversial Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) which is currently in the focus of SEC.\n\nBut rational investors do not reject a company completely based on how they feel about the company\u2019s business practices. In an ideal world, capital allocation happens based on alignment with the mission statement and practices of the company, but there\u2019s more than one way to make a profit in the market.\n\nThere are plenty of examples of companies doing extremely well even though they have been in the continuous focus of public ire and legal issues (Think Nestle with their dubious practices, BAC after the Occupy Wall-Street movement, EA with their micro-transactions, and Amazon with worker abuse).\n\nAnd for all the hate Robinhood gets and posts about moving out of Robinhood, just sort the gain/loss/yolo posts for the last month in any investing subreddit and you can still see a significant chunk of trades being made through Robinhood.\n\nYou can choose to not use their product, but it\u2019s not financially prudent to reject an investment opportunity without due diligence. All the DDs that I have seen exclusively focus on the negative aspects and then reject the IPO, and I think that\u2019s unfair. Especially given that over the past 20 years, [\\~69% of IPO\u2019s have gained value on listing day with an average increase of 12%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/)That\u2019s a 12% average gain in just one day!\n\nBasically, what I wanted to know was this \u2013 **Is Robinhood IPO a good investment opportunity?**\n\nSo, strap in while I try to condense 300+ pages of Robinhood S1 and my own views into a 5-minute read on **The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly of Robinhood**.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nRobinhood had a spectacular launch by any metric. They had [amassed nearly 1 million users](https://medium.com/inside-viral-loops/how-robinhood-got-nearly-1-million-users-before-the-company-even-existed-dfb1a57231f8) before the company even existed by gamifying their beta program. Their promise was very simple. $0 transaction fees for all the trades.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/x2uft7pjiwc71.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=29f594d10a96fc494640e62171baef195855855e)\n\nFrom the very beginning, [Robinhood had planned to create revenue](https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/18/zero-commission-stock-trading-robinhood/?_ga=2.76461904.47963929.1626865862-335952608.1624635175) from\n\na.\u00a0Premium API access\n\nb.\u00a0Trading on margin\n\nc.\u00a0Interest from holding custody of user\u2019s assets\n\nd.\u00a0Payment for order flow\n\n### The Good\n\n**Growth:**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/t9tg350liwc71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd626b15048e4b0d63c1a7e5a3a1ae0d00ddf261)\n\nThe company has grown exponentially over the years (even before the meme stock frenzy) with them approximately doubling the funded user base every year. The current retail frenzy only pushed up this growth rate. Adding to this, 80% of the users who joined them in 2020 were through word-of-mouth and Robinhood Referral which enabled them to grow organically. We don\u2019t have enough data to tell how this has changed following the GME scandal, but the one thing we can be sure of is that people are definitely still talking about them. The revenue has also followed suit growing by 309% for the year ended Q1\u201921.\n\n**Profitability \\[1\\]:**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/sccvtzuliwc71.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=639fb6255f6298bca22ee6f3d286da79429a9f3b)\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely for a company that is growing almost 100% every year to be profitable, especially in the tech world. But Robinhood was briefly profitable in 2020 before having a $1.4B net loss in Q1\u201921 due in part to a $1.5B fair-value adjustment to convertible notes and warrant liability.\n\n**Product:**\n\nIt\u2019s undeniable that they have a very well-designed product suite. It makes it very easy for first-time investors to invest in stocks (this is also reflected in their user base with more than 50% of them being first-time investors). The Robinhood gold monthly subscription program currently has more than 1.4 MM customers. Adding to this, their \\*rypto, cash management, and educational solution combine to create a well-suited ecosystem for first-time investors. The stickiness of the product can easily be seen in the monthly active user numbers.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/c06u6ksmiwc71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e1b83a70ececce4283513e39f5521d764dbd14)\n\n### The Bad\n\n**Revenue Stability**\n\nRobinhood\u2019s income is highly dependent on retail investors getting into the riskiest investments \u2013 Options, \\*ryptos and Margin. This would be extremely dependent on a highly volatile market that we saw over the past year. Once/if this settles down, the revenue stream is bound to reduce. This in itself would generate a conflict of interest with Robinhood actively encouraging this risk-taking in the user interface, through [dark patterns and gamifying the experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html).\n\n**Competition**\n\nAlmost all the major competitors who used to charge a per transaction trading fee have now [cut down their commission to zero](https://money.usnews.com/investing/portfolio-management/articles/brokers-that-offer-commission-free-trading). While this might not be the only USP of Robinhood, for a new investor coming into the trading ecosystem, Robinhood is not a compelling choice given the controversies surrounding them. The only thing they have going for them with regards to competition is an exceptional user interface, which again is subjective to the user.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nAccording to the [updated prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm), Robinhood is aiming for an initial price target of $38-42 a share, which would value the firm at $27-35 Billion. The company expects to raise around $2.2 Billion from this IPO. While a high valuation is not unlikely for a tech company, $HOOD is potentially valued now at 37x historical FY 2020 Price-to-Sales or P/S. This, when compared to Charles Schwab (10.8x) and Tiger brokers (20.1x) is on the higher side. Most probably the justification for such a high valuation is their current trajectory of customer growth and the average age of the customer (younger customers tend to be more valuable over the long run).\n\n### The Ugly\n\n**Payment For Order Flow (PFOF) \u00a0and Regulatory Risks \\[2\\]**\n\nAhh, finally we come to the most controversial part of Robinhood. The irony here is that PFOF was invented by Bernie Madoff. If you want a detailed understanding of PFOF, you can read it [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp) or [here](https://a16z.com/2021/02/17/payment-for-order-flow/). The TLDR version is\u00a0\n\n>A broker takes your market buy order for 100 shares of Acme, Inc., aggregates it with all the other small Acme buy orders, and sells that to a market maker, who fills the order. The market maker pays your broker for the volume\n\nThe spread between the buy and sell orders are then shared by the market maker (in Robinhood\u2019s case Citadel) and the Brokerage (Robinhood).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6dl9gqdoiwc71.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=c14cda402a97628c136bc66d406d8e1ef41973e2)\n\nAlmost all the major players (except Fidelity) have some amount of revenue coming in from PFOF and this is not necessarily a bad thing. From my understanding, this actually benefits the retail investor by moving the cost of the transaction from the user to the market maker.\n\nBut the main concern for Robinhood here is the amount of revenue they are generating from PFOF.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/se7aogbpiwc71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=01521f90aa415d277ebb372996cbf212544676b4)\n\nFor Q1\u201921, 81% of the company\u2019s revenue came from transaction-based revenue (PFOF). In contrast, PFOF contributes [less than 20% for TD Ameritrade](https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/companies/AMTD/no-login-required/0P4oc9vg/TD-Ameritrade-Revenues-How-Does-Ameritrade-Make-Money-) and Charles Schwab. Adding to the high risk of having more than 80% of revenue from one source, Robinhood has been repeatedly fined for not having the customer\u2019s best interest in mind.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0FINRA fined HOOD $1.25M in 2019 for not getting customers the best prices\n\n\u00b7\u00a0FINRA announced that Robinhood would pay a record $70M in fines and restitution over the outages and Robinhood agreed to the settlement.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0They are facing more than [90 lawsuits after the GameStop trading halt](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/robinhood-faces-lawsuits-after-gamestop-trading-halt.html)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0Finally, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has said that not every country allows PFOF and they are going to take a closer look into PFOF.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRobinhood started off with an extremely promising idea and then dropped the ball at its most important moment. Undoubtedly, they are going to report a blowout Q2 earnings report shortly following the listing and the stock is going to pump (They would have made a killing with the Dog\\*coin rally in April and May and other meme stock rallies such as AMC/CLOV in Q2\u201921).\n\nAnother interesting insight that we could make from their Q2 report when it\u2019s announced is if they had any net user attrition following the scandal. The age-old saying of \u201cany publicity is good publicity \u201c would be put to test! If they still maintained their growth story with AUM and active user base increasing consistently, that would be impressive, and we would know that the investor sentiment that we are seeing now is not actually translating to lost business.\n\nWe might need to re-evaluate this analysis once the IPO is over and they have announced their Q2 report and the market has settled down. But right now, given that we have an overall picture of the company and how they make money, **I feel that the risk factors far outweigh any potential listing gains that you could make**!\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] It\u2019s extremely hard to be objective when the company keeps on trying to pull one over you. The following chart is from Robinhood\u2019s official filing to SEC. They have shown +7MM and -57MM net income as the same size (that red line is the same length in both). Note that the losses are also shown in green and the scale is completely off. The actual scale can be found in the post.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5lk9oppqiwc71.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=5908ee207b1cbc278f53185cc9b6656b22e8a8ae)\n\n\\[2\\] Fun fact: The risk factor section in the S1-Filing is 75 pages long and over 52,000 words. No wonder their Chief Legal Officer Daniel Gallagher (Ex-SEC Commissioner) got that $30 million bonus.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.*\u00a0Hope you enjoyed this week\u2019s analysis.", "id": "oq1mv3", "created_utc": 1627044292.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|55|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|198|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq1mv3/an_unbiased_take_on_the_robinhood_ipo_the_good/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6wr4/does_index_inclusion_positively_affect_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kl4ixe) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/nobjos, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6044440269470215}, {"body": "Hood? \nTheir ticker symbol should ve been ROB", "score": 144, "replies": [{"body": "harder to see a cloaked thief", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24253907799720764}, {"body": "BULG", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2117973417043686}, {"body": "$GUH", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21362560987472534}, {"body": "LOL!

{"title": "F - to pay your respects. FORD DD", "selftext": "Summary: \n\nStock has been beaten down, and revenue has been in a rut the last few years but their staple lineup of cars have undergone a refresh and has renewed consumer demand. The company is also in a great financial position to weather a storm. It's biggest risk is the chip shortages and reliant on a third party vendor for their batteries. \n\n**PROS:**\n\n*Product*\n\nThe F150 has been the best selling vehicle 43 years in a row. With the EV revolution, it isn't going anywhere with the introduction of the F150 lightning. 100k reservations so far, set to release sometime next year. I encourage you to look at the product and see how it appeals to both Truck and EV fans equally. \n\nFord also refreshed their lineup. They've scrapped underperforming vehicles like the Fusion and the MKZ while introducing the new Mach-E, Bronco, Mustang and updated the rest of their SUV fleet (36% growth yoy). Ford certainly has kept up with the times and consumer preferences.   \n\n*Stock Momentum*  \nThe shorts have already left after riding it all the way down to $5 a share. The consensus was the stock has over 4B outstanding shares and has really diluted it. Ford stopped its dividend when Covid hit, and stock has been in an upward rally since going 100%+ since its 52W low.\n \n*Valuation*  \nForward P/E of 7.63. Same range as the other Auto Dinosaurs like GM, Honda etc. He who must not be named has a P/E of 105. I believe Ford at a $56B market cap, with $25B of it in cash is severely undervalued. We see other electric companies like Lucid/NIO/XPeng/Li balloon to the same market cap as ford with some not even delivering a single vehicle. \n\n**CONS:**      \n*Chip Shortage*    \nFord has had to halt production of the Bronco because of this. But the only silver lining is that Ford isn't alone in this. The entire Auto Industry is affected.  \n\n*Batteries*    \nFord Does not currently produce its own batteries. With the surge in demand, they need to vertically integrate this as fast as possible. Its perhaps one of the most important focus Ford needs to do so they are not reliant on third parties. A joint partnership with South Korea's SK Innovation plans to build these with Ford by 2025.  \n\n*Competition*  \nLuckily, the other EV and automakers don't have Trucks that can realistically oust the F150 from its pedestal. But Cybertruck has 1Million Reservations vs 100k with F150 Lightning. Granted it had first to market advantage. But curious how many of those reservations actually get filled. As for commercial vehicles goes, Amazon has backed the private company Rivian. Can they all coexist? Or will the others gobble up the market share?   \n\nDisclosure:  have no business relationship with F but I have a long position in Ford.
