Once Elon is done selling and the new factories start deliveries, the risk of hitting $750 will be very minimal. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m just trying to get as many shares as possible because once these new factories ramp and 4680 ramp and CyberTruck ramp and so on, TSLA is only going to continue growing and the higher it goes the less I have to worry about margin maintenance.

Not sure if the sector constitutes a falling dagger, but it's close to it the last few days.  But the whole sector is volatile, and has had near 100 point swings at least 3 times since August.
