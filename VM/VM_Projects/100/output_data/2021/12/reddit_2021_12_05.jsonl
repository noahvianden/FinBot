{"title": "Is TSLA a good buy right now?", "selftext": "Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I\u00b4ll try to do that and post it here. That\u00b4s my first analysis for TSLA. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I\u00b4ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Tesla\u00b4s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for TSLA\u00b4s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I do not own shares in TSLA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\n\nFirst let\u00b4s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **85%** of their sales comes from **Automotive Sales**. Another **3%** comes from **Automotive Leasing**. **Energy generation and storage** makes up for **5%** and the remaining **6%** are **Services and** **Other.**\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 12,6%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for TSLA\u00b4s stock of **$724 per share**. But because we have to account for **TSLA\u00b4s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$732 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith TSLA\u00b4s price being at **$1.144** **per share** right now, it seems overvalued. That\u00b4s why I think buying *heavily* might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That\u00b4s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see TSLA\u00b4s stock price in 5 years.** Normally we can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. Because Tesla is kind of a hype stock this method is not very good to be honest. I had to change it a little bit to make sense of it. With this method I get a stock price of **$1.136 per share** which is pretty much what it is now. \n\n**What I\u00b4ll do.** I believe TSLA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. Still, for me the price is way too high to invest. That\u00b4s why I will wait for better opportunities to buy TSLA.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I\u00b4ll see you again.\n\nIf you want me to do this for a specific stock, please tell me.

These high-growth stocks are always the first to get beaten up when market sentiment starts to become bearish.\n\nIn my opinion, it's smart to wait on the sidelines to see how all this fear of inflation pans out. I think the markets have been exaggerating these past few weeks and overreacted to the consolidation of news about inflation, interest rates, fear of the new Covid variant, and will eventually partially recover. However, we can't ignore what is happening with the economy, and fears of interest hikes can have a disastrous effect in the near future, especially on stocks. Per theory when interest rates rise, the availability of money decreases, and consumer demand falls because it becomes a lot more expensive to borrow money. Businesses that heavily rely on debt financing (like growth stocks) will have less money to spend on growth, and lower demand means the firm itself does not generate as much revenue as it would when interest rates were low. In short, they basically make less money. This effect eventually spreads throughout the economy and more mature, stable firms will also be affected. \n\nThis vicious cycle keeps repeating itself until the economy goes into a recession, stays there, and eventually is saved by central banks increasing interest rates to promote liquidity again. A classic market cycle.  Note that we are only starting to increase interest rates and that cycles like these can last a considerable number of years.\n\nI actually think some of these companies have great future prospects, but their valuations, especially in a bearish market climate, will not allow you to make much money.

The disturbance that drives the magnetic storm may be a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) or (much less severely) a co-rotating interaction region (CIR), a high-speed stream of solar wind originating from a coronal hole. The frequency of geomagnetic storms increases and decreases with the sunspot cycle.

{"title": "The Great Inflation Debate", "selftext": "tl;dr -- I'm to retarded to give a conclusion on whether consumer price inflation is sticking around or not. Instead this post just outlines the different inflationary and deflationary pressures in the global economy.

It was time to do no nut November. However, I stupidly start decided to get a head start in October.\n\nFor days I go without touching my wee wee. My mind constantly challenges me with sexual fantasies of having a harem of beautiful Korean women. However I fight off these thoughts.\n\n\"NO, I WILL NOT GIVE IN I SHOUT\" and the thoughts recede. I march onward in my quest not to nut.\n\nBut Alas, I can no longer take it! It is the morning of November 7th, a Sunday and I have nothing to do. My brain is on full sexual overdrive. This time, not only is it a harem of beautiful Korean women, but in addition, my waifu, Yoko Littner is there too!\n\n\"O HOW CAN I RESIST\" I shout. \"GOD SAVE ME FROM THIS TEMPTATION!\"\n\nGod is cruel and does not save me. Suddenly my hands move toward my pp. It is hard as a rock. I sit in my chair, lean back and start thrusting. 20 seconds in, my fantasies have taken full control. Yoko and I are making a baby!\n\nA flood of ecstasy fills my brain, my muscles tense. WACK. A rocket ship of thick, goopy cum smacks me in face. Between taking zinc which makes cummies thicker and not jerkin it for a three weeks, a fat thick load had erupted onto my face.\n\nI am drained, exhausted and humiliated by the situation. I collapse onto the floor and cry, knowing I will be punished. Starting the next day, my stock portfolio has only gone done. What have I done :/?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sux9o652as381.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=b558234df8cfdca826e72daae1a67f417fdf99b0\n\n# What is Inflation?\n\nPeople will give you lots of different explanations of what inflation is but I think of inflation as having two different components.\n\n1. Asset Inflation - When the amount of money in the system expands, it is likely the value of asset will also go up. Assets are inherently scarce and there's really no downward, disinflationary pressures (value goes down for other reasons, fear, need for money, etc.). Unlike consumer goods, we can't just use the cheap labor of third world countries to create more shares of a company to combat asset inflation.\n2. Consumer Price Inflation - The price we pay for everyday goods and services. Gas, food, clothes, transportation, education etc. Now, what makes consumer price inflation not a purely monetary phenomena is we have a big old global economy, with ever advancing technology that allows us to produce more for less.\n\nSo from here on out, I'll be examining the forces that would cause consume prices to increase over the next decade and the forces that would help decrease prices over the next decade.\n\n# Globalization\n\nIt is 1988, China has just spent ten years reforming agriculture under Deng Xiaoping. This caused a spectacular boom in the number of villages throughout China and ended the chronic food shortage that plagued China during Mao's rule. A fun statistic, during this ten year period, farmer's increased their aggregate income by 12x. Hot mama\n\nNow, from 1989 to 1999, China starts exporting cheap textiles, toys and furniture. As word gets around about this cheap labor pool, US companies get a massive hard on. Cheap labour galore and boom, all our manufacturing starts moving to China.\n\nThis acts a massive disinflationary force as China becomes the global manufacturing power. At the same time, in our ever globalizing world, we optimize the fuck of our supply chains. With just in time manufacturing and delivery, companies are no longer producing a surplus of goods to meet demand but just the perfect amount. This keeps inventory levels low which reduces cost since storing inventory is shockingly expensive.\n\nSo starting in the 1990s we've had a huge boom in globalization which has given us access to cheap labour, allowed us to optimize supply chains and even give us access to cheaper raw materials.\n\nThis has been a big disinflationary pressure. Now, here is the problem that does keep me up at night.\n\n1. China and the US, we are not getting a long anymore.\n2. At the same time, COVID was a massive shock to our supply chains and exposed a lack of robustness in the system. When countries locked down, it caused massive disruptions since our supply chains require constant, consistent trade\n\nIf globalization slows down or stops, we will no longer have a disinflationary pressure on consumer goods. If globalization actually starts unwinding and countries bring manufacturing back home, this will be quite inflationary as the cost of good will have to go up in order to pay for the investments needed.\n\nMy gut tells me, we are likely entering a period where continued globalization stops and starts unwinding a bit. This will be the biggest inflationary force of the decade. The US world order seems to be crumbling and tensions are getting hotter with China. If I was Xi, I'd have constant wet dreams about conquering Tawian and the fact that the US is lead by an alzheimer's patient.\n\n# Demographics\n\nOver the next decade, demographics, hands down will be a big disinflationary force. When a country has a large, young population, that is a very inflationary force. Schools and housing need to be built. As they enter the work force they'll buy furniture, appliances and vehicles. They'll expand the amount of money in the system as they take out loans. This surge in demand and expansion in the amount of money, all act as an inflationary force.\n\nNow, this what the boomers did and is one reason we had such high levels of inflation in the 70s. Today however, we have the total opposite problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3f3g76g3as381.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b4ed3553203bc5c27288632ad91599ff7c41fba\n\nAging demographics is very deflationary. When people retire, their consumption decreases year over year as they live off their savings. At the same time, they aren't taking out loans so we have less money creation.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the young need to support the aging population, which means a lot of our money goes to paying their healthcare costs (i.e. paying crabby nurses to wipe their poopie butts). Less money for us, means less buying of goods.\n\nWith the largest global economies, all facing aging demographics, this means a slow down in global demand, again acting as a disinflationary force.\n\nQuick side note -- With less workers in the economy, this will increase wages. However, this is not necessarily inflationary. On aggregate, if the total cost of labour increase that'd be inflationary but if the total cost of labour remains the same, not so much.\n\n# Monetary and Fiscal Policy\n\nCan't talk about inflation without talking about central banks. Here's the thing, when the FED enables cheap money through quantitative easing which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates, a lot of that just seems to cause asset inflation. People buy more expensive homes, lazy corporations buy back shares with debt,  Wealthy people increase their leverage, etc.\n\nSo the FED dinking around with monetary policy isn't as inflationary for consume prices as one might think. However, combine the FED with government fiscal policy and ooo baby can we create consumer price inflation.\n\nGive me 1,200 dollars, I'm just buying assets. You give my half black cousin Tyrone $1,200, who lives in the hood, he's actually going out and spending that shit. Maybe he spends it at strip club, takes a vacation, whatever. Point is, he's gonna increase his demand for consumer goods, unlike me.\n\nSo the fiscal policy done during covid, was definitely inflationary. Tyrone told me, 2020 was the hottest summer of his life. He never had so much money.\n\nBut will these fiscal policies, targeted at giving the lowest income earners in society money continue? Currently it looks like it won't. This inflationary boom caused during covid will likely fizzle out.\n\nAt the same time, when the FED starts tightening monetary conditions, causing interest rates to rise, this will suck money out the system as the cost to service debt payments increase. This decreases the amount of money consumers and businesses, meaning less demand.\n\nMy conclusion, between no more big government stimulus to the lowest income earners and the FED starting to taper, in 2022 this will be a disinflationary force. Until it's not of course and the FED and US government reverse course so hard to draw any long term conclusion.\n\n\\*Random Side Note: rising interest rates, don't impact the economy right away. My buddy who works at the FED, worked on a project where they examined how long it take for an increase in interest rates to start having an effect on the economy. It's about six to nine months before the impacts are really seen. However, a fast increase in interest rates has a much faster impact (same with a fast decrease in interest rates).\n\n# Technology\n\nLast, we have technology. As technology advances, it is almost always a force against consumer price inflation. If Cathie Woods is right and this decade is an orgy of technological advancements with self driving cars, massive improvements in healthcare, major disruptions causing legacy companies to cut prices in order to compete, etc. the deflationary forces will be immense.\n\nSo in this case, it's a scale. The more technological advancement, the more force against consumer price inflation.\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nWill we have much high levels of consumer price inflation in this decade? In my eyes, it all comes down to globalization. If we start unwinding globalization, the inflationary pressures will be immense as we have to rebuild the infrastructure to manufacture at home. The forces of technology, demographics and tighter monetary conditions would not be able to stop that.\n\nOn the other hand, should globalization continue, perhaps we won't see consumer price inflation higher than 2% and what we currently see is actually \"transitory\" and short lived.\n\nAs always,\n\nPP Poopie", "id": "r9k7ga", "created_utc": 1638724292.0, "score": 269, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "Today we discuss inflation.

If QE is the culprit, why are inflation rates only increasing now? If you're arguing for a delayed response to QE, then why is the inflation hitting at the same time in the EU and US, despite the fact that QE started at different times in both areas? \n\nI have to put this one down to supply chain issues and the fact that people saved a lot of money during lockdowns, which they now want to spend.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "The data says you are correct, and directly contradicts people taking a shallow mechanic/ideological position on monetary policy like the OP kinda does. It's not enough to say that increasing money supply is inflationary (of course it is), the question is whether it's the dominant or even a real source of that inflation. People working backwards from ideology say \"of course it is, because I think it should be.\"\n\nSo if we look at the data, what we see is a gap up in spending, a gap up in demand, and when you look at the overall supply situation, what you see is not longterm systemic inflation like you get with an indefinite oil embargo for political reasons (like in the 1970s) but rather a short term logistical and demand arc from the pandemic.\n\nWhat are we reading about in many of these earnings reports? Flexible multiple contracts to fill orders. The JIT provisioning system in our economy reacts blindly, which is why it failed to react properly when COVID started and lagged by several months, contributing to the supply chain issue.\n\nIt'll do the same thing here. To meet margins and move volume as best they can, large companies are ordering in excess, which puts more pressure on the market... this is being met by booming manufacturing, etc... and that will give us an excess. Then when demand drops off, what happens to labor competition?\n\nBasically, the real problem we're facing down isn't inflation... it's deflation when the demand curve drops off once it's burned through pent-up COVID demand and once we're facing down a JIT-provision oriented glut of product in the market.\n\nIf we're stupid and lean into that contributing to the deflationary cycle, and we're unlucky, that could destabilize asset prices. Imagine a massive price reduction in housing, popping the current regional bubble in some places... that would imbalance the banks like it did in 2008, but without many of the major systemic collapse issues we saw then (long explanation there), but there's still a lot of risk since the consumer credit and payroll market is based on asset valuation in large part... such a thing can be caused by a collapse in materials and labor prices, which initially would be a boon to homebuilders but would also spur heavy competition, limiting new growth primarily to local political ability to restrain new housing tracts.\n\nAnyway, I can go on and on about the problem, but it all comes down to the fact that the supply chain and demand issues here aren't baked in as permanent in our society.

{"title": "The ViacomCBS -VIAC - Saga: Part III, Return of Hwang", "selftext": "TL;DR - Since VIAC's $85 secondary in March 2021 that triggered the Archegos meltdown, when no one bank knew how levered Bill Hwang was, VIAC has been subjected to a huge amount of manipulation in order for institutions to recover those losses from $85 to \\~$40. Recently it has been pushed below $29, below book value, despite showing huge growth in streaming, decreasing its debt, and a huge slate of new content for 2022. VIAC is now set up to see a huge rebound.\n\nSo I don't want to rehash what most everyone knows. But here goes. Bill Hwang pushed VIAC from the $20s all the way to $100 back in mid/late 2020 until it all blew up in March 2021 when VIAC took advantage of the share price at $100 and raised $3 billion by doing a secondary offering at $85. When institutions bought those shares, they had no idea how levered via swaps Bill Hwang was; and given secondarys cause the stock to immediately drop, it caused a margin call, and, well...\n\nSince then VIAC traded in a channel from April 2021 to mid October 2021 in the $38-$42 range, with small pops to $47 and dips to $35. But it always stayed in that tight channel. For a reason. It was being manipulated to max pain on weeklies via institutions lending out their shares to HFs/MMs in order to turn VIAC into a premium ATM. It worked. No amount of good news could get it out of that channel; and there was a lot of it. All we've seen is growth in Paramount+, SVOD, subscriptions, and increase in Pluto TV, AVOD, MAUs. VIAC also has the biggest show across all channels and platforms: Yellowstone. It broke the record for most viewers for a season premiere, held by GoT, 6.6 million, with 13 million viewers for season 4. Incredible. Scatter pricing for ads for Yellowstone is absolutely huge.\n\nEvery single ER since Archegos has also been a beat on the top and bottom line - and in q3 they topped $1 billion in streaming revenue. This quarter they also announced they had a record of 1 million subs in just one week. [https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/368782/paramount-adds-a-record-1-million-subscribers-in.html](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/368782/paramount-adds-a-record-1-million-subscribers-in.html)\n\nWe are also seeing them start to aggressively consolidate all of their huge amount of content to their platforms, no longer licensing it out to Netflix, Amazon, Comcast - astonishingly of each of those competitors, 25% of their licensed content comes from VIAC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c62uefow5t381.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e0b03b5db9a5f022085249aae48295fa4dc50d5\n\nIt is important to understand just how big VIAC's streaming platforms can be. Their sole purpose as a company is to produce and distribute content: that is all they do. They have the huge number of studios for production; and importantly they can \\*distribute\\* it via their own platforms and channels. They need to rely on no one. This image shows just how big they are - they are the \\*second\\* biggest producer of content, only Disney is bigger,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppbjlu0f4t381.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=624538706faddd21b1c5179c57becf30e06d2207\n\nYou also don't want to discount how big CBS is. It dominates primetime. It is by far the number one channel, and as recent Nielsen ratings have shown, legacy is not declining.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hn0gzaie4t381.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbd9e6fe4575860aef5c0bbba69c6dfe6230b3d5\n\nFinally, 2022 is going to be a big year for VIAC in terms of new content; and very soon we will have two new huge new series on P+, 1883 and Halo. They'll also be dropping a new movie every week on P+ in 2022. All the while they are moving aggressively into international markets, increasing Pluto TV MAUs - it's already generated $1 billion for them since being acquired - and have a huge slate of live sports, news and other live events. Thanksgiving Day NFL game was the highest rated game in almost four decades!\n\nBottom line is this - VIAC is DEEP VALUE. They are showing HUGE growth, while trading BELOW book value. They have generated tons of FCF via sale of properties and have, and will continue to pay down their debt.
