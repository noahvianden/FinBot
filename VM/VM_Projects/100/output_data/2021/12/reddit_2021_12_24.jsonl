RoboTaxi will completly reshape the way people use transportation. Tesla aims to make it $1 a mile. That's insane. It dramatically increases the amount of people that will be using it. Want to go to a bar 3 miles away AND get back home for $6? A friend's party (where nobody has to be sober before or after) 4 miles away and just spend $8 round trip? Want to go to a grocery store a mile away for $2 round trip? We are talking Bus prices without waiting for a bus that comes every hour OR bus stops... And that runs 24/7. Many low income people will find it cheaper to RoboTaxi around then actually pay monthly gas/insurance costs... Let alone car payment/maintenance. It doesn't just take market from Lyft/Uber/Bus... It actually creates a brand new market due to how cheap it is. \n\nI could come up with hundreds of new implementations for this new market... But I think my favorite is a host of a social gathering and I offer to pay for all transport both ways. Say I want 6 friends over, from 4 households, 1/2/3/4 miles away. That would cost about $100 total before tip. With RoboTaxi, that's $20. I would never spend $100 just on transport to have my friends safely over at no cost to them for a drunken game/movie night. I would absolutely spend $20 on it. I would do that weekly without hesitation.\n\nMusk has been saying that one of the huge reasons we need the Boring tunnels and to increase highway capacity is that RoboTaxi is going to change the way people transport, but that means adding EVs to the road. Tesla will make 20 cents a mile off every RoboTaxi they don't own, but many like Cathy Wood believe when RoboTaxi is online Tesla will make EVs just for RoboTaxi. It's estimated that a RoboTaxi will make 20k-40k a year for it's owner. Let's call it 30k for easy math. \n\nTesla plans to produce 20m EVs by 2030, if that is max capacity... There will be 100m Tesla's on the road by 2033. Let's say Tesla owns 20m of these for RoboTaxi, and another 20m private people allow their Tesla's to be used for RoboTaxi.\n\n20m times 30k is 600b. Add another 20 percent for the 20m private owners, and that's 720b a year... Just in robotaxi income. That's ignoring EV sales, FSD purchase/subscription, and Tesla insurance.

{"title": "NVAX - Lambo or Ramen (Part II)", "selftext": "Here's a link to my part I - [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qezyzx/nvax_the_vaccine_play_so_bad_it_might_just_work/)\n\nA few months ago, a Politico hit piece took this stock from roughly 260, down to as low as 120 almost over night. This created an excellent buying opportunity and I was able to load up on calls and cash in on these over the last couple of weeks.\n\nWithout a doubt, the article was used by a short fund (maybe multiple funds) to crash the price and cash in on their short position. The article cited \"anonymous\" sources within the FDA, stating that NVAX was incapable of producing their vaccine at scale. The company refuted the claims and shortly thereafter, they filed for EUA in multiple countries.\n\nI'm sure there was some truth to the article, but it was clearly overblown as the company has filed for EUA across the world and has already been approved in multiple countries, including the EU and by the WHO, which gives them access to several dozen countries. As their CEO stated, \"you don't filed for EUAs, unless you have solved all your manufacturing problems.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this week, we saw WHO and EU approvals roll in only to see the price peak up to 245 (pre-market) Monday, then fall the rest of the week, all the way down to a close of 177 yesterday. Again, this created another great buying opportunity, as the stock is currently trading as less than 2x 2022 earnings. I believe average in bio-tech is roughly 7-8x.\n\nIf it's so great, why did it crash this week? I think there are 3 reasons.\n\n1. Profit takers. I think a lot of people got in on this when it was trading around 130-150, knowing approval was almost guaranteed (in at 130, out at 230 for a nice $100/share profit in a couple of weeks).\n2. Vaccine sector beat down. A lot of vaccine stocks, and other stocks with high valuations have been getting beaten down in recent weeks. For example, MRNA is down 50% from it's peak in August.\n3. Short selling. It's obvious that NVAX is no fan of Wall Street. It's current short interest is reported at over 10%, according to Fintel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe short sellers took advantage of ideal market conditions, to drive this stock down on positive news. Look at these comparison graphs of MRNA and NVAX, to give you an idea of how manipulated these low float stocks can be. One of these stocks had great news with WHO/EU approval and positive immune results from the Omicron COVID stain:\n\n[NVAX Chart](https://preview.redd.it/078d9tcmtj781.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=515155ca4f9997fe99d99a018b183b7325818c76)\n\nThe other stock had poor results with the Omicron stain and is extremely overvalued.\n\n[MRNA Chart](https://preview.redd.it/0r1zo7jptj781.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09fa27be874cbd14aef349cc76d0c2abfd950c5b)\n\nBad news, if you bought in PM Monday morning. However, good news if you had no position in NVAX previously.\n\nI believe this is going to yo-yo back up well over 200 early next week, as they are set to file with the FDA for EUA before Friday (as stated multiple times by the company this week and previously).\n\nMy current position:\n\n* NVAX 1/7/21 200c (100)\n* NVAX 1/21/21 200c (25)\n* NVAX 1/7/21 250c (40)\n* NVAX 2/18/21 250c (20)\n* NVAX 4/14/21 300c (10)\n\nFair warning, these options are expensive and risky. Don't play unless you enjoy pain. A more conservative (ie smarter) route is to buy shares and sell covered calls around the 250-300 strike price. If the stock doesn't moon, you'll collect big time premiums. If it does, fuck it, you doubled your money in a couple of weeks.\n\n**TL;DR - I believe strongly that NVAX will rebound next week due to FDA EUA filing.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo expand on the FDA filing a little. I believe we will see the filing Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning. I think this gives them the most headlines. I believe they had their paperwork ready this week, but held out for their Omicron data to come out. That's why their CEO kept saying \"within a few days.\" They finally released their data Wednesday afternoon, which didn't give them enough time to file Thursday morning. For them to file Thursday afternoon or over the weekend would have totally wasted a golden PR opportunity.\n\nYou can see Stan's wry smile when the reporter asked if it was going to be this week (Thursday) or next week - [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-fda-filing-covid-143049344.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-fda-filing-covid-143049344.html)\n\nI am also 95% sure they will include their US manufacturing (not just SII). I believe the FDA is requiring this, which caused the extra delay.\n\nThe reason this is important is because this proves that they are able to globally manufacture their vaccine at scale, and it also give them higher margins for the doses they sell. This is currently the last bear case for the stock - they have a great vaccine, but they can't manufacture at scale and the only doses that they will be able to sell are low margin ones via SII.\n\nIf they do include US manufacturing in their filing next week, I'm pretty confident this will add 25-50% to their SP within 2-3 days.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "rnobqt", "created_utc": 1640359110.0, "score": 168, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "I had traded nvax in early 2017.

Did we travel back to 2010 or something? EU plans to ban sale of new gasoline cars by 2035. Some states in the US are saying the same thing. Some countries like the UK are saying they will ban by 2030. Do you think politicians are progressive in that respect or do they see the writing on the wall?\n\nBEV sales in the biggest car market in the world (China) grew by 123% last quarter compared to the same quarter last year. \n\nThe amount of money being poured into battery research and development is growing exponentially. Almost a 4x increase in investments compared to last year.
