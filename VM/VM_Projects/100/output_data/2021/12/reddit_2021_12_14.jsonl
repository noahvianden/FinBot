I had written calls at $250 months ago before the hard run up. I sold a majority of my shares that the price. I had followed this wonderful company's stock price every day for years. It honestly kind of felt like it was my child. I watched it grow up, I believed in it and it went on to do wonderful things, but at $250 it was moving out of the house and going away to college in another state (Stanford on full-ride, of course). Everything it did since then I'm not surprised how great, but he's on his own now. If things ever get too bad ($200/share??), we're going to let him stay at the house and wait for a more sunny day so he can flourish again. There's a lot of big buyers out there that feel this way. Short-term downside will be tolerable because there's a lot of incremental buyers that still love this company but let it go because sometimes valuations get too high.\n\nMy point is if you believe in the technology, there's going to absolutely be volatility because its been like this forever, but its a part of the investment -- nothing goes straight up.

{"title": "I think Affirm ($AFRM) is in some trouble (DD)", "selftext": "**The Introduction**\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis can be summed up as follows: banks believed that giving out loans with poor due diligence to shitty lenders was basically free money.\n\nThen Affirm comes along and says, \u201cHold my beer\u201d.\n\nAffirm\u2019s business model is simple. They allow you to make online purchases without having to pay upfront. By integrating with e-commerce platforms they make using their service seamless, which is great for their top-line. However, as we learnt from 2008, aggressively giving out loans isn\u2019t free money. It\u2019s a time-bomb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Data**\n\nLet\u2019s look at the data. A loan is considered delinquent if it is past due by more than 30 days. Here are Affirm\u2019s delinquency rates. Some data is unavailable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Delinquency Rates|\\-|3.30%|\\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\\-|\n|Stimulus Cheques|\\-|$1200|\\-|$600|$1400|\\-|\\-|\\-|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDelinquency rates went down for Affirm between Q2 of 2020, and Q4 of 2020, and remained somewhat stable in Q1 2021. This was when people lost their jobs. So how were they paying back their loans? Stimulus cheques, of course. Once the cheques stopped Affirm\u2019s share of bad loans started to spike, going from 2.4% to 5.3% in just 6 months.\n\nNote that this number denotes delinquent loans as a % of loans held. It doesn\u2019t refer to the number of shitty loans taken up during the period. Think of it this way: you have 10 apples, but 2 of them are rotten. Your rotten rate is 20%. Next day you get 10 more apples, of which 4 are rotten. Your rotten rate is now 30% (which is only about 50% higher than yesterday, even though you took on 100% more rotten apples today).\n\nSo, am I saying that the American economy is going to explode in an orgy of unpaid-for Lululemons bought by people who don't understand what debt is? I was hoping to find a similar trend in delinquency rates for credit card debt, but what I found was surprising:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\\-|3.30%|\\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\\-|\n|Delinquency Rates (Banks)|2.66%|2.43%|2.02%|2.11%|1.85%|1.58%|1.57%|\\-|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Source: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS)\n\nIn the time that Affirm\u2019s delinquency rates went from 2.4% to 5.3% (an increase of 120%) banks saw their delinquency rates go down from 2.11% to 1.57% (a decrease of 25%). People are paying their personal debts. Just not to Affirm.\n\nHere\u2019s a table that might explain why the delinquency rate went up for Affirm:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\\-|3.30%|\\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\\-|\n|Credit score > 96|\\-|71.04%|\\-|74.69%|71.22%|66.20%|62.88%|\\-|\n|Credit score < 90 / no score|\\-|0.26%|\\-|0.31%|0.58%|0.66%|0.90%|\\-|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy educated guess: Affirm is taking on riskier loans to grow the top-line, and it\u2019s starting to go south. Stimulus cheques delayed the fall.\n\nMy scandalous guess: Affirm is trying to grow the top-line at all costs to keep the share prices inflated, allowing executives and investors to make an exit before their retail shareholders learn to read financial statements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Q1 '20|Q2 '20|Q3 '20|Q4 '20|Q1 '21|Q2 '21|Q3 '21|Q4 '21|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Delinquency Rates (Affirm)|\\-|3.30%|\\-|2.40%|2.50%|4.00%|5.30%|\\-|\n|Insider selling|\\-|\\-|\\-|\\-|$43m|\\-|\\-|$101m|\n|Stock compensation|$7m|$5m|$6m|$6m|$140m|$135m|$93m|\\-|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAffirm had seen less insider selling than most other companies, with only $43m worth of shares sold in the last year. However, that changed in November 2021. Between 1st November and 1st December (just 30 days), insiders sold $101m worth of shares.\n\nNeedless to say the stock compensation shot up 2,300% (Q1 2021) when the trouble started brewing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Valuation**\n\nAffirm has a ridiculous valuation. Since they don\u2019t make a profit we can\u2019t calculate their PE. The world of investing believes that tech companies can turn off their selling expenses at will, while maintaining their revenues, so the losses are transitory.\n\nAffirm\u2019s revenues for the year end 2021 were $870m. Let us assume their technology costs, selling expenses, and admin expenses were 75% less than actual numbers. Next, let us take a tax rate of 20%. This would give them a profit of $21m for the year.\n\nThat\u2019s a PE of 1534. Affirm will have a PE of 1534 if they reduce their overheads by 75%. I don\u2019t think a tech company has ever reduced their overheads by 75%. And this isn't even considering the inherent business risk explained above.\n\nWho is still holding Affirm shares?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Future**\n\nThe bulls will tell you Affirm is run by exceptionally talented and honest people who will turn Affirm into the next Microsoft, and every data point here is lying. When has corporate America ever fucked shareholders. Hopium is a hell of a drug.\n\nHere is what I think will happen:\n\nPeople start to notice the rise in delinquency rates, prompting Affirm to cut down on risky loans. They take a massive hit to their growth rate, and acknowledge the issue. People get flashbacks of 2008. Eye-popping growth rates are the only reason tech companies can trade at such high valuations. With that gone, Affirm\u2019s stock will drop into a bottomless well, and $WISH will seem like a good investment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to Play This**\n\nThe market was already rotating from growth into value stocks as I wrote this, which means Affirm\u2019s downfall could come sooner. However, I like to have a margin of safety and would recommend puts that are 1 or (ideally) 2 earnings away. I wouldn\u2019t shy away from far OTM puts since the stock will drop really far once people truly realize the risk here.\n\nDecember 2022 puts $30 puts were recently sold for $0.89. Defensive investors can aim for a higher strike price. Analysts have given Affirm a target price of $161. I give Affirm a fair target price of $2.75, if they can cut down their overheads. Needless to say, no one will be hiring me as an analyst anytime soon.\n\nI had my thesis about Affirm in **November 2021**, and bought some puts then. I only decided to write this DD recently. I am planning to load up on more puts.\n\nMy position from November:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gbsm0fhb2k581.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1e690b670ae13c6be183682442740dd963c5bd5\n\n\\#BurryEdgeChallenge", "id": "rge89w", "created_utc": 1639507560.0, "score": 470, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 316, "comments": [{"body": "My god this country is going straight to the shitter.

It sounds like a lot of this analysis is around delinquency of the loan, which is is it the loan is 30 days or greater past due. Aka PD30.\n\n2. This analysis is at the loan level and not the dollar level.\n\nThere is potential where the situation is not as bad as we might think from the analysis and it has to do with a few pieces of information that would be needed.\n\n1. We need to know when they charge off their bad debts. I would assume that it's getting charged off at pd180 but that might not be the case. If they aren't charging it off after 180 days and they're leaving it on the books for longer it will cause the number of loans that are delinquent to continue to rise. So then it really becomes a question of new or existing accounts and the delinquency that we see on those cohorts.\n\n2. We're talking about account level data which could differ quite drastically from Dollar level data.  You might have 5% of the accounts going delinquent when only 1% of the dollars going delinquent.\n\n3.  If the company is growing quite rapidly in the number of users and the new users are going delinquent, then it is possible to see this number spike. And while delinquency rates rising like that don't look good, the charge off rates are also really important to understand.  Once you get out past the 60-day mark those debts can be a little challenging to collect on and are quite possibly sold off to collection agencies for pennies on the dollar.\n\n4. I don't know their business very well, but if they're charging extremely high interest rates along with having lower dollar values going delinquent, then it might not be a problem for the business even though it doesn't look great.\n\n5. When it comes to the insiders cashing out, I would have to look up the lock up period, assuming they had one like most companies, because insiders would have been restricted from selling. The insider selling might be just them exiting to get their cash or it might have been a situation where they also saw an overvalued company for the moment. And things are coming back in line to proper evaluation (although I'm not suggesting that that is or is not true)\n\nNot saying that you're wrong by any means and I do find this really interesting.

I haven't done a cohort based analysis, but that would help understand the trend more. Agreed. The information provided in their Q statements isn't consistent, and doesn't always include the origination year.\n2. The numbers of delinquent loans are based on the $ value of outstanding loans as of the balance sheet date.\n3. Affirm has been selling off their loans. Their charge-off rate was very low during the stimulus period. In fact, they made a gain on it since they had made a huge provision for bad debts but they actually ended up with higher repayments. The charge-offs and provision for bad debts both spiked in the current quarter, compared YoY.\n4. Their business is a mix. They charge high interest rates on some loans, and charge 0% on other loans. If they charge 0% interest they take a loss, since the bank underwriting the loans still charges Affirm interest on these loans. I would have to look up how much of their business comes from each of these sources, but they are aggressively promoting the 0% interest loans.\n5. Their lock-up ended 4 - 6 months ago, and there was little to no insider selling around that time.

This is reported every quarter and known to investors. \n\nIt makes logical sense that growing new customers will inherently mean some added credit risk because you know less about them compared to existing or repeat customers. It\u2019s not really an Apples to Apples comparison to credit cards because the percentage of credit card customers who are active and have been customers for years is much higher than the number of new customers they sign up every quarter which is the exact opposite of a growing company that is signing up a significant percentage of their active customer base every year. This is especially true given both the Shopify and Amazon partnerships are new and will likely end up being the majority of their revenue. \n\nAlso with credit cards the bar for being \u201con time\u201d is much lower eg you could have a $10k balance compounding at 29% APR and pay $100 a month and be in good standing. With Affirm the payments are larger because the loan is fixed at maybe 6-12 months for your average loan. That could be trouble for some customers that could cause them to become delinquent, but in any case the losses are capped to that one transaction since you\u2019ll be blocked from using the service in the future and the company can still recoup the loan amount eventually by working with the customer which is what happened when covid started. \n\nPoint is higher delinquency rates is always going to be correlated with new user growth for any lender and since the monthly repayment amounts are much higher for an installment loan than on a credit card where the min payment is paid it\u2019s a bit of a misleading comparison. \n\nAlso this assumes the company can\u2019t tweak the underwriting standards and deny more people in a changing macro environment.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Your first mistake was taking any \"analysis\" from wallstreetbets seriously.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18513889610767365}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": ">nobody wants to wreck their credit score for a pair of airpods\n\nDisagree.
