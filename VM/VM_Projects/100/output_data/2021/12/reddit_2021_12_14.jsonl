I had written calls at $250 months ago before the hard run up. I sold a majority of my shares that the price. I had followed this wonderful company's stock price every day for years. It honestly kind of felt like it was my child. I watched it grow up, I believed in it and it went on to do wonderful things, but at $250 it was moving out of the house and going away to college in another state (Stanford on full-ride, of course). Everything it did since then I'm not surprised how great, but he's on his own now. If things ever get too bad ($200/share??), we're going to let him stay at the house and wait for a more sunny day so he can flourish again. There's a lot of big buyers out there that feel this way. Short-term downside will be tolerable because there's a lot of incremental buyers that still love this company but let it go because sometimes valuations get too high.\n\nMy point is if you believe in the technology, there's going to absolutely be volatility because its been like this forever, but its a part of the investment -- nothing goes straight up.
