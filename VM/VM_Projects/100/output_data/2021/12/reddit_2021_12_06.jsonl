'Talking' about building new facilities and/or increasing production versus actually 'doing' it are two different things.\n\nIt takes years to build semiconductor fabrication facilities, along with billions and billions of dollars. Manufacturing a chip typically takes more than three months and involves giant factories, dust-free rooms, multi-million-dollar machines, molten tin and lasers. Just one speck of dust can cause havoc. The air is constantly filtered and very few people are allowed in. Even with all those precautions, the silicon can\u2019t be touched by humans or exposed to the air. They travel between machines in cartridges carried by robots that run on tracks in the ceiling. Building an entry-level factory that produces 50,000 wafers per month costs roughly $15 billion. Intel, Samsung and TSMC have factories that are more advanced and cost over $20 billion each. Once you spend all that money building giant facilities or upgrading your current one, they risk becoming obsolete in five years or less. The technological advances within this product, along with the expected increase in demand for these chips, means the gap between the industry leaders versus the rest of the field will only increase. Few will be able to keep up or have the continued capital to do so. It is hard not to see these shortages extend for years.\n\nSo the increase in production that you speak off is not just a 'switch' that these companies can flip and just decide to increase - it takes billions and billions in capital and years to facilitate these new facilities or upgrades.
