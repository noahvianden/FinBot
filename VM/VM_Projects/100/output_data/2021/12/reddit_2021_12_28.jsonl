The speech recognition algorithms went from training them over literal months on traditional CPU clusters to about 40 hours on the GPU clusters for the same data and accuracy benchmarks. \n\nThat said, there are certain algorithms that don't work well on GPUs. If the computations are very complex or the size of the data necessary for one computation is very large or if the algorithm is asynchronous then the CPU tends to be a better choice. \n\nI do a lot of simulations where the inputs of some computations are the outputs of others. Those usually work better on CPUs because the i/o bottlenecks and downtime waiting for data and instructions to be passed to the GPU and the results returned slow down the overall time to run the simulation even if the computations are more efficient in the GPU. \n\nCloud data centers offer both CPU and GPU racks. The demand for GPU racks will continue to increase as AI matures, particularly for image and speech recognition, not to mention defense applications. \n\nImage recognition is also hugely important for autonomous vehicles. As self-driving cars mature (and the laws catch up), dedicated GPUs with their own architecture a will be more and more widespread, which is another area for growth.
