We now know that\u2019s not true, as it\u2019s been extended yet again to May. It\u2019s foolish to think that students will see enough economic gains between now and May in order to allow to payments to resume due to A) inflation running out of control, B) job maker resistance to raise wages to match inflation, and C) persistent supply chain issues that will continue through 2023, causing intermittent and inconsistent amounts of work in manufacturing and retail, further decreasing job security in what are typically considered as relatively stable job sectors. This will culminate in  a large amount of social unrest, just as the weather starts getting nicer, giving a higher likelihood for marches and protests against resuming payments. Delay again is almost guaranteed, and I think talks of cancellation will come back to the table. Whether or not cancellation happens is moot to the fact that people will panic at the discussion and unload their SLM causing it to drop. \n\nDisclosure: I own 3 puts at $13 for 5/20 because that\u2019s all I would have had to make towards student loan payments next month had they resumed. \n\n\nTLDR: people will not be able to afford their student loan payments by May and that will be real bad news for SLM.

Emotions and feeling be damned.\n\nFord has it's own legs, and has a trajectory set on a successful transition. Get on board or don't. This has nothing to do with Tesla.  Other companies are coming on board.  Tesla is not going to stand alone. Someone's going to be second.  And, that's going to be Ford.\n\nSqueeze your eyes shut real tight, clutch your Tesla calls, but guess what?  Someone's still going to grab some opportunities away from Tesla.\n\nBe smart...
