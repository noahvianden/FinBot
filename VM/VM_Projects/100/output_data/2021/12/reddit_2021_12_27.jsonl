We now know that\u2019s not true, as it\u2019s been extended yet again to May. It\u2019s foolish to think that students will see enough economic gains between now and May in order to allow to payments to resume due to A) inflation running out of control, B) job maker resistance to raise wages to match inflation, and C) persistent supply chain issues that will continue through 2023, causing intermittent and inconsistent amounts of work in manufacturing and retail, further decreasing job security in what are typically considered as relatively stable job sectors. This will culminate in  a large amount of social unrest, just as the weather starts getting nicer, giving a higher likelihood for marches and protests against resuming payments. Delay again is almost guaranteed, and I think talks of cancellation will come back to the table. Whether or not cancellation happens is moot to the fact that people will panic at the discussion and unload their SLM causing it to drop. \n\nDisclosure: I own 3 puts at $13 for 5/20 because that\u2019s all I would have had to make towards student loan payments next month had they resumed. \n\n\nTLDR: people will not be able to afford their student loan payments by May and that will be real bad news for SLM.

Emotions and feeling be damned.\n\nFord has it's own legs, and has a trajectory set on a successful transition. Get on board or don't. This has nothing to do with Tesla.  Other companies are coming on board.  Tesla is not going to stand alone. Someone's going to be second.  And, that's going to be Ford.\n\nSqueeze your eyes shut real tight, clutch your Tesla calls, but guess what?  Someone's still going to grab some opportunities away from Tesla.\n\nBe smart...

{"title": "Don't Ever Take Advice Here Too Seriously", "selftext": "**Take my words with a grain of salt. But always remember, advice may very well be bad advice. Apply critical thinking.**\n\nIt seems like I caused quite a stir here. Oh bad bad me. But my point still stands.\n\nIn October, I made a post about AAPL and asked whether it would be a good time to buy calls. AAPL was trading around $143 a share back then. I wanted to buy calls because AAPL was hitting the bottom trendline of a major ascending channel, according to my technical analysis.\n\nI was laughed at by people here telling me that I was \"stupid\" and that \"it would never work\" and that I was a \"moron\" for believing in technical analysis. I DID BUY THE CALLS, with some doubt tbh, and set a stop loss. Sold them two weeks ago at a handsome profit of 56k.\n\nMaybe I AM stupid, but I'm willing to ask questions and learn from mature, experienced people.\n\n**What I learned is, don't ever take Reddit advice seriously. Trust your instincts, and if you make a mistake, learn from it and move on. Learning from your own mistakes is much better than taking bad advice and then learning from them.** The fact is, as much as some of you want to deny it, this subreddit is made up of a limited number of decent people but a whole lot more adults that, like immature kids, tend to call you peculiar names and throw temper tantrums the second they find your opinions disagreeable, not unlike WallStreetBets. You should always be cautious when getting advice here. That's for your own benefit.\n\nIt's sad that nowadays, people only want to hear what they believe in, but refuse to change perspective and hear the other side out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ob8acbuwcz781.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e6b3eb8aa855a825eda117f1c8ccd0e0e9dbc8e", "id": "rpb14x", "created_utc": 1640568076.0, "score": 852, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 328, "comments": [{"body": "So wait, I shouldn't take your advice or I should?

In it, he interviews Jamie Mai. He was one of the guys in The Big Short. Jamie breaks down some strategies with options you might find inspiring. May help get your mind thinking about good trades but I don't recommend following his strategies too closely because he has a team who deals with higher order mathematics and we don't (presumably).

I look for trending stocks like EXR, ACN, LSI, PDL, PSA, and choose the smoothest trending stocks. I'll grab the first OTM call option. I try to get the strike price just above the current stock price. When the stock price moves passed the strike Gamma is maximized and you get accelerated profits. I also like trending stocks because the IV is typically pretty low despite the stock making large moves weekly or monthly. That means the options contracts will be cheaper. This idea I got from Jamie. The BSM model, which is used to calculate options contracts, doesn't take into account momentum. Therefore options on smoothly trending stocks will be mispriced because their gains aren't able to be calculated accurately by the Black Scholes Model.   \n\n\nBest of luck", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Further to my upvote - thank you.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.016800032928586006}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6479434370994568}, {"body": "Trading options is a lot about timing.
