Semis are not gonna rollover anytime soon.\n\nThere are few reasons for that :\n\n1) People are getting crazy for IoT devices day by day. Every child, gradmom wants a gadget. Maybe a smartphone, smartwatch, tablet or laptop etc. (This was not there in old Microsoft days, Only few priviledged dreamt of PC and genuine Windows or Office)\n\n2) Semis are literally doubling their sales every 12-18 months, Look at AMD or NVDA and even guiding further. During .\ndot com there wasnt any guidance. The sales were normal but stock prices were tripled\n\n3) During dot com the Avg PE of tech stocks was around 140. Right now it is around in 40s. We are far from it.\n\n4) With so much social media, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, Whatsapp. This narcissism is increasing even more as we move with time.What it means is when you see 10 videos on YT of cars, U try to buy it or may end up with some small gadget atleast. This social media showoff competitivness fuels greed even more.\n\nYou have now toasters witb AMD chips, Why u need smart toasters ? But people buy it because some youtuber shows it and 90% people just copy blindly.\n\nSemi will have sky rocketing sales because Social Media is fueling their sales and it releases a 5 min dopamine in our brains.

Correct me where I'm wrong. Here is the part I will be talking about:\n\n**If after-tax earnings in the Old Economy grow at that rate, they would rise from $412 billion to $740 billion. With the New Economy\ufffds $980 billion, we have total corporate profits of $1.7 trillion in 2010. At that level, projected corporate profits would be more than 10% of GDP, far above any share in history, and nearly double the fairly steady 5 \ufffd% norm of the past. Nonetheless, that enormous share arguably represents the earnings expectations of today\ufffds investors. Their expectations are priced into the market, so the market, having discounted them once, will not discount them again. Put another way, unless that robust scenario comes true, market risk today is extremely high.**\n\nThe New Economy is tech, telecoms, and internet sales. The old economy is everything else. And for prices (at the top of the Dot com bubble) to make sense, corporate earnings would have to be $1.7T in 2010. Of which $980B would have to be tech, telecom, or internet sales.\n\nSo he didn't believe that could happen, and that's the basis of the whole study right? Well I couldn't find the specifics for tech profits, (everything is internet/tech by those standards lol), but do you know what corporate profits were in 2010? $1.72T \nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/222130/annual-corporate-profits-in-the-us/\n\nSo he was wrong then right? The dot com bubble ramped up quick. The stock price obviously couldn't grow at that rate forever (we know what happened), but to get the return they needed (based on cashflow in the study), they needed $1.7T, and we actually got $1.72T. \n\nOK, so now tell my why I'm wrong for thinking that he just underestimated the \"New Economy\" (tech)\n\nEdit: I understand that the S and P 500 was lower in 2010 than 2000, doesn't that show the last 10 year bull market was justified?

And it's only because I'm managing this for my elderly father (whose a senior citizen!)\n\nWe own about 160 shares of Tesla at an Average cost of $861.  Although him and I had agreed that these would be longer term investments... I do know that his costs run high and sometimes he needs some \"powder\" (cash) to make things happen.\n\nSo this past Friday (first week of December essentially)... The stock dropped a significant amount again due to fears of the new Covid Variant Omicron... But more importantly because the Fed has announced concerns with inflation getting more widespread and a tapering of their quarterly 120 Billion dollar bond purchases by 15b.   All of this does not bode well for growth names like Zoom, Tesla and many others and they've all taken a bit of a beating.\n\nAdditionally, fund managers that I follow (like Mr. Gary Black) will be trimming (reducing) their Tesla shares by the time their PT of $1400 is reached.\n\nSo my dilemma is... Deciding whether to sell say half (50%) of my Tesla shares by the time we reach $1400? (if we in fact do so by say January or early February of 2022)?   Or do I just naively keep holding on to my position for at least several more years in the hopes and hype floating around that Tesla will be worth over at least $2000 dollars a share this time next year?\n\nFor me personally, it's difficult deciding whether to do nothing or sell some shares at $1400?  \nPlus the other complication is that I live in California and my father's income bracket is quite high (he's a very successful engineer).  This means that if I sell his shares, hoping to buy back after a major correction.... Then I will most likely lose a lot of that buying back power (meaning I will end up with less shares) after I factor in some money that would need to remain in his brokerage account to cover taxes.\n\nSo common sense and a lot of thought about this in November, had led me to believe that since we are not dealing with a lot of shares (like thousands)... It may be best to stomach any major Volatility.  But now with all this inflation news and action by the Fed...
