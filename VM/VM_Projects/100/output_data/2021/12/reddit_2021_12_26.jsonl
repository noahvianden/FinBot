{"title": "Foolish to sell weekly covered calls on AAPL just to make some extra money?", "selftext": "Hey guys. So I know someone made a similar thread recently, but I wanted to ask this too along with some caveats.\n\nSo I recently was assigned on an AAPL put I sold and I was actually happy to just keep the shares. I love the stock long term. But I figured why not just sell calls weekly anyway. I can bring in a couple thousand bucks a year even if I'm being super cautious and conservative.\n\nBUT in that other thread, everyone was warning the person to not do it.  Because eventually you'll have your shares called away and be very unhappy.\n\nIs that really that much of a concern though? Yes, I'd be very annoyed if that happened, but I think it's pretty unlikely. I monitor my options daily anyway, and I'll just be sure to roll it up and out each week if I'm even REMOTELY worried about my shares being called away (like I just did on this past Thursday).\n\nSo, those of you who are more experienced, should I stop being cute and just keep my shares and cut it out? Or is it worth it to bring in the extra money?\n\nThanks.", "id": "rp0veq", "created_utc": 1640538027.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Investors hold stocks for growth.

In Osaka Japan, there are entire apartment buildings  dedicated completely to airbnb, and operate pretty much as hotels without the fuss of housekeeping, linen service, etc.  Each apartment has a digital pad affixed to the wall so if you're arriving from outside the country, you select through the menu, and it takes your picture holding up your passport for legal check-in (since it's not a hotel and you can't present it to a desk clerk).

I can bring in a couple thousand bucks a year even if I'm being super cautious and conservative.\n\nBUT in that other thread, everyone was warning the person to not do it.  Because eventually you'll have your shares called away and be very unhappy.\n\nIs that really that much of a concern though? Yes, I'd be very annoyed if that happened, but I think it's pretty unlikely. I monitor my options daily anyway, and I'll just be sure to roll it up and out each week if I'm even REMOTELY worried about my shares being called away (like I just did on this past Thursday).\n\nSo, those of you who are more experienced, should I stop being cute and just keep my shares and cut it out?
