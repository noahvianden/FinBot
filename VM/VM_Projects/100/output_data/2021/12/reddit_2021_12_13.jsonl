{"title": "Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Intrinsic Valuation Analysis", "selftext": "Growth has underperformed value stocks over the last year due to inflation concerns. This has presented buying opportunities for those who want to add to their boomer portfolios for the long-term. I've decided to analyze companies that are down 50%+ from their 52-week highs.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nFounded in 1994, Corsair Gaming Inc. (\u201cCorsair\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) provides gear for gamers and content creators. The Company designs and sells gaming and streaming peripherals, components and systems globally. Corsair operates through two segments: Gamer and Creator peripherals, and Gaming components and systems. To increase brand loyalty and repeat purchases, the Company has 2 proprietary software platforms: iCUE for Gamers and Elgato for Content Creators.\n\nWith many of Corsair\u2019s products maintaining a number one US market share position, its brand, scale and global reach provide significant competitive advantages and allows the company to continue to capture a growing share of the rapidly expanding gaming and streaming market, estimated at over $36.0 billion in 2019.\n\nCorsair leverages its scale and operations to acquire and integrate complementary brands and businesses into its portfolio, completing 6 acquisitions since 2018. Notable acquisitions include Elgato, Origin PC, SCUF Gaming, EpocCam, and Gamer Sensei.\n\n**Financial Snapshot & Commentary**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/tFAjRJs](https://imgur.com/a/tFAjRJs)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FsjHNIQ](https://imgur.com/a/FsjHNIQ)\n\n*Historical Revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA Margins. 2021E - 2025E based on my own assumptions*\n\nSales growth from 2018 - 2019 was 17.03%, and increased by 55.16% in 2020 due to increased demand, consumer sentiment, and better margins. Over the historical period, gross margins increased from 20.55% to 27.34% and EBITDA margins increased from 6.22% to 11.84%. Net Income and Earnings per share had a significant increase primarily due to strong top-line revenue growth, gross margin expansion in both segments, expanding EBITDA with low capital expenditures, an asset light business model, and investing to consolidate market leadership.\n\n**Q3 2021 Results**\n\n* Corsair gained market share in almost every category through Q3 2021\n* Q3 Revenue was impacted by availability of reasonably priced GPUs which curtailed the demand for new PC builds and its components\n* Higher logistics costs including ocean and air freight had an impact on Q3 margins resulting in Gross Profit Margin of 25.9%\n* Gaming Components and Systems segment was impacted by GPU shortages which caused retail prices to surge to 150%+ of MSRP causing many customers to hold off building a performance gaming PC\n* Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment was impacted by IC shortages which caused Corsair\u2019s premium high value products to be in limited supply. Additionally, Gross Profit Margins were impacted by increased logistics costs as well as some reduced sales in premium products\n* Company refinanced LT Debt, increased revolver size, and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR + 125.0 bps\n\n**Preliminary Risks**\n\n* Corsair\u2019s competitive position and success in the market depend upon the ability to build and maintain the strength of its brand among gaming enthusiasts\n* Long term success and company growth depend heavily on continuous development and improvement of existing and new products\n* The Company depends on the introduction and success of third-party high performance computer hardware including GPUs, CPUs, and sophisticated new video games to drive sales of its products\n* Industry is highly competitive and Corsair faces intense competition for market share\n* Sales depends on the growth of gaming, streaming, and eSports industries\n\n**DCF Valuation**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ZzXmFOh](https://imgur.com/a/ZzXmFOh)\n\n*Base Case DCF Valuation: $28.72 / share*\n\n*Winter's Opinion Case DCF Valuation: $42.58 / share*\n\nWinter's Assumptions: Revenue Growth of 13.0% / 20.0% / 17.5% / 17.5% / 15.0% in projected years, EBITDA Margin 11.0% to 12.5% in projected years, Cost of Equity 10%, Terminal Value EBITDA Exit Multiple 10x (used EBITDA given CapEx estimates), $20.0MM growth capex per year, effective tax rate of 17.4%\n\n* Commentary: Conservative growth estimates based on management expectations and industry growth. Supply chain disruptions should begin to decrease throughout 2022 and its likely GPUs and other systems will have pent-up demand over the next few quarters. The company should see a bullwhip effect in sales growth and a decrease in operating costs moving forward. Increase in stay-at-home lifestyle due to Covid-19 should help sustain sales for years to come.\n\n**Public Comps Analysis**\n\nCompetitors: Logitech, Turtle Beach, Dell Technologies, HP Inc.\n\nBased on Multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, Price/Earnings), CRSR share price ranges from $17.40 to $32.30 with an average estimated share price of $23.31\n\n**Outlook and Final Thoughts**\n\nBased on my intrinsic valuation, I believe Corsair is valued at $32.95 (average est. share price of DCF/Comps). Corsair closed at $21.17 on 12.10.2021, representing a 55% discount to my valuation. I think that Corsair is undervalued and selling at a discount. Growth stocks will continue to face problems based on inflation risk until supply chain issues are resolved. The share price may remain volatile in the coming weeks or months. I think this is a good stock to own if you're a strong believer in the gaming industry for the long term and believe that Corsair can continue to capture market share through marketing efforts and quality products.\n\n*Sources: Corsair Gaming, Inc. 2020 10-K, 10-Qs, Investor Presentations, Company Website, Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, WeBull Desktop Platform*\n\n*Disclaimer: All information is expressed as my own thoughts and opinions.

That will likely not change in this quarter or the next one.\n\nHowever, I am also investing in Intel so I follow the GPU releases as well, new GPU releases from AMD and Intel are expected in Q1 and Q2 of 2022 (Nvidia as well but no OEM gives a crap about those since Nvidia is not even planning to release to gamers but to crypto miners). Intel is planning on building a massive stock of GPUs in an attempt to cover as much demand as possible. I am not sure, however, if Corsair plans to build PCs with Alchemist or not (I would expect they would if the leaks are true, it isn't a weak GPU and better than some that they use). Intel's GPUs are also expected to be cheaper than what they compete against (3070/3070Ti at the high end).\n\nTo me, the GPU releases is a bullish case for Corsair's decreasing qoq revenue as they could possibly either have new cheaper PCs to attract new customers or increase their margins with it being expensive-ish.\n\nIt also looked like in Q3 2021 earnings they mentioned that container costs started to decline slightly so that is also good for them.\n\nI do, however, agree with some of the people here about EagleTree. But one thing to keep in mind, [EagleTree has already sold 17.1m shares (24% of their holding) since September 2020](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/insiders/corsair-group-cayman-lp-1128669) and their last filing has been done on 430k shares, which compared to millions of shares before that, might indicate that they might be done selling, at least until the price climbs back up.\n\nI am intrigued though as to why no insiders are buying their own stock at this low price.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Let's see.

{"title": "If You Think Inflation Will Stay Around Longer Than Your Dad, Buy $TLT Puts", "selftext": "# TL;DR\n\nThe long End Of Yield Curve (10Y+) will Steepen. \n\nInflation running hot and CBs can't hike rates.\n\nNobody will buy a negative yield 20Y-30Y. \n\nYields Run, TLT Plummets.\n\nDouble Top with Bearish Divergence (weekly chart).\n\nBoth, fundamentals and Technicals there.\n\nThis may be the only trade you need to make this year.\n\nEveryone will continue to believe inflation is under control until they don't. This is a trade we can actually see happening in front of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL\n\nThe fundamental premise is inflation is present. Within inflationary environments, there is a steepening of the long end of the yield curve.  The long end includes treasury bills with a maturity of 10 years or greater.\n\nSo, if the fed would increase interest rates like many are forecasting, then lending is reduced the economy slows, which adds deflationary pressures and problem solved. However, the FED can't really hike rates in our current fiscal situation. Unlike the 1970s when the US was a net creditor nation with hella stacks, we are now a net debtor nation with a 250% Debt to GDP ratio (rekkt). If federal funds rates increase it would cause the current interest on government debt (currently \\~2%) to also increase. The resulting rise in interest could quickly bankrupt[ the US government](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/kelly-evans-can-the-fed-afford-to-raise-rates.html) (double rekkt).\n\n**How So?**\n\nCurrently, at a 2% interest rate, the US Gov pays $400B in interest. If the FFR goes from 0.0 - 0.25% to 2.0-4.0%. We could see a corresponding doubling or tripling in interest rates. Meaning, we would have to spend close to $1 trillion in interest per year. But, those rates aren't even close to high enough to control inflation. Paul Volker had to increase the mf 'n FFR to 20%! Which would equate to $4T+ just in interest payments. \n\nSo, since we can't raise rates, we are more similar to the 1940s US (shout out to Lyn Alden). Meaning, debt is high and inflation will run hot. Commodities and commodity producers will outperform this decade. These pressures cause the selling of long-term treasuries and a steepening on the long end of the yield curve. This is also known as a [bearish steepening](https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/blog/chart-two-types-of-steepening-yield-curves). \n\nBUT WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?!\n\nHERE'S HOW WE MAKE MONEY\n\nOur greatest advantage is that the US Bond Market is about to go from manipulated (via fed reserve purchasing) to the free market by [July '22](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/fed-s-powell-says-taper-could-start-in-november-finish-in-mid-2022-121092300065_1.html). The free market wants at least a breakeven rate on their T-bill which is currently[2.4%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE) on the 10Y. However, the 10Y is currently yielding 1.5%. \n\nSince $TLT moves inversely to yields, that would drop $TLT to \\~$125. \n\n**What positions?**\n\nThe play itself has been laid out by the FED. Taper to begin Nov/Dec '21 and hopefully, end by mid '22.  \n\nSo, an end of '22/ beginning of '23 $TLT put would yield over a 100% return if treasury bonds return to their breakeven rates by June. \n\nI currently have 10 x 12/18/22 $135 puts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/197q6loev7581.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=d84f517f3b712231551b8751e775b8a86414356f\n\n**Crayons**\n\nI see a massive Head and Shoulders pattern with a bearish divergence in the right shoulder. The target for the H&S is \\~$100. I'm being conservative with my personal target at $120 assuming rates return to breakeven levels. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6s4dle95x7581.png?width=2012&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ac33b78e1956a90d4660e995ac4f0eef55820b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\n1. Inflation is under control and CPI chills tf out.\n2. People rush into the bond market to buy negative-yielding bonds.\n3.
