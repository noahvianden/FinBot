Not only does it not fit culturally to a lot of regions, but also many consumers in even the most developed nations don\u2019t have the disposable income to go-out and buy three weeks of food and other goods in a single outing. Many consumers shop at grocery stores more frequently as their paychecks dictate that sort of spending behavior. \n\nNot to mention that many other countries don\u2019t have the physical space for Costco, and I mean this in three ways:\n\n1) houses are generally smaller and therefore consumers have less room to buy more items. Even fridges and freezers are significantly smaller, so that value pack of 19 chicken breasts won\u2019t have anywhere to go. For example, the idea of a fridge and freezer in the garage is a purely American concept\n\n2) cars are smaller. SUVs, minivans, pickups, and trucks are way less common everywhere else in the world. In fact, car ownership is significantly lower in the rest of the world compared to the U.S. The United States ranks 3rd in number of cars per 1000 people. If you exclude the micro countries (Monaco, Lichtenstein, San Marino, Luxembourg, etc), then the U.S is #1, Iceland #2, Australia and New Zealand #7 & #8, and Italy #10.\n\n3) not many other countries have the lot sizes and geographical area to accommodate a massive warehouse that can serve as both a distribution center as well as consumer-facing shopping outlet. \n\nI only see Costco having a chance in Canada, Germany, Australia, and maybe Japan. Don\u2019t get me wrong, those are huge, affluent markets, but I still see international expansion being a massive challenge for Costco. \n\nI believe this anecdotal take applies to South America, Latin America, Western and Southern Europe, and South Asia.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Already Costcos in Australia and doing well.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6098000407218933}, {"body": "\\> houses are generally smaller and therefore consumers have less room to buy more items.

The smaller the homes the more the quality of a product matters, and Costco is pretty well known for their quality products + refund policy (Specifically speaking to the demographics that shop at Costco)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> cars are smaller. SUVs, minivans, pickups, and trucks are way less common everywhere else in the world.\n\nAgain, look at Costco's consumer demographic. However take S Korea for example public transportation is incredibly cheap and super common (ran by their govt at cost) and taxis are much cheaper for the average person to do a Costco run if they don't want to take the metro.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> not many other countries have the lot sizes and geographical area to accommodate a massive warehouse that can serve as both a distribution center as well as consumer-facing shopping outlet.\n\nMany \"smaller\" countries have massive regional distribution hubs because it is more cost efficient. Sorry for using Korea as an example again, but one day / same day arrival is the norm.

After reviewing with Magna, I think we can exceed 7,500 production volume (previous 5,000) per month to second \u00bd of 2023, to for fill increasing demand!\u201d. This implies 25% more production capacity for the full year of 75,000 units vs previous guidance of 60,000.\n\nThere have been many great articles on Seeking Alpha about the history of Fisker, what makes Fisker unique (using MAGNA and FOXCONN as contract manufacturers much like NIO has done), and some of the troubled history of the failed Fisker Karma. I will not focus on those details here. Suffice to say that Fisker was one of the early pioneers in the EV race and launched his iconic Fisker Karma BEFORE the Tesla Model S. Yes, he ran into some issues with his battery supplier and yes, his previous company did go belly-up. But America is all about comebacks and I believe Henrik will be coming back stronger than ever. I like the fact that he has failed in the past, because that will just make him hungrier to prove himself and learn from his mistakes.\n\n**Specifications from the LA auto show indicated features are class leading at their price poin**t\n\nYou will not find any EV with this range, feature set and dynamic style in this price class (please check [www.fiskerinc.com](http://www.fiskerinc.com) for more details and to reserve one with a $250 deposit). It\u2019s a class leading SUV that starts at $37,499 ($29,999 with current federal subsidies - likely to increase).\n\n**\u201cDelivery\u201d of cars is really only 4 months away**\n\nMost people think the company is 1 year or more behind Rivian or Lucid, but that is simply not the case. In the recent earnings call on Nov 3rd, 2021, Henrik Fisker said that \u201cwell over eight months before we launch the vehicle\u201d that Fisker will be \u201cbuilding two vehicles a day\u201d. With SOP (Start of Production) slated to be on November 17th, 2022, this implies that they will be building 2 cars/day starting around March 2022.  Assuming approximately 261 days until SOP, that means 522 cars that will be built before the official SOP.\n\nWhat will Fisker do with these 522 cars? It\u2019s just way too many for crash-testing and homologation. As a point of reference, Lucid said it plans to deliver only 520 cars by the end of 2021 and only 20,000 Lucid Air sedans in 2022. On December 1st 2021, Henrik stated after the auto show \u201cwe are well over 20,000 \\[reservations\\] and the numbers go up every few minutes.\u201d Difference in their respective market cap? How about $6 BN in market cap for Fisker and over $80 BN in market cap for Lucid - 10x as much! Yes, Lucid is delivering 20,000 cars in 2022 vs Fisker delivering (in my model) 75,000 cars in 2023, but is that valuation differential warranted?\n\nAlso, Lucid reservations holders have recently been alerted to expect delays and it looks increasingly unlikely that the 520 delivery number for 2021 will actually materialize. Lucid also announced yesterday that it is being investigated by the SEC for its SPAC deal with Churchill Capital. Fisker announced on the same day that \"Our merger with Spartan Energy Corp, completed in October 2020, was reviewed by the SEC and other relevant regulatory authorities, To date, we have not received any requests for additional information from the SEC relating to the merger transaction and, to our knowledge, we are not under any investigation by the SEC regarding our SPAC merger\u201d.\n\nI know where I would rather put my money.  What happens if Fisker delivers some of these pre-production cars to employees or \u201cfriendlies\u201d much like Rivian has done? We have to realize that the start of production means different things to different people. Simply because Rivian owns their own plant, their definition of start of production is very different than FSR\u2019s which relies on contract manufacturers. Before you start to complain about Fisker\u2019s lack of owning their own plant, just look at NIO\u2019s $60 BN market cap and it\u2019s run from $2 to $33 to realize that outsourced production can be very successful.\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s get back to Lucid\u2019s recent history to get a sense of what a stock price reaction might look like for FSR when we start seeing some cars on the road. On Oct 27th 2021, Lucid issued a press release stating that customer deliveries of its Lucid Air Dream Edition (priced at $169,000) would start on Oct 30th, 2021. Lucid surged as much as 47% the next and the stock eventually went from $27.69 to $45.92 in 7 trading days! A staggering 65% return in 7 days.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/lucid-shares-skyrocket-after-confirming-deliveries-of-169000-air-sedan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/lucid-shares-skyrocket-after-confirming-deliveries-of-169000-air-sedan.html)\n\nWhat would happen with Fisker\u2019s stock if it could start \u201cdelivering\u201d cars in March 2022, which is less than 4 months away? A similar move in FSR would yield a $18.34 to $30.26 move. What happens when Fisker allows press and auto magazines to start test driving the car and they get blown away with 550bp, 0-60 MPH in less than 3.6 seconds, smart traction (allows the right amount of torque to the correct wheels) and \u201crace-car\u201d like handling?\n\nFisker also features an innovative flexible leasing model with no long-term contracts. This can generate \u201cmore than 250% margin on these vehicles long-term\u201d as Henrik mentioned on the Q3 2021 conference call. FSR can lease their cars over and over again over a 12-year life span and charge each new customer for OTA (over the air) updates for different software enhancements.\n\n**Putting it all together in a model**\n\nSo, now that we know Fisker could pop once their cars start rolling off the pre-production line around March 2022, what is the company really worth over the long-term? Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas resumed coverage of Fisker with a $40 PT and a bull case PT of $90 on August 10, 2021.  News has gotten dramatically better since then, and Jonas has yet to appropriately update his model.\n\nWe not only had the LA auto show, the news that Fisker was using battery packs from CATL (largest battery supplier in the world) with class leading LFP chemistry, but also critical news that Foxconn signed a definitive agreement to purchase the 6.2 MM square foot Lordstown facility in order to produce the Fisker PEAR. This factory gives Fisker the ability to take advantage of any incremental EV federal credits for producing in the US. Henrik even said in an interview that this means that PEAR production could be moved up earlier. He has also dropped hints that Magna is ahead of schedule for the Ocean.  Please show me ONE EV company that has announced being early to market.\n\nOn the February 21th, 2021 conference call an analyst asked \u201cin the announcement from yesterday, you talked about the Foxconn relationship alone to be 250,000?\u201d and Henrik answered \u201ccould see surpassing our original goal of 250,000 by 2025.\u201d  Then, on the Q2 call August 6th 2021, Henrik stated that when JUST speaking about the Ocean \u201cI think we will easily be able to sell more than 250,000 vehicles of that a year and just wait to see it. It's just amazing. In terms of the last two vehicles for its total plan of, four coming together between before 2025, we actually already have designed the third vehicle and the fourth vehicle will be already in negotiations for something pretty unique about that vehicle as well.
