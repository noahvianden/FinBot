{"title": "When the shoeshine boys talked stocks...", "selftext": "[it was a great signal to sell stocks in 1929.](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/04/15/211503/index.htm)\n\nWhat's today?\n\nTalking more to close relatives and friends in the last months I discovered they all play around with investments apps. The amount of money the put is substantial. What struck me how many of them actually use leverage, as it is offered as well in such apps. It is gamified, it has a slider \"2x\" which can with a swipe increased to 5x. They have no clue what they are actually doing.\n\nAll-in-all they are extremely naive and not informed at all. I tried to educate, but then they show how much money they made on such accelerators. They don't look at P/E numbers of valuations, or risk. They jump onto stuff they hear in the news. The notion that the risk they take they have to compare, for example against the S&P500 index tracker performance in the same time they are invested, is not present. (most of them have net green numbers)\n\nWithout exception all of them had the same motivation: their banks charge them negative rates on their cash (I live in europe), up to -0.5% they have to pay. With a currently inflation of 5% ish percent that means loosing 5.5% per year on their cash. But I guess in the rest of the world it is similar. On bonds/cash account you lose every year several % of your money. So everyone flocks into equity, without looking at the risks, \"as it ain't gonna get worse than my cash account bleeding\".\n\nEven an insurance agent tried to sell me an investment with a very high TER. No, the TER was not even known to her. Arguments didn't help, she was sure as hell, again the motivation was that cash was just losing value and that wouldn't change as Europe couldn't afford to raise the rates.\n\nAlso the \"large cap over small cap\" pattern I see. They buy Amazon, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, stuff they wear (Adidas, Nike), you name it. They stay away from the small stuff, because then they have to understand the business.\n\nAlso COVID did a lot. They were bored and saw advertisements everywhere... especially the banks themselves show every time on the login to their cash account their brokerage offer.\n\n[So I just looked up the use of margin.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL663067003Q)\n\nAs images tell more than a thousand words, but aren't allowed here, [here's a link.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=J6OZ) It basically dipped a bit in the march 2020 stock crash and then went up by a factor of 2.\n\nThis ain't good at all. So much leverage, with the FED preparing to raise rates.\n\nMy next step? Get more to a cash position. Green positions I partly exited (will hold some of them nevertheless) and will continue to do so. I want more dry powder if this powder keg goes up.\n\nYes, I know the \"time in the market\", market timing, etc etc. I will stay invested but I'm getting more to cash.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

{"title": "Recovering from a ~40% loss over one year", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nThis is just my experience investing for the first time during the last year and a half. Probably all very basic, but it's been such a ride for me and wanted to share today's milestone of finally not being in the red anymore.\n\n**The start**\n\nI started investing in July last year. Tried to learn as much as possible before doing so. Started with \u00a3600 but quickly kept adding more and more to \u00a310K and beyond.\n\n**The debacle**\n\nSome investments were just moving sideways, which is quite boring, especially if you are constantly looking at your account because you are new and learning, so even though I was convinced and had strong evidence that they were going to go up -and they eventually did-, I started trading to make a few bucks every day.\n\nIt worked for most of of the trades and little by little I could afford one or two additional shares with the same money. Then the big jump up came in and got me out. Missed an about 25% jump (from 80 \u20ac to 100 \u20ac), then jumped in just to see it collapse.\n\nI lost a lot -to me- of money. Only two wrong trades resulted in an overall of over -\u00a35K, out of the \\~\u00a312K total investment I had done up until then. Not only that, the process was painful. Sleepless nights making up things in your mind, anxiety and stress because if you don't buy/sell at the right time then you are missing out. And, of course, you cannot time that. So it affected my sleep and health a bit over that time, and more so after losing money that you had before. You cannot undo it and you feel stupid. And to just recover you now need to have even higher percentual gains.\n\n**The recovery**\n\nAfter contending with the idea of just giving up investing entirely, I switched to long term investing. Did some research and moved everything into AAPL when it was at around $130. I kept adding as I could, and never again sold to trade (or sold at all). I could comfortably forget about it and didn't even care if it went up or down in the short term, because I was committed to stay in for years or decades. In fact, sometimes I could sympahtise with people wishing AAPL went down momentarily just to add more to what they already had. It's been a ride and taken a while, but today I can say I am so happy to not be in the red anymore. Feels so rewarding, and definitely a day I thought would take perhaps 5 or more years to arrive, instead of just about one.\n\nI know this might seem like a smaller amount of money and time to many of you, but just wanted to share my experience after one year and a half investing. I am glad I didn't give up and was patient. I am well aware of the fact that things can go up or down from here, but I am so glad I recovered from all the losses.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is just my experience and I cannot give advice since I am not an expert, but what worked for me is to really focus more on actually investing in a company you trust and think long term, rather than trading and trying to make quick money (you definitely can, but you are also more likely to lose).\n\nThanks also everyone for the discussions in this forum, which were very helpful along the way to understand how things work.

It is ARK's ninth ETF, and begins trading Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\n\"ARK believes transparent companies have less friction which could lead to exponential growth opportunities,\" the company wrote in an investment factsheet.\n\nThe Transparency Index's top five holdings as of Oct. 31 include Cloudflare ( NET) , Bloom Energy (BE), Enphase Energy (ENPH) , Tesla ( TSLA) and Spotify ( SPOT) , according to ARK.\n\nWood became a high-profile manager after her innovation-focused portfolios surged in 2020, with the investment firm's flagship ETF, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), delivering a 153% return that year. She became especially well-known for her bullish call on Tesla -- a call she has since reiterated, saying she believed the stock could reach $3,000 by 2025.\n\nThe investment products have since struggled to outpace last year's gains, trading mostly sideways in 2021. The Innovation ETF is down nearly 25% this year, and the worst performer -- the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) -- down 31%.\n\nOnly two of ARK's ETFs have risen year-to-date -- the Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL) and the ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ).\n\nJust like most ppl on this sub back in 2020 I was a big ARK bull, but after seeing how they've performing since Feb '21, I've sold off all my ARK funds. I personally won't be investing in this new ETF, what about you?", "id": "rb5cmz", "created_utc": 1638901070.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Wow an ark fund adding tesla!

According to Tesla, a party is acting in \u2018good faith\u2019 so long as the party (and anyone related/affiliated/associated) has not:\nasserted, helped to assert, or financially backed an assertion of (i) any intellectual property right against Tesla, or (ii) any patent right against a third party for the use of its technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment challenged, helped to challenge, or financially backed a challenge to any Tesla patent marketed or sold any knock-off Tesla product or helped another party to do so.\nSo, essentially, Tesla\u2019s patents are only free to use if: you do not enforce any right against Tesla, you do not enforce any patent right against another party, you do not oppose Tesla\u2019s patents or copy Tesla\u2019s designs.\nUsing Tesla\u2019s technology would essentially make any other company\u2019s own intellectual property rights redundant. On the other hand, Tesla benefits from the arrangement because it appears that Tesla is free to use any improvements made to its technology by another party.\n\nSauce: https://www.vennershipley.co.uk/insights-events/does-teslas-open-source-patent-philosophy-mean-they-are-free-to-use/", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5433003306388855}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27406010031700134}, {"body": "If Tesla ever falls back to Earth, ARK funds would be toast", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s why ARK will never let it happen.

Do your own DD. Obligatory this is not an investment advice.**\n\n**TLDR** \u2013 Jim Chanos is shorting DKNG, he\u2019s a well-known shorter so other firms are probably piggybacking his trades and are short DKNG as well, same set up as Melvin capital and all the firms that hopped on their GME short, big mistake for DKNG shorts, the best quarter is about to come up, plus new states opened up for even more revenue that was not included in the forward guidance. In addition Jim Chanos went on CNBC and completely shit the bed with his bear math, and got all the fundamentals wrong about this stock.\n\nDKNG is also well capitalized to continue to grow, even in a low interest rate environment, which makes this stock unlike the other growth stocks being sold off, because spending is within control and strategic, not at risk to have to raise capital to dilute shareholders. The company is moving toward Web 3.0 and is becoming more of a tech company then just a regular gambling company.\n\nHow does the price explode, short covering + short covering on dark pools, options gamma squeeze after breakout, Algos forced to de-basket DKNG from short high growth stock basket related to ARKK and macro event driven Algos (interest rates, j-pow tapering and money printer slowing down)\n\n**Price Point = $90+ in honour of Jim Chanos and claim that DKNG trades 30x revenue**.\n\n**Reason #1 - Jim Chanos**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/exmjq5a705481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0a1bb8451dd2b75b9b35c9a335bd159179206e\n\nThis guy is smart, caught Enron\u2019s accounting fraud but he\u2019s lost his touch.\n\nHe shorted TSLA \u2013 [https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/21/10/23427531/why-jim-chanos-is-still-short-tesla-and-this-tech-stock-thats-up-15-ytd](https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/21/10/23427531/why-jim-chanos-is-still-short-tesla-and-this-tech-stock-thats-up-15-ytd)\n\nHe hates meme stocks and those who trade them - [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-chanos-short-seller-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-greedy-entitled-2021-8](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-chanos-short-seller-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-greedy-entitled-2021-8)\n\nNow he\u2019s shorting DKNG but using bogus math to do it and hoping Apes don\u2019t know basic arithmetic.\n\nHe\u2019s quoted in this interview [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash) with the following reasons to short DKNG:\n\n\u201cDraftKings has a valuation right now of 30 times runway revenue,\u201d he told CNBC. \u201cYou can believe in sports betting ... but this business model is flawed.\u201d\n\nResponse from the CEO :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1n2pxbf805481.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae8a1422235ff93384d909ebe8d960501206bee\n\n**Jason\u2019s right, market cap was never 30x revenue, revenue consensus for 2021 is 1.2 billion, Jim Is suggesting the market cap is $36 Billion, DKNG has not come close to that in the past few months and the current market cap $12.72 Billion.**\n\n\u201cIf you quadrupled DraftKings\u2019 revenue and gross profit ... and take their marketing spending, which is currently over 100% of revenue, to 10% of revenue, which is their target, and you keep overhead at today\u2019s level ... DraftKings would still be losing $200 million a quarter,\u201d Chanos said.\n\nBelow is from the income statement, 4x revenue gives you 851,276, he said take the marketing spending and make it 10% of revenue, so that\u2019s 85,127.6. Keeping everything else the same the loss turns into a profit of $440,915.40. So why would he go on CNBC and say different, because he hopes nobody will do the math on their own and trust him. This is pure manipulation or he\u2019s gone senile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqtolml905481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=af724b9f388a8d3796b5af8264eeeba33c0156a3\n\nChanging a few lines of the income statement and keeping all else the same makes no sense as a bear case anyway, most lines in this income statement derive their value from previous entries or are items that would go up and down according to underlying factors, such as cost of revenue would increase with more revenue, expense related to admin would start to taper off over time and Etc.\n\nOnly reason this went anywhere is CNBC hyped Jim Chanos up to be an accounting expert, they even started the interview by reliving his Enron short, but in reality Jim has been losing money left and right and his firm is down a lot. This was a clear attempt by CNBC and Jim to manipulate paper hand investors to let their shares go for little to nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqwir0ca05481.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=830d764ff43e4cd132fcf9f20cd6591004db9d0a\n\n**Reason #2 \u2013 upcoming catalyst to reverse bad quarter**\n\nShorts are going to want to get out of DKNG around this time, with the combination of NBA, NFL and NHL, the next earnings should be a blowout, plus will have the inclusion of new states that just legalized. Our hope is we send them off with a loss rather than a gain.\n\nDuring the last earnings, it was revealed that the lower revenue than expected was caused by favorites winning in NFL games during the weeks that were included in that earnings reports. This is an outlier event that can happen to gambling stocks and as we know just like options trading, you win some you lose some. But based on this information we can project with the recent upsets, the next quarter should actually have a significant increase in revenue. Basically people like to string favorites together in parlays for a better payout, if those hit , the house loses, if there are a healthy amount of upsets, the house makes money, if there are a lot of upsets, the house makes even more money. Look at some of the wins and losses these past few weeks and you will see plenty of upsets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aggvdt0b05481.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=52cb732be4cb67a29a75d887e1d6be5d2f378f36\n\nUpsets outweighing favorites for the majority of the NFL season\n\n**Huge growth**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htn337ob05481.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffd62dd3655b0d43111b156c10b08a706f57f4a0\n\nGrowth comes at a cost and we can see by the income statement, DKNG spent a lot to grow the company, but with that they got market leadership, brand recognition, acquired a quality operator in Golden Nugget Casinos, and overall increased shareholder value.\n\nphysical casino\u2019s are falling behind the online providers, but competition remains fierce and requires spending to open new markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqv1ghjc05481.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=a79b8d9dcaf5a038b12d140a84f60d4ffc0a1c0f\n\n**Inside buying \u2013 always a good sign**\n\nWe have seen a combination of the founders and exec team buying shares in the open market or exercising and holding options of DKNG. This is a positive sign as this time of the year we would see more selling. Also we notice a lot of selling by the big execs in anticipation of new tax laws next year, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and even Microsoft\u2019s CEO had sold significant amounts of shares. So seeing the execs at DKNG buy at this low price shows confidence in the company\u2019s future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeix73bd05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fdc10c5ed14dd0051b765ac2f5a78a983c03422\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn79515e05481.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ba0e0047d9dc4e8bcc5f1698124d7d3cb6eb5d\n\n**Cash Burn and overspending concerns are overblown**\n\nWe get the same argument from short sellers about this stock as we do for all growth stocks. They burn cash and that\u2019s a signal to investors that the stock in not well capitalized and will need to raise funds either through debt or equity issuance, which is dilutive to shareholders.\n\nBut as we can see from the below figures from the cash flow statement, the cash burn is small relative to the actual cash balance. The net change could also be seen below along with the growth in revenue, the ROI on this is clear, the more they spend to open new markets the higher growth is but when these markets start to mature, like New Jersey, they can become profitable within 2-3 years.\n\nSo, the cash burn on DKNG differs from other growth stocks because they are not trying to invent a new product, spending millions on R&D and only to half the product flop, they are gaining market shares in states that are newly legalized for gambling and converting existing daily fantasy clients to sports betting clients. Low risk spending in my opinion because they have done this successfully in other states and continue to execute on the marketing campaigns, they spend on by obtaining the #1 position in the states they are in, over time. If the state is not worth spending on, too small or not enough potential users, they will just spend less, it\u2019s not out of control by any means, and well within the cash balance they have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m336726f05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5fe731d8dd9510c83bac21be45a8f85568ff30\n\nThe below tweet from the CEO should boost confidence in the stock for long term holders, to be well capitalized is a bold statement for growth stocks but not for DKNG.

And this came in a month were casinos were open and travel was not restricted in Vegas.\n\n**Espn deal + twitter**\n\nESPN already has a relationship with DKNG from an earlier investment and a partnership would be worth billions.

Zillow, Pelaton, TeleDoc, Zoom have no real relation to DKNG other than being in the ARKK ETF. This has been addressed by Cathie herself and we even see new ETFs popping up to inverse her fund. Wall Street is shorting a basket of stock related to ARKK and DKNG is being dragged down with them. DKNG differs from these particular stocks because they didn\u2019t have a huge scandal like Zillow, or do an offering like Pelaton, or are considered a work from home stock like ZOOM but the price trend continue to match this basket of growth stocks. This is manipulation but once there is a breakout on DKNG the algos will have to cover and de-basket DKNG from this group similar to when TSLA broke out after their last earnings, which was also a Cathie wood stock.\n\n**Gamma Squeeze Potential**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qc2rmlqt05481.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=eac416148759bc6fe638e5680a02acbc3ce9fff9\n\nDKNG is a favorite of options market makers, with all the options outstanding, any breakout will send the stock flying in either direct, with enough buying pressure we squeeze up call options chain.\n\nOption chain skews towards calls for the next few weeks\n\n**Quote from intelligent investor which relates to the current state of growth stocks**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpz583eu05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=56cfe454d8cc93c52d963411195a548ab9f5754c\n\n**Positions \u2013 300 Shares**\n\n**15 \u2013 Jan 2023 100C options**", "id": "rb1gbd", "created_utc": 1638890344.0, "score": 364, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "Long 400 shares, thanks for DD", "score": 65, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45629197359085083}, {"body": "Need a TLDR on the TLDR.", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "Gambling on gambling, that\u2019s all I needed, count this ape in.", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "Perfect combination for WSB", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09200192987918854}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08051672577857971}, {"body": "its basically a play against options market makers who pin the stock down to burn out FDs and also against short sellers who followed Jim Chanos based on bad research.

This is a pretty good basis for deciding that they will have staying power as they grow into market share.\n\nI would want to make sure their intro bonuses taper off *after year one*, to know if customers are actually sticky or not. Or if you need to constantly throw more comps and bonuses at them. It's a competitive industry so I would suspect you'd need to spend more on retention, it's not 100% a one-time cost to acquire a client, competitors will always be running promotions.\n\nGood app design, brand, and familiarity does count for something, but it's a competitive industry and it is at the end of the day cost driven. If you think back to PokerStar days and their rakeback program (Supernova Elite), that stuff is integral to expanding and maintaining playerbase, even if you are the widest-reaching player in your industry.\n\nThere's some underlying intention to what management is doing with the share price. If you consider the psychological effect of the Entain stunt, it was such a huge bombshell that killed the assumption that their huge cash position protected against dilution. They went from having years of cash burn to potentially spending it all in one fell swop. As management you know this will cause panic and fear focusing on the Class B structure. The insiders dumped about 370M in shares in Q2 and Q3 but now we're starting to see small insider buys trickle in. I think seeing some meaningful insider buys soon would confirm to me it's safe to pile into the stock - they likely wouldn't do this if another Entain-type bid is in the playbook.\n\nIt's kind of a dangerous game to play to speculate on big brain mgmt tactics, but that's definitely the kind of ruthless shit I'd do if your stock was overvalued in the 60s range.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To avoid breaching the limit, the Treasury is using the **extraordinary measures** that allow it to continue to borrow additional amounts for a **limited time**. Treasury has announced that it will implement a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law\u00a0117-58) by transferring $118\u00a0billion to the Highway Trust Fund on December\u00a015. CBO projects that the Treasury will most likely run out of cash before the end of December. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and the credit rating agencies would react with downgrades. Yellen may have the authority to delay the transfer or break it into smaller payments but that would only keep the Treasury account afloat for a few more weeks.\n\n[Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, earlier or later than CBO projects.](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57653)\n\n**12/06** \\- Senate Republicans are rejecting a proposal floated by congressional Democratic leaders to attach a debt limit fix to the annual defense policy measure \u2014 typically treated as a must-pass bill and thought as the last hope for passing a new debt ceiling before the X date.\n\n# UPCOMING DECEMBER FED PAYMENTS OUT OF Treasury account: Balance=$152bil\n\n**12/15** \\- Highway Trust Payment = **$115bil**\n\n**12/15** \\- Interest payment = **+/-$50bil**\n\n**12/15** \\- SSA payment = $**20bil**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Federal Reserve Purchasing Projections Chart \\(at the current rate asset purchasing this chart shows will default the Treasury Account in December 2021\\)](https://preview.redd.it/x2j13wj8t6481.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bce4b7ff740e84d39d01677f5b76af753cf82d33)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Treasury Account DRAWDOWN MACRO IMPLICATIONS:\n\n* money market rates may come under pressure.\n* the wave of liquidity expected to be released could prove inflationary if credit demand is strong\n\n# CURRENT ASSEST PURCHASING REDUCTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH\n\nThe Fed would need to increase asset purchasing reductions to **$15 Billion per month** and stopping after 8months to stop a default in 2022 with the current debt ceiling raising rules.\n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\n**There is not enough time between now and the 15th to stop a default at the current stage of debate in the Senate.

So I'll clear it up because ive been following this for far more than a day like most people here.\n\nFirst, TSMC and Samsung, the other two leading edge fabs are heavily subsidized by their government, to the point where they might as well be state owned. So it absolutely makes sense to subsidize the third leading edge fab, Intel, if we want a domestic manufacturer and to prevent a duopoly situation.\n\nSecond, this isnt the first spat Mark Liu (TSMC chairman) has had with Intel. Months ago he said America should not subsidize domestic fabs because its a global economy and TSMC is better. Essentially he doesnt want the US supporting Intel and not TSMC, because hes the chairman and wants TSMC to be the dominant player..\n\nThird in terms of the money possibly going to buybacks and not R&D, Intel stopped doing buybacks last year to invest more into fabs and R&D, they still are a dividend company, but no more buybacks. Look at their balance sheets, Intel is spending billions on R&D and fabs, even when they did buybacks it was a small percent. AMD has done more in buybacks than Intel has done in the last year.\n\nFourth, there needs to be less dependence on TSMC. We all know what China's/Xi's plans on with Taiwan, and even ignoring that, Taiwan had a major drought this year that forced water restrictions that lowered production. The world cannot rely on one country for like 80% of leading edge silicon. And Samsung is falling behind they will be roughly 2 years behind Intel and TSMC by 2023, while Intel is catching up up to TSMC and only about a year behind now, so it really makes the most sense to give the most subsidies to Intel, who are also domestic and have contracts with the DoD for chips for military/aero sector than to Samsung.\n\nFifth, why should chips be subsidized anyways? Because they are almost as important as energy. Phones, cars, PC's, planes, medical equipment, tractors, boats, manufacturing equipment, you name it and they are reliant on chips. Again, if something happens with TSMC, in the next few years, the economic losses that covid cause for 2020 will be a drop in the bucket. \n\n\nBut at the end of the day, this exact story is a big nothing burger. TSMC simply doesnt want Intel getting the lions share of the $50 billion CHIPS act, because it would be funding their competitor.

Below that comes support of the 50DMA at $991.  \n\n\nTesla news today includes:\n\n\\- Elon Musk shoots down rumors of anything happening on 12/9/2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFull technical analysis and price predictions: https://youtu.be/-q7nOk\\_tu5M", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|2BG086WOP2Xfi)\n\n![img](emote|t5_n9evv|5717)THIS IS TESLA! ![img](emote|t5_n9evv|5717)", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Cramer on Musk: everyone knows it\u2019s all about Musk vs Farley right now.
