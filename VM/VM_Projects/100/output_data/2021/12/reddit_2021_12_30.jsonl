I then place a buy-to-close order right away at 50% profit. If the put depreciated fast enough, it'll close automatically at 50% profit. If it doesn't hit after some time, I remove my buy-to-close order and let it ride for max profit or assignment. \n\nFor calls, I sell as far away as possible and almost always close at 50% profit. If prices soar, I let my shares get called away and I keep my full premium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>did you checked IP before entering positions\n\nI'm not sure I know what IP is. Maybe you meant IV? if you're talking about IV, then yes and no. Around earnings, I check IVs in GME, AMC, and some others. If they're high enough I will sell a Call Credit Spread.
