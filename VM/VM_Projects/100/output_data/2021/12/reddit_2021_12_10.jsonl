{"title": "Advice on my Apple Leap? Keep or sell?", "selftext": "I bought my first ever LEAP a couple months ago and well..it's doing pretty good.\n\nAAPL $115 19 JAN 24 that cost me $4,120 and it is currently (share price $177) worth $7,042.50 for a nice profit of $2,922.50 or 70%\n\nWhen i bought the call, apple was at $143 per share (WOW)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzlalztebr481.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14ae53f7ef1f99768ff198b41c898d54993abd19\n\nWhat would you guys do? Sell or let it run?\n\nIs there any benefit into selling this call and buying a different leap? I looked at the following:\n\n$140 16 SEP 22 - COST = 4,320, DELTA = 0.85, IV = 29%\n\n$140 16 SEP 23 - COST = $5,075, DELTA = 0.76, IV = 33%\n\n$140 19 JAN 24 - COST = $5,300, DELTA = 0.75, IV = 34%\n\nmy overall portfolio & yearly salary are less than 6 figures..i'm in my mid 20's...if this call went to $0 i wouldn't be needing to call anyone for money but i would definitely be banging my head on a table for a bit..i guess to let you know budget wise where i am at. I am sure 3k profit is life changing money for some and a drop in the bucket for others\n\nany advice is appreciated, thanks. (i think the picture below is current greeks?)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6k8vbttebr481.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1760819b2282a7c3612aebd47bd886b1a52b88\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone that commented! I did not expect so much advice. I closed the option this morning for a profit of $3,000.\n\nGoing forward, I would of loved to implement the poor mans covered call on this one, but webull does not have it. For some reason, fidelity hasn\u2019t approved me for call options. I can only do cover calls with owning 100 shares of a stock. (Am looking into doing this with Apple if the share price drops)\n\nMy next question is what brokerage would approve me for pmcc? I have a lot to learn going forward and of course I know that not every LEAP will have returns like this. I\u2019m confident that Apple will continue to grow but I did not want to get greedy. \n\nAgain thanks to everyone on this subreddit for welcoming me.", "id": "rdevoc", "created_utc": 1639160317.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "I hold more than 6 figures in pure Apple stock, plus whatever exposure from various mutual funds and ETFs.  I'm also a lot older than you are I'd wager.\n\nSo with those facts as perspective on my advice - \n\nBuy the stock.  \n\nThe competitive computer landscape doesn't appear set for any major disruption to my eyes.  There are software operators (MSFT) and hardware operators (Dell, though they went private), and there isn't a company out there with the ethos of unifying hardware and software through design like Apple.  \n\nApple has been a long time coming, and perhaps the closest business in terms of \"build don't buy\" is Tesla.  You really need to understand that Apple computers are designed in the same way that the *machines that build the computers* are designed by Apple.  For every iPhone you see, they've built or bought up and refined the tooling that produces that device.  \n\nIt goes really, really deep.  Much deeper than any of their competitors.  The question remains then, will consumers prioritize the fact that there is a bit of a luxury tag on any Apple product?\n\nFor nearly 15 years the answer has been yes - again and again and again.\n\nSo ask yourself, \"what will make people change their behavior?\" because the evidence of recent history proves that we want slick tech.  *Globally*\n\nApple also has an enormous pile of cash.  They aren't so quick to act in some cases, you could argue they would have done well to buy Netflix years ago as it fits their \"intersection of technology and the arts\" mentality, but when they do make decisions, they get things very right more often than not.\n\nThe new M1 architecture does a couple things - to the public, it cements this idea that Apple is a technology leader, but to their balance sheet, it represents a huge bump in profitability.\n\nJudging purely by the jump in gross margin according to their most recent 10K, they're optimizing their COGS to massive benefit.\n\nhttps://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/42ede86f-6518-450f-bc88-60211bf39c6d.pdf\n\n2019 Gross Margin Product 32.2%\n\n2020 31.5%\n\n2021 35.3%\n\nTheir effective tax rate dropped, their cost of sales stayed flat (despite COVID and store closing - they still have the pay the lease -14.6 B USD annually!), their R&D stayed constant *as a percentage* of their revenue (more rev, more R&D budget, more and better products and services faster), basically, everything that should go up has gone up, and everything that should go down has gone down.\n\nThey report 34.9 B USD in *cash* on hand (and we know that they have more abroad).\n\nIf the US Housing Market had been managed the way that Apple has been managed, it could not have crashed.\n\nSo when you hear posters here saying \"they said it couldn't happen to X and look what happened\" tell yourself that's total bullshit.  When companies \"suddenly crash\" there were smoke signals - OR they're just straight up lying to the SEC, which is a felony, and has landed more than one CFO in actual prison.  There were people who saw the housing market collapse coming (not me) because they looked at the data.\n\nWhen I read the 10K, I don't see any skeletons in the closet.  The only thing that could knock Apple down would be consumer habits changing, and I really don't see us giving up tech... ever.", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for the well written response my friend. i will definitely be throwing money at apple for a while, regardless of what i do with this option\n\nsounds like you are set for a while with your holdings!!", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "You have the option to buy the stock at $142 so if you plan on buying Apple hold it and exercise the option.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Wow well said !!!!", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04395982250571251}, {"body": "Very well said", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04559122398495674}, {"body": "Mostly agree but apple contracts the \u201cbuild\u201d, that\u2019s the primary difference between them and Tesla who is truly trying to vertically integrate everything they can.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/11/13/bloomberg-details-apples-sophisticated-manufacturing-robots-and-equipment/\n\nThe humans involved in the manufacturing isn\u2019t the point of my comment - it\u2019s the machinery that matters as a competitive differentiator.

{"title": "Outrages predictions 2022 US inflation reaches above 15% on wage-price spiral", "selftext": "\r\n**Summary: By the fourth quarter of 2022, US CPI \r\ninflation reaches an annualized 15% as companies bid \r\nup wages in an effort to find willing and qualified \r\nworkers, triggering a wage-price spiral unlike anything \r\nseen since the 1970\u2019s.**\n\r\nAt the end of the 1960s, the US Federal Reserve and \r\nthe Fed chair then, McChesney Martin, misjudged \r\nhow hot they could run the US labour market without \r\nfanning inflation. The miscue paved the way for inflation \r\nexpectations getting out of control and a massive \r\nwage-price spiral the following decade. The official US \r\nCPI reached a peak at 11.8% in February 1975. It wasn\u2019t \r\nuntil the recession of 1980-82 and brutal policy rate \r\nincreases to levels as high as 20% that inflation was \r\nfinally killed.\n\n\r\nIn 2022, the Federal Reserve and Fed chair Jerome Powell \r\nrepeats the same mistake all over again as the post-Covid \r\noutbreak economy and especially the labour market \r\nare severely supply constrained, making a mockery of \r\nthe Fed\u2019s traditional models. \n\nPowell believes millions of \r\nAmericans will return to work and fill some of the 10.4 \r\nmillion open job positions as Covid-19 fades. But this is \r\nplain wrong. Some have retired early due to the crisis \r\nand thus have permanently left the US workforce. The \r\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates the exodus of \r\nolder workers to be about 3 million people. Others aren\u2019t \r\nreturning to poorly paid jobs after seeing huge handouts \r\nduring the pandemic and seem to be waiting for better \r\njobs and pay.\n\n\r\nThe big difference between today and yesterday is that \r\nthe pandemic has fuelled a great awakening of workers. \r\nAcross sectors and income classes they realise they are \r\nnow more empowered than ever. They demand a better \r\nexperience: better job conditions, higher wages, more \r\nflexibility and a sense of purpose from work.\n\n Coupled \r\nwith persistent inflationary pressures coming from the \r\nproduction side, the energy crisis and labour shortage, \r\nthis results in unprecedented broad-based double-digit \r\nannualised wage increases by Q4. As a consequence, US \r\ninflation reaches an annualised pace above 15% before \r\nthe start of 2023, for the first time since WWII. This \r\nprompts the Federal Reserve into a too-little, too-late \r\nmove to tighten monetary policy faster in a desperate \r\neffort to tame inflation. But the central bank has lost \r\ncredibility; it will take time to regain it.\r\n\n**Market impact: extreme volatility in US equity and credit \r\nmarkets. The JNK high-yield ETF falls as much as 20% and \r\nthe VIXM mid-curve volatility ETF soars as much as 70%.**", "id": "rdlng7", "created_utc": 1639178665.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Powell bro, no one wants to go back to work for minimum wage when they can just buy dog coins and NFT\u2019s w stimmy cheques instead", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "I make 3x more than my salary on QQQ calls for January every year.
