Here's a quick summary of what I saw\n\n*City planning makes Chandler the easiest driving city I've ever seen\n\n*Waymo's service is very smooth and polished.  Easy pickup/dropoff, much better than Uber.  \n\n*Waymo's driving agent is smooth and sure footed.  I spent 45 minutes total riding in it, and never was concerned about safety.  \n\n*Waymo avoids highways and unprotected lefts (UPL).  This caused the ride to be 3 miles and 4.5 minutes longer than the FSD ride.  \n\n*The Tesla navigation required 4 lane changes in a short distance, which FSD couldn't accomplish.  But FSD handled going off route gracefully \n\n*FSD attempted a sketchy UPL across a 45 mph road which was too close for me, so I took over to stop it.\n\n*After resuming FSD handled the rest of the ride without incident. \n\n*FSD took the highway, merged, and exited without incident.  \n\n*FSD is weirdly awkward in seemingly easy situations.  Sometimes even with no traffic whatsoever FSD can be slow and nervous making turns. Waymo doesn't have this issue.\n\n*Waymo is much smoother on steering and turning.  \n\nOverall it was an awesome experience!  It's interesting to see similar quirks of the two systems, as well as the differences.  I put together a YouTube video showing the two rides as well: https://youtu.be/LOKyGmqyL_0\n\nTLDR: FSD was quicker due to the highway and shorter route but failed due to needing an intervention.

Some might argue cash is bleeding value to inflation but it probably depends how you use it, when you use it, why you use it, etc...\n\nYou also dont necessarily have to get assigned. I prefer to roll due to tax issues (In Straya trading on US brokers) but admittedly I have been stuck in badly crashed stock and chosen to bail to get the capital value back to use it elsewhere. (I have a CSP in SWBI entered the day before it dumped, I bought another CSP when it levelled off the day after it dumped this is exactly why I keep 50% cash around. I already closed that one for profit and am confident that SWBI is coming back up longer term.So, I just roll the other one monthly and the value is there to clear 2% on that capital so I am fine with that while I wait for it to return to the strike I sold it at originally, 2% on capital is my monthly target.)\n\nI have also tried rolling out and down while adding contracts to drive the strike down to chase the price, but don't recommend it unless you 100% commit to staying in the trade. When I eventually got tired of doing that it cost me a lot more to close it when I gave up. I prefer to \"Hold the strike\" now (look it up on this sub) and if it is a good company it will recover.\n\nSo I don't even really do The Wheel unless I have to, then usually it would be because I am expecting the company to boom. e.g. MAXR.  I am in it now and likely to take assignment in a few months and sit on the shares (not wheel) as I expect it to go to the moon when they launch their product.\n\nI also will jump out of a trade for a loss if my outlook on the company has changed. PLTR I did this, MAXR I did this breifly but have since come back to it, and CRSR I did this. I lost on PLTR and CRSR but economic outlook had changed for me so I did not stay in hoping for improvement.\n\nBeing able to take losses and move on will often save you from being stuck in mingers when they go bad. Doing this takes practice and learning to listen to your inner voice and let losers go rather than mulling on them. (Learning to trade mechanically in order to override emotion is one of the best/ things to learn)\n\n(CAVEAT: The Wheel is not a guaranteed winner and can go badly wrong, it just seems to work better than most other approaches because your fall back is shares. Hence why choosing long lasting and solid companies with good fundamentals makes the most sense.)\n\nI have tried every weird method for trading options out there and seem to always come back to the CSP and roll  approach i.e. The Wheel. often licking my wounds from losers in other methods.\n\nI'd also recommend diversifying across your choices to add protection. So when one goes down another might not. One thing to look at it is correlation between tickers. choosing those that do not correlate in their movement. e.g. SWBI is a hedge trade for me, if shit goes south economically people will start buying guns in the US (imo).", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Just pretend it didn't Happen....", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07824163138866425}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05896376445889473}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5985470414161682}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0847952589392662}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.492477148771286}, {"body": "Western Union is pretty big amongst scammers and money launderers....however, they are also very big among immigrants sending money back to their countries who are likely not very tech savvy.

{"title": "An Objective Look at Jim Cramer", "selftext": ">*Cramer gets a lot of shit around here, and most of it is deserved.  I wanted to take an objective look at why people like or dislike this guy. This is what I came up with. Would love to discuss more in the comments*\n\nJim Cramer is an investor turned stock-evangelist who has probably reached a wider audience with his financial advice than anyone in human history. Unless you consider the biblical forbearance on lending to be financial advice, in which case the list goes: Jesus, Cramer. Or maybe Mohammed, Jesus, Cramer. Regardless, it\u2019s rarified air.\n\n**What\u2019s Cramer\u2019s story?**\n\nHarvard, Harvard Law, Goldman Sachs, launched his own hedge fund, founded a publicly traded media site *The Street*, wrote six books on investing, and of course, hosted 17 seasons of \u201cMad Money.\u201d On paper, Cramer\u2019s the wet dream of compensating parents everywhere. *I raised a winner, a winner!* \n\n**What\u2019s to like about Cramer**\n\nHe\u2019s fun. He\u2019s like the cool teacher from high school but for stocks. You learn about business, but you also learn about life, and he just gets it the way your parents never could. Sure, his histrionics get annoying, and are possibly a cry for help, but he\u2019s knowledgeable, contagiously passionate, and his show is an entertaining way to keep in touch with the financial markets.\n\n**What\u2019s Not to Like** \n\nA lot of what Cramer does is a disservice to his viewers. He promotes excessive risk-taking under the guise of public education. Cramer purports to be all about empowering Middle America by preaching advanced stock-picking techniques, but he knows the vast majority of his viewers have no chance to beat the market, and those that stand a chance don\u2019t need him anyway. Cramer is to stocks what Dog is to Bounty Hunting. He turns a profession into entertainment. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that, there\u2019s just nothing particularly useful about it. Cramer knows this, he even tells his viewers this occasionally, but that message is drowned in a tsunami of ticker-tape and sensationalized minutiae that turns irrelevant ten seconds after Cramer feigns a stroke at hearing it. \n\nSome people don\u2019t like Cramer's personality. Cramer is one of the old guard, a veteran of the investing era before personal computers, when the most confident personalities made the most money. Haters find Cramer jockish, overconfident, condescending, inauthentic, greedy, and creepy. All of those accusations have merit. He's pissed off entire groups of investors (like wsb) because he's an unapologetic hot-take machine. That's his job. He's the Skip Bayless of finance. The difference, though, between Cramer and an ESPN analyst is that people are investing their life savings in the market. Worse, Cramer will occasionally get serious and give high-quality financial advice. He's capable of doing that, but he's also capable of spitting off five terrible stock recommendations. Viewers have to know when he's doing a shtick and when he's being authentic and that can be hard. Should CNBC be held to a higher standard than ESPN? \n\nThis leads to the inherent conflicts of interest. People listen to him - they buy stocks when he says to, which means he has the power to move markets. Do Cramer or any of his cronies exploit this power to manipulate markets and illegally make money? That's difficult to prove but at the very least he doesn't do a good job of avoiding the appearance of impropriety. \n\nLastly, Cramer has a habit of making absurd, disturbing headlines, including but not limited to:\n\n* Repeatedly calling Lenny Dykstra (who Bleacher Report named one of professional baseball\u2019s 25 biggest Sleazeballs) \u201cthe greatest mind on Wall Street.\u201d Dykstra was awarded his own column on Cramer\u2019s TheStreet.com, which was revoked after Dykstra was busted by the SEC for fraud.\n* Martin Shkreli, famed \u201cpharma-bro,\u201d was arrested on securities fraud, revealed in an interview that Cramer gave him his first job. Shkreli recalled: \u201cJim interviewed me and he asked what I did, I said I played guitar. And he asked me to come and play guitar to prove it. And I played all these wedding songs and I started work at Cramer\u2019s hedge fund March1, 2000, when I was 16.\u201d\n* Cramer apparently admitted to securities fraud, although he later clarified he was speaking hypothetically about the behavior of others. Jon Stewart interrogated him on the matter and it\u2019s must-see TV. \n\nIn Cramer\u2019s defense, he has a target on his back (that he put there) and sometimes gets unfair criticism. During the midst of the financial crisis, he encouraged viewers not to withdraw their Bear Sterns savings accounts. Bear Sterns went bankrupt and the press excoriated him, but his advice was spot-on: the savings accounts were FDIC insured.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*TLDR: Cramer is a legitimately good investor with a lot of impressive credentials and a good investing track record. But little of that transfers to the character he plays on TV. He repeatedly puts himself in bad situations, he has  conflicts of interest (or at least appears to and he does little to avoid the appearance), and he can be annoying.
