Very roughly speaking, 100 shares = 100 billionths which is one ten millionth of the company.\n\nAfter each quarter, the company releases their financial results, and the most important/relevant number is earnings per share (EPS). This tells you how much of the earnings \"belong\" to your stake in the company. \"Earnings\" represents the amount of income left over after all of the expenses in that quarter. Year to Date in 2021 (through September 30), Tesla has an EPS of $2.85. That number will likely be over $4 for the full year once the Q4 results are announced in January (not investment advice - simply an example to help visualize this concept).\n\nNow, obviously all of that money doesn't come to you directly. Tesla takes that money and saves it for the future or spends it on growth, like building new factories and research and development of new products.\n\nWhen companies are growing, they usually do not return earnings to the shareholders because all of the money is being reinvested into growth. The idea is to spend your $4B dollars of earnings now to generate greater earnings in the future. If you can earn $4B from selling just shy of 1M cars this year, imagine how much you can earn by reinvesting that money in factories, batteries, and more efficient productions methods (ie Gigapress) with the goal of selling 20M cars 8 years from now.\n\nAs long as there is significant opportunity for growth, companies will keep reinvesting their money into their future.\n\nMost companies eventually reach a plateau where they feel like their growth is tapering off to only a small amount per year. This is usually because they have grown out their product line and their production to take a significant portion of the market and there isn't a lot of space for significant growth left. Once this happens, a healthy company will make the decision to offer dividends to their investors. Dividends are a direct payment of a portion of earnings to the shareholder.\n\nThis is where the intrinsic value of a share is derived: the future promise of a direct return of earnings. Eventually, the stockholders will reap passive returns from the efficient operation of the company.\n\nSo, you might ask, how is the value of a share determined in the meantime? The answer is complex of course. Fundamentally, you are buying into the idea that you will receive dividends one day. Now, the company may choose to pay a set dividend amount each quarter, or they may link the dividend to a percentage of earnings. Either way of course, the dividend won't be 100% of the earnings per share, as the company still needs to sock some money away to grow slowly.\n\nEven though dividends won't be equal to total earnings from a company, the higher the earnings, the higher the expectation for the dividend, so higher earnings expectation is always better (obviously).\n\nInvesting is always about analyzing money potential growth in the context of time. If I can invest in a stock generating dividends already, why would I bother with a stock like Tesla which is a long way away from dividends? *Because I believe that Tesla will grow so much that it's worth while to park my money in their shares now*. I will receive no direct income for years, but I am getting in \"before\" the growth.\n\nIn this scenario I am projecting that my ultimate dividend from Tesla will be a much larger percentage of my invested money 10 or 15 years from now compared to the percentage I would receive immediately if I invested in company B tomorrow.\n\nHow do I determine if that is the case? Well, first of all, it's impossible to predict the future, so I can't know for sure. But I can model and estimate.\n\nWhen \"valuing\" stocks, people look at certain metrics to determine if a stock is \"expensive\" or \"cheap\". There are lots and lots of metrics and lots and lots of strategies, too much to go into here.\n\nBut I will discuss one briefly - the P/E Ratio. P/E Ratio is the ratio of your (share price) to (EPS). (Share price)/(EPS) = PE Ratio.\n\nNow, PE Ratio is not the best metric for radical growth oriented tech companies like Tesla. But it is a widely used metric which people talk about often.\n\nThe PE Ratio represents how much future earnings are \"Priced In\" to the stock price already. The higher the ratio, the more future earnings are already priced in, and the more growth you need, as a newcomer to the stock, before you would earn a worthwhile return through a future dividend.\n\nPE Ratio, then, is a way of expressing how much of a \"expensive\" a stock is, relative to a stock with a different PE Ratio. Amazon has a PE Ratio of around 60. Tesla's is 325, which is much higher. Tesla's earnings have to grow 325x to justify the price, while Amazon only has to grow 60x.\n\n(Again understand there are better ways of valuing a rapid growth tech stock, this is just an example to explain PE Ratio)\n\nYou might ask where the difference comes from - why is Tesla so high? The answer is simply supply and demand - how many people want to buy in now for Tesla vs how many people want to sell. Because there is such strong demand for Tesla, it is able to support a high valuation. Put another way, people expect Tesla to outperform even the 324x multiplier over time. Because enough people are willing to buy even with that high multiplier, the stock price stays that high.\n\nHopefully that makes things clear as mud!", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "This is all correct.
