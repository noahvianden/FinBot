I search each topic once, do you think i have a clear understanding of the person? Let's say i have a person, I know which groups they had joined and who their relatives are, as well as what their relatives buy and or having in wish lists. Do you think with 10 wish list items, i don't know what they want to have? \n\nSupposedly let's take example of photo tagging (label). If your friend is uploading a picture of you, who have other pictures together. Facebook will combine both the network graph + CNN model to predict that it's most probably you. Sure, google has more photos of each of you, but they have so many other photos that sometimes it's not feasible to go through everyone. Their network effect is not as effective as Facebook. Almost no one uses google + anyways. Good thing FB is shutting down the feature but you get the point. \n\nI'm not saying that google has less data, i'm saying they dont have the BEST data on all fields like the user above claimed. No, there are honest things you can do while be in Facebook (ie: looking through dog pictures, flower pictures, ect...). Another problem with searches is that if someone borrows a computer, forgot to log out, do you think it's not a contamination of data? Also, the search space is too vast, thus it runs into a sparse matrix problem. You can have a ton of data but each topic is only a few lines of data, and some might not be relevant to your cause/ROI. Yes, you do have more data but like i said, I'm not saying they have less data. They have to compete across the front with many other players (amazon, fb, apple, tesla, ect...).\n\nAs for conversion rate, Amazon is probably the best with less page usage. Their recommender model is top-class (same with netflix). They can categorize your shopping behavior -> match with similar people like you -> suggest items that others buy that you haven't. The same method is said with the items browsing. This is personalized data and requires a lot of network effect as well user profiling. Searches are too vast and can be contaminated easily, thus giving you more data but over too many fields to focus on. \n\nAgain, i'm not saying google is a bad buy or anything. I have over $90k invested in google and way less in facebook/amazon. What I am saying is that these AI problems are not easy and google doesn't have the hold of everything on top like the user said. What i can say for sure, is that their Deep learning models are state-of-the-arts and no other companies can touch.

You need to be able to build up a model for someone and having their searches tied to the account is just solid gold.  There is just no other data nearly as valuable.
