Also, It seems their CPU integrated graphics are going to get a huge boost. \n\nI really want to see these Raptor Lake laptops with the new Intel GPUs in them.  Should be launched late 2022.  \n\nMoibleye is making news too.\n\nSilicon is an expanding market. because of that, Intel can lose to both AMD and Nvidia, and still sell more chips, have more revenue, and make more profit then the previous years.  \n\nWhat I see Intel doing is destroying profit margins for AMD and Nvidia.

Also AMD and Nvidia have been duluting owners by selling shares to raise capital while intel had been buying back shares.  \n\nAll three Intel, AMD, and Nvidia use TSMC.  Intel is able to make most of its own chips because it owns foundries.  While AMD and Nvidia are fabless and rely on TSMC or Samsung for 100% of manufacturing.  TSMC has been increasing prices for AMD and Nvidia. Intel uses TSMC, but also has better pricing control because it owns foundries.  \n\nIntel's biggest challenge right now is they are stuck on 10 nanometer chips while AMD is on 7 nanometer and Apple is on 5 nanometer.  Intel is still doing well competing at the higher 10 nanometers.   The rumors are Intel's new GPUs are going to use 3 nanometer tech built at TSMC.  \n\nSummery, Intel is planning on putting out decent enough stuff at lower prices then its competition.

Meteor Lake (Q2 2023) will be a different story though.\n\nAlder Lake is just Intel's sign of life in my book. A sign that they are finally awake. Both Alder Lake and Raptor Lake use Intel 7 process, which is 10nm. Alder Lake is a test run for Intel's P and E cores.
