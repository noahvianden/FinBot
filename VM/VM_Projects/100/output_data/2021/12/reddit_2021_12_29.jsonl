{"title": "Realizing These 7 Trading Mistakes Saved Me Over $200,000 in Losses This Year", "selftext": " If you\u2019ve recently started trading, you\u2019re likely very disturbed by the recent pullbacks and volatility, especially among high-flying household tech stocks like Docusign, Roku, and Teladoc, which are down 45% from recent highs. Even more jarring was the complete crash of Chinese darlings Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com due to concerns that the communist government in China would be, well, communistic. \n\nInstitutional investors used fears of inflation and the latest COVID variant as a reason (excuse) to get out of positions they knew had been overbought. And all the stop losses got triggered thereafter, creating a snowball effect. This has restored some sanity to the market, though I\u2019d argue many stocks are still overvalued.\n\n I\u2019m going to lay out 7 mistakes everyone makes when investing below in the hope that it provides some guidance to those who need it. If you feel you don't need, just don't read it. Thanks.\n\n**Expecting the Market to Rise in a Straight Line**  \n While this seems straightforward, many people believe the stock market only goes up and never down. This is not true. The market goes up 80% of the time BUT not all companies are taken on that ride and you should expect a 10% pullback every other year. \n\nLikewise, the number of smaller pullbacks of 5% have become more common over the past decades and now average around 5 per year. Keep in mind, these pullbacks represent the average of a bundle of 500 stocks, meaning some stocks are affected a lot more than 5% and others less than 5%.\n\n**Not Picking An Entry Point**\n\nThese market pullbacks represent great buying opportunities, but should not be relied on as the entry points because in the moment investors don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a 5, 10, or 20% correction. Instead of trying to predict the future outcome of a pullback, I have a set list of companies I want to buy always ready to go with my target price.\n\nThink of this list as your budget - you determine this entry price and you don\u2019t budge from that target. If the stock drops to the price or below, it\u2019s a buy, and you enter the trade. I may lose more money on the way further down but that\u2019s OK, I got my entry price and need to have faith in the investment rebounding. I have gotten burned more times than I care to count by getting impatient and buying a stock above my target price only to watch in horror as it tumbles back down to the price I wanted to pay to begin with six months later.\n\nTruth be told, this is more a game of patience and good technology. I set price alerts using Fidelity (always to my phone not email) and I try to ignore the FOMO as the stock rides up high quickly.\n\nBeing a successful investor is a lot like being on a diet at all times. I\u2019m constantly hungry for more, wanting to jump in an enjoy decadent treats, and having to sacrifice my desires for better outcomes. If I\u2019m not feeling the friction of personal restraint, I\u2019m not investing, I\u2019m just gambling.\n\n**Setting Entry Prices Based on Graphs Only**\n\nOK, so I need to set an entry point to avoid being the bag holder - how do I do that? There are many ways. The worst way IMHO is to look at a chart and pick a number based on where a stock has been previously aka a previous dip. Technical analysts will often point to support and resistance lines in graphs and talk  about whether or not a stock will hold its fall at a resistance point or break out through a previous resistance line. \n\nNew support and resistance lines are forming all of the time because of the micro and macro environments. Said plainly, events cause these levels - they are not mystical levels that form on their own. People react to events and prices change. And many levels are created by people in support of their own thesis these lines exist, self-perpetuating their existence. Usually, they are formed around events. The events could be company news or it could be macro news about the inflationary environment, policy changes, or other world events. So it\u2019s critical to track events and know what\u2019s going on with the company and the world before going in. You can do this through the news or by using technology.\n\nI use a software system to keep track of major company events and help me understand how they will impact the price movement. I haven\u2019t found a more efficient way of doing that.\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken account of events, the next thing to do is find a way to value the stock. There are many ways to do this and I plan on writing a post with more detail on that in the near future. For now, I\u2019ll note a few simple ways to do this.\n\n**Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)**\u00a0\\- the P/E ratio gives an analysis of the stock\u2019s price relative to its annual earnings or profit. The higher the P/E, the more expensive the stock. The easiest way to understand this is to think about your investment as the share price and the annual return on that investment as the earnings. If the P/E is 20, it would take you 20 years to recoup your investment in terms of the value of those earnings. This ignores a lot of things like inflation, free cash flow, the total assets of the company, company debt, and how fast the company is growing. But it\u2019s a useful back of envelope way to give an idea about whether the investment may turn out well. If a stock has a P/E above 20, the company should be growing double digits annually, not be riddled with debt, and have competitive positioning so it doesn\u2019t get crushed. If it\u2019s trading over 60 P/E, it should be growing earnings and revenue triple digits to justify the valuation, or be in a position to dominate a market for many years to come.\n\nOther valuations include the Price to Book ratio, the Price to Sales Ratio, and the Enterprise Value to EBIDTA. We\u2019ll have to cover these in another post. For now, know they exist but you can use the P/E as a north star to guide your entry points and avoid overpaying for stocks. In an environment of low inflation, P/E matters less than it does than in an environment of higher inflation, where companies with less earnings and cash flow have to borrow more at higher interest rates to continue growing.\n\nSo set your entry price on a reasonable P/E ratio that is in line with the historical 5-year P/E of the company and its peers (Fidelity makes this readily available). If you buy a company with no earnings, it\u2019s going to get crushed every time there\u2019s an inflationary scare because in order to grow, that company has to borrow money or raise more money by selling more shares or debt, which dilutes the company\u2019s value. Likewise, if their high growth stalls for even one quarter, the stock will go into free fall. So you need to monitor earnings results very closely if you own one of these stocks.\n\n**Creating a Portfolio That is High Risk**\n\nIf I had a hundred dollars for each time someone asked my opinion about Nio, PlugPower, or Docusign, I\u2019d be able to pay a full year\u2019s college tuition. Yea, these stocks have done very well until now. But they are volatile stocks all based on the premise of future domination with little evidence to back that up today. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I LOVE growth stocks. But they should compose a portion of a portfolio, not the whole pizza.\n\nI allocate 20% of my portfolio to growth stocks and that\u2019s pretty high, but I\u2019m willing to lose over half of that for the longer term gains. I would never be 100% growth stocks as that is an easy way to experience immense pain as these stocks are likely to crash heavily as we\u2019ve seen recently. And I buy and sell these stocks - I don\u2019t hold them forever.\n\nThere are far better experts than I at creating the killer portfolio allocation, but my advice is to carve it up into stable dividend payers like Verizon, large cap leaders in tech like Apple, large cap healthcare companies (I like Anthem), large cap payments companies like Visa and Mastercard, strong value mid-cap companies like my favorite: Crocs, some consumer staples stocks that people need even when things are bad, some semi-conductors that aren\u2019t overpriced, and companies leading in new industries that actually make money. \n\n**Buying At The Peak Price**\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever bought at the peak, the following scenario should sound familiar: An event happens, the stock you\u2019ve been hearing about all year, which is up 100%, rallies 13% today and another 15% the next day. Analysts up their price targets, the news is buzzing that the company is unstoppable, and days later the stock is up another 50%. You\u2019ve heard about this company for a long time and have wanted to buy it but waited. Everyone you know owns it, brags about their gains, and it looks like it\u2019s making another unstoppable, huge run. Not wanting to be left on the sidelines missing out again, you throw some money at the stock, buying at its peak. A week later, UBS calls the stock\u2019s valuation detached from reality and lowers its price target, sending the stock down 15%. In the days that follow, it continues to sink, with analysts downgrading their estimates. Then they miss their earnings target, and the stock plummets further. You\u2019re unsure what to do, so you do nothing and watch your losses pile up. You are the bag holder.\n\nIf the description above sounds uncomfortably familiar, don\u2019t fret: you\u2019re not alone. We\u2019ve all been there. The only thing to do is to learn from the events and take the lesson that it\u2019s very risky to buy at the peak, where a peak can be defined as the point at which everyone knows about it, is talking about it, and has already invested in it. If you come in after, you\u2019re taking on more risk than the possible reward. So what should you do when you want to own that stock? Wait. Set a reasonable entry point and wait. You might have to wait 9 months. Women do this for children all the time while being wildly uncomfortable. You can handle not buying a stock for 9 months.\n\nThere is another way to play it that\u2019s more complicated: you could pick a price that is a little above your entry point and sell a put. That gives someone else the right to sell the stock to you at that price and in return you collect the premium for the contract. If the stock you want is trading at 300 and the price you want to pay is 200, sell a $30 put at 230. If the stock never comes down, you make $30 a share, and you have profited from the stock. Congrats! If it does come down under 230 and the contract is exercised, you end up buying the stock at 230 but pocket a $30 premium, making your net purchase price 200 - just the price you wanted! Win win.\n\n**Losing Faith & Conviction**\n\nAfter taking a beating on a stock or ten, it\u2019s easy to lose faith in your abilities to make sound investments and even easier to lose conviction in your other stock purchases. It\u2019s these moments where you need to remind yourself that the market goes up AND down and you will have many more years to make money (if you\u2019re healthy) provided you learn from your mistakes and continue trying.\n\nI write down everything I\u2019ve learned in a list that I revisit time and time again. This list is now 30 points strong on what not to do based on 30 ways I\u2019ve lost money. It\u2019s now a list of how to make money in the stock market (and how to populate blog content).\n\nIf you write down what went wrong, you\u2019re committing to lifelong learning and to be improving. If you don\u2019t and opt to wallow in self-pity, you\u2019re bound to not only repeat these mistakes, but you\u2019re likely to sit out on future market rallies because you lack conviction. The best buying opportunities comes when market participants feel powerless and are willing to sell their stock at steep discounts.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s blood on the streets, buy property.\u201d\n\n**Not Having an Exit Plan**\n\nHow much money do you want to make on your investment? The answer can\u2019t be infinity and I don\u2019t know isn\u2019t much better. Professional wealth managers aim for 6% a year, net of fees. The S&P 500 returned an average of 7.5% over the past 20 years.\n\nSo what will I do if a stock I own goes up 300% in one year? I sell it and wait for an opportunity to buy it again when it comes back down to earth. Why? Because I\u2019ve accomplished the returns I\u2019m looking for. I sell it because I reached my exit price, even if that happens a lot faster than I thought it was going to because my goal is to make money not to own stocks.\n\nSome stocks\u00a0*are*\u00a0long holds. Visa, Apple, Microsoft, Google - it\u2019s ok not to have a lifetime price target on these. For others less established, I like to have a goal. I bought Lemonade stock at $44 for example. When I bought it pre-IPO, I thought it was a 10X stock over 10 years. In the first year, the stock skyrocketed to 175. It was too much too fast for the trajectory I was expecting so I sold some at 80 and the rest at 120. Making 2 x and 3x my money in one year reached my goal of 10X return over 10 years in terms of the annual return, so I was out. I also thought the valuation was not justified. Others agree, and the stock is back at $44 now. If I had bought and held, I would have achieved no profit. Instead, I grossed $50,000 on a $20,000 investment.\n\nIn case you\u2019re curious, I do plan to buy Lemonade again IF they can prove they are able to gross more revenue per existing client. Right now they are paying too much for customer acquisition.\n\nJust remember to take taxes into account when determining your profit targets. In my case, I held LMND for a year prior to selling, so I paid capital gains taxes not income tax rates.\n\nGood luck.", "id": "rr5xz1", "created_utc": 1640776757.0, "score": 1128, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "Top tier shit post.\n\nMe - not having $200,000 saved me $200,000 in losses this year.", "score": 987, "replies": [{"body": "Amazing outcome", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "The only plausible one", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "#winning", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15898576378822327}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22338847815990448}, {"body": "And all the friends we made along the way.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12994638085365295}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15764892101287842}, {"body": "in other news, 100% of the people that didnt die, are alive.", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1738036870956421}, {"body": "wonder why OP didnt post on wsb lol", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "They're auditioning for a Seeking Alpha gig.", "score": 29, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1670873761177063}, {"body": "Clearly not decerebrate.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.018009968101978302}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15947218239307404}, {"body": "Financial advisers *HATE* him because of this one easy trick!", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3671148121356964}, {"body": "Congrats on your top tier strategy", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38905924558639526}, {"body": "Perfect hedge", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26692068576812744}, {"body": "You fucking beat me", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21066701412200928}, {"body": "we are not the same", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12315184623003006}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3325527310371399}, {"body": "Op should also share his \u201c30 points\u201d list he lost money", "score": 89, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20481666922569275}, {"body": "What the fuck's an exit strategy?", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "Hold until it's delisted", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19502156972885132}, {"body": "A margin call.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44311216473579407}, {"body": "Something MSM articles tell you to make so you can exit good positions instead of holding them for better gains", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45729371905326843}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24608327448368073}, {"body": "The peak bullet is BS.

{"title": "Anyone else seeing huge value opportunities in this market?", "selftext": "Is it just me, or has cheap gotten really, really cheap? No, it isn't just me. Even though value did well this year, the value spread is still near the biggest it's ever been (I like AQR's insights on this). That means that the stocks that have low P/E, P/B etc. have gotten cheaper, while those with astronomical ratios or negative earnings have gotten more expensive.\n\nThe most obvious and widely known one is probably T. Doesn't even need to be discussed, really. Buy one cheap telecom with huge earnings, get one big media/streaming company for free. Telecoms overall are unreasonably cheap... check out KT Corporation for example, it's fun.\n\nAnother one is the big Russian gas company. It's not going anywhere, being among the cheapest producers of the world's most important \"green\" energy source, with the biggest reserves on earth. Not to mention europe's suicidal energy politics. Going to get a dividend yield of 20-25% on my cost basis, would buy more but it's already over 10% of my portfolio...\n\nThen there's VIAC, which is priced like it wouldn't even exist in five years. No, it still makes a lot of money, has a fast growing streaming service, and a huge library of content. Maybe a buyout candidate?\n\nAn interesting one is Rolls Royce. It makes stuff like plane engines and energy systems, and is researching small modular nuclear reactors which may become the saviors of the planet. Priced like it's going out of business next week with a P/E of 4.\n\nThe Crown Jewel of China, BABA. It's gotten so much hate recently that I just had to buy some. Anything sub $150 is a steal for this kind of growth and moat. I missed my chance with Amazon, so why not try with the next best thing? Worth now the risk of a \"hostile takeover\" by CCP, IMO.\n\nCorsair. This has been popular on some unsavoury places, but maybe not entirely without merit. PC gaming is growing, so why wouldn't this stock grow too. The company isn't 50% worse than it was less than a year ago, as the share price would indicate. Hugely shorted.\n\nGold miners are cheap as hell while still making nice earnings. One would think that gold would get some love in an inflationary environment? I dunno, maybe it's just not that popular right now. The best time to buy.\n\nThen there's the entire nuclear fuel market. Every investor in the know has a small stake in it, simply because of the asymmetric risk/reward ratio.\n\nSome other cheap stocks that I own but maybe wouldn't add too much at this point are MU, KHC, WBA, INTC, some small steel companies and banks. And \"cheap\" tech SPOT, TWTR.\n\nShare your cheap stock ideas or criticize mine!\n\nDisclaimer: I own stock in all of the companies mentioned, have used long term margin to buy them, and am going to buy more in the near future.\n\ne: can't believe I forgot to mention Berkshire Hathaway.

We spend millions making sure e-sports \"athletes\" use our gear and have our logo on their t-shirt and fans notice that.\n\nc) It's not just gaming that is growing but streaming too. Our streaming gear like Elgato capture cards, microphones, web cams and other will surely benefit.\n\nd) In addition to streaming gear we are also starting streaming coaching service that is much higher margin business and growth segment.\n\ne) What really separates us from our competitors is that while we have competitors only selling PC cases and only selling keyboards and only selling RAM sticks, we sell it all. You can almost build entire gaming and streaming setup only using our components. Not just that but it all integrates into the same system via our iCUE software and then it all plays nicely together.
