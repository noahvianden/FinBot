{"title": "Why inflation is way worse than consensus", "selftext": "I'm going to be up front, I have loaded a bunch of spy n aapl puts.\n\nSo Jack Dorsey famously tweeted about hyperinflation, which got him mainstream coverage and soon after the stepped down from Twitter. Now he is also the CEO of Block formerly known as Square $SQ so he has insights into millions of merchants and cash app data. He sort of knows what people are buying and whatnot.\n\nNow let's start with what is consensus. CPI is reading 6.8%. Food is up 25-50% for meats. Crude oil and other energies are up. Home prices are up. Stocks are up. SnP500 is up 27% this year. Historical, it usually gives 10% a year. So roughly speaking, 17% above historical averages.\n\nOk so those are the consensus facts. So what's hiding the hyperinflation? One, covid. Omicron is the latest variant and there will be more variants to slow down the economy if it ever gets hot whenever we reopen. It's really easy to see inflation once you go to eat and sees everyone waiting to get seated and the restaurant is understaffed. They are going to raise prices and only stopping them is covid.\n\nFunny internet money and new ipos and spacs also hide inflation. If those didn't exist, the money would have went to other things and made prices higher. \n\nWe talked about the current hyperinflation, what about the future? Well, the Federal Reserve is going to hike to .75%- 1% by end of next year. I don't think that's enough to slow down the economy. Terminal rate is 2.7% which doesn't stop an inflation of 6.7%. Now the Fed is hoping it's transistory, and they might be right. But the only way inflation comes down is when asset prices come down.\n\nNow let me explain my trade. Why did I buy long term puts on the market and AAPL? Only way we stop inflation is with asset prices coming down. Why not make money on the way down of something inevitable? If we already have hyperinflation, then they have to crash the market to stop it. Therefore you should be hoping for a crash to save the US economy. \n\nIf I'm wrong and the fed keeps letting inflation run another year, I think it's totally worth seeing the collapse of the financial system when they finally hike rates to 10% to stop inflation. So either I'm right and I make money, or I'm wrong and the economy goes into even stronger hyperinflation and crash. I will probably dca into deep OTM puts because the crash will be bigger and bigger until it all collapses. $1 of OTM puts would be worth $1000 or more at that point.", "id": "ri7vwh", "created_utc": 1639711712.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "I remember my first time putting on clown shoes and pretending to know more than the circus master.", "score": 207, "replies": [{"body": "Many of you thought it would never happen but I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it.

{"title": "Blue chips wont be fun next year", "selftext": "Why I believe that sector rotation is inevitable starting now\n \n2020 and 2021 have been extraordinary years. They also have been extraordinary for the stock market. After an initial dip in the stock market when COVID broke out everything and anything rallied. Initial dip only lasted 2 months and then sector by sector flew into all time highs and rallied now for a year and a half. There were massive gains to be made in tech, pharmaceuticals, speculative plays, even the old boring financials and even the housing market\u2026 I won\u2019t even mention the short squeezes! I myself had some fun with those.\nNo matter how high the prices looked for the stocks- they just kept getting higher. Critical opinions from analysts and news reporters started disappearing. It just doesn\u2019t look very good if you keep saying that things are overpriced when those prices keep going up, does it? I remember Elon Musk saying that  Tesla prices were too high at $750 pre split- then it reached $1200 post split and now Tesla is trading at 300 PE ratio! And somehow nobody says that it\u2019s that high anymore\u2026 Folks, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Tesla- it\u2019s a great company; and would Elon Musk purpose to me tomorrow I\u2019d say \u201cyes!\u201d without a blink of an eye, but 300 x price per earnings? I suppose Tesla will have to electrify Mars too.\n \nI should not single one stock out. Most stocks have gotten into euphoria zone mid pandemic, mid and small caps including. But what no one seems to have noticed is that while blue chips continued to rally- most mid caps (after reaching highs a year ago) have already consolidated. Yes! That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying -market has already corrected leaving only the shiny blue chips at sky high prices. I really don\u2019t want to be this person spewing gloom and doom everywhere, but I do not see a good year coming for Amazon, Tesla, Google, Ford, Zoom, Nvidia, Home Depot, etc. They are exceptional companies, that are currently priced even more exceptionally (if you know what I mean). We won\u2019t be buying computers to start working from home anymore; we have bought extraordinary amount of cars to avoid public transport so there will be little demand for automobiles in the next 5 years, we have already settled with our new subscriptions, housing market is finally slowing and we are not redesigning our home anymore to accommodate a work from home office. There has been an incredible growth in the past few years but now earnings reports will start coming in showing stagnation or downtrend in demand and euphoria will pop very quickly. Our big growth companies will not be growing that fast anymore and can you really justify 50, 100, 300 PE for something that is not extremely high growth? For something that is possibly very strongly affected by inflation?\n \n \nSo following this thought process what do I think will happen in the stock market? I\u2019ll pretend I\u2019m an oracle here for a second\u2026\nHedge funds need to justify their fees and make some money, most of them do not or are not allowed to go short so they will be looking for opportunities. Possibly stocks that are heavily underpriced with sound fundamentals and that are not that affected by fluctuations in demand. I vouch for the whole pharmaceutical sector to have an amazing year! Data collection agencies, infrastructure, utilities, gold miners should do well. Quite frankly all those beat down forgotten stocks that we were ignoring for the past year should come to life. I believe that after nearly two year stock market euphoria we will come back to fundamentals and conviction plays. Easy money won\u2019t be a thing of the day anymore and things won\u2019t rally \u201cjust because\u201d\u2026.. here I am with gloom and doom again, but I do think that we need to prepare for more of a whack-a-mole setup in the market for the next few years and stay away from anything that doesn\u2019t appear to be a good deal. I also believe that S&P and Nasdaq will pull back and will make negative gains next year or maybe even a few after, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be gains made in niches or catalyst plays.\n \n Check out a 20 year Nasdaq yearly chart to see for yourself how desperately it needs to consolidate and it does do consolidate! \n\nAs for myself, I\u2019ll be scouting out the stocks that have strong fundamentals, high growth possibilities (without hitting my wallet with high PE) and positive catalysts in the near future.
