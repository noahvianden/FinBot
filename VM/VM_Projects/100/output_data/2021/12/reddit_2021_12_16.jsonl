I'm assuming you close them out before expiry anyway, so you wouldn't deal with anything after hours.\n\nNot saying \"do this\", but am curious why you don't, if you don't.

I understand one leg might F him in the A, but both?\n\nApologies, I don't understand the analogy about credit spreads and condors.

At least not on purpose lol.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Do you mean because he'd literally need more collateral he's taking on more risk?\n\nNo, he does not need more collateral to turn a naked call into a strangle.\n\nWhile you're correct that it is extremely rare for both to be assigned, that's not the risk I'm talking about. I'm just referring to the profit and loss regions. With a naked call, you only begin to lose money once the stock price goes beyond the strike price + premium received. If the stock ends *anywhere* below the strike price at expiration, you get full profit.\n\nWhen you sell a put to turn it into a strangle, now you need the strike price to be between your short strikes for full profit. So instead of any price below your short call, you actually care about how low it is allowed to go. Yes, you do get more premium, but that's because you're taking on downside risk now. The probability of stock price landing between your put and call strikes is lower than the probability of landing between $0 and your call strike.\n\nThe analogy of credit spreads and condors is the same thing - instead of taking risk only on one side, by turning it into an iron condor you're taking on risk on both sides.\n\nIt's interesting you mentioned lizards - a jade lizard is a short put plus a call credit spread. It is set up specifically to take risk off the call side. By purchasing a long call, you've reduced the premium received, but if you set it up properly you have no risk to the upside. So it is trying to take the middle of the two strategies we discussed above - try to get more premium, but only just enough as to not invite additional risk.\n\nAt the end of the day all these options strategies are just pushing the areas under the curve around in a [profit/loss graph](https://www.optionsbro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Short-Strangle-Options-Trading-Example-.jpg) to suit your thesis.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Wow this is awesome.

In this scenario, my sum delta is still 200\\~ but now less of my overall account is allocated to these positions, so I am able to use the additional freed capital to either hold as cash, for other positions, spreads, or hedging via various strategies. \n\nThat way, if I was wheeling and FB+MSFT both drop 10/share, I am down 2K. In a PMCC set up, due to gamma/delta I would be down like 1900\\~ so slightly less, but overall no tangible difference to my account.\n\nThe main risk is when you run PMCC but increase your net sum delta exposure which is what usually happens.. you see you can run 2 PMCC for the price of 1 wheel so you double up or even triple up, and now instead of lose 1K when FB drops 10 bucks suddenly you're losing 30 on the same account size. \n\nAs far as risk of LEAPS going OTM or something, I personally would not run PMCC on companies who would be exposed to such draw downs and unless its like DOCU situation, I would likely cut my losses way before the stock is cut in half (hence the 50% of current market price target).\n\nOverall, I do like this approach, it just needs to be managed to avoid over-exposing yourself even though it can be tempting to do so haha.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The S&P when??
