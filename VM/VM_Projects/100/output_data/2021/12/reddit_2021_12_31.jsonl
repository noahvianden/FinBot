GOOGL, -0.31% GOOG, -0.34%, memory-chip company Micron Technology Inc. MU, -2.37%, [Salesforce.com](https://Salesforce.com) Inc. CRM, +0.31% and Walt Disney Corp. DIS, +0.68% at prices that are upwards of 45% below their closing trading levels on the days in which he made the transactions, according to a periodic transaction report filed with the government.\n\nFederal law requires members of Congress to file reports within 45 days after they or their spouses purchase or sell securities exceeding a value of $1,000, along with a rough estimate of how much the transactions were worth.\n\nPelosi, owner and operator of a San Francisco\u2013based real estate and venture capital investment and consulting firm, purchased between $500,000 and $1 million in call options in Alphabet stock with a strike price of $2,000 and an expiration date of Sept. 16, 2022, about 30% below the closing price of the stock on Dec. 17, 2021, the day of the transaction, according to FactSet. He bought between $250,000 and $500,000 in call options in Micron shares with a strike price of $50 and an identical expiration date, about 45% below the closing price on Dec. 21, the day of the transaction.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s husband also bought between $600,000 and $1.25 million in call options in Salesforce with a strike price of $210 and an expiration date of Jan. 20, 2023, about 15% below the stock\u2019s closing price of $247.21 on the day of the transaction, Dec. 20. He bought between $100,000 and $250,000 in call options in Walt Disney shares with a strike price of $130 and an expiration date of Sept. 16, 2022, roughly 13% below the stock\u2019s closing price of $148.76 on the day of the transaction, Dec. 17.\n\n**Link to the full story-** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pelosis-husband-bought-google-disney-call-options-that-would-pay-off-if-bull-market-continues-11640894240?mod=mw\\_more\\_headlines](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pelosis-husband-bought-google-disney-call-options-that-would-pay-off-if-bull-market-continues-11640894240?mod=mw_more_headlines)", "id": "rsrb0n", "created_utc": 1640947466.0, "score": 722, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 173, "comments": [{"body": "The only thing I thought when I saw her buys is that she expects the bull run to continue.
