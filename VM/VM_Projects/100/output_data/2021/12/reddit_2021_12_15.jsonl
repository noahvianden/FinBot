The leftover options remnant of a merger between the heavily shorted American Torchlight Energy (TRCH) and Metamaterials (MMAT). BUYING and EXERCISING MMAT1 before Jan 21 2022 would give you TRCH shares which aren\u2019t supposed to exist anymore.\n\nFinding MMAT1:\n\nOn Fidelity:\n\nThere are 2 sets for Oct and Jan, in the adjacent for both there are some that have multiple lines for same strike. The top one for each double is the mmat1... this is confirmed by clicking get quote and it shows up top. Mmat1.\n\nFidelity instructions below courtesy of u/bigdeerjr \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MMAT/comments/rhezvj/having_trouble_finding_mmat1_options_here_is_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nOn TD:\n\nHave to call the trading desk. They want to make sure you understand it is an adjusted option. Jan is available.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GQeiyVP\n\n\nPart 1\n\nThe Story:\n\nGather round you crayon-sniffing maladaptive little misanthropic misfits and get your mom\u2019s credit card out. I\u2019m going to tell you the story of how your dad who left you both for strippers and cigs 20 years ago has come back as RoboCop to make you 80s rich.\n\nChapter 1: Them Hoes be Greasy\n\nThe story begins with your dad, John Birdman. He really did leave you and mom for cigs and fast girls all those years ago and decided to -try- to capitalize on his passion by launching a company called Pole Perfect Studios that sold poles to strippers in Texas. Unfortunately, he kinda sucked at business and it looked like Pole Perfect was going under. In frustration John dug a hole in the ground to lay down and die in, but along the way he struck Black Gold! \u2014Oil not a dead stripper that is\u2014 And just like that he found hope! Armed with strippers and oil, John set out for The Land of Maple Syrup.\n\nChapter 2: Of Eggheads and Shorts\n\nOn the Canadian side, CEO Jorge Paprika and his crew had spent the last ten years LARPing Mythbusters and making next-Gen light-bending technology. Jorge dedicated his life to the study of Metamaterials, fancy do-hickeys that have a range of applications from shielding people from LAZERS to noninvasive blood glucose testing and MRI optimization. He was so good at this that Canada called his company a unicorn. This made Clivesdale horses feel bad, but we\u2019ll get to that in a bit. \nWhat Jorge didnt know then but painfully learned was that the Canadian mining company he reverse merged his Egghead Group with was heavily shorted and when he went public, his company was shorted into the ground.\n\nAs Jorge sat outside his business on a park bench in Canada staring at his gloomy ticker, the stench of cigarette smoke, cheap perfume and gasoline wafted over him:\n\nJohn Birdman: \u201cSup tard, want to crush some shorts?\u201d\n\nJorge Paprika: \u201cFuck yeah let\u2019s do it eh!\u201d\n\nAnd so our story begins.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nPart 2\n\nThe Science Behind a Gamma Squeeze:\n\nWhen a trader buys a call option, it creates a risk for the counterparty who sold the call option. Without further measures, if the shares rise above the strike price, the option seller will have to acquire those shares in the open market, at a loss, to fulfill the contract.\u00a0\n\nThere are many ways to hedge this risk. The net-net of the process, though, often requires someone to buy a share of the underlying stock, called a covered call.\n\nPositive feedback loop (aka what happened to Gamestonk): As the stock goes up, the market maker will adjust its hedge by buying more stock. Meaning if you BUY AND EXERCISE cheap OTM CALL options, market makers have to buy real shares to keep the option hedged.\n\nThe Escape: Hedgefunds can escape the gamma squeeze -aka rampant OTM call buying- by buying long term OTM PUTS\n\nThe Exception: This DOES NOT work if the Option Chain ITSELF IS GOING TO DIE. Rampant OTM Call buying and exercising cannot be stopped if the options chain of a company is about to expire if it undergoes a merger. In fact, all FTDs of a PRE-merged company are due T+35 days after final Options Expiry.\n\nWe will explore the hypothetical possibility of compounding an FTD due date and a gamma squeeze \u2014aka BUYING and EXERCISING MMAT1 Options\u2014.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPart 3\n\nThe Trade - How and why BUYING and EXERCISING MMAT1 Options could force a Gamma Squeeze of MMAT\n\nThe Clivesdale Horse Hedgefund:\n- Unicorns are cooler than horses, you can ride them, they can fly and gore people\n- Metamaterials was dubbed a Unicorn by Canada and John Birdman and his strippers left their Clivesdale horses in Texas for The Canadian Unicorn\n- As a result, Clivesdale Horse -AKA KERRISDALE HEDGEFUND- is short shares of Meta Materials Inc (NASDAQ:MMAT).\n\nhttps://www.valuewalk.com/meta-materials-mmat-a-photonics-company-thats-an-optical-illusion-kerrisdale/\n\nPreliminary Facts:\n- Torchlight Energy, which merged with Canadian stock Metamaterials, was insanely shorted, GME level shorted\n- Metamaterials inherited shorts from a Canadian mining company and was insanely shorted\n- When they merged, there were issues with the merger and till this day, Metamaterials (MMAT), which should only be trading in America, continues to trade in Canada under Ticker MMAX, when the latter stops trading, the real float of the stock will drop from 218 million to 109 million. THIS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR BY END OF JAN 2022.\n\nMain points:\n\nPOINT 1:  Hardboiled Shorts\n\nWhen an American company merges with a foreign company, Shorts have to close out FTDs on the merged company T+35 days after a merged company\u2019s legacy option chain ends.\n\nCase-In-Point New Egg and Lianluo LTD:\nOn October 25 2020 when news broke about  the Lianluo Retahd LTD merger with NEWEGG, the stock went from 0.4$ to 4$ the next day, meaning the news caused shorts to start covering. $NEGG then hovered between $4-10 until May 19. T+35 days after the Lianluo options chain ended however, from June 29 to July 7 shorts covered a veritable fuck ton of Lianluo short positions, causing the price to run up as high as $79 intraday.\n\nTie-In:  Metamaterials and Torchlight energy merged in June but the TORCH options chain only closes on Jan 21, 2022, so expect short covering FTDs T+35 days after that date.\n\nPOINT 2: Digital Dividends = Squeeze\n\nIssuing unobtainable dividends can fuck shorts.\n\nOver stock DEEZ NUTZ:\nFrom March 13, 2020 to August 21st 2020, eccentric CEO Patrick Byrne\u2019s company, OSTK jumped like a MOFO. This is because he issued a private dividend that shorts could not cover via Ripto-Flurrency that was inaccessible for six months, forcing short sellers buy Overstock shares on NASDAQ to cover their positions, causing a swarm. Hedgefunds sued over this but ultimately lost with prejudice in 2021 so unobtainable dividends are a legal silver bullet to shorts.\n\nTie-In: Metamaterials is issuing dividends to its investors via its PRIVATE company Oilco, dividends which will be unobtainable by hedgefunds without buying and exercising MMAT1 options or buying MMTLP.\n\nPOINT 3: Egghead Stripper Math\n\nEXERCISING Jan 21 MMAT1 Options, purchasable through Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, could theoretically cause a gamma squeeze by forcing call writers to hedge risk, credit to u/CherryGrapeGorilla for example below:\n\n\nWARNING: EGGHEAD MATH BELOW\n\n\u201cMMAT1 2.5C:\n\n2.5 x100 = $250 exercise + $100 premium (if you buy the contract for $1.00) \n= $350 to exercise. \n\n== $7/share MMAT + 100 MMTLP. \n\nWhich is equivalent to $3/share MMAT + $2/share MMTLP.\u201d\n\nMATH ENDS ^\n\nTLDR: \nIn January, stock ticker MMAT is facing four major catalysts that could cause a short squeeze:\n\n1. MMAX converting to MMAT, cutting the float in half from 218 million to 109 million\n2. An Oilco Special Dividend\n3. Jan 21 2022 TRCH Options Expiry forcing SHFs to deliver TRCH FTDs T+35 days later in March\n4. Investors Buying and Exercising MMAT1 Options through TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, exacerbating the effects of Point 3.\n\nI wrote this as a point of academic curiosity. I absolutely DO NOT want people to do this. I love Clivesdales and I definitely do not want Kerrsidale Hedgefund to be Melvin capitaled.\n\nGod speed Retahds.", "id": "rgr480", "created_utc": 1639544754.0, "score": 524, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I havent done the calculations yet but just from top of my head we should be at 40% of FF just since merger on the Nasdaq ticker. Even though it have 2 Cusip the oustanding shares are 281 million. No dilution what so ever. I Will message you printscreens of mondays Ortex and yesterdays they took away 19 million shares from CEOs holdings and changed the % of SI % FF. With all this said remember this does not include any of the FTDs from TRCH. Here is a link to the MMAT forum and a member that did DD on this couple of months ago.  I also suspect that there is a shit ton of FTDs from the Canadian ticker. Its an old Canadian mining ticker. Shorting mining companies in Canada is a national sport for the hedgies there. Canadas market is even more corrupt then the US. They can move FTDs between eachother every 10 days and never even get a slap on the wrist. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MMAT/comments/pjiqtc/mmat_a_checkmate_to_the_shorts_the_galactic_bear/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3110097348690033}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3029007315635681}, {"body": "Fidelity isn't giving me a MMAT1 ticker, anybody else have any luck w MMAT1 through fidelity?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes!

{"title": "Federal Reserve Day - My predictions on Powell's moves - 7 hours 30 minutes countdown!", "selftext": "In response to [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgegd6/last\\_minute\\_predictions\\_does\\_powell\\_crash\\_or\\_soar/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgegd6/last_minute_predictions_does_powell_crash_or_soar/) :)\n\nFirst let's take a step back and analyse the world logically and with facts.\n\n1. The Fed has 2 priorities: (1) Maximum employment (2) Price Stability and low inflation. Everything else is secondary.\n2. Markets have priced in a 2x taper by March ish, a 2-3 rate hike in 2022.\n3. Omicron hasn't caused lockdowns YET, except it most likely will due to the 2x transmisibility. Although Omicron is 90% less severe, and vaccines still work 70-75% for hospitalisations, Omicron is a wildcard. The International Energy Agency predicted a reduced demand for oil due to Omicron as well just a few days back.\n4. Pfizer's 89% pill's final data is reasonable. Possible FDA approval end of year.\n5. Maximum employment seems to have been reached since 4.2% (4.5% expected) unemployment was seen. Participation rate is 61.8%, still lower than pre COVID (63.3%), but it's recovering. Jobless claims (ie unemployment benefits) was 2x less than expected, although this seems to be expected since unemployment was lower than expected.\n6. CPI inflation was as expected - 6.8%. PPI sadly was higher than expected 9.6% (9.2% expected). CPI's main culprit was gas prices and used car prices. Gas prices seem to be subsiding. Used car prices are mostly due to the chip shortage. PPI was due to an increase in demand for goods and services. Gas / oil prices actually reduced.\n7. The UK has declared an emergency for Omicron, and will possibly boost everyone quickly until the end of the year. Australia's Omicron cases are skyrocketting due to a recent superspreader event with 150 people infected.\n8. China showed higher than expected inflation, yet retail sales was lower than expected.\n9. The yield curve was not very nice after Omicron, and before inflation, but it seems to have recovered. In fact, recently, the long term yields seem to be going up rather.\n10. The debt ceiling was just passed (Senate 50 v 49, House 221 v 209) a few hours ago and will now be signed by Biden. It essentially delays the issue until early 2023 or late 2022.\n11. The put/call ratio for major indices (CBOE) has declined somewhat, except it's still around 141 puts v 100 calls. On Dec 10 during the Inflation day it was a whopping 204 puts v 100 calls. On PPI day (PPI higher than expected), it was 141 v 100.\n\n|Date / Event|Puts v 100 Calls (SP500 Index)|Puts v 100 Calls (total equity ie individual stocks)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|23 Tue Nov|146|53|\n|24 Wed Nov (Jobless claims 50% less) (Omicron first discovered)|**178**|50|\n|25 Thurs Nov (Thanksgiving)|HOLIDAY|HOLIDAY|\n|26 Fri Nov (WHO variant of concern)|117|56|\n|29 Mon Nov|161|42|\n|30 Tue Nov (FDA voted 13-10 on 30% Merck)|154|48|\n|1 Wed Dec|143|52|\n|2 Thu Dec|**189**|62|\n|3 Fri Dec (US Budget deadline - shutdown averted) (Unemployment better than expected)|143|74|\n|6 Mon Dec|153|54|\n|7 Tue Dec|168|43|\n|8 Wed Dec|148|45|\n|9 Thu Dec (Jobless less than expected again)|158|53|\n|10 Fri Dec (Inflation better than expected)|**204**|61|\n|13 Mon Dec (First UK Omicron death, emergency declared)|**189**|56|\n|14 Tue Dec (PPI worse than expected) (Pfizer 89%)|141|60|\n|15 Wed Dec (Debt Ceiling passes, FOMC)|||\n\nThe table does show a consistent long term high put to call ratio. Inflation Day and FOMC Monday saw elevated 200 puts v 100 calls. Now it has subsided to 141 puts to 100 calls. It's still relatively high though, except it has subsided.\n\nFor updated Fed probabilities from CME:\n\n|Month|Year|Chance of Rate Hike (13 Dec)|Chance of Rate Hike (14 Dec)|Chance of Rate Hike (15 Dec)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|December|2021|1.11|**3.32**|**5.54**|\n|January|2022|8.46|8.12|**10.22**|\n|March|2022|36.84|**33.04**|**38.05**|\n|May|2022|56.42|56.76|**59.31**|\n|June|2022|78.83|78.07|**81.11**|\n|July|2022|85.39|85.92|**86.97**|\n|September|2022|90.65|**91.41**|**92.44**|\n|November|2022|93.17|93.99|94.63|\n|December|2022|97.24|97.71|97.96|\n|February|2023|97.93|98.31|98.45|\n\n**My conclusions:**\n\n1. First if Omicron didn't exist, Powell would be pretty strict, and may even say a 4x rate hike. This is because PPI was higher than expected, and CPI is on point. Likewise, unemployment is at a all time low, and jobless claims are very low.\n2. But here comes Omicron into the mix - Omicron will further exacerbate supply chain issues, cause unemployment to once again tick up (if lockdowns are seen), and will cause some mayhem. Possibly even a dent in consumer demand. Likewise the International Energy Agency forecast a drop in demand for oil due to Omicron, most likely due to decreased travelling and transportation.\n\nDue to Omicron, in my view, if you look at the world logically, the Fed will still taper x2 speed. Maybe even slightly faster. Most likely 2x. Omicron will be with us for 3 months at least (the US only has just started so Jan, Feb, March ish). This most likely the Fed will NOT raise rates in Jan and March, and will raise rates in May due to Omicron subsiding. Maybe even in June, since April / May might be recovering from Omicron. Then another rate hike in July is possible. Then finally November. Maybe even December, but unlikely.\n\n**IMO Powell will most likely say \"We'll adjust our policy decisions as we see fit because Omicron will cause disruptions to the economy, as seen in Europe. This will impact full employment and price stability. However, inflation seems to be elevated for longer than expected, with Omicron further exacerbating the issue, and so we believe a 2x taper until March is necessary.\"**\n\n**I doubt he'll mention any IR increases, but in the dot plot, it'll show at least 3 IR hikes ie around May/June, July, November. Unlikely March, since March will show the full wrath of Omicron. I'm most worried about a December 2022 rate hike!**", "id": "rgx1qg", "created_utc": 1639567908.0, "score": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 145, "comments": [{"body": "Long story short.

Agree also on inflation / Omicron monitoring.\n\nThat's true - except generally speaking used car prices are generally inversely related to new cars.

You\u2019ll fix one thing, and then two months later, there\u2019s another expensive repair that needs to be made. The car is just wearing out and dying, like a 103 year old human with several types of cancer, the car has just reached the end of its life and we have to accept it.\n\nSo every month, more cars are reaching that \u201cend of life\u201d stage, than there are new cars rolling off of the assembly lines. Meanwhile, a lot of people can\u2019t work from home (waitresses, construction workers, chefs, etc,) and they also can\u2019t walk or bicycle to work, can\u2019t afford to pay $15 each way for a taxi or Uber, and can\u2019t use mass transit because it doesn\u2019t exist in their area. Those people *need* cars to put food on their table, but each month the supply of drivable old cars is dwindling, and there aren\u2019t enough new cars coming onto the market. So the people who would normally trade their semi-old car up for a new car are holding on to their used cars for longer. People who normally like to buy new cars don\u2019t want to sell their current 3 - 5 year old cars right now, since it\u2019s too hard/expensive to buy a new one. They\u2019re just going to ride out the pandemic and wait for production to stabilize and get a new car. The people driving old beater cars don\u2019t have that option once their cars die, they need to get something so that they can continue their jobs, and they have to pay whatever the price is. So this imbalance + shortage is driving prices way up.\n\nI think that\u2019s the problem, more so than software engineers buying a Tesla for normal personal use, a Mercedes SUV for hauling the spouse and kids around town, a Mazda Miata for the midlife crisis, and a Ford F-150 for that imaginary time when they may hypothetically need to haul large objects around (which will never, ever happen.) Those people exist but IMO the cause of the car shortage is just natural attrition + reduced production, rather than hoarding by wealthier people.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting analysis (also I didn't mean people we're hoarding cars :) )- so to paraphrase, what you're saying is\n\n1. Old cars have a short depreciation cycle - ie they'll break faster. I agree.\n2. Transit, Uber etc are expensive, and some cannot do WFH. I agree as well. Sadly the US is a urban sprawl country and car ownership is very high.\n3. Interesting take on people hogging their not so new but not so old cars - essentially people know prices are high for new cars, and so they're waiting it out to buy a new car. This makes sense. I even confirmed with some data analysis (CUUR0000SETA01 New Cars and CUSR0000SETA02 Old Cars). Presuming your theory is correct, that means we need to find the correlation of used car prices to new car prices when new car prices are time lagged (ie if a new car was +50% in Jan, it should filter through making used car prices go up X months later. The R2 without any lag is 0.416, so in general if new car prices go up, old car prices go up 41.6% of the time. If you add time lags of 12 months, the R2 only went up to 46.6% so maybe your hypothesis is right? Though I would have expected a higher R2 number.\n4.

{"title": "Call the $UBER! Destination: Gainsville", "selftext": ">Drive with Uber and you can afford first class like me! \u2013 Rose DeWitt Bukater, Titanic Survivor\n\n\\*12/21/21 Update at bottom\n\n\\*12/23/21 Update at bottom (see Chart 2)\n\n# KEY POINTS\n\n* Similar setup to Dec \u201819-Jan \u201820 rebound (1mo return \\~+45%)\n* Analyst EBITDA estimates too low; avg PT of $70! (+85%)\n* Explosive \u201922 EBITDA growth on increased op leverage\n* Consistent 2022 Top Pick on Street; screens great for fund managers\n* CEO bought 200k shares, major vote of confidence\n* Wandered desert for '21, Entering promised land '22\n* Calls priced for good upside!\n\n# Company Description\n\nUber is best known for its B2C ridesharing platform, but the variety of logistic-based businesses under its umbrella drive the company's full value. This includes B2B businesses like Uber Freight, which in \u201821 acquired Transplace- a global leader in logistics and supply chain management software- during the early innings of a historic transformation in both industries. Additionally, in markets where Uber could not compete immediately (i.e. China) they invested in leading regional startups (i.e. Didi), allowing them to still profit from the global transportation & logistics transformation while gaining optionality through simple strategic sales. Uber has also developed subscription and loyalty programs, locking in their customer base while taking market share. Best of all, they\u2019re also ramping a high-margin advertising business, practically printing free money from businesses looking to be promoted on their super app. A consistently smart, strategic approach has made Uber one of the great companies to come out of the 2010s tech boom.\n\n# Thesis\n\nUBER has been getting hammered nearly all of 2021 for various reasons, none of which are due to fundamental shifts in the business. It's a far stronger company than pre-covid, as the pandemic era forced Uber to increase efficiency & financial leverage, making them **more profitable on lower bookings**. **Return to full volume = Profits like Splash Waterfalls** (see: Ludacris). Did I mention the CEO just said they had their **best bookings week ever**? Additionally, they should benefit from travel news over the next month as it continues to see strong recovery momentum despite Omicron.\n\nTwo important calendar events happen annually: Entering the new year and the second half. Funds are always for stocks to drive outperformance in that next period, and in the case of Dec, this leads to supply overhangs from tax-loss harvesting (TLH) suddenly being met with swift buying once the \u201ccoast is clear\u201d. Like the overhang in \u201819, Uber could rebound out of this period toward the mid-to-high 40s where the CEO purchased 200k shares last month. Market mechanics converging with positive fundamental news should support a near-term multiple rerating.\n\nRecap: This play is taking advantage of a rebound as the coast clears from overwhelming Dec supply (TLH & omicron fears), buying demand re-enters (week of 12/17) helping it break its downward channel, and a sentiment & technical reversal is signaled, leading to further upside momentum.\n\n# Current Valuation & Financials\n\n* Revenue Growth: +49% \u201922, +31% \u201823\n   * Fwd P/S '22: 2.9x ... valuation and growth speak for themselves. Name one other company growing at \\~40% 2yr CAGR trading at only 2.9x Fwd P/S.\n* EBITDA Growth: +243% \u201822, +188% \u201823\n   * Explosive growth a direct result of prior investments across their platforms\n   * Does not yet account for CEO\u2019s comments on 12/14 reaffirming 4Q21 EBITDA toward the higher end of the guide (orig: $25m-$75m), which likely flows through to slight estimate raises across the next calendar year as well.\n   * Uber continues to approach full profitability, currently estimated for Q2 \u201923. I suspect Uber may pull this expectation forward at their Feb ER.\n* Free Cash Flow Growth: \u201922 +190%, \u201923 +268%\n   * UBER\u2019s efficiency initiatives have it on the brink of becoming a colossal FCF generation machine, with \u201922 expected to be the year they flip FCF positive for the first time in history. Guess what factor should do well in the next phase of this market? My money is increasing FCF will be top of that list.\n* Equity Investments\n   * The primary culprit of their Q3 miss, equity investment revaluation (i.e. Didi stake of 144mil shares) drove the bulk of their -$2.4B net income loss, not losses from actual business operations.\n   * CEO looking to strategically raise cash from these investments as they rebound in the future; with Didi relisting on Chinese markets, it will eventually flow through as a colossal earnings tailwind in the future.\n* Analyst Price Target: $69.50, +86% Upside\n   * The buffer makes it a fantastic candidate to rebound and still have plenty of upside following their February ER.\n   * **UBER named a Top 2022 Pick by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS so far.** What do all these have in common? They comprise the bulk of investable assets and represent a significant portion of sell-side flow. Good PMs drive outperformance by buying early in a price turnaround and that\u2019s roughly where we are.\n\n# Technicals\n\nTechnicals are horrific due to the relentless nature of the TLH in Q4 as managers offset insanely strong gains elsewhere. However, 2020\u2019s resistance level of $37 has become the new support during the December selling and it is very clearly basing; once the TLH subsides this week, we should have a quick zip upward, officially breaking the upper channel of the downtrend, in turn triggering positive momentum signals which leads to fast money re-entering the stock. See Chart 1 in Appendix\n\n# How to Play\n\nNote: All positions assume a rebound to mid-to-high $40s by expiration. Prices as of posting (12/15). Prior resistance highs were $64.\n\n*Gen X/Boomers*: Buy stock! No brainer.\n\n*Risk-Averse*: April \u201922 C42.5 currently presents 1-3x upside, expands to 5.5x on sustained momentum to $55 following Feb ER.\n\n*Quasi-Risk Averse*: March \u201922 C42.5 currently presents 3.9x upside, expands to 5.5x on sustained momentum to $55 following Feb ER.\n\n*Pump It Up! Junior*: Feb '22 C45 currently presents 4.7x upside on a post-ER rebound to $50, expands to 9.5x on a rebound to $55, 85% of prior highs.\n\n*Pump It Up!*: Jan \u201922 C40 currently presents 5.5-9x upside on a rebound toward mid-to-high $40s\n\n*WSB Delight*: Jan \u201922 C42 currently presents 6.5-11x upside on a rebound toward mid-to-high $40s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy positions (12/15): I\u2019m accumulating all of the above, finishing my purchasing over the days ahead as we take advantage of volatility from options expiration and the market holding its breath through the Fed announcement. Instead of posting this write-up on Dec expiration (12/17) as planned, I decided to crank it out earlier due to the attention boost UBER got 12/14 so people could start legging in positions. Keep in mind the current positioning of the options market should create a gravitational pull toward $40 into 12/17 expiration at the same time TLH starts to subside.\n\n# Appendix\n\nRegarding regulation, which I originally cut for length due to it not being relevant to this trade:\n\n>I'm glad you mentioned that as I cut it out for length. As RBC stated in a recent report:  \n>  \n>*We view outcomes similar to Prop 22 in CA as more likely, where driver protections are put in place with an emphasis on those pursuing full-time driving which affects the minority of drivers.*  \n>  \n>As BTIG stated in a recent report titled \"UK Ruling More of a Win Than Headlines Suggest\"*:*  \n>  \n>*UBER reclassified UK drivers as workers in 3/2021 and competitors didn't match, which meant that* ***UBER's costs \\[already\\] went up*** *...The net result should be... a level playing field... and finally a scenario in which UBER could raise prices to offset the higher costs... since the reclassification.*\n\n[Original Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgzg3g/comment/hon7prk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nChart 1:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[UBER found solid support at 2020 resistance levels, leading me to believe this is the bottom. A reversal toward the upper end of the channel should lead to a breakout from the downtrend in price and sentiment.](https://preview.redd.it/7wdisi8kac781.png?width=2421&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb0d0c8f02bfb41b51d732850e15283a4bbdcaa6)\n\nChart 2: (12/23/21)\n\n[12\\/23\\/21 Continued strength has UBER poised to break out of the downtrend channel](https://preview.redd.it/lokpartm7c781.png?width=3834&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c18ef5157c75d24aea150ca6f912884f663387)\n\n**12/21/21 Update:** UBER showed great strength against 12/20's market-wide selling pressure, a signal that the supply overhang is behind us. With UBER near $42, the $42 strike now becomes the higher gamma play with the 45s being the higher upside play. Given that TLH is generally over and with the Santa Claus rally in play, UBER definitely looks ready to break out of its downtrend channel with a higher probability bursting toward high $40s to $50 by Jan expiration (where it currently has 150k OI on C50, which will either be a wall or an accelerant depending on how quickly it gets there).\n\nGiven recent strength, I made the following rotations:\n\n* 100% of Jan 40s into UBER Jan 45s and another Jan effect play\n* 50% of my UBER Jan 42s into Jan 45s\n* 100% of March 42.5s into March 47.5s\n* Still holding April 42.5s (best reward/risk on run to $55)\n\nAs mentioned in the thread & comments, I had owned every suggested position as they offered the highest return/risk based on my proprietary excel model, and all remaining UBER positions still offer great upside into the month ahead as UBER approaches its breakout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12/23/21 Update:** After UBER's strength was called out on CNBC's Fast Money today, this will bring additional attention and flows to the stock. The broad market (S&P) remains supportive as it lifts higher, and itself likely makes a sustained break above Q4 resistance (~4700) into Jan. Both of these factors are supportive of a full breakout for UBER. Still targeting high 40s/50 by Jan expiration (4wks away), especially as the required average daily move to reach $50 has dropped to +0.60%.\n\nCurrent option positioning supports a gravitational pull toward $50 on continued momentum (currently 150K Jan C50 OI); depending on how quickly that strike is approached, that OI would also create a small MM hedging lift on a break above $50.\n\nI've completely exited the Jan 40s and 42s and rolled to Jan 45s which offered over 3x returns on a run to $50.", "id": "rgzg3g", "created_utc": 1639575926.0, "score": 260, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "Didi fucked this stonk hard, def a buying opportunity but  I\u2019d rather buy shares like a boomer", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, great returns to be made no matter how you play it.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Hey what call options are looking at?
