I bought 200 shares of SNDL 11 FEB 2021, sold two covered calls at about 1.30 each, and bought them back for 0.70 each. I then tried to sell two covered calls against my stock for 1.00 each.\n\n\"Insufficient Option Buying Power\" was the result.\n\nHow could I need money in order to write and sell a call option you ask? Well as it turns out you can have positive unsettled funds and negative unsettled margin, and if you have a negative unsettled margin, you cannot open a new short position, including buying or selling until this negative unsettled margin balance has been dealt with unless you can wire in 3x the amount of the positon you wish to open.\n\nI finally got in touch with someone over at IBKR, I have an account with Webull and IBKR. Webull did not answer for two days, nor respond. ANYWAY, IBKR had some very interesting things to say about this issue.\n\nI might not be perfect here but here goes a shot.\n\n\"It is important to understand the different types of funds.\" -Yuri\n\nDaytime BP = Settled funds + Unsettled funds + Available Margin\n\nOvernight BP = (Settled funds + Unsettled funds - MINUS MAINT REQ)\n\nCash BP = Settled funds + Unsettled funds\n\nCash Available = Settled CASH\n\n\\-----\n\nUnsettled Funds :\n\n1. Unsettled Cash\n2. Unsettled Margin\n\n\\-------\n\nSettled Funds :\n\n1. Settled Cash\n2. Settled Margin\n\n\\------\n\nIt is imperative to understand the difference between Unsettled CASH and Unsettled MARGIN. Having NEGATIVE Unsettled CASH means you will be issued a margin call to meet the MAINT REQ for your broker, EVEN IF you have a cash account you are subject to the MARGIN rules and procedures.\n\nWHEN BUYING OR WRITING OPTIONS :\n\nYou are using margin. When you receive a credit, it is (+) positive unsettled margin. However, if you buy to close and complete the transaction with (-) negative unsettled margin funds, even if you have (+) positive unsettled cash, that exceeds your unsettled margin, to show positive unsettled funds and positive account balance, you could still have NEGATIVE UNSETTLED MARGIN.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWell, you effectively have received a MARGIN GFV (good faith violation) while it is not on record, you will be unable to open new margin positions, until this violation is lifted either by wiring funds prior to (NOT ACH but WIRE only) 14:00 hours EST, or waiting until the margin funds settle.\n\nOther options??\n\nHave 3x (Yes three times) the amount of the option credit in settled cash.\n\nAvoid NEGATIVE UNSETTLED MARGIN (basically never have negative unsettled funds) by purchasing to close positions with available BP only.\n\nDO NOT USE MARGIN TO CLOSE SHORT POSITIONS IN A CASH ACCOUNT. I learned the hard way guys, but now I know that I must be very careful with my fund management. I had a positive unsettled balance on my Webull account but a negative unsettled margin, and that kept me from being able to open new short positions, while I could still sell my stock, I could not sell a covered call option to hedge my investment and lost 30% in 24 hours. Because I had a balance of -$20.91 unsettled margin and +369 unsettled cash. showing me a positive unsettled fund.\n\nWHY did this happen?\n\nThe day I was trading, Webull was having issues with clearing times, so my previous transaction took about an hour to settle into my account, and in that time I purchased to close a position with funds that I thought were available in my unsettled funds. BUT THEY WERE NOT. Therefore I used Unsettled MARGIN to close and that put me negative until those funds settled with the broker, a T+1 time on options.\n\nPlease show some karma if you learned something from this, thanks guys.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I have  releeased your main r/options thread identical post.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2034030705690384}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46749964356422424}, {"body": "Do you apply technicals analysis to options charts or do you place more emphasis on the underlying chart?

I receive an immediate credit when I Sell to Open but then I'm holding a contract that's in the red. If I close it out when it's $3.83 in the green does that mean my total profit is the $50 credit I received plus the $3.83 that I would buy to close the contract for?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> If I close it out when it's $3.83 in the green does that mean my total profit is the $50 credit I received plus the $3.83 that I would buy to close the contract for?\n\nThe $50 credit **is not your profit or a loss**. Think of it as a retainer for services to be rendered in the future. When you trade a CSP, you sell high in order to *buy back low later*. So until you do the buy back part, you don't know what your gain/loss will be.\n\nFirst, when talking about options trades, its best to stick with a single contract option chain quote, rather than your position value. Because if you had 2 CSP for a $50 position value, that means each contract only has a $25 value. I'd have to know the quantity to understand what the number means. Instead, use the quote in the option chain. You sold the CSP for $0.50 premium originally, right? Don't use the x100 dollar value, so I don't need to know the quantity.\n\nWhat the $3.83 green position gain is telling you is that if you were to buy back the put at that moment (buy to close), you might have to pay $0.4617 (because .50 - .0383 = .4617). The net difference is .0383, your gain. Since you would buy to close for a lower price than you got when you sold to open, you show a green gain.\n\nA retainer works in a similar fashion. Say you are a lawyer (the seller of the CSP) that requires $50k retainer to start working on some legal paperwork for a client (the buyer of the put). You bill hours and expenses and after a few days, you have charged $3830 against the retainer.

To that end the suitable option solution I would think is to buy a liquid ETF like SPY with cash. Then go short a synthetic future by buying ATM or slight OTM Put and selling OTM Call. This gives you complete protection against bubble burst while keeping the cost of insurance (Put premium) low. It gives you some room on the upside too.

Regards,", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the help! I've been reading and watching so many videos, but unfortunately I'm the type of person who needs to discuss to fully grasp the concept.\n\nTo clarify my unclear question: do I need enough money to cover the cost of the shares in the contract when I sell or exercise? If the strike price is $59 and I have one contract = $5900 would be the buy value?\n\nLast question: what's the differences between selling, exercising, and rolling over a contract?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Last question first:\n\n**Selling**: In US parlance there are two terms \"Selling to close\" and \"Selling to open\". Selling to close means you are selling to close a position, essentially you are selling what you had previously bought. You end up booking your profit or loss depending on the price you bought. Selling to open is basically selling to open a new position in your a/c. It is same as \"shorting\" or Option \"writing\" which is basically selling an option that you had not purchased before. \n\n**Exercising**: As you are aware option buyer has a right to buy or sell the underlying at the SP while option seller has the obligation to do the opposite. That is why option seller gets a premium from the buyer. Now the option buyer can \"exercise\" this right by demanding the delivery of stock by paying the SP or demanding cash by selling their stock at the SP. Clearly only option buyer has the right to exercise and it is totally discretionary. They may choose to exercise or they may keep holding their options. Option seller has to comply whenever the exchange (randomly) assigns the exercise request from the buyer to a seller. When the option is OTM it is not profitable to buyers to exercise as the market price is better than their right to buy/sell. Now, American options allow exercising options at any time before expiry whereas European options are exercised only at expiry. I am guessing all options in US markets are American options and hence can be exercised at any opportune time during the life of the option. Exercising closes the position for the buyer and seller. Neither has any right or obligation when the option is exercised. \n\n**Rolling over**: Basically if you want to continue your position even after the current expiry is over then you cover / square off / buy-sell your existing position in a contract that is soon to expire and take the exact position like it in the next or farther expiry at the same or relevant SP. This is more important for option buyers because towards the end of the expiry the time value goes down fast and option buyers want to avoid that while keeping their bets on. \n\nSo, you do not need any money to sell (meaning \"sell to close\" = selling something you had prev bought) your option. Imagine this like selling the stock / ring / watch you had already bought. You do not need any more money for doing that. \n\nIf you want to exercise your call option then you need to bring in (SPx100)$ to purchase the stock. If you want to exercise your put option you should be able to deliver 100 shares per option of that underlying and receive (SPx100)$ \n\nHope this helps.

Do I need to exercise my $8 put? Or does it get taken care of by the broker?\n\nFirst of all, don't write put credit spreads so close to the money. You want something around 30 delta and it is unlikely that $1 out of the money is 30 delta.\n\nSecond, you cannot sell a long put and buy a short put. All of the terms -- short, long, buy, sell -- are completely mixed up. So here's an explainer:\n\nBuy to open = long, which you sell to close\n\nSell to open = short, which you buy to close\n\nSo either use \"open long\" or \"buy to open\" for the long leg, and \"open short\" or \"sell to open\" for the short leg.\n\nI'm going to translate your example to open short $9 and open long $8. Or more concisely, open a 9/8 PCS.\n\n> A week from now, the price is $7 and I get assigned.\n\nDon't open put credit spreads that are only a week from expiration. You would only get assigned on expiration day.\n\n> Do I need to exercise my $8 put? Or does it get taken care of by the broker?\n\nNothing gets \"taken care of\" by your broker. Your broker *may* take care of themselves by exiting your trade (closing it) without your input when it gets near being at risk of assignment. Because an assigned put in an account that can't afford the cost is a liability for the broker.\n\nDo not rely on brokers to do anything for your benefit. If you get assigned on the short leg, it is up to you to do something about it. You can probably cover the cost by selling to close the long leg and using the profit to offset the cost of the assignment. You might have to add additional cash. You can also consider exercising the long, but that is more complicated and the timing is tricky -- you should only do it if you are sure you will be assigned, and since you don't get the notification that you were assigned until after the market closes, it would be too late to exercise the long put -- so closing the long is usually best.\n\nIt's true that if the long is ITM on expiration, your broker will automatically exercise it, as long as your account can cover the expense of exercise.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks so much for the explanation and corrections!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I forgot the most important point: Don't hold your position to expiration and you won't have to worry about *any* of that assignment stuff.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2585568130016327}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2038380354642868}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7158058285713196}, {"body": "This is why TD Ameritrade requires you to have a margin account to trade spreads.

The demand and supply depends on (1) price of underlying (2) Time to expiry (3) volatility or movement in the stock (4) Interest rates (mostly constant and hence not part of our consideration)\n\nFirst 3 factors are continuously changing. The price of option does not change proportionately with any of these factors. However the general guidelines are easy to follow. When will the demand increase?\n\n1. A call option becomes profitable / attractive when the price of underlying increases fueling the demand. A put option becomes profitable/ attractive when the price of the underlying goes down. The price of a put option thus increases when the price of the underlying goes down.\n2. As the time to expiry becomes less and less the expectation of a massive move in the remaining time keeps going down and so does the demand and price of that option.\n3. If for one reason or another the underlying is moving very fast and making large strides (case of GME) the expectations of further massive moves increases. This increase in volatility forces option sellers to demand large premiums to cover their risk and option buyers anticipating a huge move are willing to pay it. Price of both calls and puts increase when volatility increases irrespective of the direction of movement.\n\nApplying this to your case, since you have bought a put the price of the option increases when the price of the stock decreases.\n\nHowever, in case of GME the volatility was SO HIGH (to the moon, if I may say so) that the main component of the option price paid by you and many others around that time was due to the volatility. Now as the volatility is subsiding by the hour that portion of the price is coming down. So we are witnessing that the price of the stock is coming down but so is the price of the put.

It is an educated guess at this point of  time. And you may be absolutely spot on. The stock price must move  significantly to overcome the two drags on the option price mentioned  above - theta and IV crush. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.\n\nConsidering all these factors plus that you are already in profit may be you can consider rolling out or rolling over or rolling out and over. Protect your profits, keep your bets open and give them some more time to fructify while reducing your exposure and theta decay.\n\nHowever counter-intuitive it may seem from a bullish view you have I would also check if some calendar spread is possible. Sell an OTM call for current cycle (with high IV and low time to expiry) and buy next cycle call (perhaps ATM) call. That would book your current profits  and reduce the cost of your next cycle call.  Or if you are reluctant to book profits then it will protect them while limiting the upside.

I\u2019ve been a lurker of this community for some time now and find it to be a good balance to my lurking of WSB. I\u2019m hoping someone \u201cmore intelligent\u201d than me (shouldn\u2019t be difficult to find that person here!) can help me better understand how I should best approach the following fact pattern.\n\nI have been a long-term holder of $NET (Cloudflare) since the IPO. I own several thousand shares that I do not ever plan on selling. Well, I guess if it becomes a $250b company in a decade I\u2019d consider selling to retire but that\u2019s a conversation for another day. I\u2019m more than happy to ride the ups and downs as I believe in the company and its ever more important role in the future. That\u2019s on me and my decision.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m struggling and where I\u2019d love some help from this community. On the price dip to about $71 in early January I picked up 100 of the Feb 19 2021 call options (so, 10,000 shares \u2013 I know you know that, just making sure I lay things out clearly) at a trade price of $3.10. Those options are now worth approximately $9.50 (a little higher as I type this but same difference). So, I\u2019m sitting on about $66,000 in profits and a liquidation value of $97,000.\n\nI\u2019m very lucky in that even if the options went to zero it wouldn\u2019t ruin my life. It would stink to lose $100k in an earnings report don\u2019t get me wrong, but I\u2019d still be able to wake up the next day and be OK financially.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get some help with is what\u2019s the best approach with these options. I\u2019m considering the following:\n\n* \\- Just let things ride. Since I am OK w/letting these options go to zero (not happy about it but it wouldn\u2019t kill me) this gives me the most upside so just take the risk\n* \\- The above though seems like a somewhat silly play b/c I do have the capital to roll these out to the May expiration (would cost me $80k to roll and keep the same number of calls) or August expiration (would cost me $130k) which would buy me one or two more earning reports. My lean would be to the May expiration, just b/c the dollars don\u2019t look as intense, but I\u2019m open to suggestions\n* \\- Lighten up somewhat. Sell some / most of the calls, increase my 6,000 shares more towards 10,000 shares, plan on holding those \u201cforever\u201d, and lock in some of my profits on the calls. This would of course decrease my upside this earnings but also would avoid the risk of the $97k liquidation value of the options going to zero.\n* \\- Something else I\u2019m not well versed / intelligent enough to be thinking about (the what I don\u2019t know I don\u2019t know issue)\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m just not as sophisticated as I\u2019d like to be in this space and would appreciate any guidance the community is able to provide.

Calculate your total capital outlay for equivalent shares. Three BB calls controls 300 shares, so take the share price of $12 or whatever and multiple by 300 = $3600.\n\n1. Calculate your total capital outlay to open the option trade. If the BB calls cost, I dunno, $2 each, you would spend 2 x 3 x 100 = $600.\n\n1. Divide the share outlay by the option outlay. That is your leverage. 3600 / 600 = 6, so 6x leverage.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!

If you short a put worth $2, you get $200 in credit. This is the reverse of option leverage. You got *less* money for the option, more for the shares.

I have heard that a margin account is necessary for options trading. Is there a reason I would prefer to have a margin account if I wish to limit my total loss and only risk funds I have, instead of borrowing?\n\nA margin account is necessary for credit trading or trades that require short positions, like a vertical spread. You do not need a margin account for long-only trades.\n\nYou need not take a *margin loan* for your option trades, so no borrowing is necessary. You do need cash or shares for collateral against short positions, though.\n\nI have a margin account and have never taken a margin loan or had a margin call. It's completely do-able with cash. You just need enough cash. And yes, a margin account is preferable, particularly if you want to trade short unsecured puts and save some collateral vs. CSPs.\n\n> 2. Say event X is on the horizon, which will likely affect the target's stock price. If I opt for a long straddle:\n>\n> (a) Is my total cost then the total of the put cost + call cost + fees? So likely a high number? ie for Tesla circa USD10,000 at an $805 strike price?\n\nYes. Yes. If $805 puts and calls are around $50 a piece, yes (I'm too lazy to go look at the option chain to confirm).\n\n\n> (b) When I hear about options people mention day trading and the rule of not leaving positions open at night. How does this work if you wish to opt for a long position ie until X event lapses and a few days after?\n\nWell first, if you are not day trading, ignore any advice having to do with day trading. I hold option positions over night and even, gasp, over weekends, with no problems. Different rules for different trading approaches. They are not mix and match.\n\nAnd a \"long position\" doesn't refer to time. It refers to whether you bought to open the trade (long), or sold to open the trade (short). If you want to refer to time, use \"far expiration\" and \"near expiration\".\n\n> (c) With break-evens at $701 to $908, how do I close the position if it's dangerously close the strike price? Do I sell both option contracts and hope they have some value? Why would anyone purchase them, if so?\n\nThe break-even number **only applies at expiration**. As you will never be holding position through expiration, it is irrelevant for making closing decisions. Instead, *before opening a trade*, decide on a target rate of return on your initial debit (or credit), a loss limit, and a maximum holding time. For example, I exit a long position when I have gained 10% or more on my initial debit.\n\nOption trading with debit trades is all about buy low, sell high, before expiration. If you buy for $10 and days or weeks later you can sell for $12, you made a 20%  profit.\n\nPlease see the **Closing out a trade** section in the links at the top of the page for more about exit strategy.

However if it happens towards the expiry then there will not be much of a gain. You may have already seen the option chain at that expiry date, if not, please do check. Quite possibly the higher strike puts are not way costlier than the $200 SP you have chosen. So instead of choosing the Strike of your target price may be you can choose a higher strike which is still substantially lower than the CMP (say, SP of 500$) This will have more chance of making money as well as it will make more money than the SP of $200. The 200P can at max be worth $200 as the stock price can not go below 0$\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Assuming this order is filled and the price drops below $200 on or  before December does that mean I have the right to purchase 100 shares  for $10? \n\n No. When you purchase a PUT you buy a right to **sell** the stock for $200 And $10 is the premium you pay for having that right. This makes sense if you believe the stock goes below 200$ Since you do not have any stock right now at $1000 this is a speculative bet for you and not an insurance as I have described. Look at it in any which way the purchasing of Put gives you the right to sell the stock at the SP. You can also sell your option for a profit since you do not have the shares to sell.

Some of his trades will fail. That's why he also says that frequency of trading is critical. If one trade fails and that's the only trade you make that month, that's a disaster, your win rate is 0%. But if you make 100 trades that month and only 1 failed, that's a spectacular 99% win rate. On average, win rates tend to be closer to 70%-80% over the long run, depending on the strategy, so several failures are expected.

People are trading options without even the most basic understanding of how options work. That's usually the final signal, shoeshine boy euphoria, that leads to a big correction.\n\nBad habits, particularly in the form of results-oriented thinking (e.g., You do something that every textbook says is a mistake, but you made 1000% profit on it, so you decide the textbooks are wrong. Nobody ever accounts for luck), are rampant right now. Nobody so far has argued with me that their results speak louder than experience and common sense, but I expect that to happen any day now.\n\nAll that said, your criteria isn't terrible. The risk management part is the most important part. You realize how much you have at stake and if it all blows up at once, you know that you put yourself in that position. Awareness is nine tenths of the battle.\n\nA simple adjustment you can make is lower your profit exit level. Make it 20% and I think you'll feel less anxious about the risk, because you will be out of positions much more quickly.

Limit orders to close are for making profits. That's how you tell the difference.\n\nYour broker's order system should understand that you are short the position, therefore a stop is for rising price and a limit to buy to close is for falling price (limit or better, and lower is better). But if you are unsure this will work, just close the position manually, forget about triggers.

We short futures in case we want to go short. Of course, we have options. But stock shorting is not easy as there is no proper infrastructure/ platforms developed/ functional for stocks lending and borrowing. But you seem to be right. I was thinking about the same with regard to MTM (mark to market) on futures. Option profits are not collected / deducted every day on market close but futures P/L is adjusted daily. So on some day if your futures are in heavy loss you can get a margin call even though you are having even more profitable options. Ignore if you are not familiar with futures.\n\nSome expert in US markets should be able to give you the right information. Also, **perhaps** scalping is a short term trading (intra-day only) product. I am not sure. I can not try this in India. Our markets are rigged heavily and intra-day stock trades are taxed heavily (considered equivalent to gambling, lottery, horse racing) however options and futures are not treated as such and do not attract sin tax. Yes, It's crazy. Point is I can not short/ long stock and sq off intra-day. And if I use futures I can not go part shares. It will have to be lot size only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When you say \u201cfirst scalping point\u201d are you referring to the first time  you try to short? You will end up making money right? because you  already are long a call?\n\nYes. If the premium you paid on the call was very high then you will have to wait farther to short your stock the first time otherwise you will exhaust your short limit with average short price below SP+premium / breakeven price effectively locking in negative return. If you keep it far off then it may not ever get triggered and stock keep bubbling between SP and below this 1st shorting point with premium losing time value. The stock may even end up between the C and P strikes we bought without hitting our shorting point and there won't be any scaling gains but both premiums will be lost. That is why the first point and intervals between shorting points are important imo.  If we increase the number of points, start from a low value and small number of stocks, it may increase our transaction costs.\n\nActually that  points to another problem. Stocks have a delta of 1 and the option will have a delta of 0.5 or little more. If the stock moves up after you exhaust your call limit (100 shares per call) then you may end up losing more as the option price won't be able to keep up with the stock price increase. And at the end of the day if you are forced to settle or marked to market on your stock position you will get in trouble.  On expiry every thing may work out but what if you get a margin call before that. Please check with some local expert if you are marked to market every day on a short stock position.\n\nOverall seems useful for short duration continuous HFT kind of trading and for brokers and market makers with no brokerage worries. I am not sure how it will suit us retail. Definitely won't work with futures and mtm set up. Don't take my word for it. I have no idea how stock shorting works.\n\nBut Delta is a real worry. Option prices won't keep up with stock prices and be able to cover losses.\n\nAlso all theory aside do some paper trading if possible and you will know all the minute details.\n\nSorry for a long reply.

They will help you learn more about trading options, particularly with respect to trade planning, risk management and exit strategy.\n\n> If I bought a call option lets say for 3/12, with a strike price of $60, premium is $5 (0.50 x 100).\n\n0.50 x 100 = $50.\n\nIt's best to forget about the x100 part, that's implied. Stick with just the premium prices. Think of all the quote numbers as \"per share\", then everything is consistent between shares and option contracts.\n\n> The price goes up to $80 and I decide to exercise the option. My first question relates to this, isn't it smarter money wise to exercise and buy the 1 contract and then immediately sell it at the stock price (obviously, you need enough money in your account to do that) rather than selling the call (due to potential infinite loss)?\n\nThat's a big **NO**. Several things are confused in that statement.\n\nFirst of all, what is the value of the call when the stock went up to $80? That is a critical part of this decision. Let's say it went up to $20.70 (from $0.50). Your profit on the call alone is $20.20/share. If you exercise, you pay $60/share for shares worth $80, so $20/share net profit, MINUS the premium you paid of $0.50, so $19.50/share. \n\nClearly, just closing the call would have been more profitable in that scenario.\n\nSecond, you do not get control of the shares immediately in an exercise. It takes at least one trading day and sometimes two. So if you exercise on a Thursday, you probably get the shares Friday morning, but could get them as late as Monday. That's a lot of time for the shares to fall and wipe out your profit.\n\nYou can work around that delay problem by shorting shares at the same time as you exercise, locking in the net profit on the shares. If you are a day or two from expiration, that might be worth it. But the further you get from the expiration, the more profit the call by itself will have and probably be better to just close the call.\n\nFinally, you are confusing **sell to open** with sell to close.

(I apologize in advance if this is really long)  \n\n\nI had a call debit spread for Sundial that I purchased earlier this week in which I paid $2.00 ($20.00). The expiration was for today. The long leg was $1.50 and the short leg was $2.00. For some reason Robinhood closed out my option contract around 3:00 this afternoon when the stock was trading a little over $2.00. My questions that I have related to this are:  \n**Why did the close my contract out for me?**   \n\n\n**I would have made max profit had the stock stayed above $2.00 (even if it were up by 1 cent -$2.01) had Robinhood not closed it when the market closed correct?**  \n\n\nMy last question is in regards to Call Credit Spreads. I was looking into getting in another call credit spread before market closed for the same stock - Sundial. When I do call credit spreads I normally purchase the the two legs higher than the stock price. Today I created a call credit spread in which both legs were both below the price of the stock ($2.06). The short leg was at  $0.50 and the long leg was at $1.00 which would have credited me $0.50. I'm confused by this because I know usually the stock price has to be below the short leg in a call credit spread but seeing as these two legs were below the stock price it confused me. If I wanted to have max profit come expiration would the stock price need to stay above the $0.50 call which makes no sense because I thought call credit spreads are bullish.

There are conservative strategies all the way up to the \"YOLO\" extremely speculative strategies. These \"YOLO\" strategies are how people make the gains you may see on wall street bets, but for every successful person, many many many more have lost money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe core advantage to buying an option is leverage. You essentially get to \"control\" 100 shares of a stock for way less than the price of actually buying 100 shares. Let me demonstrate with the most straight forward example: buying a call option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenario:\n\nStock A is $10 a share. We buy a call option for $2.00 with a strike price of $11. The total cost of the option is $200 ($2.00 x 100 shares). In order to break even here, the price of stock A needs to rise to $13 dollars ($11 strike price + $2.00 a share premium we paid).\n\nScenario 1: Stock A tanks to $5 a share. Our contract is worthless & we essentially lost $200. Compare this to if you had instead bought 100 shares at $10. You'd be down $500. Sure you have the stock & maybe it rebounds, but you're now in the hole & responsible for it. This is one benefit to the call option: you know up front your maximum risk. You can never lose more than $200 even if you woke up the next day & stock A was worth $0.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenario 2: Stock A soars to $15 a share. With the option, we make $200 dollars. Remember our break even was $13 a share. At $15 we are up $2.00 a share x 100 shares = $200 dollars. So for an investment of $200 we made $200 (100% profit). If we instead owned the shares, we would have invested $1,000. It would now be worth $1,500 which is 50% profit. Sure $500 is more than $200 but compared to initial investment we made more with the option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing to note: Options traders rarely exercise the contract & actually purchase the shares. They will typically sell the contract for a direct profit once profitable. You don't need to mess with actually purchasing the shares then turning around & reselling them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, image you have $1,000 to invest. Let's say we buy 5 of the above call options ($200 x 5 = $1000). Scenario 2 occurs where stock A is now worth $15. We can sell our 5 options for $200 profit each netting $1,000 in profit. If we had instead invested the $1,000 directly into the stock, we would be getting $500 profit. So you see, here you made more money with the same starting investment by purchasing options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake the GME debacle. Pretend GME is at $7 a share like it was. Let's say you had foresight & bought 20 call options with a strike price of $20 dollars for $175 each (costing a total of $3,500). GME skyrockets & you sell your contracts when GME price is $320 a share. We need to subtract out our strike price so to us, GME is essentially $300 a share. Remember, with 20 options you control 2,000 shares now. These are now worth $600,000. You essentially paid $3,500 & sold for $600,000. You just made dumb money. Image if instead you took the initial $3,500 & bought shares at $7. You would have 500 shares. You sell them at $320 each & get $160,000. Still huge gains, but not compared to the options scenario.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI glossed over a few bits & options are more complex than this, but this hopefully gives a good idea. It's all about leverage. You pay less to control 100 shares than buying them outright & you can potentially realize gains on those \"cheap\" 100 shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA conservative use of options as you eluded to would be selling covered calls. Here, you own 100 of the underlying stock & you sell a call to a buyer. For doing this, you get a premium, say $300. You get to pocket that, it's now just $300 dollars of profit you have. Let's say the option expires worthless. You can turn around & sell another covered call, getting another premium you pocket. This is great if you have a stock you're planning to hold long term anyways. You are being paid to keep holding it. Do note though that the buyer can exercise the contract & call your shares away. You'll be paid for them (at the strike price of the contract you originally sold). This may or may not benefit you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOptions always have risk, there is no way to utilize them for free money. But they provide a wide array of risk. There are very conservative options strategies that have low risk as well as low profit. There are speculative strategies that have high risk & high reward.

So, take Tesla for example, if you were to buy 100 shares of Tesla stock right now, it would cost you $81,500.  Let's say you don't have that money but want the \"option\" to buy Tesla stock in a month or two months at the rate that it's selling for today, so you buy the Option contract to do so.  If Tesla goes up in price, now you can buy it at a later date at the price that it's going for today, you could choose not to buy it at all,  OR you could sell that contract and make much more money than your original investment in the paying for the premium.  The Premium is the \"option\" to buy the 100 shares. In summation, the Option Contract gives you the ability to control 100 shares of Tesla stock without paying for 100 shares up front.  If you don't end up buying the stock, you lose the money you used to pay for the premium, but you can always sell the Option contract and its value is derived from the shares of stock that you have the right to buy at a certain price rather than the increased price. \n\nI'm sure others have a better answer.

If APPL stock is $135 & you buy an \"in the money\" call option with a strike price of $130, the premium is going to have this intrinsic value built into it meaning it will be $500 (to cover the spread) + money for the time value of an option (this is referred to as extrinsic value). So let's just say this contract cost $700 dollars premium. Every option has a \"break even\" price which is the price the stock needs to move to in order to cover your initial investment (in this case $700). In our example, APPL will need to move to $137 a share to break even (this covers the $200 extrinsic value we paid for the option). If it moves to $138, we just made $100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne reason to buy in the money is because it lowers this \"break even\" cost. Let's say we bought an \"out of the money\" call option with a strike of $139. This contract will cost less (no intrinsic value to cover here). Let's say it cost us $200. We actually need APPL to move to $141 a share before we break even. It's more likely that APPL will move to $137 for our \"break even\" of the in the money option than to move to $141 for the break even of the out of the money option. Some view it as \"safer\" to buy already in the money call options as it requires a smaller change in the stock price to become profitable. This comes at the cost of a higher up front investment. However, there is a chance that APPL tanks, let's say to $130 a share. Both of our contract examples expire worthless, however one lost $700 while another only lost $200. It's all about a balance of risk based on what you think the stock price will do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPut options are the opposite of call options. In a put, you reserve the right to SELL 100 shares at the strike price (call options is the right to BUY 100 shares at the strike price). For a put, you want the value of the stock to go under the strike price. If your put strike price is $130 & APPL tanks to $120, you make $1,000 dollars since you can essentially buy stock at the market price $120 & sell them to your contract holder for the agreed $130.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPut options are \"in the money\" when the stock price is below the strike price.

I'll just share what I do.\n\nLiquidity is the first priority. The stock could be the greatest new thing since Elon altcoin, but if the option market lacks liquidity, it's a non-starter for me. I use daily trading volume of the ATM call to determine liquidity. After the first hour of trading, I want to see at least 100 volume. I'll go down to 10 further from the money. I also want to see at least monthly expirations, though having weeklies is better. Finally, I want to see reasonable bid/ask spreads. The spread of the ATM call should not be more than 10% of the bid. Spreads further from the money can go up to 2x that amount.\n\nIf I start with that liquidity requirement as my first screen, that cuts out 90% of option candidates, so now the problem of doing DD is much simpler since there is a lot less to worry about.\n\nAnother requirement I have is I don't trade on any underlying with a share price of less than $10. Too much risk of it turning into a value trap.\n\nAs a risk management technique, no one options trade is more than 5% of total account liquidation value, and I don't concentrate in a single company or sector with more than 20% of that account value.  So that cuts out super expensive options, like AMZN.\n\nThat narrows the universe of underlyings down even more. At this point, I have maybe 50 to 100 candidates. From there, I can start doing individual DD. If it's a company stock, I take a look at the guru focus site (example for HLT: https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/HLT/summary) and make sure there aren't too many red flags. If it's an ETF, I look at the etf.com summary and comparable. If it's an index, well, there aren't that many indexes so I already know which ones I want to trade.\n\nFinally, I have a free subscription to SeekingAlpha.com for areas I'm interested in, whether it's space stocks, or green energy, or fossil energy, gold, Fed policy, etc., you can get stock picks and analyst DD for trends or sectors to watch. These can be fed into the top of the screening process to potentially become a new candidate. This is how I found HASI as a synthetic stock candidate (though I had to stretch the liquidity requirements a bit to do so).\n\nTo be clear, an underlying has to go through all that *just to make it on my watchlist*. It doesn't necessarily mean I've found a good option trading opportunity for it yet. I have about 40 underlyings on my watchlist, but I've traded less than half of them so far.\n\n> Also, secondarily, what are the most important \"studies\" (as they are referred to on Thinkorswim) that I should learn so as to make informed decisions?\n\nEDIT: Meh. I'm not a fan of pre-baked technical analysis \"studies\". Do your own learning, decide which, if any, TA indicators you believe in, and then use those.

Pfizer and Moderna rates were 100% with 2-3x the antibody rates. Oxford 100% with ~1x.\n\nCovaxin is an inactivated virus vaccine, more alike the Johnson & Johnson or moreso the Sinovac (Chinese) vaccines.

Sinovac only had a antibody rate of about 1/3 though.\n\nOverall though my guess would be that Covaxin Phase 3 results (due in March) are similar to Sinovac, maybe a bit better.  In general all of these vaccines are preventing severe cases from occurring, and strongly effective against moderate cases, just you might still get a mild case, so the 66% isn't really a \"bad\" number. Reports are Covaxin is likely to get FDA fast tracking if it's above 50%. This stock is probably a decent gamble but it's not the \"golden vaccine\" I see it being hyped up as.

It's a part of the economy but not the whole. Due to the fact that most stocks are expected to be appreciating assets, t is not an ideal measure of inflation. Inflation would be much more accurately measured, and they are measured, by the value of commodities. By definition inflation means the increase in values of commodities. So if there's actually inflation, commodity prices would've gone up. Example: say at 15%, a company earning 10% of its capital would struggle to stay afloat because the prices of the commodities they need to operate increase at a higher rate than their returns.

The following DD is based on simple assumptions, I haven't looked at the company's financial reports in-depth or used any mathematical models to forecast future cashflows.\n\nShort-term: your hope is for GME to spike. AMC is following the stock movement of GME because both have a lot of common interest due to r/wsb. If GME sees another boost, even if for a day or a couple of hours, it can be your chance to get out. If GME doesn't spike, AMC is very unlikely to do so.\n\nLong-term: let's assume that AMC will be able to operate like it used to before Covid19. Q4 2019, AMC was sitting around 8 dollars. Q3 looked better for the company where the price sat around 10. Q1-Q2 it sat around 14. You go back to 2018 it was higher. You look at 5 years, it is a downtrend. Now let's assume the price was around 12 during 2019 and that AMC could reach those heights again in 2021 after covid is done. Realistic? The answer is no. Why? dilution. AMC had 100 million shares during the start of 2020, now it has 400 million because AMC needed to raise money. It means that the company needs 4 times the amount of revenue that they had in 2019 to achieve the same evaluation and thus the same stock price which would be around 12. That obviously won't happen because regardless of what AMC does to improve performance, it won't be able to increase its' revenue 4x.\n\nAny more factors to consider? AMC still has massive debt and will operate in an industry with ever more focus on streaming.\n\nConclusion: as far as long-term sentiment goes I actually don't think the fundementals are on the company's side. Even if we assume that the company can go back to its' previous performance pre- covid19 it should still be priced way lower because of the dilution of their stocks. If we assume a price target of 12 (2019 performance and the amount of shares), it means that with the amount of shares that exist now (400 compared to 100 in 2019), the company will only be worth 3 dollars. Simplistic look, but something to keep in mind.\n\nI think the best chance of AMC having a spike is for its' price to go up because of GameStop or because of emotional investing after covid19 is over. I can see some people buying the stock without understanding the fundementals because they think ''well, it will surely go back to 15-20 now that the pandemic is over''. As far as fundementals go, I think they are weak. Yes, the company is in a better position compared to a couple of months ago when it risked bankruptcy but it happened at the cost of substantial dilution.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "There is rumors of Netflix or Amazon buying them out eventually.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty sure that was a recycled rumor from last summer.

Fed intervention has purposely pushed people into more and more risky investments, in part because they gave bailout money to banks, who then took that money and used it to front-run the masses and camp out on assets battered by the 2008 crash, and its aftermath, all the while knowing the market would be pumped up so they could make guaranteed returns on their free money.  What that means is that yes, there is money to be made, but it is much harder now.  I would suggest learning some technical trading basics, including the importance of volume to price, trend-lines, and Fibonacci advances/retracements.  \n\nThe market appears to be in a crack-up boom, in my opinion.  It is like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller right now, imo.  The artificial manipulation has really defied all reason, and reality will catch up with it eventually.  The problem is timing it.  Until then, people will continue to make money without understanding how markets actually work.

I have read a lot of books, but I can't think of one in particular to recommend.  It takes a long time to really understand what markets mean, for most people, in my opinion.  The Austrian view of economics is the correct one, but mainstream education and media does its best to malign them and push the irresponsible Keynesian view.  You can go to [mises.org](https://mises.org) for more info on the Austrians.\n\nI read as many websites as I can (I already studied economics in college), and I examine their arguments and data, looking to amend my worldview constantly.  Currently, I read things like: [https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/](https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/), [https://www.economicpolicyjournal.com](https://www.economicpolicyjournal.com), [https://www.jsmineset.com](https://www.jsmineset.com), [https://oilprice.com](https://oilprice.com), [https://www.kitco.com](https://www.kitco.com).  [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com) is a good place to learn basic stuff.  Generally, the more mainstream it is, the more fake it is.  The best places to get information are from smaller sources.  The masses simply aren't smart enough to digest any sophisticated views.  You can also subscribe to someone's newsletter, but the only one I would recommend at the moment would be Robert Wenzels' letter over on [EPJ](https://www.economicpolicyjournal.com).\n\nThe one thing you have to remember is to consider the source.  If someone is an insider, their opinion will push the narrative that TPTB (the powers that be) need in order to herd you into shitty investments so they can fleece you.  Economics has become political as well, since the Marxists took control of the universities and media.  There is very little real, unbiased information out there, and what little there is, is repressed by Google and all the other techno-giants, many of which were funded by intelligence agencies for the express purpose of controlling the flow of dialogue and information on the internet.\n\nI am by no means a guru, so do your own due diligence, but you need to understand the larger macroeconomic conditions that drive the smaller picture which most of us never get past.  Human psychology is a yuge part of it also.  The stock market is like a casino, and people do stupid stuff in herds.  Maybe read up on Charles Mackay and [the Madness of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds).  My main thing is writing, so I study all aspects of humanity, but I worked in real estate finance (successfully) and I definitely understand economics and America.  I wish I could give you a better answer, but it takes a lifetime to understand markets, because markets are an organic expression of human life.  This is why the pressure in the markets (caused by manipulation) will continue to build until the whole thing explodes.

{"title": "Why to REALLY buy GME (Solid DD)", "selftext": "LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons). \n\nSherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. \n\nWhen Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward. \n\nFils-Aim\u00e9 the Nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. He turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. This is shown in particular with his Nintendo of America endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about Reggie so I didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago) \n\nNext up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. \n\nWe recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth. \n\nNext, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. \n\nMost recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.\n\nConservative price target: $200 by mid 2021 with little hype and absent a short squeeze\n\nTldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock. \n\nBut what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions 5200 shares GME, 52x covered calls sold exp 2/12, 50x calls bought exp 2/26, a few bucks in cash waiting for a drop if it happens. Tell if I'm wrong somewhere with sources linked please and thank you.\n\nEdit: As requested, my average cost is roughly $60 after buying back in late last week. I had original shares at an average buy in of about $30 assigned to covered calls on 1/29. I believed the company had too much downside at those prices.\n\nObligatory \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf19", "id": "lf023x", "created_utc": 1612745292.0, "score": 2167, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 255, "comments": [{"body": "With Cohen in, and Microsoft, I genuinely don't see GME tanking without a fight", "score": 532, "replies": [{"body": "And the entire world knows about GME now, free marketing.", "score": 302, "replies": [{"body": "I don\u2019t care if you poached the entirety of apple\u2019s marketing team and threw billions at them, you still wouldn\u2019t get the same level of marketing that GameStops been through this past few weeks.", "score": 168, "replies": [{"body": "Totally plus probably inexhaustible lifelong warm fuzzies amongst its target audience because of this most epic of gaming battles. \ud83c\udfae", "score": 40, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26648783683776855}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I don't know about that the financial press was very silent on the new hires last week, any other time of year we would have had interviews discussing future plans and so on, but the players didn't want to pump it.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10849732905626297}, {"body": "And all of wsb better do their gift, game and pc component shopping at GameStop. \n\nMy nieces and nephews are about to be getting hella gift cards, in turn they\u2019ll go shop at GameStop to help pump financials", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10013813525438309}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3521013557910919}, {"body": "Ive been saying this for the past fucking 2 weeks.

{"title": "Geopolitics and semiconductors : Taiwan is leveraging TSMC/Qualcomm to force US confrontation on independence issue", "selftext": "So you\u2019ve probably heard the news of Taiwan being \u201cthanked\u201d by America for alleviating chip supplies. But there\u2019s some geopolitics behind this. \n\nThere\u2019s talk that Taiwan is essentially putting all cards on the table and push the issue of independence at all costs in a do or die effort. Essentially, Taiwan wants to pressure America into announcing full on Taiwanese independence and committing to it. This would be the culmination of the modern Taiwan issue, and essentially would be the end of the 2 Chinas status quo. \n\nThis is basically a gamble by the Taiwanese hawks (DPP) who are willing to sacrifice their reputation and market share of TSMC in order to force support.\n\nHow? \n\nBy forcing an artificial shortage of chips. This not only leads to shortage of automobile chips for Chinese companies, but also incentivizes America to give full support. Btw, EU feels betrayed on this especially since they supported a Taiwanese petition to block lithiogram machines. \n\nThe reason Taiwan is playing chicken is because they feel there is a limited opportunity to force American commitment before China grows too powerful. Likewise, US hawks also want to force a confrontation since it\u2019s \u201cnow or never\u201d before China reaches peer state status.\n\nTLDR:\n\n- Taiwan is planning an artificial shortage of chips especially for the auto sector to pressure US into independent support.\n\n- Geopoltics is prioritized over business practices, since market share could be lost and business relations strained as EU/China/Us companies feel alienated and untrusting.\n\n- DPP is using TSMC/Qualcomm for geopoltics in a last ditch effort to force Biden admin on the China issue \n\n\nWhat to do:\n\nI honestly don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m hoping other ppl here can say how money can be made off this lol.

The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET**.

{"title": "$PCG (PG&E) - California Utilities DD", "selftext": "**Position**: I purchased $PCG shares at $4.98/share and added to my position last week.  Also purchased $SRE and $EIX. \n\n**Summary**:\n\nCalifornia utilities are undervalued ($SRE, $EIX, $PCG) and still down \\~ 27% from pre-Covid levels.  I believe all are strong buys \u2013 I have positions across the board. $PCG is my most bullish. I believe it is a very cheap entry point for a company that has proven to be bulletproof to regulators/oversight.\n\nPGE Emerged from Bankruptcy with $25.5 B settlement\n\nPGE should be eligible to reinstate dividend in 2022. Cheap entry into a growth stock with an expected reissuance of dividend.\n\nWild fire risks are low in winter, spring and early summer. 2020 was actually a very intense fire season but CA utilities mostly came out unscathed due to public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).  \n\n1) **CA Utilities Undervalued**  \n The real BRRRR are utilities. They print their own money by capital improvement deprecation based on rate cases. Due to the 2018 wildfires and subsequent PSPS, utilities are getting authorized by California and Federal regulators to do more capitalized projects than ever. What does this mean? Revenues are going to be higher than ever. In the case of PCG, they hit the sweet spot in ineffectiveness. Doing so bad not to go bankrupt, but bad enough to get all their projects authorized by the state to maximize revenue.   Again, the California Public Utility Commission authorized the highest general rate case ever. \n\n2) **Bankruptcy Settlement**  \n $PCG\u2019s market cap is $23.54B and has an outstanding bankruptcy $25.5 B settlement as of June 2020. Why is this significant? For one, the optics of having a valuation larger than your settlement liability flip (due to a $5.4 billion and partial $1.35B obligation) with February 25th earnings (unless the stock goes down by 20%) but more importantly, the settlement was incredibly favorable to $PCG.  \n\n$PCG will likely post their highest annual revenue ever. EVER\u2014see item #1. This wouldn\u2019t work in the real world (maybe banking in 2008), but in the California utility world, if you screw up you get more money. Fire happened 2018, 2017 $PCG had $17.14B in revenue. 2020 revenue might be as high as $18.71B. So likely 10% higher revenues two years after a colossal failure.  \n\nThis is why utilities are included in the Monopoly game. \n\n3) **Dividend and Leadership**  \n $PCG agreed to freeze their dividend until $6.2B in non-GAPP core earnings. This target can be met as soon as 2022\u2014not much of a penalty all things considered especially with the cheap entry point for this stock (down 36% from pre-COVID, down 52% from post fire peak) \n\nAnother settlement term was restructuring the entire leadership team. $PCG did that, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re replacing Jason Garrett with Mike McCarthy. They got themselves someone with a proven record leading utilities in Patricia Pope, who signed a 5-year deal with PG&E starting January 4, 2021. She previously served as CEO for Consumer\u2019s Energy which was known for safety. She\u2019s also the first women to ever lead two Fortune 500 companies. This will be her first earnings call for PG&E. Her announcement caused a brief spike in the stock\u2014I expect the same with her first earning call (particularly with the positive numbers). \n\n4) **Wildfires**  \n Why buy now? Wildfire season is officially over now that CA received a ton of rain. This should be reflected in the risk for all utilities, but hasn\u2019t resolved yet. 2020 was a very long fire season that lasted deep into January 2021. With all the PSPS and redflag warnings, I was hesitant to pull the trigger until CA was in the clear. I also positioned my call options to align w/ the beginning of 2021 fire season for a higher ROI if my strike price comes in. So in the clear for wildfires + new CEO + high earnings\u2014great entry point.\n\n**Potential** **obstacles**\n\nThere are pending investigations into some 2020 wildfires. Regardless of culpability, a big chunk of this will be covered by wildfire safety fund and won\u2019t be anywhere near the 2017/2018 fires.\n\nOperation and Maintenance costs/regulatory fines. Most costs are not capitalized, but most utilities know how to work around the regulators to get everything capitalized. There\u2019s always the potential for additional fines, but they\u2019d be pretty inconsequential.\n\nBiggest obstacle: Everyone hates PG&E\u2014like hate hates them. But WSB seems to be cool with Martin Shkreli so there\u2019s that.\n\n**MOAT \u2013**   \n Ultimate Moat. They are bulletproof and there\u2019s no point of entry other than acquisition. They provide infrastructure to transport power. Battery storage, solar, wind, gas, nuke, etc. all still use the same grid to transport. With higher EV demands and increase investment in fire hardening measures revenues will continue to climb.\n\n**WHY WSB?**\n\nGet that Money! Buy the utility you hate. If you\u2019re in PG&E territory, buy the utility you hate and are obligated to pay.\n\n**EDIT:**\nThanks for all the comments/feedback.  \n\n**RE: $PCG hatred.**  \nHatred 100% valid\u2014it\u2019s not going away.  They\u2019re pretty shitty.  My point is that the system has rewarded their ineptitude by forcing public investment into their business.  Those checks have already been signed and sent out.  \nIt\u2019d be like if you were the only Uber driver in town.  You drive the car, charge your passengers, and then you get in a huge wreck because you thought brake pads didn\u2019t need to be inspected/changed.  Instead of being out of a car and in jail, the state tells your passengers to pay for your repairs and give you a 10% bonus for calling the repair shop.  Does it pay to have a well-maintained car in this situation?  No! The best position to be in in this situation is to have a super shitty car that requires 15+years of repairs collecting 10% every year until the brake pads need to be replaced again and the cycle continues.  It\u2019s a monopoly.\n\n**RE WSB u/ DD**\nu/angela_lansbury busted me.  I\u2019ve only been a user for 13 days!  Well, me and 80% of the users. \nThat said, as long as I finally have a forum\u2014I have to express my gratitude to WSB.  I had no idea a community like this existed until $GME press.  I can\u2019t tell you how much joy this group has given me and how much I\u2019ve learned.  It also got me out of bed at 6:00 every morning for the past 2 weeks.\nMy DD was tribute to this group.  I think there\u2019s a good opportunity to get in to a very institutional position (utilities) for a discount.  Utilities are rigged\u2014everyone knows that.  But what is a rather recent discovery is that their shittiness is directly proportional to forced public investment.  The worse you do the more you get.  This model works pretty well for schools, roads, etc.  The difference is that guaranteed $10 for every $100 spent that goes right into the utility\u2019s coffers.\nThis isn\u2019t a back-the-truck up YOLO for me, it\u2019s an investment I believe in.  I\u2019m long on $PCG, but I also think there\u2019s going to be upward pressure soon and wanted to share it with the group.\n\n**Edit 2**\nJust realized my comment responses were getting blocked.\n\n**Re: Erin Brokovich**\n\nIn 1995 the stock was at $30.25/share, then cratered to $20 with the $333m settlement in 1996, and then was $35/share in 1998\n\nAnother example:\nThe 2010 pipeline explosion affected share price. Pre explosion $48/ share.  Dropped briefly to $43, then back up to $48/ share three months later.\n\n**Re: new utilities for counties.**\nCCAs are not utilities.  They still need to use and pay to use PGE equipment (poles, wires).  CCAs contract generation.\n\n**Re: $4.89/share**.  Users properly ridiculed you.

{"title": "Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC", "selftext": "I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.\n\nTheir reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.\n\nTo preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout \"market manipulation\" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).\n\nThe first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:\n\nMy screenshot (02/05/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xk8hlhj30fg61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8aba006b33a4b703ca7eee7ed856f553a80dc98\n\nThe short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.\n\nRegardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on \"updating data\".\n\nI presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.\n\nHowever, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.\n\nRight, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.\n\nMy screenshot (02/06/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uildby970fg61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9284081630cd1b25087b0fe69abaa112e7eaf3\n\nAs you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).\n\nIn April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.\n\nI get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?\n\nThere was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff\n\nHere's the email he received.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s04tukbb0fg61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=812fbfea028d41767684ceef6e2c7eb65a87d5d7\n\nAgain, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.\n\nThoughts.\n\nP.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.\n\nP.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!\n\nEdit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:\n\n\"Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn\u2019t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.\n\nAre you certain the chart isn\u2019t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I\u2019ll resolve your ticket but I\u2019m still here if you reply.\"\n\nI mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say \"oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more \"accurate\" measurements to our users\". Ya know?\n\n**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**\n\n**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.\n\nHis post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**\n\nAnd for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis beautiful ape tweeted at Fintel referencing this post\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4seq03r6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24808432116a21e6764ac9d1508faab3e26cd2c3\n\nThis is their response:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft0xrjbt6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54c3cb8e783953cd2b62f069245e282e4efd86d5\n\nSo their excuse is a \"programming error\". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).\n\nI'm just sayin' feels like excuses to me.", "id": "lfcpce", "created_utc": 1612793882.0, "score": 3661, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 334, "comments": [{"body": "I asked a similar question regarding their changing data, this as the response;\n\n\"Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern!

{"title": "Enphase Energy (ENPH) pre-earnings (Feb 9) Extensive DD", "selftext": "EDIT: Posted a post-earnings DD in which I analyzed the earnings results and web-call. Post is under approval and is not online yet. Let's hope a Mod will approve it ASAP.   \nHi all,\n\nSince the GME hype has calmed down a bit, I present you with my first DD on this forum.\n\nFirst of all, no financial analyst here. This is no investment advice and do your own research.\n\nI will take you trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do.\n\n**Okay here we go:**\n\nI have a background in economics. Since the market nowadays is quite high, I am trying to analyze every investment I make thoroughly to minimize the risks. After November last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. However, we have increased a lot and I feel the urge to deep dive in every company I invest in.\n\n**Step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.**\n\nWhat my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next week\u2019s earnings. I analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.\n\nWhile doing this, me and my team have picked Enphase Energy.\n\n**Step 1, look at the previous realized EPS and Revenue vs. forecasted EPS and Revenue:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtl7ekf7t9g61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=939fb0f1be41f22db8691e0988faaba30274826c\n\nFirst observations:\n\n\\- 2020 amazing year.\n\n\\- Dip Q3 2019.\n\n\\- Good year 2018\n\n\\- Something was going on in 2017. But there was a change since 2018, 2019, 2020 are good years.\n\n\\- Bad year 2016, again something changed.\n\nPlease note the price implication in the last column. Visualized here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uuaap768t9g61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe52c18b03d49437ca465d0657c9b6581ac3e91c\n\n**Step 2: Company snapshot.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1c1s3n8t9g61.png?width=395&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0e4631b87c5b7a3fcba79311d0020c6efdd8733\n\nObservation: High P/E value compared to competitors.

So buying now would on average be a good idea. This month it has increased 6% while the average for February is 24.8% (8 year average) (no statistically proven).\n\n**Step 4, Ownership.**\n\n**Important question to ask: were there any strong buys/sells in the last couple months. The more recent the data, the better. We don\u2019t look at holding reported at 09/30/2020.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pm8rhpdat9g61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbca79f9313e6f0afaf769c8dc32117c6847f701\n\nObservations:\n\n\\- Strong buy by CEO Mr. Badrinarayanan on the 28th on Jan. 2021.\n\n\\- Strong sell by Sunpower Corp. (not representative)\n\n\\- Strong buy Blackrock Fund Advisors on 31th Dec. 2020.\n\n\\- Strong buy Blackrock Advisors (UK) on 31th Dec. 2020.\n\n**Step 5, Ratio analysis.**\n\n**Why was 2016 & 2017 such a bad year?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1we1q1zat9g61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=84673e3874646acc05e1c72bc6f514b09a541036\n\n\\- Extreme good performance after 2017.

I have been in solar industry my whole adult life. Started with Tesla before they went public.\n\n\"SolarEdge happened\". New electric code came out in 2017 (2017 NEC) requiring \"arc fault protection\" within 10' of panels. Enphase micro inverters had this built in but got sukerpunched by the cheaper SolarEdge \"whole system\" inverter with individual diodes at each panel. Somehow SolarEdge designed and launched a product that somehow bypassed the new regulations right before they were implemented. Many in the industry thought this was extremely fishy and still do.\n\nOlder Enphase micro inverters (215 &250) models had some \"staying connected\" issues with home Wi-Fi systems. They also had some individual microinverters fail and need replaced. And, some installers didn't fully plug everything together resulting in customers losing production from system.\n\nThe American made Enphase were a superior product even with those small temporary issues. The newer models from 2016 on have been great and still hold distinct advantages in warranty, ability to add individual panels facing different directions, monitoring, etc,etc.\n\nThis company stayed strong when they got \"screwed\". Kept up great customer service.

Also most ground mounted arrays should use string inverters because of distance to electrical box. \n\nSolarEdge uses these \"string\" inverters in their system and is the \"weak link\" in their design IMO.

That big tree at the corner of my property starts throwing some shade on the array, all of those panels in full sun are slacking. Enphase makes \"micro-inverters\" which allow each panel to operate independently. Their product makes the solar installation a little more expensive on a per-panel basis.

{"title": "Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear. DD Inside.", "selftext": "Why is energy still the play and why will it let you retire in the few years?\n\nGeneral: \nDuring a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the \u201808 \u201809 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]\n   \n  \n\nNext, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He\u2019s working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his \u201cBiden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment\u201d which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  \n    \n\nEnergy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.\n  \n\nHydrogen: \nRecently Mercedes-Benz spins off it\u2019s truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. \u201c..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]\n\n  \n\nNuclear::\nNow, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     \n  \n\nUtilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]\n  \n\n\n\n# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar\n\nThe tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    \n\nTickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) \n  \nFinal: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn\u2019t even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. \nI'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.\n\nSources:  \n[1] https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/12/111205140613.htm  \n\n[2] https://joebiden.com/9-key-elements-of-joe-bidens-plan-for-a-clean-energy-revolution/  \n\n[3] https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/  \n\n[4] https://josephcollinsul.medium.com/the-uranium-bull-thesis-ce6d49ebd219  \n\n[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI  \n\n[6] https://apnews.com/article/technology-environment-germany-54b2b7629539b2fb8f1383b83b490c42  \n\n[7] https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ballard-introduces-fuel-cell-industrys-first-commercial-zero-emission-module-to-power-ships-301125226.html  \n  \n  \nPositions: people are asking my positions, I'm long on all this stuff in the boomerfolio.

It's anticipated that with the existing pipeline of new reactors and existing reactors that there will be a deficit between contracted and uncontracted supply.

They're fundamentally slow projects, which require a massive amount of capital: roughly $8-10 billion per 1 GW of reactor capacity, or about $8-10/W of capital.  They only pay off over a very long period -- 30+ years.  *In a stable energy market where prices are steady and there's no rush*  this works out since modern Gen III reactors are rated for 60 years of operation.

Offshore wind is a bit slower (call it more like 3-4 years).  Solar and wind are much less capital intensive - $0.75/W to $1.5/W with offshore wind being somewhat higher.   [Those prices are declining rapidly as well](https://www.lazard.com/media/451447/grphx_lcoe-09-09.jpg).  When you adjust for their respective capacity factors to get cost per *average* unit of power output (rather than raw capacity) then the numbers are slightly less favorable, but they're still half the price of nuclear or better.  An individual wind or solar farm won't last as long as nuclear powerplant before it needs upgrades or some equipment replaced, but that's okay: they last long enough and with equipment costs steadily dropping the replacement will be much cheaper.   The operating costs for solar & wind are also much lower than nuclear.\n\n[See the charts for Germany's energy production](https://energy-charts.info/charts/energy/chart.htm?l=en&c=DE&interval=year&year=-1&stacking=sorted): from 2010 to 2020 they built enough renewables (mostly solar/wind) to go from 20% of their electricity to 50%... and that's when there was vastly higher prices and less manufacturing capacity.  That's the 4th largest economy in the world.  Given how much renewable tech has matured and the industry has grown, we could probably do that in 5 years now, at *crunches some numbers* call it 1/4 of the price or less.\n\nWhen you put this together, what you get is that **if the goal is to bring carbon emissions down ASAP then renewables are by FAR the best short-term play.**  And here's the first big BUT for nuclear: we have to bring carbon emissions down by around half by 2030, and **it now too late to start building nuclear reactors towards that goal** given a 10+ year span from planning to completion. Yes, okay, we might be able to streamline some regulatory processes a bit but that would only shave a year or two off that (and it comes with real risks).  The second BUT is that energy prices are not stable:  renewables will push the price of electricity downwards as they rapidly become cheaper.  The opportunity cost of sinking money into an expensive reactor right now is not good, when the competition will be much cheaper by the time it goes online. \n\nWill we probably build some more nuclear powerplants long-term (at least to replace some of the ones that are aging out now)?  Probably.  But that's more of a long-term *assist* to renewables rather than a short term boost -- they are to fill in power for areas where the geography isn't favorable to renewables.\n\nSee also [this figure from the IPCC SR15 report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/SPM3b-724x1024.png).

Early Gen I reactors from the 1950s-1970s (and naval reactors) have much in common with SMRs.  They are smaller models, and in the case of Gen I reactors the idea was that many units would be built.  This turned out to be a bad idea, and Gen II reactors were built much larger, because it was cheaper to build one very big reactor core than many smaller ones.  \n\nOn the other hand, technology and manufacturing has changed a great deal since that era and the concept may be ready for another pass.  I fundamentally like the technology NuScale has developed because it's based on well-proven, mature PWR technology and is a particularly elegant reactor design.

I think the other more exotic SMR proposals are unlikely to succeed -- there's a long learning process discovering the engineering problems when pioneering a fundamentally new reactor design.

My two cents on who\u2019s going to be the future energy source - it\u2019s NOT going to be mutually exclusive, and the scope should be more focused on global environment instead of just the US. \n\nLet me layout a few things, and you can take it as you may. Battery IS the future, but NOT the only future. Why? Because battery is the only technology component among electronics industry that hasn\u2019t made any exponential advancement as a field. Just ask yourself, when was the first time you used a lithium ion battery, I can\u2019t even remember, because it\u2019s been here forever. And ask yourself a second question, how much has the mha rating changed of your AA battery since you first used it? Now the second problem of battery is weight to energy ratio. I\u2019m on my phone, so I can\u2019t post a chart for you, but it\u2019s easily googleable, and the ratio for battery is very low. So what are batteries good for? Answer is short range, urban bound vehicles. If you own an EV like I have, you\u2019d know this is true. Stretching out the battery range is not fun. \n\nNow why hydrogen is the other part of energy future? I\u2019d like to start by clearing up some misconceptions about hydrogen first. \n1)Hydrogen blows up - yes but not really, hydrogen is combustible, so is gasoline. But, In the case of damaged hydrogen tank, it\u2019s actually safer than gasoline for two reasons - A) hydrogen fuel cell stores as liquid hydrogen from being pressurized, in the case of puncture or damage, liquid hydrogen turns into gas and dissipates very quickly from depressurization, and also the virtue of it is the lightest and easiest bonding element. B) if it catches in flame, which both gasoline and lithium ion battery also can, hydrogen flame would be directional, again due to pressure and the nature of being gas, it doesn\u2019t leak or spread into residual fire. So in a car crash, with large and multiple puncture in the fuel cell, there\u2019s actually less risk of combustion, hydrogen would dissipate in seconds. \n2) What\u2019s the point of of using electricity to produce hydrogen, and then using it to charge a battery anyway? It is because hydrogen production can be done through utilizing otherwise wasted energy production. Let me give you a few examples. Most electricity produced go into an electricity grid system, where excess generally can\u2019t be stored. Electricity usage goes through diurnal cycles, but solar hydro productions don\u2019t. So when there\u2019s excess in the grid, they just turn the generators off even though there are potential to produce. In these cases, they can be used to produce hydrogen instead. It acts as a form of high weight to energy ratio storage medium that can be transported.\nIf you followed so far, this bring to the actual use case for hydrogen future. Commercial mid-long haul truck or bus fleets will use hydrogen. Clearly batteries are not economical for long haul due to weight and space needed for that range. Hydrogen can bridge this gap, while also not requiring a lot of infrastructure that seem to be the other concern. You can have destination point fueling and forgo enroute fueling.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think your story is fully right in a few points:\n\n* Hydrogen generation throws away a very healthy % of energy\n* It has been proposed to use plain EV batteries to store the waste you mention, the peak and valley averaging capability is something that you can do with any technology that has electricity as a step, not just hydrogen.

It will also mix fast and there is no easy way of containing it. The mix is highly explosive. I cannot even begin to contemplate the clusterfuck that a mild tunnel collision can end up being.

Hydrogen more likely than not will play a big part of it. I\u2019m not trying to attack battery or defend hydrogen\u2019s weakness here. Just trying to point to some misconceptions.\n\nEvery form of energy medium loses some energy. Hydrogen obviously is no exception, at 60% system efficiency it\u2019s not bad. Battery is a lot higher at over 80%, but you have to round efficiency ratio again to its mass. Battery in this department is very bad. Hence why my point being EV is not suitable for heavy duty long haul. \n\nCyclical waste energy can be stored a number of ways. True. It\u2019s more nuanced than I can explain in a Reddit comment. There isn\u2019t a universal method for all environments. Hydrogen generation is the more promising one in my opinion for a lot of applications. Alternatively we can and have used \u201cwasted\u201d energy to melt salt, pump water into higher elevations, load large spring system and charge batteries to store those as potential energy for future use.\n\nI can see long tunnel being a very real and serious concern for hydrogen future though. I don\u2019t have a good answer for that.

You are using the term Biofuels in places where what you're actually talking about is Biomass. They are different, and that distinction matters. Your entire subpoint 2 is talking about biomass products. Operationally, biofuels are usually considered a subset of biomass. Biofuels is almost universally classified as liquid or gaseous fuel alternatives for transportation. When you start talking about electrical generation, that's almost exclusively biomass. That's why the distinction matters. \n2. Regarding your subpoint 3. You're essentially saying biomass (you said biofuels, but see my subpoint 1) can be used as a generation peaker. Theoretically, you're not incorrect. But from a plant physics perspective, using boiler combustion plants as peakers is not easy, or efficient. It's like trying to use coal as a peaker. Can you theoretically do it? Yeah. Are the plants designed to operate that way? No. Would a grid operator ever use the plant that way? Almost never. For the last decade, and the foreseeable future, peak demand has been/will be met with natural gas combined cycle plants. In terms of fuel-fired generation (meaning not renewables/battery), these are superior in terms of peaking. (Combined cycle plants are also by FAR the most efficient form of thermal generation). If you research biomass energy stats, you'll find that almost half of all biomass energy production comes from wood and wood byproduct burning, and most of THAT generation is done by wood and paper manufacturers who burn byproduct to generate power and process heat for their facilities - sometimes selling it back to the utility if there's an excess. It's not non-zero, but almost no utilities do or will ever use biomass for generation. \n3. I'm not saying biofuels and/or biomass are irrelevant. Biofuels specifically have some potential, IMO moreso in sector specific applications like agricultural. Your arguments about the intermittent aspect of wind and solar are valid. No qualms there. However, a) Nat Gas peaking b) Battery storage, which is coming down in price a ton and the \"economy of scale\" is already there/growing. c) Nuclear would be a nearly infinitely better way to baseload for renewables than biomass. No major US utilities, or the Department of Energy, are looking at biofuels/biomass as a part of the future grid. IMO, the growth potential is really capped to offsetting fossil fuels in specific sectors, and even then, EV is probably gonna win out. \n\nSource: Engineer who has worked in energy for almost a decade and currently does energy related R&D for DOE everyday.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "1.

Fukushima was recently in the news once again back in October because Japan is [considering dumping contaminated water into the ocean](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54658379) as they are running out of storage for it, and scientists/government debate the potential impact of this. It's risks like these that have potential consequences for decades to come, and people read and digest this information - and to be clear, it's not disinformation. \n\nMy point is that people are well aware that nuclear energy comes with risks, and those risks can be absolutely catastrophic no matter how well intended the company/government running them may be - especially with the type of reactors in use today - and their devastation will likely last well past our lifetimes. We've had multiple generations witness what happens when things with nuclear do go wrong. Look, humans make errors, we're not perfect.

I'm actually very pro-nuclear energy and do believe we need to have a massive investment into nuclear, as I believe it to be our best bet to curb climate change.

There are reasons those designs were chosen (story for another time), but I don't really agree it's disinformation or lack of education which make people against nuclear. It's quite the opposite - people are educated and they read about these incidents and they begin to understand the greater impact they can have on the environment we're trying to protect from climate change.

They're in the process of developing the 3 nm process and it isn't expected to be ready until 2022. Even once its available, in 2022, it won't ready for wide scale manufacturing for another year or two because yields will be very low. AMD's latest Zen 3 cores are built with a refined 7 nm node. Their roadmap for Zen 4 (5 nm) chips states it'll come out in 2022. 5 nm is still in the early production phase (low yields) and Apple booked out all of its capacity for 2021.  \n\nIntel as you said is still stuck on 14 nm. Their newest chips coming out in Q1 2021 (Rocket Lake S) is still 14 nm+++++++++. Not only that, but they got fewer cores (8) than their previous flag ship (10). Intel says their long overdue 10 nm chips (Alder Lake S) will come out in Q3/4 2021, but who knows if they can actually keep the deadline. It wouldn't be the first time Intel said they're on track with their new node and then announce they're fucked several months later. They outsourced chips from TSMC, but they only outsourced it for their Core i3 lineup, which means absolutely nothing. Their flagship money makers are still manufactured in-house.  \n\nIntel has made some very good leadership changes this month, but changing leadership doesn't mean immediate results. It'll take 2-4 years until the re-hired engineers can produce a leading class chip because chip development takes a very long time. AMD has at least those 2-4 years to eat away at Intel's market share. They're also not afraid of dropping prices to create value. I have no doubt in my mind, if Intel's Rocket Lake S chips out-perform in single thread tasks, AMD would either release their value non-X chips or just drop the price of their X chips to once again overtake Intel in the value/performance ratio.
