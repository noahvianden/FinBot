To be able for me not to experience that negative acct (like d other guy), i have to sell (closed) both so I won\u2019t incurred any more charges. I will only loose my premium, unless I don\u2019t sell it. Anything I do when doing options naked is to get rid of it before expiration date. Lets say I only bought call on NOK at strike price of 5.50 4/1. To be able for me to profit is for NOK to go up to $5.80. Otherwise if it goes down, my option is worthless. But I still need to closed it? \nIf NOK goes up on price let\u2019s say $7. I sell then I profit? What if I don\u2019t sell it and let it expire, what would happen? Pls advise, trying to make sense in my head. I bought sticks since i was young but never done an option at all. My first one is this NOK and I ddnt even buy a put.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hey BeeThrifty. Theres alot to digest but I'll try to do my best... I cannot tell you benefits or disadvantages  of buying a call and put with the same expiration because there are a lot of factors. \n\n\nEdit:  When you say doing options naked, that indicates doing something such as selling calls at a lower strike without actually owning the shares. For instance, NOK is trading at (pretend) $5.80 and you sell a call out of the money with a higher strike than it is currently trading (i.e. $6.50). If it went to $6.51 by expiration, you will have to hand over 100 shares and you will get paid $6.50 per share. If you dont actually own 100 shares of NOK, then that is called naked. \n\nWhenever you buy a call that expires out of the money, you dont have to do anything because you only lose the premium you paid when you initially purchased it. It's similar to car insurance in that if theres no accident, you don't get back what you paid for the insurance.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, I just got scared since I don\u2019t own 100 shares of Nok but 25.

{"title": "Oil Price Crash Anniversary - Energy Squeeze Play", "selftext": " \n\nReal DD from JP Morgan Quant on Oil / Energy Equities\n\n\"According to JPMorgan quant *Kolanovic*, the biggest short squeeze yet is set to begin next month as systematic funds, momentum chasers, trend followers and the CTA community in general cover their legacy shorts in the energy sector and go long. CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive. However, this is in the context of a huge systematic net short overhang in the energy sector. In other words, energy - in all forms be it oil or energy stocks - remains the most hated sector across all investors.\n\nThe catalyst that forces the squeeze is the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the Covid crisis, at which point various vol metrics followed by vol-control funds will reset and they will have no choice but to go long. That - *and this is the punchline of Kolanovic's thesis*\u00a0 \\-\u00a0 will \"change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive\" which is also a gentle hint from the JPM quant to all the redditors out there: if you want to spark a truly historic short squeeze, one which forces systematic shorts to not only cover but to go long, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks.\n\nKolanovic was kind enough to even give you the timing: you have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor **\"will need to rebalance in March by closing \\~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding \\~2% to energy longs, for a \\~22% net buying in Energy.\"**\n\nWhat is the quantitative significance of these flows? Well, the Croatian quant calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about \\~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, **\"the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn.\"** It could be far, far more. As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. And, remarkably, **the most recent number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95h8uq9bquj61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0632e1b65f80fd25d66e5c4c95be3f811110b68\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe then said that since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance. It now appears that said frontrunning of the CTA squeeze officially kicked off yesterday because according to Goldman prime on Monday, Feb 22, on the same day the bank saw the largest net selling in US Macro Products since Jan 27, the biggest increase in ETF shorts since November (offset however by aggressive buying in single names), **it also observed the official start of sector rotation into energy stocks, as \"energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years\" a +5.8 sigma move.**\n\n*Here are the market details from Goldman's Prime Service for Feb 22:*\n\n**The GS Prime book saw the largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-1.5 SDs vs. the average daily net flow of the past year), driven by short sales outpacing long buys 5 to 1.**\n\n**US equities \u2013 Largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-2.0 SDs) driven by short sales in Macro Products**\n\n* **Macro Products** (Index and ETF combined) saw the largest net selling since Jan 27th.\u00a0 Macro Products have been net sold in 9 of the past 10 trading days.\n* **ETF shorts increased +4.3%** \u2013 the largest 1-day increase since November \u2013 driven by Large Cap, Technology, and Corporate Bond ETFs. ETF shorts have increased +9% week/week (+25% YTD) and now make up 21.4% of the non-Index US short book, the highest level on our record going back to 2012.\n* **Single Names were modestly net bought overall** (+0.2 SDs) \u2013 Sector flows were split driven by net buying in Energy (long buys > short covers), Real Estate (short covers > long sales), Comm Svcs (long buys > short sales), and Health Care (long buys > short sales) vs. net selling in Info Tech (short sales > long buys), Materials (long sales), Financials (short sales > long sales), and Consumer Disc (long sales > short covers).\n\n**Energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years (+5.8 SDs), w**hile Info Tech was the most net sold sector, the $ net selling was relatively modest (-1.0 SDs) driven by short sales.\n\n* **FAAMG (GSTMTMEG) \u2013 Collectively the TMT Mega Caps were modestly net bought yesterday,** driven by risk-off flows with short covers outpacing long sales 1.4 to 1. The group had been net sold for four straight days (8 of the past 10) coming into yesterday \u2013 aggregate long/short ratio (MV) of the group had declined -33% MTD to 14.6, which is in the 23rd percentile vs. the past year.\n* **Most net bought industries** \u2013 Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels, Entertainment, Specialty Retail, Road & Rail, REITs, Food & Staples Retailing, Media, Household Durables\n* **Most net sold industries** \u2013 Interactive Media & Svcs, Software, Capital Markets, Internet & Direct Marketing Retail, Chemicals, IT Svcs, Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure, Food Products\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wdsajacquj61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f57b4b7faf2fc7e6a0bc76460ae6b8df258e0bd\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position:**\n\n**$XOM $MRO $OXY OTM Calls for \\~Q3**\n\n**$NRGU**", "id": "lt1tj4", "created_utc": 1614358252.0, "score": 178, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "Yes, bought into a few oil companies about 6 months ago.

These options on futures expire on the 3/17th while calls on XOM and other oil expire the 3/19th.\n\n[Crude April Futures Options](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CLJ21/options?moneyness=allRows)\n\n[XOM March Options](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/XOM/options?moneynes)\n\nNow, If you look at OI on XOM you'll already see quite a large OI in ITM calls, but with major interest at 55c which is only several dollars away. It's important to note that valuations for XOM and Crude index are tied closely. If crude goes up, XOM goes up. Since these futures options expire 2 days before options contracts. If crude squeezes as a result, it's going to accelerate the squeeze in XOM, especially at the 55c mark.\n\nXOM has a announcement on wednesday although the nature is unknown it could have something to do with the sale of some of their old production assets which could increase price\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts to watch**\n\n* Key date is on the 4th of March when OPEC announces if they are going to continue at the same output or increase output with signs of global recovery in sight. If they do it would have to be a small amount (like under 500k or 1M extra) This will surely drive the price down however global oil consumption is still hard to predict since consumption is lower than forecasts so its really riding on vaccine distribution, reopening, and general spending to increase which means logistics sees a surge in fuel needs. It's unknown what the current crude reserves are in certain countries, the US is starting to exhaust strategic supplies but OPEC doesn't want to increase production if overall demand does return as quickly as expected.\n   * Something to keep in mind, OPEC has to decide if they want to capitalize and raise oil prices at the cost of accelerating the switch to EV vehicles\n* Another thing to note, when the Dollar Index goes down, crude goes up since every transaction is based on the USD. Since it looks like we're printing more USD this means crude prices will continue to rise, further feeding into a possible squeeze.\n* Closing price of crude on 3/17 to see if futures fall in the money. Currently the larger OI contracts are in the money so a squeeze is probable. This will push all oil stocks up. XOM and Marathon have the strong correlation to Crude price movements and will be strongest with these two followed by Oxy and BP.\n\n**As far as April Put movement:**\n\n* This being said, the OI on puts could be ITM if Opec decides to increase supplies lower crude prices\n* Valuations have been rising in anticipation for the meeting on the 4th. If a considerable raise in barrel output is announced for the month of April then we see a downward prices on crude and petroleum companies.\n\n**Im rather bullish but again, the OPEC meeting on 4th is a big factor**\n\nI am eyeing starters in high OI calls so liquidity isn't as much of an issue:\n\n[XOM  3/19 55C and 60C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/XOM/options?moneynes) \\- Huge OI compared to MRO\n\n[OXY 3/19 30c and 35C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/OXY/options?moneyness=allRows&expiration=2021-03-19-m)\n\n[BP 3/19 27.50C](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BP/options?moneyness=allRows&expiration=2021-03-19-m) \\- It should be noted that BP does not move as tightly with crude movement like ZOM and MRO but it certainly does move.\n\n[UCO 3/19 60C](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/UCO/options?moneyness=allRows&expiration=2021-03-19-m) \\- Proshares 2x Crude the daily movement (could be huge on the 17th/18th going into the 19th - Low liquidity (OI=287) but return could be excellent\n\n**Hedging**\n\nI may also pickup some XOM 3/19 50P starter as a hedge just in case ZOM's announcement is negative, but will still hold the calls mentioned above in the event crude surges.\n\n**Inflation figures from stim**\n\nAlso another note, lower USD index values usually correlate to higher crude barrel pricing and with this 1.5T stim plan that was announce we may see another possible driver.

{"title": "What caused stocks to dump yesterday: the unwinding of $50B worth of bonds", "selftext": "Last week and earlier this week, I've been posting warnings about watching out for increased volatility leading into March, and particularly toward the end of March, which is the end of Q1. We're going to see unwinding of massive positions in the pandemic and tech stocks that were successful in 2020 as institutions and professionals will be forced to change their portfolios to more value oriented stocks that will perform better in high interest rate conditions: commodities, energy, high free cash flow businesses, industrials and financials. I refer to this as \"rotation\" where portfolios evolve from being focused on one sector or asset class to another over time. This Spring, these rotations may not occur in a slow, calm and orderly way. \n\nMonday, as I said in an earlier post this week, I liquidated most of my positions in the hot stocks of 2020, including EVs, and began focusing on interest-rate proof businesses. These are businesses with lower long term debt, good free cash flow, actual positive profit margins, and good balance sheets. I'm just holding long positions in outright cash purchases of stock, so I don't have complicated positions to \"unwind\" (I just sell a stock to get out of a position). However, institutional and professional investors, and hedge funds, have more complicated and leveraged portfolios. \n\nWe can't expect the unwinding of positions of so-called \"whales\" (big players) in the market to always be orderly or calm as the end of Q1 approaches. \n\nYesterday's market dump appears to have been triggered by one or more whales forcefully selling $50B of bonds into a reluctant buyer's market. The below is a good article from Bloomberg but it's premium content so I'll summarize it below because it answers the question, *Why are bond yields spiking despite the Federal Reserve setting its interest rates to banks so low and WTF is going on in the bond market?*\n\n[Chaotic Treasury Selloff Fueled by $50 Billion of Unwinding](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/chaotic-treasury-selloff-fueled-by-50-billion-position-unwind)(Paywall)\n\n* **A massive dump of $50B in bonds suggest one (or a few) positions were unwound by one or more whales**  \n\n> \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an orderly selloff and certainly didn\u2019t appear to be driven by any obvious fundamental continuation or extension of the reflation thesis,\u201d wrote NatWest Markets strategist Blake Gwinn in a note to clients. \n\n* **\"Fundamental decoupling\" between low interest rates and a heating economy**\n\nBond and lending pros are rejecting the Federal Reserve's low-interest view, which is at odds with 6-7% growth projected due to stimulus plans and rebound from the pandemic and Powell's talk of \"maximum employment\" plans\n\n> The bond market\u2019s divergence from a fundamental backdrop was most evident at the shorter-end of the curve. Eurodollar contracts -- which are priced off Libor -- collapsed in record volumes as traders repriced their expectations for the path of Fed rates with few obvious catalysts.\n\n* **What exactly happened?  5-year Treasury notes jumped 22 points, and spreads associated with those notes jumped 24 points**\n\n> The main protagonist in the bond market was the five-year Treasury note, a maturity often associated with long-term Fed rate expectations, where yields closed 22 basis point higher on the day. The so-called butterfly-spread index -- a measure of how the note is performing against its two- and 10-year peers -- jumped 24 basis points, the worst daily performance for the sector since 2002.\n\n> Markets now see a Fed hike by March 2023 compared to mid-2023 previously, and have priced in rates over 50 basis points higher by 2024.\n\n> But in remarks this week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell offered reassurance that policy would continue to be supportive and look beyond a temporary pick-up in inflation, especially from a low base. While Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida expressed cautious optimism on the outlook, he said it would \u201ctake some time\u201d to restore the economy to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n* **Bond buyers who disagree with the Fed were \"on strike\" yesterday and created a \"liquidity drought\"** \n\n> A number of more \u201ctechnical-style\u201d factors were in the mix, against a backdrop of a good-old-fashioned buyers strike...\n\n> A lack of bond market liquidity, just when traders needed it most [i.e. during a big dump of $50B in bonds]\n\n* **Also high frequency trading exists in the bond market too, apparently, and they suddenly disappeared yesterday in a market that was used to their presence, at the same time buyers thinned out**\n\n> \u201cWe think that a steep decline in market depth contributed to the outsized moves in yields today,\u201d wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Jay Barry in a note to clients. Barry showed how the share of high-frequency traders in the Treasury market -- which has been on an increasing trend -- tends to retreat rapidly as volatility spikes.\n\nI expect to see more volatility as positions from 2020 unwind and people create whole new portfolios for post-pandemic 2021. This is a good time to look at which stocks are the ones doing well each day and why. \n\nDisclaimer: Not a financial professional\n\nEdit: I plan to reenter tech stocks hardcore once these whales are done with whatever BS they do at the end of every quarter whenever there are big changes.\n\n__________________________\n\nEdit 2: Here's an addition of more material offered by /u/TomatoeHaven from other references (I have not checked them)\n\n**What impact, if any, does the Fed have on Treasury Yield?**\n\nNote: Treasury yield briefly topped the 1.6% level on Thursday and traded at its highest level in more than a year, raising concern for investors across asset classes.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, if bond yields continue to rise and there is a smooth rotation out of growth and defensive stocks into value and cyclical stocks, the Fed will remain sanguine,\u201d strategist Albert Edwards of Societe Generale said in a note. \u201cBut the risk is growing that with so many bubbles blown by the Fed something will burst soon.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/us-bonds-treasury-yields-rise-ahead-of-fourth-quarter-gdp-update.html", "id": "lsyfcs", "created_utc": 1614348619.0, "score": 5612, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 992, "comments": [{"body": "For those of us who would prefer not to liquidate any part of our tech or growth stocks, what is your outlook for when more stability will be achieved? \n\nYou reference the end of Q1, does this make you believe that April or May will be a less volatile time for these types of stocks?", "score": 152, "replies": [{"body": "This selloff appears to be ending today, because tech may be bouncing today. \n\nBut whether a bounce is going to continue into next week depends on a few things. \n\nIn terms of volatility, because institutions have to change up their portfolios at the end of the quarter, we usually see a lot of selling at the end of quarters that have seen some big shifts in the stock market.

I'm referring to those two separate types of selling in my post.\n\nFor rebalancing, it's not that the institutions have to change up their portfolios, but the market changes under them, so they have to sell some things and buy some other thing to bring their portfolios back into the balance that they're supposed to, by contract and rules, be in. If you're supposed to have 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds and your stocks suddenly dumped, like they did last March, then you'd have to buy more stocks to bring your portfolio's proportional holdings of stocks back up to 60%. When the market rises a lot as it has since last March, you'd have to sell stocks to bring your portfolio's proportion of stocks back down to 60%\n\nThis is a current example below. JP Morgan says the recent drop in bond prices means that a lot of portfolio holders who have to follow certain rules will have to sell stocks to buy more bonds to bring their level of bonds back up to where they are supposed to be by the end of March. \n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.in/business/news/jpmorgan-says-up-to-316-billion-selling-in-equites-by-quarter-end/articleshow/81376513.cms", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot for your reply and i find it very helpful.

Their \"siRNA platform\" is going to face a lot of trouble and I think it's extremely unlikely it'll see success as a therapeutic RNA degrades too fast so persistence which is required for non-vaccine things is too low. I'm not sure if I understand their \"Innate Immunity Platform\" (this itself is concerning), but from what I do understand I'd guess that targeting host proteins is going to cause them a lot of trouble in clinical trials for a treatment that's only going to be effective in early viral infections (read small market) -- I'm not clear on the exact targeting mechanism (e.g. small molecule, anti body, biologic, etc) and that missing information worries me (but maybe more reading would clarify). Their \"T Cell Platform\" would be better named their HCMV platform and it's honestly the most appealing technology, but I'm torn on whether it's a horrible idea or a brilliant one. It suffers from all the typical viral delivery issues in terms of size and ability to access any target, and this alone is a pretty good reason for most investors to keep their distance. The reason it could be a horrible idea is that HCMV being more reactive means it could cause sever side effects or just be cleared immediately if injected with broken viral particles. On the other hand if they use more mundane envelope protein to hide it and the reaction is sever against infected cells via the MHC (as the literature they are pointing to suggests), then it's a clever way to kill a target cell population. I'm actually quite interested in the science. I think their \"Antibody Platform\" is down right stupid. Why go to all the trouble of identifying antibodies in living host when you could just add fc to the host protein? That's some of the most insanely difficult work science is even capable of all to do something that could be done a hell of a lot easier. **Verdict: VIR is not a long term position.**\n\nNow PACB is bit further outside my area of expertise. It's a company for sequencing and sequencing isn't going anywhere, but I'd guess that most of their future prospects are in making sequencing cheaper rather than coming up with new ways to sequence. Problem is sequencing is already dirt cheap for pure dna. So that means there's a question of where they're going with this: It looks like full genome sequencing. I can tell you I don't think full genome sequencing is going to become a prevalent and normal sequencing, but someone in cell-bio (I'm in structural bio) might disagree with me. Basically I'm not qualified to say, but they at least have a business in a field that's not going anywhere and might see some growth. **Verdict: PACB is a safe if mediocre long term position**, but again I'm less qualified to comment on this one.\n\n\nEdit: Also this is based off the science, not the business sense or financial decisions.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What do you think of companies focused on genetic testing like EXAS or NVTA?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not a doctor, but my understanding is that screening for certain types of gene defects has become increasingly common.

Firstly, they only work on small molecules. That's not the end of the world since most drugs on the market are small molecules, but small molecules do have a horrible specificity problem that tend to cause off-target effects. One of the sells of these types of delivery systems is that in some cases such as this one they can mitigate those effects. What that means for investors is that a lot of the success this has already seen is due to being used on pre-existing and already approved drugs. The problem gets worse though because retention of the drug in the lipid nano-particle is determined by both the specific lipid and the specific drug. They have to be very compatible, and the change in environment (in this case pH) has to favor release.

In other words the value of the company has exceeded the rate at which it's growing. \n\nIf we take a look back in history, we can jump to a hot time in 2007. For context, in July of 2007, the first iphone was released. By December the value of AAPL's share had reached a high of $7 per share (I assume it has split many times until now so ignore the small number). However, AAPL wouldn't reach this price again until just around 2 years later (Dec 2007 - Oct 2009). Now obviously this looks like cherry picking data and I picked one of the worst times in recent history for apple. And the lull was *only* 2 years.\n\nHowever if we hold a general sentiment that a market crash is right around the corner then expecting apple to take a long time to recover is reasonable. And if we look at some metrics related purely to apple, such as the notorious P/E ratio, we see that [Apple's P/E](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio) ratio currently is the same as it was before the 2008 crash. If you don't like PE ratio because the company can be re-investing in themselves (thus lower earnings despite strong value), then the P/S ratio is just as revealing, showing that Apple's P/S ratio is significantly higher than it was at it's height in 2007. (just change the tab on the macrotrends site). In fact, all of the valuations for AAPL are really high compared to how they normally run with numbers only matching those of 2007 (at least within the last 15 years). \n\nSo yeah, I think Apple is overvalued. I'll pick it back up if it hits like, $100 or something. The thing is that many bulls are convinced that Apple is purely a good company and no valuation is too high because it'll eventually go up...which is probably true. But if I suspect that the stock might tank for 2 years, then I'm ok holding some cash for the time being and bringing my investments elsewhere. \n\nAlso this phenomenon is not only affecting Apple as it is affecting virtually every growth/tech company in the recent years. So I finished selling all of my tech on Monday/Tuesday and have been trimming the positions over the last couple weeks. \n\n[yahoo chart](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/AAPL#eyJpbnRlcnZhbCI6IndlZWsiLCJwZXJpb2RpY2l0eSI6MSwidGltZVVuaXQiOm51bGwsImNhbmRsZVdpZHRoIjoxMC4zMTg0NzEzMzc1Nzk2MTgsImZsaXBwZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJ2b2x1bWVVbmRlcmxheSI6dHJ1ZSwiYWRqIjp0cnVlLCJjcm9zc2hhaXIiOnRydWUsImNoYXJ0VHlwZSI6ImxpbmUiLCJleHRlbmRlZCI6ZmFsc2UsIm1hcmtldFNlc3Npb25zIjp7fSwiYWdncmVnYXRpb25UeXBlIjoib2hsYyIsImNoYXJ0U2NhbGUiOiJsaW5lYXIiLCJwYW5lbHMiOnsiY2hhcnQiOnsicGVyY2VudCI6MSwiZGlzcGxheSI6IkFBUEwiLCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsImluZGV4IjowLCJ5QXhpcyI6eyJuYW1lIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwb3NpdGlvbiI6bnVsbH0sInlheGlzTEhTIjpbXSwieWF4aXNSSFMiOlsiY2hhcnQiLCLigIx2b2wgdW5kcuKAjCJdfX0sImxpbmVXaWR0aCI6Miwic3RyaXBlZEJhY2tncm91bmQiOnRydWUsImV2ZW50cyI6dHJ1ZSwiY29sb3IiOiIjMDA4MWYyIiwic3RyaXBlZEJhY2tncm91ZCI6dHJ1ZSwiZXZlbnRNYXAiOnsiY29ycG9yYXRlIjp7ImRpdnMiOnRydWUsInNwbGl0cyI6dHJ1ZX0sInNpZ0RldiI6e319LCJzeW1ib2xzIjpbeyJzeW1ib2wiOiJBQVBMIiwic3ltYm9sT2JqZWN0Ijp7InN5bWJvbCI6IkFBUEwiLCJxdW90ZVR5cGUiOiJFUVVJVFkiLCJleGNoYW5nZVRpbWVab25lIjoiQW1lcmljYS9OZXdfWW9yayJ9LCJwZXJpb2RpY2l0eSI6MSwiaW50ZXJ2YWwiOiJ3ZWVrIiwidGltZVVuaXQiOm51bGx9XSwiY3VzdG9tUmFuZ2UiOnsic3RhcnQiOjExNjc3MjQ4MDAwMDAsImVuZCI6MTI2MTk4NzIwMDAwMH0sInN0dWRpZXMiOnsi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwiOnsidHlwZSI6InZvbCB1bmRyIiwiaW5wdXRzIjp7ImlkIjoi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwiLCJkaXNwbGF5Ijoi4oCMdm9sIHVuZHLigIwifSwib3V0cHV0cyI6eyJVcCBWb2x1bWUiOiIjMDBiMDYxIiwiRG93biBWb2x1bWUiOiIjZmYzMzNhIn0sInBhbmVsIjoiY2hhcnQiLCJwYXJhbWV0ZXJzIjp7IndpZHRoRmFjdG9yIjowLjQ1LCJjaGFydE5hbWUiOiJjaGFydCIsInBhbmVsTmFtZSI6ImNoYXJ0In19fSwicmFuZ2UiOnsiZHRMZWZ0IjoiMjAwNy0wMS0wMVQwODowMDowMC4wMDBaIiwiZHRSaWdodCI6IjIwMTAtMDEtMDJUMDc6NTk6MDAuMDAwWiIsInBlcmlvZGljaXR5Ijp7ImludGVydmFsIjoid2VlayIsInBlcmlvZCI6MX0sInBhZGRpbmciOjB9fQ--)", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Not if Apple mass produces its M1 chip which it will as it has TSM\u2019s priority over all other customers.

It also takes time to substitute one form of energy for another. If you want to switch to solar from national gas, you have to spend time and money to make the conversion. That makes it slower and harder for people to hop around to different energy substitutes in order to undercut high prices or chase bargains, so energy producers have less price-driven short term fluctuations in demand.

There\u2019s a ton of nuance I\u2019m glossing over, so don\u2019t take this as gospel.\n\nBonds are like a reverse loan, with simple interest at a fixed interest rate. Governments and companies issue bonds to raise easy money really quickly, with the promise that you can cash them in and make back your money plus interest at a later date. The money you can get out the other end is thus capped off. Bonds then gather value over time until they hit their promised value, and can eventually be cashed in. Until then, bonds can be traded similar to stocks.\n\nThe way it usually works is that if the economy slows, interest rates drop. More bonds tend to be issued in those times to make up for decreased revenue, or sometimes because that money can be invested and grown pretty effectively. People buy those bonds to ensure their money grows steadily, without the volatility of a stock market. Higher demand means comparatively higher prices.\n\nIf economic activity goes up, interest rates tend to go up too, and that tends to drop bond prices, so that the net effect is that you make ~roughly~ the same money on a bond. Nobody would buy bonds if prices didn\u2019t drop while interest rates are high \u2014 that would just be a dumb investment.\n\nSo, the overall effect is that the price of bonds goes up as interest rates go down, and vice versa.\n\nBiden\u2019s stimulus plan is expected to jumpstart the economy, but interest rates are going to stay low. This means that bonds are going to be in high demand because they\u2019re both profitable for investors while fewer of them need to be issued \u2014 less supply and more demand makes for higher prices.\n\nIt also means stocks are going to drop in value, because this kind of economic situation means a lot more money will be flowing through an economy. More money in circulation means it has less value per unit of currency. We call this inflation, and it\u2019s bad for profits on the short term. Even if your numbers are the same, $1 yesterday was worth more than $1 today, which means you\u2019re bringing in less value.\n\nThat\u2019s why when bond prices go up, stocks tend to dip. Everyone\u2019s betting on the same thing in different ways.

In all honesty, they themselves are not sure what's going to happen and are simply rolling the dice, hoping that the outcome will be in their favor so that they will be given astounding credit in the media just in the case the market does fall, which it won't.\n\nThe government is printing more money in a matter of days than it has in 10 YEARS.

I hate these analysts with every fiber of my being because they think that they can time the market, but they know deep inside, that they are wrong and are misguiding everyone. This can't be compared to the 2008 crisis because the fed and government are doing everything they can to support the ETFs by not only printing more money but also putting in policies to make this a fail-proof market. Why don't people understand that the government is printing money so that normal retails investors keep pumping money back into the market? This was all part of the corrupt government plan. The stimulus check is meant to save people who don't have jobs, but the government is literally giving it out to the people who DON'T need it. I know so many people who have enough wealth but still got the stimulus check. Guess where they put the check? INTO THE STOCK MARKET!!! The only way for the stock market to go is up. If you still don't believe me, keep waiting and missing out. This is the best and safest hedge against inflation.\n\nAs always, the poor people that don't invest NOW will be left out in the big game of investing and later on realize the grave mistake they put themselves in.

I believe the reasons for the recovery were because the government spent so much money trying to reel in the dive of the stock market by pumping money in. With federal interests rates as low as they are, it allowed companies to borrow money for very low rates and growth to continue. A lot of these tech startups have (likely) taken on large amounts of debt but don't currently have the earnings to match. Furthermore, due to many Americans (such as myself) having fewer expenditures, more money can be pushed into stocks. These issues compound to create very high valuations. \n\nIt's my belief that government support will continue with low interest rates and we can see this trend continue, but once the economy 're-opens', most of these companies are going to be worth more than they were before the economy closed to begin with. Once this happens, the government support is going to wane, interest rates are going to rise, and these companies that have taken on large amounts of debt are going to have the interest eat into their earnings. This is a more personal opinion, but I think that when the economy re-opens, many investors will see this as a great time to sell because there is the implicit assumption that the stocks prices will be at a high and many investors don't intend to hold the stocks long term (i.e. trying to cash in on the recovery and then close their positions).

I tried looking on ycharts briefly to see the timespan of their calculation, but I'm guessing the 12 month forward P/E is standard. I also was curious so I looked at how the forward P/E was calculated which was about as standard as I expected. But I think they use the current market price of the shares and divide it by the expected earnings per share in the future. So I want to say that those forward P/E ratios are accurate under the condition that the price of each share trades sideways while the company grows under the share, right?

Most houses with a 2 car garage and driveway, an area the size of 4 cars, can probably be deleted or replaced with 1 car uncovered driveway.  \n\nV2V and V2I communication, the next step after level 5, enables a host of other benefits.

I haven't thought too much about it and its really just been a gut feel.\n\nTo clarify: I'd only be fine with 10% margin at 1000/share once TSLA reaches hire profit (say $8b for a year) giving it a PE ratio of 125, and a really really freaking good 3-yr PEG ratio. While I think the intrinsic value of TSLA today is above 1000, the rest of the market doesn't really look that far into the future IMO, and could lead to a temporary dip in which I get margin called, until the p/e increases. \n\nSo for the margin curious:\n\nSo right now in my M1 account let's say I have \\~37 shares \\~= $25k. We'll label my portfolio value \\`p\\`. $5k of that portfolio was purchased via margin. My broker has an equity requirement of 40% for my TSLA shares meaning my margin (let's call this \\`m\\`) can never exceed 60% of my portfolio.\n\nso 5 > .6 \\* p yields if p < 8 (thousand) I get margin called.\n\nThus, I get \"maintenance called\" if my 37 shares drop to $8k, or 216/share. At that point I have 2-5 days to fund my account with more money to pay off my margin such that it drops below 60% of my portfolio.\n\nIf I don't fund my account, M1 will arbitrarily sell any items in my portfolio (which in this simplified example is all TSLA), to pay down some of my margin. If you bought for less than 216/share less than 12 months ago, this would suck for you because you'd get it taxed as income, rather than long-term capital gains. Alternatively it would suck bc if you would have never gotten margin called, TSLA could say, 4x in the next 6 months and be at 800+ share again.\n\nIf TSLA dropped to 108/share, my portfolio value would be $4k, but I'd still owe my broker $5k, meaning they'd sell my entire portfolio plus I'd still owe them $1k.\n\nSo in summary, at current prices, at a \\~67%ish drop I have to start liquidating some of my portfolio, and at an 83% drop my portfolio is completely annihilated.\n\nI'm fine with this, because technically I have enough cash on hand to cover my margin call. That cash is cash I'd rather keep for if I lose my job and have to pay rent etc. If I get margin called and lose my job it's back to couchsurfing.\n\nThe thing is the second you use margin you no longer become a long term investor and have to be accurate/lucky about your short term predictions, or else during just a 3-day downturn you can get margin called, which can wipe out your entire portfolio in risky scenario.

Also, the biggest issue I see is that this is not very sustainable.. once a company or individual buys a level 2 charger (as an example) it is going to last years and years.

They should far outlive any EVs.. and as such, once the infrastructure is established, the money is just not flowing in as fast.\n\nI mean, there could be some planned obsolescence or new models but what could really change?

Hedge funds were closing long positions to cover shorts. When other hedge funds saw that their holdings were going down, they also closed positions. Basically like dominoes. \n\n\nToday, after this second GME runup, there\u2019s two likely scenarios. First scenario is that the 10 year treasury yields are rising. Bonds/treasury = less risky than stocks. Higher yields = more money paid to the person holding the bond. So if some people (boomers) can hold a \u201cless risky\u201d asset like a bond, with an \u201cokay\u201d return then they\u2019ll choose that over the stocks they were previously holding. What\u2019s likely happening is that entities who hold stocks closed positions because of bond yields increasing. Which then causes a cascading of selling.

{"title": "They are trying to Margin Call Us.", "selftext": "I think that big hedge firms are cognizant of the fact that many of us use margin to invest - which is why they\u2019re liquidating their stocks en mass - to push the value of our accounts down as low as possible to make us liquidate so we don\u2019t get margin called. \n\n... Naive, on the their part, because this only makes us thirst for more blood. \n\nWe should try to target the stocks that they want. Maybe dividing them by sector, and mass purchasing. I do believe that American Airlines if you\u2019re a big holder of that as it was promoted in this thread will be liquidated tomorrow in a brutal way. \n\nNot only did they need to liquidate to cover their shorts for NOK AMC and GME - ** but I think GME is a diversion. \n\nBut I think they figured out that there\u2019s a lot of new investors Who don\u2019t have the liquidity to cover their margin in effect Destroying any and all competition that they had. Because they had an advance warning by being the cause of the crash they liquidated their stocks before everyone else had the chance to because they perform this after hours.\n\nThis is also why I think they crashed prices so steeply on Monday and only continued the downward decline harsher through the end of the week. \n\nTheir intent after - (and I do think that stocks are going to go down more) - Is to leave a bad taste in the mouth of as many new investors as possible, and to shake out anyone who is holding GME or NOK or AMC by virtue of needing the money.\n\nI think early to mid next week they will be buying back their shares at the rock-bottom price that they push the market to so in the end they are planning to be better off. If you have liquidity, I suggest you look at the stocks that you could never afford before, because I think they think they were stupid. In fact I know that they think that we\u2019re stupid. Which is a fair point, however we\u2019re so stupid that we don\u2019t care about money. So long as we have enough to eat.\n\nUnfortunate thing for hedgies is - their* cost-of-living is a hell of a lot higher than ours. I suggest anybody who does not hold AMC NOK GME. \n\nPay close attention, and let\u2019s figure out which stocks will be targeting next. There has to be a pattern to keep track of what they\u2019re doing, because they seem to be doing it in collaboration - which should be securities fraud but you know how this goes. Who holds the SEC responsible for securities fraud? No one. \n\n>American Airlines is going to take a steep dip tomorrow, I believe, along with every other airline as well. Again, the end goal being here to margin call as many people as possible who don\u2019t have liquidity. \n\n>>The SEC can suck my dick. I\u2019ve already lost 2k To Nokia in the last run but frankly I don\u2019t give a shit so long as they are* hurting.

We win this time no matter how much you try to put us in the red, scare us, bully us, or manipulate the market with the power that you have, we might be stupid apes, but apes together strong.\n\nAs for me, I doubled down on Nokia and AMC today I sold off some of my kriptoe (this is important pls don\u2019t flag) at a loss, so I\u2019m heated, but I wanted to preserve my real liquidity for when shit gets real next week.

Passed by proxy, on a holiday weekend, a bill was passed by a small group of uber wealthy men, the federal reserve we know today, that skyrocketed interest rates \n\n>> The government raised interest rates.\nIn August 1929 \u2013 just weeks before the stock market crashed \u2013 the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised the interest rate from 5 percent to 6 percent.\n\nEconomists and historians have long argued that Federal Reserve policy contributed to the crash. In 1928 and 1929, the Fed raised interest rates in an effort to limit securities speculation. Higher rates caused economic activity to slowdown in the US. The Fed's actions also had unintended global consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s not even an argument if that\u2019s what insinuated the crash in 1929. History repeats itself. \n\nWhat role did the Federal Reserve play in the Stock Market Crash 1929?\nIn 1929, New York repeatedly requested to raise its discount rate; the Board denied several of the requests. ... The Federal Reserve's rate increase had unintended consequences. Because of the international gold standard, the Fed's actions forced foreign central banks to raise their own interest rates. \n\nVery few profited from this, but it created the beginning of the insane wealth divide we still see today. The history of the federal reserve sounds boring.. I assure you.. it\u2019s the farthest thing from it.\n\nI think I think about fiat/federal reserve more than sex, tbh, a bit of an obsession for me. \n\nThis article is insufficient and dances around the point of it, but it touches on it in a general way and how regardless you agree with me on the history end \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.history.com/.amp/news/what-caused-the-stock-market-crash-of-1929", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">If anyone stops agreeing on its worth at any time.

{"title": "\u201cThe real moon play\u201d: Multi-faceted infinite squeeze cycle", "selftext": "Revised:\nI think I get it now. It\u2019s not one or the other squeeze. It\u2019s all of them together, driving each other. \n\nCongress just had them testify about round 1 but they don\u2019t even know round two is gonna bigger. They turned the issue into even more discussed worldwide news. That may not be the \u201ccatalyst\u201d but it is aerosolized fuel in an enclosed space ready for a spark. \n\nThe Armageddon, only statistically possible but completely unimaginable, scenario we\u2019re heading towards. We all know the shorts exceed the number of available shares and the original SHORT SQUEEZE thesis. But now we have the GAMMA SQUEEZE taking part. Retail figured out how to counter synthetic shorts by forcing institutions to honor call options. Every call option that has been written and is in the money MUST purchase shares in the open market even though THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SHARES IN EXISTENCE TO DO THAT. And not just the shares in the market. This would mean the entire share count held by hedges and clearing houses being transferred to retail and etf ownership through options being exercised. \n\nRetail countered the naked shorting in way that not only negates it but exponentially increases the squeeze process. \n\nIt\u2019ll be like using a market order to cover a short squeeze, gobbling up any share no matter the cost(remember the 5k snipe orders last time?), except at a market wide level- the entire float PLUS forced shares bought for ITM contracts. \n\nHow much can something cost when it doesn\u2019t exist but HAS to be bought?\nThe ultimate lesson in supply and demand. \n\nIt\u2019ll be like taking the strength of pliers and adding a hydraulic press. \n\nWe were all looking at it like round one. Over extended hedgie shorts vs retail holders forcing a cover. But the dynamic has evolved to a MULTI FACETED INFINITE SQUEEZE CYCLE.\nThis is \u201cthe moon\u201d play. This makes that AI suggestion of 130k a share make sense. I\u2019m not saying the AI is right necessarily in terms of price. I am saying it\u2019s gonna take a deeper look at what happens when institutions owe more than they can\u2019t deliver, and resulting price movement further exacerbates the original step. The machine takes information and EXTRAPOLATES. \n\nIt went to 5k when it was retail using available shares to force shorts to cover. How multiplied can it get when that happens again while institutions are forced to buy 100 share lots for contracts? \nThere won\u2019t be enough open shares on the market. They\u2019ll have to sell their own to the option holders just to honor them. They\u2019ll have to buy more from other brokers and clearing houses having the same problem. \n\nAnd all of this is compounded even further, because the higher this drives the stock the more option contracts are ITM, more forced buying and giving their own shares , more squeezes, more contracts ITM repeat repeat repeat repeat.\n\nThat\u2019s the important part. Not just the squeezes. The \u201ccycle\u201d. Because it\u2019s self perpetuating past a certain point, like a dying star reaching the critical mass it takes to become a black hole. \nI saw someone even mention that once and I didn\u2019t understand but they were right. \n\nIt would literally crash the stock market and effect all foreign markets involved. An upwards crash that sucks all capital from the largest players. \n\nI see people mentioning \u201crational thought\u201d or \u201crational behavior\u201d of the stock. \nBut it\u2019s not rational. Holding something beyond its suggest value breaks with the notion of rational value systems. It\u2019s mass irrational behavior to cause extreme hyperbolic stock movement. I feel like hyperbolic is the right word over parabolic?\n\nYou know how when you buy a call it technically has the potential for unlimited gain because the stock can theoretically go up infinitely? This is exactly that situation being played out on a grand scale.\n\nI think it\u2019s kind of amazing because this is the defining characteristic of using the the stock market instead of gold. It increases the amount of perceived wealth beyond the physical capabilities of the world. There\u2019s not enough gold or precious metals to equal the world economy. It\u2019s made up to represent something that can\u2019t exist but is necessary to facilitate the notion of unlimited growth. And now that very same principle may be inadvertently used to either destroy the system or force an evolution of financial theory. \n\nThe entire point of this idea is that the mechanics are being broken by players refusing to acknowledge parameters. They learned to cheat the system back at us the first time. \nShorts are creating shorts of shorts. They don\u2019t exist. They\u2019re making unlimited shares to maintain their position. So buyers are gonna do the same thing, but purposely do it in an arena that can\u2019t be expanded indefinitely. They can make up the shorts they borrow back and forth with each other(and through unknowing retail stock-lending program participants) but there are only so many real shares. They are inarguably finite by definition. \nCould they force a reverse split or  force dilution by issuing new shares against shareholders and the company\u2019s will? I  don\u2019t know. \n\nAll we have to do is hold. Hold on to your sense of wonder as the story plays out. \nHold to your courage. \n\nI\u2019m not a financial advisor and don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. I just like this stock and stories about the end of the world. \n\nI don\u2019t even care about the money that much. I just want to take control of my own life. \nI can\u2019t wait for us to read about this moment in history someday, and each think about what small parts we played and how we remember it. \n\nApes together strong", "id": "lst66i", "created_utc": 1614327491.0, "score": 845, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 182, "comments": [{"body": "Wife told me to sell.

(from a NEWBIE, for the NEWBIES)", "selftext": "*DISCLAIMER:*\n\n*1) I am NOT a professional investor, this post can be pure dumbshit, do your researches, never listen to apes.*\n\n*2) I am NOT a professional investor, as for the professionals PLEASE don't start \"oh, we're saying this stuff from weeks\", \"oh, were you asleep?\" and so on. This post is for the newbie and or for the confused one. You PRO's forget it.*\n\n**AND SO... WHAT'S THIS GME STUFF TODAY?**\n\nFirst thing first: don't want to start a flame but... please STOP with this \"WE\" are taking GME to the moon. \"WE\" are not even taking GME to MC Donald's. Market are for big investors, the \"whales\". The \"normal\" people, those who buy 1, 10, 50 shares, simply doesn't have the \"force\" to move substantially the price of this share. Look at the book, there are entities buying and selling MOTHERLOADS of shares, I mean MILLIONS of $$$ like peanuts. These are the ones moving the price, not US. \"WE\" can help this, indeed, following the \"thrust\" when some whales decide to move a stock high or to sink it.\n\nSo the point is trying to speculate for the next move of the BIG PLAYERS, in order to eat some crumbs. But don't get depressed, for ape-birds, crumbs are LIFE.\n\nOK, but wasn't GME dead? Weren't the hedge founds out?\n\nIMO it's not a matter of hedge founds and short selling, it's a matter of OPTIONS. (if you don't know how options works start from here [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) )\n\nToday February 26th, a lot of options expire, both calls and puts.\n\n**BUT**\n\nThere is a an imbalance towards the call ones, AKA there was a lot more of money in calls (so betting that GME would rise) than in puts (so betting GME would fall).\n\n**FACTS ENDING, SPECULATION STARTING**\n\nFebruary 23rd there was A HUGE selling in crypt0 currencies. I mean some people sold MILLIONS and MILLIONS and MILLIONS of crypt0s, in the middle of the greatest bull run of them all... STRANGE.\n\nThe very next day, someone, at 3:00 PM starts to resurrect an almost dead GME buying LOTS and LOTS of shares. Obviously, the one that have bought all these put options started to short GME in order to keep the price low, but NO: MR.X then places SHITLOAD of money and GME rises from $50 to $90 in just an hour. EVEN MORE STRANGE.\n\nI think that MR.X (that can or cannot be a single investor, maybe is a group of investors, maybe a whale, even a foreign country, who knows) decided to move all his crypt0 reserve in order to protect his huge investiment in GME calls.\n\n**SOUNDS GOOD.. GO ON!**\n\nNow, guess what... this night the crypt0 markets sank another time. Someone sold a LOT of coins... And today the option are expiring... do your math.\n\nI think that Mr.X will RISE GME today, at any cost.\n\n**OK, so GME to the MOON? ...but HOW far is the moon?**\n\nLet's look at the option chain: the big numbers (more than 10000 volume) are at these prices:\n\nCALLS: 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 800\n\nPUTS: 100, 50, 40\n\nThere are basically two forces: one that wants GME to stay OVER 150, better over 300, ideally over 800; one that wants GME to stay under 100, better under 50, ideally under 40.\n\n**NICE. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN TODAY?**\n\nWell, maybe nothing.\n\nBut if someone start SHARPLY to buy loads of GME, and you see the price going 150, 200, 250, I bet it will continue to buy in order to reach 300. Then if the market \"feels\" the momentum, maybe it could reach 400 or 500. It's very difficult but not impossible reaching 800. But over 800 today... I don't think it will really happen.\n\nOtherwhise, if GME sinks UNDER 100, it will remain there. There is a remote possibility that will go down to 50, maybe 40, but not less than that.\n\n**MY HEAD HURTS. IT'S ALL SO COMPLICATED.**\n\nAs a matter of fact, it is EXTREMELY more complicated and unpredictable. Don't forget that in the game there are also the short sellers and the market makers... so everything could happen.\n\nBy the way... today CAN be an interesting day for GME... or maybe not?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** *at 6:30 AM EST the premarket is only +8,85%. IF someone wants to climb it up to the BIG numbers, will start buying BIG just at the opening. Otherwise you could hope for a pre-closing rally to reach 200,250,300 but not more. That's because of market halts (LULD), if would be impossible to push it to let's say 800 in only a couple hours, that would (maybe) need a full day of market halts and restarts.*\n*at 11:00 AM EST is floating around 125. IMO there's no time to reach 800 today.

{"title": "Really long DD and Analysis! What happened yesterday explained in detail and exposing the HFs obvious manipulation.", "selftext": "Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4\n\n**9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22\n\n**1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572\n\n**2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31\n\n**3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787\n\nNOW THE ANALYSIS:\n\n**WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**\n\nSo, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.\n\n**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**\n\nNow it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb\n\n**WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**\n\nBecause bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b\n\n**WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**\n\nHedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.\n\nIN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).\n\nQuote: \" **Naked Short** \u2014 This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation \u2013 the lynchpin of this massive fraud.\n\nReturning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share \u2014 instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.

Most people who aren't retarded would take profits there, especially after what happened last time GME spiked like this. If I hadn't already sold my bags for slightly lower from the last dip I would have sold for sure to minimize my losses. I think anyone expecting this to moon again is not operating on hard data. This spike is an echo of the effects of the other spike.\n\nI expect today to follow the same pattern the Friday of the last spike did. It'll fluctuate up and down in the morning then crash slowly to a new low over the day. Followed by more declines Monday and more people holding the same bags as last time.\n\nHappy to be proven wrong but I don't see any numbers that are convincing.

Sometimes people create narratives to create value, however, if you learn the basics of the game, you can play without hurting yourself.\n\n5. Watch the clock. Human being are predictably in time like bills.\n\n6.

Gamestop DOESNT make sense right now.  that's never been the argument.  \"Ryan Cohen has the answers\" isnt a bet on gamestop, its a bet on Cohen, and that's exactly why that explanation is actually all they need to tell you in counter argument.  you either believe in him or not.\n\n>I think Ryan Cohen jumped onboard because he wanted to turn a <$20 company into a ~$50 company or higher. That's it. He was gonna do that by turning a physical retailer into an online retailer. That's it.\n\nand that's a fair opinion.  this could be it.  but that's a different argument than \"gamestop can't get bigger\".  that's an argument that you think Cohen had different goals than other people do, and that you think he's not as good as other people think.  that's a a valid counter argument to the people you're against, and fundamentally different than \"gamestop has issues that they can't fix to get bigger\".\n\n>I think Gamestop has been completely overblown as a long term business especially when people start talking about it in the >$100 mark or especially anywhere near the $1000 dollar mark which is completely bonkers.\n\ni mean, it has comapritively few shares on the market, 100 isnt ridiculous long term, its not trading billions of shares.  \n\nthe 1000 dollar mark has nothing to do witht he company though anyways so not sure how that's relevant.  that's about the squeeze, and not the company.\n\n>By the time Gamestop turns into an online retailer with any reputation, subscription based gaming services like Xbox Game Pass and Playstation now will be the norm.\n\nthat's an assumption, and an assumption that gamestop can't provide a better service.  we don't know either of those things yet.  you're making your bet, others are making theirs.\n\n>Nobody can seem to come up with any positive specualtion that I haven't already given decent views against earlier\n\nthey did, they just made an argument that ryan cohen himself is the positive speculation and you're not willing to accept that as a valid argument.\n\n>Gamestop in 2 years will be worth more than Tesla in its peak because otherwise that makes my decision to hold onto a stock I paid $400 for 3 weeks ago a bad idea and that just isn't acceptable.\n\n1.  this is a straw man, because you're inserting hypothetical scenarios of when someone bought GME stock to make your argument look better.\n2. youre comparing share prices when not all shares are created equal.  for one, tesla has nearly triple the amount of shares in existence than GME has.  so it's not a 1 to 1 comparison.  they can be valued the same share for share and GME still wouldn't come close to Tesla's \"worth\".\n\nif they had an equal number of shares you could make this argument, but they don't.  tesla being worth 1000 a share is a way bigger deal than GME being worth 1000 a share, because that's nearly three times the money invested into Tesla in that scenario.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5837633609771729}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6229105591773987}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08007735013961792}, {"body": "I don't really know either.

{"title": "The Post Earnings RKT Play - ROCKET TO THE MOON (Tendie Time)", "selftext": "**TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**\n\nYesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).\n\nRocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.\n\n**Next week, things start to change...**\n\nBut before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:\n\n1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion.\n2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists).\n3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**.\n4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended.\n5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.\n\n**So what happens next week?**\n\nFirstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.\n\nMore importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.\n\nEveryone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.\n\nWith all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.\n\nRocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!\n\nRKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.\n\nI am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.\n\n**I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**\n\n**RKT TO THE MOON!**\n\n[Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-q4-2020-earnings-call-tra/)\n\nEDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME. Just more reason to buy\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advise and should not be taken as such.

If that happens at expiration no one will buy your call contract and it becomes worthless.\n\nIn short you aren't on the hook for $30 x 100 shares because a call is a contract not the shares themselves. You can sell the contract itself or if you let it expire it becomes worthless and becomes $0.\n\nAnother example: In RKT I assume the price will break $30 in 2-3 weeks, so I bought 1 call option at $0.38 per share (so x100 that is $38 I paid) set to expire 3/19. Once the price of shares increases to $45, people now want this contract because it garuntees them the opportunity to buy 100x shares at the strike price of $30, which is under the new high price. \n\nThis starts to seem complicated I know, but put simply... If the price is at $45 and I have a contract that says \"you have the opportunity to buy 100x shares at $30\" that means someone could buy it and \"exercise the option\" meaning they decide to buy those 100x shares. Since they now own 100 shares at a price of $30 when the actual stock price is $45 they can now sell for a hefty profit. This evaluation is how call options increase in value as the stock price goes above your set strike price. In my actual case that means the call I bought which cost $38 is worth about $500-900ish.\n\nThat was only the upside tho. The downside is the closer you are to the set expiration date the less optimistic the market becomes of your contract being capable of making a profit if someone bought it from you. For this reason the longer you hold it the less valuable it becomes. Considering looking up some videos on what 'The Greeks' of call options mean.

If the stock is at $45 by March 19th for example and you don't exercise an option, does it expire worthless or?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great question, had to look into it a bit more to do it justice. The time frame is generally recommend to always have a buffer 2 weeks from when you think the stock will rise. To understand why that is, if you look at \"the Greeks\" the Theta value is the average rate decay per day until the expiration, generally it also accelerates as that date comes. \n\nMine for example was a Theta rate of -0.065 which means that $178 call loses 6.5 cents of value on average per day till my March 19th expiration date, which gets higher as that date comes. For this reason having less time can be beneficial because its a cheaper premium, but also risky because you could miss the rise in stock price. Literally anything can go wrong, there could be a power outage or the housing market could crash and fuck that stock rise. Less time for the price to rise again is also why the risky short time call is cheaper by comparison to long times.\n\nSo you're thinking, so why not just buy a call 9 months out right?\n\nSo all the Greeks are related, if you give your call plenty of time its going to cost a premium because its safer for you, less risk = less value given existing conditions. Why is that? because call options are generally sold to put or short buyers, so calls and shorts are related inversely. That means when there is high short interest there is low call prices because its expected to not move upwards and vice versa.\n\nAs for when to sale, a call is a bet saying essentially I bet that at this strike price of $30 is where the stock price will be within my time frame. The \"Delta\" of the Greeks tells you the average value per dollar increase you call is worth above the strike price (remember to multiply by 100 shares). Mine is something like 0.565 so for every 1 dollar above my strike my contract gains $56.50 of value. \n\nSo at $45 share price the price I paid rises 15x my Delta value because its $15 over my strike price. How does that create value? Because shorts/puts buy those calls and make the inverse bet that it will go down from that price. So that means my whole contract could gain a value of an additional $847.5 - (fees of course).\n\nAs for what value is good to sell at above the strike price thats a matter of how much risk you can take b/c if you are wrong or your timing is off you lose 100% the call value upon expiration unless you exercise it and buy the 100 shares. The idea is to sell your call contract at a high enough value, as soon as possible in order to get the highest return on it. Terms of in the money, or out of it refer to the current price of the stock and where your strike lands in relation to it. If its at or under the current price its in the money.\n\nGamble only what you are comfortable to lose because options are extremely risky and it can be quite difficult to actually make money using them as a beginner.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Very thorough explanation.

{"title": "Anyone feeling the stressed about GME see these charts", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[This is GME. This is your rocket ship. Its currently fueling up.](https://preview.redd.it/qfw3u6q2qvj61.png?width=3060&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3cd4bcec168e8a068a8de56d40633cb1de77c74)\n\nThis is a chart for GME, the price has been adjusted to scale logarithmically to make the trend easier to see and enable us to see all the data points at once. For all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go, the faster you go higher. This trend started in August. It will likely continue as long as Ryan Cohen and the folks he brought over do good work. Now lets address those large spikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[January Ape welcoming party, no despair here.](https://preview.redd.it/x7vxju4trvj61.png?width=3057&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed649938b25bcb7e461ba4ec794d56bbe72fa33)\n\nSee this, its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble (dont panic just breathe and read, if you're having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you.)\n\n[See](https://preview.redd.it/syvpt1m4tvj61.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e)\n\nSo a speculation bubble occurred, but why? What caused it and what does that mean going forward? Especially with the recent activity yesterday and today.\n\nFirstly I am not a financial advisor, and I don't give financial advice.\n\nSecondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy GME duh. News goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy, paper hands sell. Ok but that sounds really bad right? Again not necessarily. Bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months. One of the things that makes GME such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap. This important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations. In fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible, its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel. Imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on. the less water (available shares) the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes MAD MAX and you have all the water to yourself.\n\nso the speculation boils down to....is this the Squeeze? did it squouze? am i too late? So what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400. Well nothing the Price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before, all the while costing the shorts more and more interest, until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and you're wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now.\n\nAdditionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldn't really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch. those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves. OR they could lie to you, and double down. Historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money\n\nPersonally I don't think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own. I think that it will end in one of 3 ways.\n\n1 SEC will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away, and a scapegoat will be offered to the public\n\n2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and they'll go belly up\n\n3 the shorts are right and we're either too dumb or too distracted to out last them\n\nJust to be clear these are all short term endings. The long term end is basically Cohen and Friends save GAMESTOP and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse, or they don't. They got a pretty good track record though. I mean Chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what GAMESTOP is, don't get me wrong I love my dogs but I spend way more on video games each year than I do on pet food and supplies, and I don't think I'm the only one.\n\nOK, so that covers Jan but what about today and yesterday. Well yeah short answer is I'm not sure, but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype.
