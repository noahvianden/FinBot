Today I averaged down on my PLTR and $ARKG positions as well as adding a $AMD condor to my list. Also, I bought some $ACIC and $PRNT common stock. I went ahead and cut my $SBE as it was already not performing well; I'll look at getting back into it when the markets show signs of life. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Adding to Watchlist:** \n\n**$PRNT:** This is a 3-D printing ETF advised by Cathie Wood's team at Ark Invest. Over the past years the popularity and demand for 3-D printing has exponentially increased. If this one is not already on your watchlist, make sure it is. I'd suggest a long term position of holding common stock. I only bought 25 shares today, however I will be averaging in more if it drops. \n\n* Target Price: $55\n* Entry: <$35\n* Risk: 3\n* Timeframe: 3-5 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itfolhcp6ci61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba57ed0bb1f2dd2aa5c68c5a3ddabfecd14e552\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**$TSLA:** Tesla has dipped to interesting buying levels for myself. I already hold 100 shares that I sell covered calls on, but I'm thinking of increasing my exposure through either LEAPS or just buying $ARKK. Recently watching an interview with Cathie Woods, CEO of Ark Invest, increasing her position and it got me thinking. With the long range Model Y coming out soon, a possible Model 2 priced at $25,000 in the future, the Tesla autonomous semi's going to start rolling out, and the race for ridesharing and robotaxis I don't see any reason not to be bullish on Tesla. Once the $25,000 price point electric sedan does launch in China, the sales will be through the roof. Take it from someone that live in Shanghai for a decade - I see a Model 3 every 15 seconds drive by (it seems like). Not to mention that Tesla seems to be entering the Indian market as well and has just made $700M investing in $BTC. Again, all of these things put together and add up to a much higher $TSLA. I'm making a case for a $1350 EOY $TSLA.\n\n* Target Price: $1350\n* Entry: <$800\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 5-10 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ip3ofbhq6ci61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=e749327de8e34e59dfed9ecceec0fba45a25d2ac\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNote: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.", "id": "ln30jv", "created_utc": 1613697892.0, "score": 283, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 170, "comments": [{"body": "Churchill Capital is up over 500% in the last 3 months sitting at a market cap of 14.08B that is an insane surge.

I am sure you are trolling me but whatever. \n\nI knew so very many people at that time (housing collapse) who were completely wiped out at that time. The whole 2008 timeframe was very dark in so many ways. I kept silent about what I had personally done while I kept my powder dry and my gold stashed and did not rejoin the markets for awhile. Rented from 2006 until 2010. Bought my second house in 2010 and stayed out of the markets for the most part just concentrated on my job and paying off the mortgage.\n\nI did not have alot of cash when I started my financial journey but my first house really skyrocketed (sold for 3x over 6 yrs) and then the gold I bought in 2006 also tripled in value by the time I sold it in 2010 for the next down payment. I am now out of the miliitary and in my third house which is mostly paid and worth \\~1M. I have, since 2014, been more active in the financial markets but I have mostly been a fairly conservative value stock guy (AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, etc). Most buy and hold... not at all an options person.\n\nAll that changed in January with GME. I was a long time lurker in WSB ...  I am not a YOLO kind of trader but a pretty cautious and paranoid investor. So fine... anyways I had followed the GME thesis for quite a while on WSB. I could see the merit's to DFVs thesis but personally thought that it was a doomed plan. The deck is too stacked against retail investors vs the likes of Melvin and Citron and Citadel. The value play gave them, at best, a stock price of $15- 20. \n\nBut is was about the time that the stock price rose to about $30 that things got interesting and I had enough capital that I could lose a bit on that short squeeze play (not part of DFVs original thesis BTW). It was then quite apparent that Melvin and Citron were hurting very badly from reports in the media - the short squeeze was playing out! So I bought a couple hundred shares and watched that whole thing like a hawk. The short squeeze idea was breathtaking but again I was bit scared about what might happen in the markets. I was convinced that if this played out the financial markets could collapse. I decided to close my positions on all my other stocks and focus solely on this situation. \n\nAnd that collapse almost happened except for some (I believe) very criminal actions at the core of the markets infrastructure. When I saw what happened on 28 Jan I sold my shares soon thereafter. I am glad I did but firmly believe we could have witnessed that GME short squeeze actually destroy the whole system as it \"mooned\" into the 1000s (and the shares were actually repaid).\n\nSo here we are now in Feb... I got a nice little war chest of \"play money\" from the GME fiasco. I am in /r/options trying to get a better understanding of how options work for the next bit of my financial journey. I am not a sophisticated financial wizard, just someone who can think critically and work in ways to protect my best interests.\n\nBut at this point I am actually pretty optimistic about the mid term prospects for the financial markets. I don't believe the markets are about to collapse at this point... it has survived the events of Jan 28th (with a .50 cal round  whizzing right past it's figurative head). I am hopeful we can reform the infrastructure and adopt some new (i.e. blockchain) tech to reform the settling process. But sure there is \"froth\" and many people don't agree with the valuations of TSLA (as an example) but now I am actually quite hopeful, which is weird right?\n\nAnyways ... whatever, a long winded response that doesn't answer your question but I just felt like typing it out I guess.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "amzn", "msft", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3465868830680847}], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "To be fair, a lot of people were talking about a housing crash coming back then.\n\nDid they run a hedge fund and go to their broker and ask them to create a mechanism for them to short the housing market?

You are only protected up to the front month, so you have to close out the trade when that comes.\n2. The credit is cut down by quite a bit\n3. Capital requirements are still high\n\nSo it looks to me like the % on capital isn't so great.

I would say if the point of this is to mitigate risk on the bear call spread, you close out on the first month expiration.  So therefore:\n\n1. If the stock moves higher, I gain on month 1, lose on month 2, and theoretically because 1 is closer it should move more, and I profit at close\n2. If the stock moves lower, month 1 goes to zero, and I could theoretically close out with some portion of month 2 at a gain.  But I won't get the whole gain unless it moves far enough away, and IV remains low at the same time.\n\nAnyway, I'll try to look at what you've done/said above in more detail and try to see if there's something else I can be looking for.

{"title": "$HUT - A Safe Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunity Amidst Crazy Valuations - Hut8 Bull Thesis", "selftext": "**__$HUT - A Safe Bitcoin Arbitrage Opportunity Amidst Crazy Valuations - Hut8 Bull Thesis__**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' fellas, it's your resident ape gang professor Flux, here to lay down some knowledge. You may remember me from my AT&T short term bull thesis where I managed to call the pop on AT&T two days before it did, and helped a bunch of dudes \"risklessly\" bag upwards of 180%. This is my second attempt at writing DD, and I feel like I may have gotten a little lost in the sauce in this one, so I left midway TLDRs for people to read in case they don't really give a fuck about the nitty gritty. All that being said, buckle the fuck in, this is a long one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##__Introduction__\n\nI'm going to preface this by saying that I am *not* particularly fond of Bitcoin as a whole. I fuckin hate magic internet money. That being said, there are people who are way fuckin' smarter than me who are insanely bullish on it, and with major companies like Paypal, Tesla, and Apple starting to grab some, as well as major institutions like Blackrock starting to dabble in it, it would be stupid to ignore completely. For the time being, Bitcoin is here to stay, and although I despise it, I know that there's money to be made. Investor euphoria is at all time highs, with the price of mining companies rapidly outpacing and diverging from Bitcoin its self. After watching Riot Blockchain run up from a penny stock, to 3$, to 15$, to 30$, to now fucking 70$, you better believe I'm not passing up ***another*** opportunity to make some coin. If you want some exposure to Bitcoin in your portfolio, without paying fuckin' 70$ for $RIOT, you've come to the right place. Enter, Hut8.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__What is Bitcoin Mining?__**\n\nBefore we get started, I need to lay down a few key concepts. In layman's terms, Bitcoin Mining is the process of creating new Bitcoin by solving a computational puzzle. The result of Bitcoin mining is twofold. First, when computers solve these complex math problems on the blockchain, they produce new Bitcoin. Second, by solving computational math problems, Bitcoin miners make the Bitcoin payment network trustworthy and secure by verifying transaction information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo mine a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a [nonce] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce). This number is extremely difficult to get, and there's no easy way to cheese it ; Miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result. The brute force method is extremely time consuming and computationally expensive, as you are literally trying every combination out there to get the SINGLE one that works. \"C'mon Flux, How many combinations could there possibly be\", you ask? A fuckload. A mega shitton. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's estimated that the total hash rate of the entire Bitcoin network is currently sitting at roughly [151 million TH's](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate). That's 151 million, TRILLION nonces attempted, per SECOND. On average, the network ensures that it takes roughly 10 minutes to mine a block, so we can multiply 151 million trillion by 600 to get our answer. That's **9*10^22**, or **900000000000000000000000** different combinations attempted, to crack the block, grab your coin, and move onto the next one. And it's only getting *more* difficult. The network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks. The aim is to keep the mining times consistent at 1 block per 10 minutes. Therefore, if mining power is doubled, difficulty would also get doubled.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__Rise of the ASIC__**\n\nBack in the day, any schmuck could mine Bitcoin and turn a slight profit on their personal computer. With the insane increase in hashing power, you actually end up losing more money to electricity costs than you would make mining, by a factor of 10. This was largely in part, due to some real smart mfs inventing what is known as the ASIC miner.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Back in 2013, people started developing ASIC chips specifically designed to brute force the SHA-256 function, and find nonces. These chips are unbelievably good at what they do, with even a shitty chip being a factor of 100 times faster than your standard PC. ASIC miners are used by all Bitcoin mining operations, and it's important to know the costs, and overhead before we proceed. One final thing to note, is that Bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in Bitcoin. This is due to the \"lag\" that occurs while new Bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture this excess profit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNowadays, the average [top of the line ASIC miner](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A) can generate roughly 110 tera-hashes per second. That's 110 Trillion attempts at finding the nonce, *per second*.Top mining companies run a fuckload of these miners in tandem, to get a couple of thousand *peta-hashes* per seconds. For reference, one peta-hash is equal to 1000 tera-hashes, meaning that companies running at 1000 peta-hashes are actually running at one million tera hashes, per second. One million, trillion hashes per second. Fucking unreal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs far as we're concerned, at current day conditions, if you're mining at 1000pH/s, you're generating 4000 Bitcoins per year. Obviously, this is far from reality as global mining power will increase, but keep this number in mind, as it's important. 1000pH/s = 4000 coins mined in a year.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Midway TLDR :** Under current conditions, mining Bitcoin at a rate of 1000 peta-hashes will generate roughly 4000 Bitcoins per year. 4000 Bitcoin * $50,000 USD = $200,000,000\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# **__Calculating Growth and Profit Margins among Mining Companies__**\n\nNow that we've got some basic knowledge of how Bitcoin mining works, as well as the general profits we can expect from it, it's time to start crunching some raw numbers for each mining company. I will focus on the general profitability of each company, how many coins each company has the potential to mine in a given year, and how many coins does each company have on hand. In this DD, I will be providing analysis on three different mining companies; $RIOT, $MARA, and the secret dark horse, $HUT.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__$RIOT__**\n\nHas been around since July 2000 doing nothing relevant. It formally became Riot Blockchain in October 2017, and has been focused on its Bitcoin mining operations since. Riot Blockchain is now partnered with Coinmint LLC, from New York, who is responsible for operating the miners. They apparently get electricity for around $0.01/kWh, which is absurdly cheap.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [456 pH/s](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/RIOT-Q/pressreleases/974231/). Under current conditions, they are set to mine a little under 2000 Bitcoin this year. They are waiting on a shitload of new miners to come in, which will effectively raise their hashing power to 842 pH/s at some point in Q1, and then 1446 pH/s by the start of Q2. \n\n- In December 2020, when their stock price rocketed alongside Bitcoin, they took advantage of this and ran a [secondary offering which raised $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm). They used $35m of this money to pay for the new miners.\n\n- They hold 830 self-mined Bitcoins.\n\n- They currently have $150m in liquid assets (Cash + Bitcoin), due to the secondary offering.\n\n- $RIOT is trading at 78$ per share, with a market cap of 5.3 *billion* dollars\n\n- [Up 1800% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://imgur.com/VjQTaA3)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# **__$MARA__**\n\nThis company is kind of a fucking fiesta. It first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium when it was first founded in 2010, then changed its mind and started fucking with real estate in Southern California, and most recently, has started patent trolling. I have no idea *when* they started dabbling in Bitcoin, but in 2019 they ordered a shitload of miners, so we can only assume that's about the time they got into the mining business.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [258 pH/s](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MARA/pressreleases/1151711/). The did however, order new miners like RIOT did, and once those arrive, they'll be mining at a cool 688 pH/s. Under current speeds, they are projected to mine 1000 Bitcoin this year.\n\n- Similar to RIOT, they also did a [secondary offering in December, raising $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.html). With this money, they ordered even more miners.\n\n- Just last month, they ran ANOTHER secondary offering, and raised $300m. They used this money to purchase 4,800 Bitcoin at $31,000USD per coin.\n\n- As a result, MARA has 4800 Bitcoins held, fresh off the press.\n\n- Since then, they've made $90m off of their Bitcoin purchases, leaving them with roughly $240m in liquid assets.\n\n- $MARA is trading at 48$ per share, with a market cap of 4.5 *billion* dollars\n\n- [Up 1450% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://imgur.com/wwzoTn6)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__$HUT__**\nHut 8 is one of Canada's oldest and largest Bitcoin miners, providing value for investors through extremely low production costs, and appreciation of Bitcoin inventory. Their mining operation is self run and located in Alberta, allowing for significantly less overhead costs due to self management, cheaper energy, and colder climates.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Currently, the combined power of their entire mining operation is [**1073 pH/s**](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hut-8-mining-bitcoin-holdings-surpass-3-012-valued-at-186m-cad-804326405.html). This puts them ahead of most other mining operations by a landslide. Similar to the others, Hut 8 is looking to expand its' mining operation by adding more miners, bringing up their total hashrate to around [1500 pH/s](https://hut8mining.com/hut-8-finalizes-11-8-million-equipment-financing-loan-from-dcg-subsidiary-foundry).\n\n- Hut 8 holds 3000 self-mined Bitcoins on hand. 17% of their entire market cap is made up solely from the Bitcoin that they hold.\n\n- Out of the 3000 coins that they hold, 1000 of them are held in a Genesis savings account, generating a 4% yield, increasing their generated revenues from Bitcoin appreciation.\n\n- Currently possess $190m in liquid assets.\n\n- $HUT is trading around 9$ per share, with a market cap of 900 million dollars.\n\n- [Up around 500% compared to Bitcoin's 200% run](https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZOvgAju/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Midway TLDR #2 :** $HUT out performs $RIOT and $MARA in every metric, but is only trading at a market cap of $900m opposed to $5.3b and $4.5b respectively.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__So... What Gives?__**\n\nComparing Hut 8's raw numbers to Mara and Riot, it's a night and day difference. Hut 8 has an astronomically greater amount of hashing power compared to its' competitors, meaning that it generates more coins on a day to day basis. Furthermore, Hut 8 is also holding 3000 Bitcoins that it self-mined, allowing them to reap the rewards of the appreciating price of Bitcoin. Riot has less than one third that amount, and Mara has **bought** 4,800 of its' Bitcoins, meaning they literally paid (lost) money to acquire them. Furthermore, Hut 8 also has fewer expenses and a much healthier [balance sheet](https://hut8mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hut-8-FS-Q3-2020-v3.pdf) overall compared to its peers. Hut 8 mines faster, holds more, and is in a much better financial state than leaders in the industry. I believe that Hut 8 is **criminally** undervalued when compared to other companies in the same sector.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__Minor Factors Holding Hut 8 Back__**\n\nThere are simply two factors which I believe are holding Hut 8 back. The first of which, is the lack of publicity. Up until last week, I straight up didn't know Hut 8 even existed. Furthermore, I can guarantee you that until this post, *you* also didn't know that Hut 8 existed. Hell, the only two blockchain related tickers I knew of were $RIOT, and $MARA. Hut 8 is relatively unknown, and once the mainstream catches wind of it, it'll likely pop just as hard as its peers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe second setback, comes from the exchange Hut 8 is traded on, the TSE. Many investors don't care to look to, or don't have access to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. As a result, even if they wanted to trade on the TSE, they are limited. Hut 8 also happens to trade OTC, but those exchanges are even less popular than the TSE. Regardless, since many don't have access to the TSE, they can't buy in, even if they desperately wanted to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__Hut 8 Bull Thesis and the Ultimate Catalyst__**\nRegardless of the minimal downsides, **what we have here is an awesome financial arbitrage opportunity.** A company that substantially outperforms its peers is trading at a maximum of 20% of its competitors value. Hut 8 is an absolute steal right now. Furthermore, it also hasn't run yet. It's only increased around 450% in relation to Bitcoin's 200% rise. Its peers have run 2000% and 1450% respectively, meaning Hut 8 has lots of room for growth. Hut 8 also has a hidden catalyst which could help the stock truly explode.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that it is important for Hut 8 to get listed on  the Nasdaq. The difference in liquidity between US-listed $MARA and $RIOT vs $HUT is a staggering 100x. Numerous investors would be delighted to buy into the Hut 8 story but are currently unable to do so due to liquidity concerns. Nasdaq markets are much bigger and more liquid than that of the TSE, and listing on Nasdaq will open up the floodgates in regards to demand for the stock. In addition, listing on the Nasdaq will greatly enhance Hut 8\u2019s visibility and brand among US and international investors. A Nasdaq listing would be the ultimately catalyst for Hut 8, as more people would know about it, *and* more people would invest in it. There have been some rumblings and rumors about a Nasdaq uplisting for Hut 8, but  when asked, Hut 8 officials vehemently ignore all remarks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__Bitcoin Bear Thesis__**\nWe've come to the point in the DD where the music stops, and the rainbows fade. Sure, as undervalued as Hut 8 is compared to its' peers, we still need to remember, that we're talking about Bitcoin mining companies. These companies are fundamentally dogshit. You're literally paying the executive team of RIOT/MARA/HUT to buy an ASIC miner, plug it in, and sell any Bitcoin for you. That's fuckin' it. You could literally do what these guys do by yourself. You're literally paying a premium to indirectly get exposure to Bitcoin. Long term, and as far as future earnings go, this play is likely a loser. Unfortunately, the market doesn't care for the fundamentals, and we can exploit it. Bitcoin has passed $50k, and the narrative says that its going to $100k. It's all sunshine and rainbows.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRemember earlier in the article, when I said that as Bitcoin price goes up, mining becomes VERY profitable? As a result, there is, and always will be a rush to deploy more hardware. This is literally proven by the order book of the above companies. Remember 2017? When Bitcoin ran from 4,000 to 20,000 in a matter of months? The total overall hash-rate only increased by about 60%, compared to the 500% increase in the coin itself. Wonderful stuff. Can you guess what happened after? Hash-rate went up an astronomical [681%](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) over the course of the following months, decimating profit margins as new miners were produced and deployed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm not trying to sound all doom and gloom like the world is ending, but I also don't want any of you to get caught with your pants around your ankles.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**__Conclusion__**\nAlthough I dislike this sector with a passion, I enjoy making free money enough to look past it. Compared to its' peers, Hut 8 is criminally undervalued. It does everything its' competitors do, only better, and it does it all while maintaining a better balance sheet. Furthermore, the \"blockchain\" sector is on fucking fire, with retail euphoria, and institutional money flowing in like a river. This presents us with an incredibly unique financial arbitrage situation, similar to what the homie Warren Buffet used to do back in the 1600s or someshit. Buy Hut 8, hold it, and wait for the mainstream media to catch wind of it to cash in on your tendies. Make sure you have a solid exit strategy in place, cause when the music stops, it's gonna be a bloodbath.

I love you all, and I wish you all bountiful gains.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**TLDR**\n\n$HUT presents us with a minimal risk financial arbitrage opportunity. It is criminally undervalued compared to its peers, while doing everything its' competitors can do, but better. It currently trades on the TSE and OTC markets, but there's talks about it being uplisted to the NASDAQ, where it will explode in popularity and exposure, resulting in its price inflating to RIOT/MARA levels.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**__TLDR of TLDR :__** Buy $HUT on the TSE or $HUTMF on OTC markets. No, it doesn't have options. Yes, you can still count on a modest 400% return.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n ---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**__Sources__**\n\n\u2022 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce\n\n\u2022 https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate\n\n\u2022 https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/RIOT-Q/pressreleases/974231/\n\n\u2022 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm\n\n\u2022 https://imgur.com/VjQTaA3\n\n\u2022 https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/MARA/pressreleases/1151711/\n\n\u2022 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.htm\n\n\u2022 https://imgur.com/wwzoTn6\n\n\u2022 https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/hut-8-mining-bitcoin-holdings-surpass-3-012-valued-at-186m-cad-804326405.html\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/hut-8-finalizes-11-8-million-equipment-financing-loan-from-dcg-subsidiary-foundry\n\n\u2022 https://www.tradingview.com/x/8ZOvgAju/\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Hut-8-FS-Q3-2020-v3.pdf\n\n\u2022 https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty\n\n\u2022 https://hut8mining.com/", "id": "lnguxf", "created_utc": 1613744153.0, "score": 226, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "really well formatted post, I didn't read it, but it was really nicely made.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Haha, thanks man.

It's really not a very profitable business, and the reason I don't mine anymore is because by the time I buy a $5K ASIC and deploy it, it's already less profitable than calculations told me ... and before I make it 90 days, network difficulty skyrockets and before I make it one year I'm producing 1/64th of what I planned on mining when I spent the $ on the ASIC ... sometimes I wonder how *anyone* plans to stay profitable in it, lol, but apparently some big players do ...\n\nI'd also like to point out Hive Blockchain (HVBTF), another undervalued OTC miner stock ... what makes HVBTF special is that they mine both Bitcoin *and* Ethereum, which is the next blockchain revolution and price explosion just waiting to happen. Hive has actually managed to become profitable with positive EPS and still expand their hash-rate by over 30%, and they're mining loads of BTC and Ether.

{"title": "$T, the boomer dividend stock that might finally get moving", "selftext": "**TLDR**: this juicy mature wants to do a dance and i want to be her full-time owner and part-time lover\n\n# Introduction\n\nblah blah blah, at&t is a big old bitch:\n\n>AT&T Inc. is the world's largest telecommunications company, the largest provider of mobile telephone services, and the largest provider of fixed telephone services in the United States. Since June 14, 2018, it is also the parent company of WarnerMedia, making it the world's largest media and entertainment company in terms of revenue. As of 2020, AT&T was ranked 9 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations, with revenues of $181 billion.\n\n(I copied this from Wikipedia)\n\nBelieve it or not, AT&T (@\\~29/share at the moment) has something going for it at the moment. For starters, it's still about 25% below its January 2020 highs. Furthermore, the stock has good fundamentals and a bunch of strong potential short-term catalysts: there looks to be insider option buying activity, there's a few potential deals to be made, and lastly (perhaps most importantly) the options are cheap with a low IV. We'll start with the bear case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Bear case\n\nNone of the shit below comes to light and the big buys (assumed to be insiders) were looking for something else in this trade. Maybe  whatever caused this 4% increase this last week or so was enough for them and they've already exited.\n\nAlternatively, it turns out they didn't get nearly as much of the 5G bands as we would've hoped.\n\nAnother possibility is that the meme stocks fly again and people rotate out of safe stocks like AT&T in the short-term.\n\nNow for the bull case:\n\n## Pre-COVID days\n\nThis is a tech and entertainment stock that has yet to recover from COVID a year later \\[[chart](https://i.imgur.com/yPwJY6F.png)\\]. This is purely about price, but this year has not left them in bad shape, profit is down only about 16% since the final quarter of 2019. \\[[link](https://www.investors.com/research/att-stock-buy-now/)\\]\n\n## Fundamentals\n\nAs far I can see it, this stock has good fundamentals. $T has a **book value of about $22.69/share**, meanwhile the stock trades at about $29 a share\\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/t/key-statistics/)\\]. There is a fantastic built-in bottom on this stock.\n\nDisney (which is now priced like a tech stonk) only has about double the streaming customers that $T has and it trades at 297% of book \\[[link](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbo-max-subscriber-update)\\]\\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/dis/key-statistics/)\\]. That's all I've got for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Short-term catalysts\n\n## Potential Insider Trading\n\nI first came across this on [unusualwhales.com](http://unusualwhales.com/) last week, but /u/FluxRevived does a good job explaining the potential here \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ll6kne/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/)\\].\n\nTo summarize, there has recently been an insane amount of buying on OTM T calls \\[[link](https://i.imgur.com/jc2i7hw.png), **UPDATE (2/23):** there is a new whale from 2/18 for a 3/26 31.5C, see link\\], this doesn't just happen for no reason. Whoever is behind that trade likely knows something (I think something to do with the airwave auction) and I don't think it's the meager 3-4% gain we've seen since the order occurred. I could be completely wrong.\n\nCompare that activity to something like Intel \\[[link](https://i.imgur.com/pWFCgVw.png)\\], and you can see that it's much more divisive. Rarely do you see so many orders come through over a relatively long period with so little ambiguity.\n\n**UPDATE (2/28):** the new whales are a bit more divisive, but there is a call whale \\[[link](https://imgur.com/a/abC6ztp)\\] for October.\n\n## 5G Auction\n\nThe more I read about this, the more this makes sense. For those of you that don't know (I sure as shit didn't) there was a three month **81 billion dollar battle** **for 5G** airwaves that ended the day before yesterday \\[[link](https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107)\\].\n\nOut of the 81 billion spent, AT&T spent about 20 billion to Verizon's 35 billion (these are estimates)\\[[link](https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-secures-14-7b-loan-probably-for-c-band)\\], but there were 57 bidders \\[[link](https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107)\\] and 5,684 licenses won. T-Mobile doesn't seem to have bid beyond about 10 billion, but they are already ahead in terms of 5G coverage and roll-out (thanks to /u/Devilsbullet for this) \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lnhh8r/t_the_boomer_dividend_stock_that_might_finally/go1eatn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\].\n\nThis means that AT&T, along with Verizon, will likely get a lion's share of the 5G airwaves available at this auction. The winners will likely be announced on **Friday, February 26th** \\[[link](https://www.lightreading.com/the-edge/5g-in-us-will-get-lot-clearer-by-march-31---heres-why/a/d-id/767368)\\], and I have a sneaking suspicion that AT&T won a good chunk (see \"Potential Insider Trading\").\n\nThis is my favorite catalyst, and I think the most likely to cause a price increase in the short term.\n\n## Flight to quality\n\nFundamentals are boring \\[[link](https://twitter.com/simplejackcap/status/1341388555839528960?lang=en)\\] but the market is looking choppy and it's not unreasonable to think that during a choppy market there will be a flight to quality \\[[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight-to-quality)\\], and there is quality and safety in AT&T my dudes \\[[relevant clip](https://youtu.be/KSheZC9C__s?t=78) (at&t is alice)\\]\n\nDid I mention they have a 7% dividend \\[[link](https://www.investors.com/research/att-stock-buy-now/)\\]? Boomers fucking love that shit, they never fucking sell and there's a built-in bottom at 22.69 a share.\n\n## Streaming\n\nI didn't even know AT&T owned HBOMax before researching this shit but apparently they have some originals and they just came out with that Mortal Kombat stuff. I dunno, maybe they'll announce something that's actually cool soon? Potential catalyst here I guess. Their streaming service is actually decent, they have 37 million paying customers \\[[link](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbo-max-subscriber-update)\\], which is only about 60% less than Disney+'s 95 million.\n\n**UPDATE (2/23):** \"AT&T nears deal with TPG to sell large minority stake in DirecTV, U-verse at $15 billion valuation\" \\[[link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/att-nears-deal-with-tpg-to-sell-large-minority-stake-in-directv-u-verse.html)\\]. This deal has been talked about for a while now, they bought DirecTV for $49 billion and are now selling it at a loss. Still, it is good news that the deal is nearly almost completed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## AST SpaceMobile and Palantir\n\nAT&T wants to give you phone coverage from space. I don't really know what's going on here, this SpaceMobile shit is only going to start getting action in 2023 (aka: i dont give a shit) \\[[link](https://www.lightreading.com/ossbss/vodafone-atandt-sign-up-for-5g-via-spacemobiles-satellites/d/d-id/766194)\\], but there is a potential catalyst here, you can read more if you want \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ll6kne/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/)\\].\n\nAT&T definitely seems to be a customer of Palantir, but they didn't announce a full-on partnership on Palantir earnings. I'm skeptical of anything newsworthy coming out soon; still, there's some dd out there if you like \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ll6kne/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/)\\]\n\n## Online interest\n\nOnline interest is growing, there have been threads on the palantir subreddit \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/lhcy8p/att_is_100_a_customer_of_palantir/)\\], the options subreddit \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ll6kne/t_att_short_term_bull_thesis_insider_trading/)\\], smallstreetbets (you may have already seen it) \\[[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lhpoor/possible_insider_trading_on_att_dd_inside/gmzkcm1/)\\], and twitter \\[[link](https://mobile.twitter.com/nope_its_lily/status/1362148921082978312)\\]\\[[link](https://twitter.com/RedditTraderGuy/status/1359584827046043654)\\]\\[[link](https://twitter.com/ChartingOptions/status/1357053461347635203)\\]\\[[link](https://twitter.com/ChartingOptions/status/1358470986929160194)\\]. It doesn't really seem to be catching on (lmfao), but if online interest picks up we can see the IV (currently at about 25% for early March calls) really pick up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Options are cheap\n\nIV is low and the greeks are good, check out the options chain \\[[link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/T/options?date=1614902400)\\].\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## The end.\n\nThat's all I got for you guys.\n\n**FULL disclosure:** I bought some 3/5 30.5 calls earlier this week, and bought more yesterday.\n\n**my positions:** 3/5 30.5C\n\n**professional background in investing:** Non-existent. I bought a thicc book on options in sophomore year of high school (about 8 years ago) and thought I would be a market genius. I never got past page 15\n\nGood luck out there!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE (February 23):**\n\nI updated the album to reflect the new \"whale\" (large options order), the only new AT&T whale was a 3/26 31.5C (no put or bearish whales) from 2/18.\n\nThe big news from today is that AT&T are nearing a deal on a sale of a minority stake in DirecTV. The numbers aren't any better than were expected a month earlier, but the deal may be finalized this week (see \"Streaming\") which can be a strong bullish catalyst.\n\nWe are still waiting for the FCC to announce winners, which could be this week  (see \"5G Auction\").\n\nI'm currently holding and watching, added some more 3/5 calls during the dip.\n\n**UPDATE (February 24):**\n\nAT&T confirmed to have won the second most number of licenses \\[[link](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-370267A1.pdf)\\]. I think this is very good news but the stock has yet to react in AH. There is one more catalyst which I did not see coming, the sale of a stake in DirecTV, which should be finalized in the coming days \\[[link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/att-nears-deal-with-tpg-to-sell-large-minority-stake-in-directv-u-verse.html)\\].\n\n**UPDATE (February 28):**\n\nHey guys, I'm sorry to see the longer term performance of this play and I hope you guys didn't lose much or maybe took profits on the Monday. I think the drop in this stock is a byproduct of the broader market sell-off, I don't see the negative surprise in any of the news about 5G or DirecTV as the results were as good as expected.\n\nThere is analyst/investor day on 3/12 \\[[link](https://investors.att.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations)\\], I'm thinking of rolling my calls over to get exposure to that potential upside. There seems to be more discussion of AT&T online with the 5G auction and minority sale of DirecTV having been completed. I'm still hopeful, but cautiously so.\n\nWish you all the best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE (March 8):**\n\nWe're back! 3/12 looks to have been the correct expiry for this play. AT&T still has the investor day coming up, but has been hit with an SEC investigation \\[link:[https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316163/sec-att-nonpublic-information-analysts-beat-quarterly-estimates](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316163/sec-att-nonpublic-information-analysts-beat-quarterly-estimates)\\] which doesn't seem to be doing much at the moment. Things are looking good at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE (March 13):**\nAnalyst day went well! I hope you guys rolled your calls and sold some on Friday. If there's a dip on Monday I'm buying again, hoping for increased demand on the stock given their streaming and 5G rollout goals.\n\n\nGuys I fucked this up and I'm sorry, I never thought this trade would be such an L.", "id": "lnhh8r", "created_utc": 1613745801.0, "score": 232, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If AT&T came out with a good chunk of that spectrum, I think it would be a bullish as shit catalyst. The auction \"Makes 280 Megahertz of the 3.7-4.2 GHz Band Available for 5G Services While Relocating Existing Satellite Operations to the Upper Part of the Band\"\n\nLet me tell you about 3 GHz. So, most of your normal cell phone calling and some basic 3-4G happens on the 900 MHz range, which is what allows cell phones to work in a lot of non line of sight situations. The downside is you can't really get a ton of data through a lower frequency\n\nBasic physics rule of thumb with wireless is: the lower the frequency, the farther the range but lower capacity. The higher the frequency, the shorter the range but you can transmit far more data. This is because lower frequencies have physically larger wavelengths, which for the sake of argument makes it easier to \"go through\" things.\n\nWant to know why fiber optics are so fast? They transmit data via light waves that are measured in **Terahertz**, not basic ass Gigahertz. Now of course, you can't do that shit over the air which is why we use glass.\n\nLet me tell you some basic wireless nerd shit. Your home router is most likely broadcasting on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Download an app on your phone called WiFi Analyzer and walk around your house. You will notice the 2.4 GHz will have a farther range than the 5 GHz options. However, 2.4 GHz has much lower capacity than 5 GHz which is why your performance on a 5 GHz channel at home will be much better.\n\n2.4 GHz suffers A LOT from interference. Want to know why you pick up a million SSID's on your channel list? That's every god damn router, ring doorbell and IOT piece of shit near you sharing a tiny **80 MHz** of channel space. The 5 GHz is great for home use, but you are limited to like 20 non consecutive channels, which is fine for home purposes.\n\nWhat makes 3 GHz so awesome is that these cell carriers are bidding for **EXCLUSIVE** use of those frequencies, with **280 channels of that shit available AND they can transmit LOUDER than 2.4 GHz** (louder = range, channel width = speed) This means they can blow the horn of fuckin Gondor and NO ONE can broadcast on that same frequency without the FCC coming for your wallet. 3 GHz will allow cell carriers to blast fat ass channels huge distances from their towers, which means faster porn downloads. That's why this auction reached an absurd $80 billion\n\nThe results from the FCC auction are in a few days, and if they have picked up the 1st, 2nd or 3rd most amount of channel space, get ready for fuckin lift off (hopefully)\n\nEdit: It would also help to think of whatever they spent on this auction as an asset. If they spent $20 billion on spectrum, that is $20 billion they can offload to a buyer, which will most likely increase in value. You'll see a bunch of no names as winners in this auction and that is exactly why they bid: to sell future spectrum", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "This is one of the most useful comments I've seen on reddit.", "score": 24, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15065622329711914}, {"body": "We may have missed the opportunity...

Bond prices are inversely related to coupon rate. Rising coupon rates means falling bond prices, which means there's a sell off in bonds. The 10 year yields have been increasing from less than 1% at the beginning of the year to now 1.29% today. Now if people are selling off the bonds, wouldn't that mean they would need somewhere to park their money, i.e. in the stock market, making the stock market rise?  \n\n\nOr conversely, we could argue that bond yields are rising so more people will shift their money bonds because it's risk-free. So they take that money out of their stocks and buy bonds so stock market sells off and goes down. But more people buying bonds means bond prices go up, making yields go down, which defeats their purpose of moving the money out in the first place.\n\nHow to resolve this conundrum?  \n\n\nBONUS QUESTION:  How is the rate of inflation related to treasury yields and the stock market? I've heard that rising inflation is a threat to rising stock prices. But I don't understand why. Fed prints more money, no where for money to go, so it goes in to stocks. But Fed printing more money also means rising inflation.

It is not a zero sum case.\n\nIn reality, if the country goes worse and the bonds yield go up many people will opt for selling their stocks and will be afraid of buying the dip, further depressing the price of the stocks.\n\nIn 2008 in Europe much of the printed money went straight to high yield bonds of countries like Spain and Greece instead of reaching the real economy (aka people). So the countries saw themselves issuing more and more bonds at higher rates every time.\n\nRising inflation can be a risk to stocks because  to counter it you need to raise interest rates which has a negative effect in companies' debt.

Say that person owns that stock already (this is selling covered calls), their incentive to sell call options is that they get the money from the premium immediately (from the buyer of the call options), and if the stock doesn\u2019t go above 35+however much the premium cost, the options won\u2019t be exercised by the buyer because they\u2019d just be losing more money, and the seller of the call options just basically got free money from the premium. The downside of this would be if the stock went to say 50$, the seller would still have the money from the premium, but they\u2019d be forced to sell their stock at 35$ which is now way below market value and the buyer of the call options would be making money by getting a 50$ stock at a 35$ price + the premium they originally paid.\n\nI'm not covering everything here, but hopefully it's enough to get a general idea of what it is.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6791269183158875}, {"body": "Investopedia is a good source.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I read on investopedia which is where I do my research for other basics and I red the article on it about call options but I was still slightly confused.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Buying a call option is a contract (100 stocks) that gives you the right to buy a stock at the strike price. \n\nRight now I have NEPT $1 Call 05/21 so that means I have until 05/21 to exercise my calls or sell them. Because my call option is in the money ( above my strike price ) my contracts are increasing in value because NEPT is increasing in value. If it goes down I lose money. If the contract is not exercised or sold by the exp date it expires worthless. The greeks are too much to type out but they determine the pricing of call/put options. They are important so I would recommend studying those if you decide to get into options/puts. A put is just the opposite, a stock going down rather than up. You pay a premium and minus that is your profit. So I payed .80 x 100 = $80 per contract but it gives me the right to buy 100 NEPT at 1 dollar and sell it at market price (1.97 right now, however high it gets by 05/21 I'm hoping $4-6) if I choose to do so.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Is selling a call a for sure thing?

Of course, if it starts dropping i can end up losing a good chunk. When your exp date comes closer you can decide to sell your call or exercise and buy the stock at your strike price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSelling Calls/Puts is different but less risky (I mean selling from the start, not buying and then selling at higher price). When you sell a call you collect premium from the buyer and will make money if the price goes down because the buyer will not exercise out of the money and you will keep collecting premium, If they do exercise then you will need to sell those shares to the buyer at the strike price. Selling a put is the same but reversed, you sell puts if you think the stock will go up.

It could be 0% one year and then 20% the next (that specific situation isn't likely because the average is over decades rather than two years, but the concept is the same).\n\n\nTo answer your questions, Let's assume a year when an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 returns 10%. Let's also assume your capital gains are long term (January 1st to January 1st the next year) and that you have no other income. In that case, your federal long term capital gains tax rate is 15%.

Note I'm not assuming marginal tax rates here because I'm too tired to do that math lol.\n\n\nSo, your before tax gain needs to be about $126,000 to have $100k after tax ($126,000 * .795 = $100,170, I'm rounding the 6.57% to 6.50% in this example). Assuming a 10% return that year, you would need to have invested $1,260,000 to get $126k in gains ($1.26M * 1.1 = $1.386M, minus initial investment of $1.26M is $126k).", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So if you're just doing one lump sum investment, you'll naturally lose shares (but keep the same dollar amount in this hypothetical example) because you're not buying anymore.

{"title": "(2/19) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss\n\n> * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.\n\n> * B/itcoin \u2014 which topped $52,000 this week \u2014 hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world\u2019s biggest c/ryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes b/itcoin is a \u201chighly speculative asset.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus\n\n> * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. \u201cThe price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,\u201d she said.\u201d We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.\u201d Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid\n\n> * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.\n\n> * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer\u2019s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK\u2019s top court rules drivers are workers\n\n> * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company\u2019s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an \u201cagency\u201d that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers\u2019 status as independent contractors, not employees.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice\n\n> * During Thursday\u2019s GameStop hearing, Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about \u201cpayment for order flow,\u201d a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them.

It's your choice to buy a risky investment and please  be prepared to see some losses along the way.\n\nGME  created a huge inflow of people to stock market subreddits and I am  tired of scrolling through thousands of posts asking about market  bubble, market correction.

Please be  weary about the other side of your trades - there are people taking huge  profits - if we will have a lot of them in a span of 10-15-30-120 days  we might see a market correction.\n\nIf  you are new to investing buying a stock feels like a very intimate  moment, sadly, a lot of people already own/owned that stock.\n\nIf  you want safety sell your positions and buy ETFs (stable all world,  maybe S&P), maybe go for a dividend stock like T. If you can't  handle your emotions make your portfolio all cash and trade on a paper  account.\n\nAnd for the love of god  don't call yourself a \"long term investor\" because you are bag holding a  20% loss. It might never come back, may come back tommorow, maybe in 7  years? You never know.

You can sell an option to hedge against risk (or buy a put) whereas with common stock it can go to zero or close to it. If you want more time to be right, just buy more time to be right. Options are just an instrument and it's foolish to say they're risky just because a bunch of fucking morons on reddit buy stupid options at stupid times. At the money, long dated call options on solid, well managed companies don't expire worthless \"most of the time\" and you clearly don't understand options if you think most options traders are holding them until expiry.

For example, there's tons of \"meme\" stocks that just don't make any sense or there are a ton of new investors that are plugging money into placeholder economies.\n\nSince $GME, there's just a ton of low quality posts in all investing subreddits. For example, I'm really like Palantir. However, that subreddit is now a bunch of rockets and diamond hands. I don't think people understand the tech, they're just into it because they think it'll get them omega rich (I don't think it'll hit stratosphere levels, but I think it's a good 5-10 year play).\n\nAll of this to say, I have no clue what happened yesterday, but there's just a ton of hysteria in general, which is just what happens when you have a big run up like this. That being said, it's important to ground yourself on the fundamentals. For example, when you look at the S&P500, it was down maybe -1% to -2%. If you look at the historical chart for the past 20 years, this run up is incredible and a bounce of -1% or -2% is mostly just normal market noise/movement. \n\nMore important is to have a strategy and to execute on it. That begins with understanding what your goals are, what your time horizons are, and planning for bumps along the road. Then, when you look at a stock you have to understand why you like some random stock. Is it the business or do you think it's mispriced relative to the market? What are the levers that you would look into to develop a basic thesis so that you can understand when it is time to buy or sell? These might sound complicated and it can be but this will at least give you some grounding for how to execute.\n\nYou also need to remember that it is practically impossible for a single retail investor to outperform the markets over the long-term.

{"title": "NEW TRADERS: The internet is loaded with bad advice on buying individual stocks\u2014your core portfolio should be built on old principles", "selftext": "All I see in Reddit, Twitter, and social media is bad advice for the flood of new traders getting into the market right now. For every random post you see of someone claiming to have made a fortune on an individual stock, there are 40 people who tried and failed, and just didn\u2019t post about it.\n\nMost new traders see that the market is raging and think they can jump into investing and become rich in 3 months by just buying and selling off an initial $5k investment a few times. Here\u2019s the reality: proper investing takes time (patience), discipline (holding), and work (research). For 90%+ of people, your best strategy is in ETFs.\n\nFor 100% of people, your best strategy is putting the core of your portfolio in ETFs. Your investments in individual stocks should ONLY be a supplement\u2014ie buying high conviction, high upside plays that won\u2019t damage your portfolio\u2019s stability if you lose. The number of people out there who seem to think a portfolio with 50% PLTR is a legitimate investment strategy is extremely alarming, and they are going to end up losing a lot of money. Maybe not on that stock, but on one of them as they continue down that path.\n\nIf you want to invest, you should take the time to read John Bogle\u2019s \u201clittle book of common sense investing\u201d to understand why ETFs always beat 90%+ of investment strategies. Also everyone should read Benjamin Graham\u2019s \u201cIntelligent Investor\u201d. If you don\u2019t have time, why would you think you have time to invest?\n\nThe distilled version is that the market always broadly goes up in the long term, buying and holding a diversified s&p500 ETF with very low fees (like VOO) is the surest way to guarantee your fair share of returns. Almost everyone on this sub would have better returns over 30 years if they did nothing but that. But of course, that isn\u2019t fun for people.\n\nBut know this\u2014the market will come down from here. It is trading well above value. If your money is disproportionately in individual stocks, you have no guarantee of it coming back.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to investing out at least 90% of your money in VOO and leave it alone. Forever. The rest you can take shots at individual stocks with. When you add money to your portfolio, add at least 50% to VOO and then with the left over you can buy individual stocks. Do this for AT LEAST a year, but 3 would be better.\n\nIf you\u2019re experienced you don\u2019t need me to tell you this but 60% of yours portfolio should still be in ETFs.\n\nGood luck out there. I don\u2019t know when it will come down, but it will.\n\nEDIT: after some people calling me a \u201cboomer\u201d and questioning my selection, I\u2019ll provide disclosures. It\u2019s true that I do not own only ETFs. But I have been investing for a lot while.

Additionally, while there are no concrete figures to confirm this it seems logical to assume that figure might reach as high as 90% if we extend this to businesses over a) a 15 years period and b) included any business as a 'failure' which couldn't return 10.9% ROI per year (S&P 500 index avg).\n\nYet, few would say 'don't open a business - it's bound to fail.' One in ten isn't great odds, but honestly every time I've applied for a job it's been me against a hundred applicants if not more.

I will likely change based on my views of the future, but right now its working.\n\n As my core increases i increase the size of my short pool of money. ETFs make up my core (SPYG, ARKK, ARKG, ICLN) REITs are my 2nd line of long plays. I am running a theory that REIT's have not recovered and there will likely be a boom for em pretty soon. Democrats arent very likely to put people out of the street and even if they do REIT's would pick up the cheap real estate.

For whatever reason, he did not think it was a good idea to mix the two and the greatest results would be achieved by sticking to one or the other.\n\n* The defensive investor -  someone who spends a minimum of time analyzing stocks and wishes to be as safe with their investing as possible. They should invest primarily in index funds (and by extension the ETFs of today).\n\n* The active investor -  someone who takes the time and effort to identify high value stocks that have the potential to give good returns over the long haul. This is for people who are willing to take the higher risk for higher reward. Pick 30-40 stocks to actively work with.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGraham also had a lot of rules for investing that would apply to both methods.\n\n* Diversification - In terms of keeping some amount of your assets in cash, bonds, stocks etc. He suggested a range of 30-70% between stocks and cash/bonds, depending on the risk you personally are willing to take on. \n\n* Diversification - In terms of spreading your investments across different industries/countries etc. to protect against unexpected drops in a single industry or sector.\n\n* Cost averaging - the act of investing your money in smaller increments over time instead of in one large chunk. Whether defensive or active, he was not concerned about the market trends of bull/bear or crashes on a day to day basis. If you invest a small amount each month, you will average out large highs and low lows. If there is a crash, he suggested you might even invest more at that time, because stocks will be \"on sale\" or offered at a discount. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor active investors, he had a laundry list of guidelines for finding value based stocks. Some of those rules dont apply today, but many still do. (Im just going off memory here, some might be off and Im definitely missing some, but you get the idea).\n\n* The stock price should be less than 2/3 the book value. \n\n* The company should have no debt. \n\n* The company should provide a dividend (evidence of a healthy company).\n\n* The company should have reliable earnings over the past 5 years.\n\n* The P/E ratio should be lower than the market average by some degree. \n\n* The stock must not be popular on Wallstreet (and by todays metrics, probably not popular on Reddit or other social media). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nGraham thought that such an approach would give you the best chances for a slow and steady return over the years. I do think it is interesting that things like PLTR would not be a recommended buy from Graham because it is too popular. Such popularity makes the stock volatile, which can lead to unpredictable gains/losses. \n\nI think you are right in that there are a lot of new investors recently (hey, me too), but the key for people who want to succeed is to learn what type of investor they are (or even if they are speculators) and employ an investment plan that fits their goals, mental status, patience, and other factors.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "If I had the coins I would give this an award.

If you had anything legimate to say it would be against these points because these points are WHY the stock is going to go up, may not be today, may not be tomorrow, may not be the end of the quarter. The point is when its low is when you buy unless you want to go full blown smooth brain then you can buy high and sell low like most of us and post that sweet sweet loss porn which is what this subredit is all about...risky investments...\n\nYou want investment advice go to r/investing.

They are \u201cmanufacturing printed electronics\u201d that are considered crucial in aerospace, defense, medicine, automotive, and research industries. \n\nI\u2019m currently m1 in medical school and here\u2019s what they say that caught my eye:\n\n\u201c3D printing is already transforming the healthcare industry, from additive manufacturing of medical devices to producing functional pre-clinical parts. The technology is enabling rapid medical advancements and paving the way for new applications. \n\nUsing Nano Dimension\u2019s DragonFly\u2122 System, medical device manufacturers can now 3D print embedded sensors, multi-layer PCBs and miniaturized modules with conductive components and complex geometries, for a variety of applications in the medical device industry such as microfluidics and non-invasive sensors. With the DragonFly\u2122 System\u2019s groundbreaking ability to simultaneously 3D print both dielectric polymer and conductive metal traces at high precision levels, designers can fully utilize their creativity to design surgical and training tools with irregular geometries. Groundbreaking new designs for medical tools can be pioneered, with the virtually limitless design freedom afforded by the DragonFly\u2122 System. Contact us to discover how 3D printed electronics can be leveraged to overcome challenges in medical device innovation.\u201d\n\nThose who were born to change medicine as we know it can now use their knowledge to literally \u201cDESIGN SURGICAL TOOLS WITH IRREGULAR GEOMETRIES.\u201dRemember earlier I said these boards can be flexible?? Not only are they flexible as hell but they can be thin as hell too measuring in at minimum 30 microns. \n\nI\u2019ll say it again 30 MICRONS as in 30 MICROMETERS as in 0.00118 INCHES. A width of human hair measures anywhere between 17-180 microns. These boards can be as thin as a strand of fucking hair. Imagine how much freedom you can have building a tool or device with a circuit board where you can decide how wide it is. Or how long it is. Or how it\u2019s shaped. Or how many layers it has. Oh yeah I forgot to  mention that you can interweave the circuitry between these layers of boards. THAT\u2019S RIGHT YOU CAN INTERWEAVE THE CIRCUITRY BETWEEN THE LAYERS. \n\nSurgery and medicine in general is going to become even more non-invasive with the presence of tools that are completely unique for the job. \n\nCreatives in medicine will be able to solve problems that were not solvable before. Current problems can be mitigated or improved. \n\n...FOR example Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a type of therapy for those who deal with Parkinson\u2019s, seizures, tremors, and compulsions as of now. It\u2019s currently being studied for other potential treatments. As a B.S. in Neuroscience I know two organs that rely heavily on electricity is your heart and your brain. The potential for DBS to treat other ailments is definitely possible. With that in mind, DBS is VERY invasive and it involves implanting a massive electrode into the center of your brain in order to reach the sub-thalamic nucleus (important in Parkinson\u2019s). Then once you\u2019ve outlived the potential of surgery going wrong resulting in brain hemmorage, infection, possible altered mental status, etc, then you\u2019ve gotta walk around with this massive neuro stimulator attached to your chest at all times in case you need to activate it at any given moment. \n\nWith NNDM\u2019s technology, this surgery could be COMPLETELY different. Maybe we won\u2019t need a massive electrode in the center of your brain. We could find a way to surpass the rod-shaped electrode and 3D print a smaller, thinner one that can can directly attach to the sub thalamus. That massive Neuro stimulator could be half the size thanks to NNDM\u2019s stackable circuitry. Maybe we\u2019ll even find a way to 3D print a tool that would remove the idea of opening up someone\u2019s skull for neurosurgery completely off the table. Guys this is just ONE example and there are a million and then some. \n\nNNDM states that their printing system has 3 key advantages: \n\n1. Reduce time to market and optimize design for medical devices, biomedical sensors and in-vivo (inside living organism) applications.\n\n2. Keep your IP in your lab with the DragonFly LDM System and save time by eliminating the need for involving external parties. (This means you can have immediate access to solutions by creating tools when you need them and ONLY need to be approved by whoever owns the machine e.g., hospital board of directors)\n\n3. Foster digitalization in healthcare, consumerization, real time interactions with smart sensor and 5G technology.\n\nHell man, your dentist is gonna be able to 3D print tools that can make cleaning your teeth easier for them but they\u2019ll still blame your bleeding gums on not flossing enough ;) \n\nKeep in mind, I am an IDIOT and I don\u2019t know shit. But from what I do know, NNDM is gonna make me rich one day. I haven\u2019t even scratched the surface on their reach. I only talked about medicine. I didn\u2019t even do a good job explaining that and there\u2019s a shit ton more in medicine that I obviously missed. These fuckers are in aerospace, research, defense, automotive, all shit I have 0 clue about. \n\nIf you know anything about electronics in your specific field then I\u2019m sure you can think of many ways in which this can be implemented. I recommend taking a read on their website they have some interesting stuff to look forward to if everything goes well for them. \n\nNNDM IMO is a fantastic pick, but VERY long term hold. Biggest downfall is creating software that is compatible with 3D printed circuitry. A bunch of Ivy League researchers put out an article practically demanding that this type of technology gets studied and invested into more.\n\ndisclosures: 2060 shares @ 4.85 holding since November 2020 and I\u2019m buying as much as I can until it hits $20 and we\u2019ll see what happens news-wise and potential catalysts.\n\np.s. if you have a hard-on for Cathie WOOD, ARKQ has 7,524,877 shares in its holdings (2.49% of ARKQ).", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
