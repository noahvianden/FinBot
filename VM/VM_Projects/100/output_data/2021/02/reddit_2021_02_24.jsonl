Treatment is usually mainly enhanced training in speech, communication, self care, social skills, etc. - it can help a lot, and the sooner started the better. Some people may have additional conditions, require medication (but a large number do not need medication). \n\nThere's a lot of free help available, including through public schools for school age kids. The goal is to get the kids as functional and independent as possible, and reputable services will back off on the intensity of training on skills that the kid masters and maybe encourage new skills. There are lots of weird diagnoses and treatments that hopeful / in denial / desperate parents are attracted to - don't know whether any of them might help, but obviously any really effective treatment would be in the headlines over a period of time. \n\nWeird story - I had a coworker who was visited at the office by a friend - friend said his son had Asperger's (now considered part of the spectrum) - coworker gave his friend a really hard time, insisted that the kid didn't have Asperger's, even though he had never met the kid and hadn't heard the symptoms. Be cautious of advice from others - you know the kid better than others, and if you have a concern it may be worth checking to see what kind of testing is available (and look for references on the reputability of the testing).\n\nEvery kid is different, so what happened with one kid doesn't necessarily predict what will happen with another kid, but in general a high percentage of people show improvement, especially with training, and a kid with better communication, better behavior, better connection to the world, better emotional attachment to family, etc. is a goal worth trying for. Some people (but not all) can even get to the point where they can function well in the outside world, especially now that some employers realize that they can benefit from special skill sets that some people may have. SMR claims to have Asperger's - if true, he seems to be doing pretty well with it. Elon says many people think he's on the spectrum - if so, it probably gives him skills that are useful for what he does. Skills often associated with being on the spectrum can include ability to focus with incredible intensity on a problem, and learning everything there is to know about one or more subjects - useful in specific jobs.\n\nAlso important for parents to engage with their kids - talk with them, explain things, show them things, maybe activities - not just come home from work and rush over to the social media. Kids on the spectrum have a tendency to stay in their own internal world - it may take a little more effort to draw them out and spend more of their time interacting with the world around them. There are plenty of references on how to live with someone on the spectrum - basically be part of their life, let them know there are things they are supposed to do, don't be mean to them, praise them when they get things right, etc.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.012103776447474957}, {"body": "I would not assume.

{"title": "$PLTR Extensive DD Part 2: What Makes it Disruptive/Valuation", "selftext": "Yesterday I posted a lengthy DD on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), where I went in-depth on my evaluation of the firm's history, its financials, and why I believe the naysayers are wrong (Link included here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i\\_think\\_pltr\\_is\\_invincible\\_rn\\_and\\_in\\_the\\_long\\_run/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq8rw4/i_think_pltr_is_invincible_rn_and_in_the_long_run/) )-i do recommend reading this first, this post is meant to be a follow-up/supplement to my liking of this stock.\n\nBut I wanted to go more in-depth into just why I find this company so special and unique. As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we'll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).\n\nWhat is truly unique about Palantir's software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir's software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company's clients' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir's cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.\n\nNow, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov't). But I think what boomers don't understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.\n\nLet me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest's large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla's performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn't have access to trial data on say, congested roads.\n\nBack to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR's revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company's growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir's clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn't talk up Palantir's greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!\n\nThe reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir's platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.\n\nThis gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? \n\nLet's start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn't *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn't add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett's whole commitment to \"value.\"\n\n[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the \"gold standard\" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don't even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.\n\nAnd while we're at it, let's talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I'll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we'll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That's fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn't understand technology).\n\nSince the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let's talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. \n\nIf you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.\n\nI also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don't know what that means, basically PLTR didn't have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).\n\nAnd this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren't oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).\n\nThis is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday's DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.\n\n\\*\\***This is not financial advice. I recommend you read up on PLTR, pour through its financials, and hear more from its CEO, Alex Karp, and Chairman, Peter Thiel- then make your own informed, balanced, intelligent, rational decision. Without a doubt, this will be** ***the*** **company being discussed in the decades to come, and I just want to expedite the conversation now.**", "id": "lr1l80", "created_utc": 1614134576.0, "score": 417, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "I agree with everything you said and am entirely bullish and long PLTR.

You might think, okay their AISC is 1200 so with gold at 1800 they make 600/oz....if gold goes to 2400 you may think \"okay their profits have now doubled\"....but they wont because they hedged at 1850 or less.

I just like silver's asymmetry more. There was a time to be in the majors and that was 2019 when gold broke out above 1350 and silver was doing nothing. The majors tend to lead because they were profitable at 1350, so 1500 is all just extra money. After that, if the uptrend is confirmed then the juniors tend to get revalued.\n\nLets say you have two miners, one has AISC of 1000 and the other 1400 and gold is at 1200.  And then gold goes to 1400 So the first one has its profits double and the second is now just breaking even, and gets a small revaluation based on the value of its ounces in the ground. Now another 100 dollar increase doesnt mean nothing for the first miner, but its trivial in comparison to the second.\n\nAn example of these would be Kirkland Lake as the first miner and Hecla as the second. By all accounts Hecla was in far worse shape than Kirkland and from a trad value perpective uninvestible. But the point is that the share price reflected their unprofitablity *at that time*, not the future value of their production when the thing that they make goes up. And it played out exactly that way, Kirkland is down from 2019 and Hecla almost tripled. \n\nI hope thats clear", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "IF YOU'RE GOING TO FILIBUSTER, YOU SHOULD RUN FOR SENATE!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

See section of Vroom\u2019s 10Q below:\n\n*Paragraph in VRM 10Q: \u201cOn May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, \u201cRocket\u201d) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the \u201cRocket Auto\u201d brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the \u201cRA Agreement\u201d). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company\u2019s inventory will be conducted through the Company\u2019s platform.* ***Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021*** *and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement.* ***The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period*** *based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.\u201d*\n\nAs you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter\u2026and **what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday\u2019s earnings report?** A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don\u2019t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted.\n\nI do think Rocket will acquire Vroom \u2013 why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn\u2019t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it\u2019s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly.\n\n**Why is used car sales good for Rocket?**\n\nBecause Data, Data, Data.\n\nRocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans\n\nRocket can very easily have access to half of America\u2019s homeowners credit reports by 2030 \u2013 The jackpot of consumer data.\n\nWhat does a credit report tell you? **It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off.** This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform.\n\nLook at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana\u2019s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket\u2019s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket\u2019s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus \u2013 to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world\u2019s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate.\n\nRocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes **1 million decisions per day** and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions.\n\nNot to mention, ***Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales***\\*\\*.\\*\\* We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep \u2013 and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana\u2019s presence.\n\n**Rocket Homes:**\n\n*WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW:*\n\nDear smooth brain, please download \u201cRocket Homes\u201d on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won\u2019t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes.\n\nI would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket\u2019s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial).\n\nNot going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B \u2013 A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET\u2019s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED.\n\n**Rocket\u2019s expansion internationally:**\n\nRocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B.\n\nWe love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country.\n\nRocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket\u2019s Lendesk fits the Bill.\n\nUnfortunately these dumbass mods won\u2019t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/) Link below:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt\\_dd\\_part\\_iii\\_but\\_rkt\\_is\\_just\\_a\\_mortgage\\_company/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRKT/comments/lr2slx/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)\n\nThis international expansion (along with Rocket\u2019s other ancillary businesses) highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started.\n\n**Short Squeeze**\n\nOriginally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares \u2013 but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares.\n\nDespite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market.\n\nTo combat this unnecessary shorting, **Rocket announced a $1B buyback**; currently their float is $2B.\n\nFirst off, who even announces a buyback when they\u2019ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of.\n\nRocket\u2019s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday\u2019s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover?\n\nInitially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn\u2019t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn\u2019t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August \u2013 that\u2019s how much he believes in this company.\n\nGilbert has a big ego \u2013 so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron\u2019s Fathead to Benedict Arnold\u2019s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America\u2019s biggest traitor*. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below:\n\n[https://nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/](https://nesn.com/2010/07/cavs-owner-dan-gilbert-changes-price-of-lebron-james-fatheads-to-benedict-arnolds-birth-year/)\n\nThis was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect. \nJust like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close).\n\nFun fact \u2013 even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James\u2019 departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship\u2026 Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000](https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2020/08/20/dan-gilberts-fortune-soars-to-496-billion-making-him-the-15th-richest-person-in-america/?sh=1bbbac915000)\n\n**But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren\u2019t they buying back shares at these these levels?**\n\nAnswer: because they likely can\u2019t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain.\n\nAccording to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading.\n\nWhat is material information? Material information is any information that hasn\u2019t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released.\n\nWhat is Rocket's \"non-public material information\":\n\n* The announcement of Rocket\u2019s big, new financial partner\n* The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto\n\nThis information is likely to be made public on Thursday\u2019s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase.\n\nGilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into.\n\nSay it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked.\n\nTDLR: this doesn\u2019t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT\u2019s situation.

{"title": "GameStop: Your Build-A-PC Workshop", "selftext": " \n\n***TLDR:*** *GameStop can be a build-a-pc workshop with trade-in for a new PC every year (like how people trade in phones)*\n\nI heard this idea being tossed around before and I wanted to make a post to discuss it's potential. First go watch this 40 second video on YouTube since WSB doesn't allow links: \n\n# NZXT Workshop DLC trailer \u2013 PC Building Simulator\n\n[screenshot from the video](https://preview.redd.it/vgryv5esddj61.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e87e17d619445b3562992e05cf406e065b5ed75)\n\nThis is a PC Building Simulator but imagine, for a second, if this was real and became GameStop's market place. PC building is hard and not many people either know how or want to do it. That's why people buy PC's pre-built, but it's almost a guarantee that you would get better specs for the same price had you built the PC yourself.\n\n# Building a PC is hard\n\nWhen I built my PC it took several days for all the parts to ship to my house and the power supply was even delayed for up to 3 weeks, so I could not use my PC when I already had every other component. When it came in, it took 2 hours to build cause I had to open all the boxes, figure out what goes where by searching it up on YouTube, and then stumbling to connect the different wires to the motherboard. Look at this mess. Not my room, but it looked something like this\n\n[PC building catastrophe](https://preview.redd.it/mfgp51gwddj61.jpg?width=454&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a8d7e0b4d943021f13da13b60970e317c31b5c2)\n\n# But it doesn't have to be\n\nImagine how easy it would be if all the parts are already opened (new/used) and placed on the shelf and you could just swap parts and pick parts as you go with an employee helping you all along the way in case you get stuck. Not only that, the employee could even tell you what parts are the best for what games you want to play. If you only wanted to play Minecraft on low end graphics and don't need a PC for AAA games, they could tell you the parts to get for the cheapest PC that could handle that.\n\nNot only would this open up the gaming world to people who don't have gaming PCs, this is just incredibly convenient. This would also let people stay in a GameStop like it's an Apple store and just hang out and chat with people building their PC.\n\n[PC parts quickly selected for your gaming needs](https://preview.redd.it/bf2kkrxbedj61.jpg?width=502&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3380fabf8c12007a8e04432afaab0d8312f49175)\n\n# Trade Ins\n\nYou could trade in your old PC and get a discount in building your new one. This would give value to brick and mortar stores and people could be trading in PCs like they trade in/buy a new phone every year\n\n# Questions\n\nWould you go to this? I know for a fact that I would.

He does building in real time so you can follow along and get familiar with the process . [This video is really helpful] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIF43-0mDk4). I watched this one repeatedly until it all started making sense.

Basically, you can give yourself a crash course with the myriad of guides on the internet.\n\nLike most people, I knew nothing about computers before I decided to build one but not even a month of research later, I created a parts list, ordered it, assembled the computer, and installed the software without a problem. It was easier than expected, rewarding, and my PC is still going strong because I can upgrade specific components when needed. You don't get tech support but you learn so much more by solving problems yourself.  \n\nI understand if you don't want the hassle but don't be intimidated by the process.

{"title": "EV stocks are blood red. Time to buy EV stocks.", "selftext": "In 2009, I watched my 401k get cut in half due to the Great Recession. I didn't want to put a single dollar into the market, but I refused to take a dime out. I was scared. My wife, who is much smarter than me, convinced me to put $10,000 into stocks I thought might survive a decade. I did that, but I also chose one specific sector to favor more heavily than others. I chose infotech. It worked out.\n\nThis isn't the Great Recession. Indicators are pointing to a very healthy market ahead and a pretty big swing up--if the virus gets under control.\n\nToday I woke up to find EV stocks on sale. It looks ugly, and there's plenty of reasons why this is happening right now. But the EV market isn't going anywhere; it's simply the future. And because of that, I'm sticking $60,000 into the market again tomorrow, but this time, I'm spreading it across a lot of stocks. Some more speculative than others. Everything will be pure calls or stocks purchases; no puts, no spreads.\n\nSome of these stocks are going to collapse to pennies. Others will more than quadruple in value. I'm making this post so I can come back in ten years and kick myself for not choosing THAT ONE STOCK to invest the whole amount in, just like I did with Netflix. (Though I put most in it.)\nI also thought it would be good to get a bunch of EV tickers in the same place, so you can do your own DD and choose which of these might interest you. Or do like me, put larger amounts in the more stable picks, and throw some money on the craps table with some others.\n\nYou'll notice some popular stocks missing, because I just don't have any faith in them.

Let me explain:\n\nEvery car maker has publicly declared they will make 100% clean energy(EV) vehicles by 2035. Meaning 100% of cars sold from 2035 and on will be EVs.\n\nIn 2020, EV car sales made up 1.5% of all car sales in the world. So these companies that are turning profits on EVs are doing this amongst competition in a 1.5% block of the entire automotive industry.\n\nI agree with you that current valuations are like NKLA for most of the EV stocks out there; but there are a select few that actually have great fundamentals for being a part of an emerging industry(I will get to those tickets in a bit).\n\nAlthough fundamentals are important, you can\u2019t be boxed in with fundamentals for new industries. For example: in consumer goods industry a good P/E would be under 60x. For tech, a good P/E would be under 40x. Is AMZN a bad investment based on that fundamental ? Amazon currently has a 75x PE ratio...\n\nNow P/E ratio is not the only fundamental, there is revenue growth, EPS growth(not always the best indicator for growth companies), Net Profit growth, etc... for growth industries however, you can not always rely on fundamentals as a base.\n\nBack to tech, in the 1990s everything was in bubble territory(dotcom bubble happened in 2000-2002). But if you had the foresight to find those few actual profitable companies(Microsoft, Apple, etc...) you would probably not be working right now. The Tech industry in the 90s was even more risky than the EV industry now. Tech wasn\u2019t fully adopted until around 2010s when this new bull market started taking form. My point is, tech was uncertain. The EV industry is not. There is 100% certainty that the industry is moving the EVs and there is a date of when it will be happening. So how do you pick a winner in this whole EV boom:\n\nLook for the commodities associated with it.\n\nEVs need to charge...charging stations will replace gas stations(not immediately but gas stations will phase out)\n\nSBE - merging with chargepoint has 140m in revenue in 2020. They currently dominate 73% of the EV charging market.\n\nEV batteries are made with Nickel and Lithium(I have not done enough research into these markets but here is what I know):\n\nALB \u2014 very profitable and consistent miner\n\nVALE \u2014 Meme stock...so it must be good\n\nUltimately, the valuations will line up...however in the short term there will be some blood. But in long term investing you just need to do some research and find those gems that will be 100x baggers.\n\nTLDR: EV industry is a guaranteed growth industry with mass adoption guaranteed.

This is my own position to make back some money so I can yolo it again on meme stocks and destroy hedge funds.  Skip to TL;DR if you don't want to see a bunch of maps and shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SCENARIO:**\n\nEver since DFV has shown us the glory of short squeezes, there's been an army of idiots attempting to short squeeze any stock with above average short %. This week if you haven't noticed your account is down 50% because there was a \"sEctOr rOtaTion\" into airlines, travel, casinos, hotels. The argument being vaccinestalksgoingwell.exe and reopening have more growth potential than tech (yada yada yield -- BRRRR goes the printer -- tech all day). So the idiots on stock twits, discovered that American Airlines ($AAL) has a >25% short interest and is trading \"below\" pre-pandemic levels. My DD is to prove to you the following i) AAL management team has issued 50% more shares and diluted the tits out of the company therefore the price/valuation are not understood, ii) There is an incoming stock issuance, iii) $19 puts are only $0.31\n\nShares outstanding refer to a company's stock\u00a0currently held by all its shareholders, including share blocks held by institutional investors and restricted shares owned by the company\u2019s officers and insiders. **The number of outstanding shares is used in calculating a company\u2019s market capitalization.** You can see from this graph below -- $AAL has diluted their company by nearly 50% to survive the pandemic.\n\n[American Airline's LTM Outstanding Shares](https://preview.redd.it/bojg1iypddj61.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4984a79b531221dd605996b414e7d722c7a7f09)\n\nThis however does not tell the whole story. The company in April took at $6B loan from the treasury. Apart of the agreement, the treasury has the ability to exercise 44M warrants at a strike price of $12.51 cents. This represents 7.8% of the outstanding shares in $AAL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Treasury Program Warrants - 44M shares that can be exercised at $12.51\\/share in 2025](https://preview.redd.it/g4p6u0vphdj61.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=74bd36a59fb55dce48092171e2b60cffe3651bdb)\n\nDon't believe me? Let's have a look at their market cap. Assuming you're a complete imbecile and only look at stock price, sure it looks like $AAL is trading far below pre-pandemic levels. As of close today (2/23/21) $AAL had a market cap of $13.22B. In November of 2019, they had a market cap $13.64B --- except the stock was trading at $30.56.

Here's my favorite part... the company has decided not to announce when the shares would be issued and barred their executives from speaking to the media. In other words, they have been waiting for retail investors to drive the stock price higher to dump these shares into the market.

That is the basics of it. However, there are a number of other things you need to consider when buying options. Such as: you don't need to hold to expiration. Let's say HAL gets to $25 by April 15, 2021. Your option contract will very likely now be valued at much higher than the $3.70 that you paid. You can sell it off early, very likely for a nice profit (assuming there is trading volume on it). You need to look at the options chain, the volume, and learn something called the Greeks (theta, vega, gamma, delta, etc.). Also be sure to learn about IV (implied volatility) as this heavily impacts the value of options contracts, specifically when it comes to short dated options (this is less important (but you should still learn it) if you are buying LEAPS like HAL 1/21/2022 $22.50C).

{"title": "Why Father Burry is calling the big short 2.0 - I have translated his message into a language you autists may, with effort, be able to understand. Three words: Inflation.", "selftext": "Our father Autist Michael Burry (Burry if you read that don't be offended, we mean it as a term of endearment. You are our hero). Has called the next crisis. He posted a book on twitter that I will link here. I have just finished reading the book: The dying of money. Here I will attempt to summarise why he says the end is nigh.\n\nI read the book so you didn't have to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately I need to first explain some simple economics: but here goes... Most of you already know many of this stuff...you can skip a bit ahead. This first bit is for all the new retards we have recruited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn order to stimulate the economy, America, and other governments, by way of their Central banks \u2018print money\u2019. They do this by buying their own governments bonds in the open market. They sometimes, as during the COVID crisis, buy corporate debt too. They actually, literally, \u2018buy\u2019 this money with money they \u2018digitally print\u2019. That money comes from nowhere. (They add a liability and an asset to their balance sheet and boom- printed money).\n\nTheir intention is to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates. When you buy a bond, you push it\u2019s price up, which then decreases it\u2019s yield \u2013 if that relationship confuses you, here is an example. A 1-year bond is trading in the market at 98$ (this bond has a par value of 100$), so you can buy the bond at 98$ wait a year and receive 100$. A nice 2/98 = 2%\\~ yield.\n\nBelow, fed buys bonds, yields go lower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Yields fall as government buys bonds.](https://preview.redd.it/k5c2gmio6ej61.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2519e2a3c5964b329dda0de9e05d03316876656)\n\nIf interest rates go down, businesses borrow more money to invest, and jobs are created because investments create jobs. But, if an economy is running at 2% interest rates then even investments yielding a meagre 2.5% would be invested in, because they can earn the difference \\~0.5%...\n\n**Why doesn\u2019t the printing of money, by way of decreasing interest rates, cause inflation immediately?** Well, actually, it does. It creates inflation immediately in stock prices. The \u2018printed\u2019 money doesn\u2019t go to your average citizen, it goes to corporations who sell their debt to the Central Bank. It goes to big investors who sell their government bonds back to the Central Bank because they can earn more in stocks this way. They are clever, they know a   stock yielding even a stable 3% will earn them more than the current bond which only yields 2%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Stonks go up when fed prints. Relationship is dumb simple.](https://preview.redd.it/xvtnb39w6ej61.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=093073729951c00917ffd9a974cb5974ba76c39b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# START READING HERE SMART AUTISTS!!!!!!!!!\n\n**When does printing become a problem?**\n\nThe central bank looks at food prices, general household items, petrol prices, housing and other goods that the average you and me purchase almost every week. Bundle these together and call them CPI (Consumer price index) \u2013 inflation. Inflation in **certain** goods.\n\nNow let\u2019s imagine a scenario. You have 100 people in an economy. 2 people are stinking rich and the rest get by fine but don\u2019t have much extra to invest or save each month. They use their savings to purchase mediocre goods, a new bicycle, or a new TV. Why would they invest that extra $100, it\u2019s too little a sum to have any affect, even in the long run, on their lives.\n\nNow we look at the rich, they already have the TV, the car, a wife and a girlfriend and maybe a few houses. Where does their extra savings go? Straight into stocks. And maybe a new car every so often. Fine-dining and other sorts of things which **are not in the CPI (consumer price index)** basket.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WATCH THIS:**\n\nMr Central banker comes along and prints an extra $1000. Give this money to the Rich man what will he do? He already has the car; he already has the houses. He will invest it straight into the market. Bam! Stock market inflation, stock market goes up. This is what has been happening since 2008 (you will see a graph further below that displays this process).\n\nThe extra 1000$ does not affect the CPI basket\u2026The rich man is not going to suddenly eat twice as much or buy 10 more TV\u2019s. The \u201cstimulus\u201d money from the Central bank inflates only the stock market.\n\nGive this 1000$ to the poor-normal man, what will he do? He may treat his wife to dinner, buy his kid a bicycle that he couldn\u2019t afford. Fill up his truck. Pay his rent. It is not that he is wrong to do this, this is most likely his best option. A meagre 1000$ in the stock market will have no effect on his life, even in the long term.\n\nThe point here, is that Central Bank \u2018Printing\u2019 does cause inflation, it causes inflation immediately in the stock market- because that\u2019s where the money goes. Only when that money \u2018spills\u2019 into public hands (Think stimulus checks) does inflation in the \u2018CPI\u2019 sense of the word, unveil itself.\n\n**Inflation becomes a problem.**\n\nInflation becomes a problem when it isn\u2019t accompanied by its good friend economic growth. Inflation, has an interesting effect of raising bond yields. Investors don\u2019t want 2% bond yield if inflation is at 3%. So, they simple do this- they don\u2019t buy bonds. What happens when someone doesn\u2019t want to buy your house? You lower the price. No one is buying bonds? Bond prices go lower, and therefore yields rise. \u2013 Remember if no one buys the bond the prices go from 98$ to 95$ (supply demand). At the end of the bond\u2019s life, you get 100$, so the yield rises as the price falls.\n\n**The inflation problem occurs** when the average man got his hands on some of that sweet government money. The poor man was able to effect CPI because he will actually purchase goods in the CPI basket. Give every poor man in America 1000$ they will go out and buy from a limited supply of goods. A limited supply of goods, supply demand and prices rise. Inflation \u2013 CPI.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What do we do?**\n\nThere are basically only two outcomes to this scenario:\n\n1. If inflation in CPI, caused by the average American\u2019s stimulus check, opening of the economy, increasing oil and commodity prices, gathers momentum, it will finally unleash the latent inflation potential of America. Everyone who holds dollars, or dollar denominated debt \u2013 meaning every single country. Will pay for America\u2019s inflationary sins. Fortunately, poorer countries who are indebted to America should actually benefit from this.\n\nUnder this scenario inflation will need to increase by this much (look at red line in graph):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The red gap is the inflationary potential- The inflation that has not yet been realised but it does exist and needs to be realised eventually](https://preview.redd.it/zp2yb1r57ej61.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ab58d80429b169749c0d3b868007983fb5889f5)\n\nYou can see that in 2008 the Central government began its shenanigans. In a stable economy, money supply should increase sort of in line with GDP. As you can see above money supply has increased far more than that. That gap, indicated by the red line, is inflationary potential. It now basically just sits in stocks.\n\nUnder this scenario, by my calculations, money supply needs to come back down to real GDP. The Central Bank won\u2019t do this. They won\u2019t tighten. That would hurt too much. But the naturally forces of inflation will do it for them. And prices in the economy will inflate to catch up with the money supply.\n\n2) Scenario 2: A highly probable outcome: Japanification.\n\nJapan has been doing QE for a much longer time than America. The reason why they haven\u2019t blown up in an atomic bomb of inflation is because this money never reached the hands of the middle class or the poor. So that inflation couldn\u2019t occur in CPI.\n\nHowever, inflation did occur everywhere where the rich were. As it was them who had more access to this money.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Central Bank could, by way of printing even more money, buy more bonds and push down yields. They could let inflation run for a little while and hope it doesn\u2019t gain momentum. If inflation gains real momentum, which it could because they are giving money to the middle and lower classes, then they cannot follow Japans lead. If inflation remains muted and low. The real issues of wealth inequality will only persist and worsen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not to say that the managers of these governments are inherently sinister in their motives to conduct QE, which disproportionately benefits the rich. It may just be the only way they know. And by human nature people would rather be instantly gratified, leaving future generations to pay for inflationary sins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What happens in scenario 1 summary:**\n\nInflation goes out of control (CPI inflation, stock inflation has already had its turn). Yields rise, Central Bank get\u2019s spooked and tries to raise rates a little. Economy tanks due to raised rates. 6 months later or maybe a year later and the currency has found equilibrium by depreciating around 70% relative to the price of real goods- not relative to the price of other currencies. Or the currency has found equilibrium because they removed that money from the system-highly unlikely.\n\nStocks fall because yields rose. And everyone has the next best opportunity to invest into the stock market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What happens in scenario 2 summary:**\n\nInflation rises a bit due to stimulus checks. Central bank remains unconvinced that inflation will gain momentum. If inflation does not gain momentum the Central Bank will continue to print until they see GDP growth. Stocks go up but until the wealth gap is too extreme and a revolution takes place. This could take 10 years or 100 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Inflation only becomes a problem when the poor get to buy normal goods that exist in the CPI.](https://preview.redd.it/soxtt7dm7ej61.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=247b3ccb7cb0c36c3a51064517ae66099b86ab80)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - You don't deserve to benefit in this crash.

Mutual funds are just a number on a screen (and while they can grow to enormous amounts, they aren't anything until you pull it out and cash in). I obviously have a separate IRA and 401K that are designed for long term retirement investments so that I'm not left without a large pool of money at retirement age (this is still a \"bet\" btw and alot of things can happen in the next 40 years that totally wipe out those \"numbers on a screen.\")....which means that people shouldn't be banking on that stuff to take care of essentials if it does get wiped out.\n\nI know if you want to make the most money, paying off a 3% interest mortgage isn't the most optimized way to do it (especially if the market can net you 4% historically)....BUT BUT BUT at least you have a house, paid off your mortgage, which is usually the single largest expense to any family in their lifetimes. I can make/save more money in the market than I can building equity in my house, but the biggest difference is that a house is a house. It's tangible. It is a raw essential (water, food, shelter). It is an investment that isn't purely financial in nature. It is an investment in my family's welfare and safety. If I own my house, and pay off my mortgage early while I have reliable cash flow, then I am covering that essential first, rather than betting on imaginary numbers that are exposed to unknown and external forces. Again, I'm investing into the market, but my priority is my house. Just think of all the people who lost their investments AND their jobs (cash flow) and still had outstanding loans and debts to pay. You go homeless. Well...call me hyper-conservative (especially after seeing what 2008 did to my grandfather's and my dad's accounts), but safeguarding against that result should be everyone's first priority. Protect yourself and protect your family in the here and now. Does that mean your mutual funds won't be as impressive...yeah, that's exactly what it means. But it also means that if I experience VERY REAL problems like unemployment or market crashes, at least I have a roof and only have to worry about cash to cover food and basic utilities. People can survive and be happy with that. Take the home away and have those funds disappear in the market (and lose my job in the debacle)...and we don't have a house anymore.\n\nImo, people who chase the extra percentage points in the market (compared to putting more investment into paying off your mortgage) are playing with fire and are putting entire livelihoods and the livelihoods of their family into the hands of much larger and external forces...and these forces don't give a shit about you. I.e. RH completely changing how they do business one afternoon to manipulate the market. The market isn't for \"us.\" You are a small fish in a sea of sharks. Play in it, sure...but make preparations and set up proper priorities to protect yourself from the sharks. They don't care about you and will change the rules to ensure they win and smaller investors lose.\n\nI'd rather have a roof over a \"once upon a time\" million dollar account....as I stand in the bread line wondering why I didn't sure-up the essentials first.

And the only thing keeping me and you out of them is gainful employment and owning property to survive on while things get tough. Take away employment and I'm still able to survive without being homeless. If the government deems it necessary to repossess my house and take everything from me....then let's just say that whatever gains I made in the market are gone anyways. Repossessing property is a final straw...very very very slim chance that I get the house that I own taken from me...much much much higher chance that I'll lose my life fortune in the collapsing market WELL BEFORE any threat to our homes becomes commonplace.\n\nBreadlines exist, in the here and now, and it doesn't take much to put you in one....especially if you don't own a home and get laid off (and lack family support structures to take you and your family in). Owning your own home is one of the first steps to becoming financially free. Being able to pay off a mortgage was and still is one of life's great accomplishments, imo. My parents finally did it in their 60s, and have been living under stress their entire lives as they were edging upon paycheck to paycheck living. If either of them would've lost their jobs, we would've lost the house. I'm in a much better situation where I have plenty of disposable income (of which, again, I make hefty investments into my IRA and 401K) and I have the opportunity to be totally debt free by my 40th birthday if I can retain my current job for a few more years.\n\nDebt is debt. Being free from debt is financial freedom. My family isn't a corporation that views debt as a positive sometimes. Debt is what I owe to the bank at any given moment, and if I don't have the liquidity to pay it ALL now, then I'm exposed....and it isn't some trivial exposure. The exposure I'm talking about is what puts people into breadlines and onto the street when the banks come calling. You think that term mortgage is free from amendments?...the lender can and will ask you to pay your balance in full right now if shit goes bad. Being free from that risk and having a home where all i pay are taxes and insurance for the rest of my life, is more liberating than having a million dollar account with Fidelity. Again, from purely a financial perspective, paying off your mortgage early is not the right move. But owning a house isn't purely a financial investment. It is literally the welfare of your family to an unknown future that you are investing in. To some people (such as myself) that is more important than min/maxing my financials to squeeze a few more percentage points out over the course of a couple decades. I'd rather be assured to know I can be debt-free and a homeowner when I'm 40 if I choose route \"A\" rather than route \"B\" which is rolling the dice and hope I don't experience lay offs or market recessions all in attempt to become a paper millionaire in that same time span. To put it simply, I was in my 20s in 2008 and saw firsthand what can happen (and no one even cares nor paid a price for it....reform? What reform. Like one obscure dude went to jail...) while Wall Street got bailed out. I'm not messing with that shit after seeing life fortunes dry up in the matter of weeks/months. My grandfather was a paper millionaire before 08. He has since passed away, but all that was left of his estate was his property. His investments...gone...because he had to withdraw funds to keep his standard of living and he never recovered from 08.\n\nEdit: and one thing to add too...debt follows you even after you are dead. If I die tomorrow, my wife gets life insurance sure, but she and my kids also assume whatever debt I had to my name. That doesn't just go away. So becoming debt free is not only a smart move for my own financial freedom, but also for my kids as well. I'm actively investing for them on the side as well, but I'm not handing any sort of debt-ridden estate over to my kids to figure out. Some things are just more important than money gains and \"playing it perfect.\" Sometimes owning a home, being debt free, and living a happy life with a decent amount of transferable assets that you pass on to your kids is more important that whatever short term market gains I can make in the here and now (I'll get off my soapbox now lol...sorry if that came across like I was lecturing.

If I'm carrying debt, that would be consumed and the farm would probably be split in half where I would have to sell my side and it no longer stays in the family. Just the idea of being free from any of that nonsense and going to bed debt free is more important to me than being a paper millionaire....and it's not like I won't be a paper millionaire eventually. I just don't want to be a paper millionaire with lots of debt and the market crashes and now I'm not only not a millionaire anymore, but I'm also now sitting on debt that I \"could've cleared\" when I had the capital to do so...\n\nFinancial freedom, to me at least, is zero debt and positive cash flow. That means you can reliably save for family vacations, fun purchases, and you are completely safeguarded from paycheck to paycheck living. Does it mean that I'm not retiring at 40. Yeah. It means that I still need that positive cash flow to keep the basic utilities turned on, but it means I'm living a stress free life where I can set my salary price point and I'm not having to nickel and dime or shoot for promotions to keep my standard of living up.\n\nI just consider myself very very lucky to be able to pay off a single family house before my 40th birthday (not that I have just yet, but the funds are there to cover that remaining debt).

KOS need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because 2021 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\n*What is Implied Volatility*\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\n*What do the Analysts Think?*\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Kosmos shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Kosmos is a Zacks Rank #2 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas.\n\n*What do I think?*\n\nWith the economy starting to open, we are already seeing a hike in gas and crude oil prices. Airlines are preparing to soon get back to a normal flight schedule and many most of the population will begin to use energy again as a means to get around.

Considering this is the future, you can probably add \"buy certain other digital versions of gold that we dont talk about here\" to their list. Historically, they see rampant inflation in every economic movement and \"stores of value\" (again, a historic euphemism for gold) are means to protect against the lost of purchase power in such environments.\n\nHowever, some people don't like historic \"stores of values\" since they are essentially worthless as industrial inputs. Thus, these people diversify their \"stores of value\" from a single product to a basket of products, preferably those with well known applications to a productive economy (why do you think copper is \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 lately?)\n\nThe problem with all \"stores of value\" though is logistics...holding tons of gold is literally hard. Holding as much copper as you need to hedge against even mild inflation is probably impossible. Thus, investors who believe the future holds inflation, and wants to \"hold commodities\", but wants an investment vehicle which actually produces returns (as opposed to various metals that sit in a warehouse and literally cost you money to hold) buy into commodities producers...like mining stocks. These companies produce the \"stores of values\" that should hedge against inflation, sell those products regularly to produce reliable gains, then typically return those gains to shareholders via dividends / capital gains (both in investment in new mines / the increased demand for outstanding shares). For people trying to moon shot these probably wont do that, but they will produce reliable gains (5-10% is probably not unreasonable) which is, frankly, what rich people really need (1% real returns on a billion dollars is still a shit ton of money). For retail investors, maybe not so much (1% real returns on $100,000 is nice, but not enough in even the longest of timelines).\n\nFrom there, other investors (for example, Warren Buffet) broaden their definition of the above to include certain markets / products. Consumer goods tend to be bought at the exact same rate in a great economy as they do in a recession (sometimes more so since that may be the only \"luxury\" some demographics can afford). What's more, they don't have the boom / bust cycle so inherent to commodities / commodities companies / stocks. Again, producing a reliable stream of returns that can reliably pass on inflationary costs to consumers. Johnson & Johnson, and Coke are two companies I believe the aforementioned Buffet loves for these reasons (though I don't own any of those stocks so cant say if that observation is reality or just me).\n\nThat's usually where the defensive investor in a high(er) inflation environment stops.\n\nThat being said...people have been saying inflation is coming for decades and it hasn't. Not to say it cannot, just that it gives credence to those below who say \"buy the dip\" with the common sense advice that you should be buying broad based ETFs that cover large segments of economies to create investment diversification for the purposes of risk mitigation.

GDP increases (due to low unemployement) and inflation increases (mo' people, mo' momey) with it.

Velocity cannot cause price changes anymore than your shadow can push you over.\n\n>  unless the money printed gets in the hands of the lower class who is more than likely to spend it\n\nIt takes a while, but the inflation does eventually leak downwards, via either real investment in new ventures or else luxury spending.

Prices rise slowly but steadily. Real estate stays extremely overpriced.

In economics this is known as the \u201cKeynesian multiplier\u201d or a persons marginal propensity to consume or spend (MPC/S). Higher wealth level, higher propensity to save (into stocks, bonds, etc.); lower wealth level, higher propensity to consumer (buy stuff). \n\nThere\u2019s another thing at play here, which has been the change in the plumbing of the financial system since \u201808, which includes some incentives for banks not to lend the money they\u2019ve acquired via the Fed, but that\u2019s an entirely different rabbit hole.\n\nOverall, he is correct on this point, stimulus given directly to people will create some inflation (in my opinion it\u2019ll be largely transitory) 7/10.\n\nWhere he is woefully incorrect is the Japanification of interest rates. 1. Japanese wealth/income inequality has actually flattened in the last 3 decades driven by lower unemployment and social programs geared at rental assistance, health care and child tax credits. 2. Much of the disinflation in Japan has been caused by a rapidly aging population that isn\u2019t spending money. Low interest rates actually compound this issue, as savers spend less than they\u2019re receiving in fixed income. It\u2019s an economics chicken/egg issue for another conversation. 3. Corporate culture in Japan that hoards cash and has minimal debt relative to corporations in other countries has actually reduced the inflationary forces by curtailing spending.\n\nDisinflation in Japan hasn\u2019t been caused by central bank intervention, rather, central bank intervention to spur inflation is caused by demographic changes and a deflationary wave imbedded in their economy. This is a highly debated topic. \n\nOP is taking a simplistic, incorrect view of what\u2019s shaping inflationary economics 2/10.\n\nI\u2019m in the camp that inflation will be transitory, and not rabid enough to drastically erode domestic purchasing power. I think 1-2 years could produce some inflation, but there would have to be MASSIVE structural changes in our national financial plumbing to see high single digit inflation in the US. \n\nDemographic tailwinds likely reverse in the coming decade, which if not offset by labor reform could bring inflation... but we\u2019ll all be 40 by then.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

The issue with inflation is it can create a squeeze if it starts catching up too quickly, which tanks the economy.\n\nWhile CPI would seem to be lagging, that might not be a lag that ever needs an adjustment because consumer purchases aren't scaling proportionally to GDP like they used to be, that gap is just services that aren't being counted.

Remember that the market for US dollars is far larger outside the US than inside the US. This is why looking at inflation and macroeconomics as it relates to the dollar needs to be done from a global perspective with an understanding of the USD as the fiat currency of last resort. As the initial wave of inflation starts to sweep more vulnerable economies, there is going to be capital flight into US dollars which, while far from perfect, look much better in comparison to euros, reals, and yen. This phenomenon is seen time and again in rapid inflation and is explicitly mentioned in the book.\n\nI agree with your premise that inflation is a real issue for the USD. But I think that we are going to see massive strengthening of the USD as capital flows in and demand spikes, before we see weakening and deleveraging.

I.e. only the stock market can preserve wealth at this time unlike other periods in time.\n\nThe bubble factor is currently the price of the stock market is predicting an increase in corporate earnings due to inflation, if inflation runs rampant this will reduce the likelihood of a market correction as company earnings increase to meet the lofty valuations.

Do we really think they'll let all that be taken away from them.\n\nSo my overall conclusion - stick to investing in the market - companies with good management, strong balance sheet and a focus on growth in the long term will serve you well.

I hope I don\u2019t get banned for this...\n\n**Inflation** isn\u2019t only caused by the federal reserve. Inflation means prices go up. Supply and demand drive prices, so increased demand or decreased supply can also cause inflation. \n\nImagine the public finally realizes that tendies are the superior sustenance and start stocking up on tendies. Demand increases. Prices go up. This is inflation, without any change in money supply or government intervention. This is called demand-pull inflation. \n\nNow imagine, even worse, COVID-19 evolves to spread to chickens, decimating tendie farms across the country. Supplies dwindle, driving prices up even further as tendie farms struggle to source enough raw tendies. This is cost-push inflation.\n\nNow we have a nightmare scenario on our hands: A full-on tendie crisis in this country. Politicians don\u2019t want to let a good crisis go to waste, so they start introducing legislation to look like tendie heroes: We get first-time tendie buyer tax credits, cheap government loans for tendie purchasing, tax breaks for tendie suppliers, and talk of tendie loan cancellation. None of this actually addresses the core issue of tendies being too expensive, because all of these policy changes push prices up. \n\nNotably, no new money had been printed by the fed through QE. Now replace tendies with real estate or college educations (a bad trade, I know, but bear with me) and you have our current high housing and college prices. An Ivy League education (whatever that is) doesn\u2019t cost $60K per year because of the kids got $600 stimulus checks in 2020. \n\n**Quantitive easing** or money printing is not the same as stimulus. Beware of anyone who talks about them Interchangeably, because they\u2019re not. The government spends a lot of money every year, but they don\u2019t simply walk down to the federal reserve and print off a pile of crisp $100 bills to pay for it. They have to collect taxes and take on debt to make it work.\n\nYou might wonder who would loan us money if we could simply use our guns and army and money printing machine to either refuse to pay it back or simply print our way out of debt. The reason we can get these loans is that people and countries trust us not to do that.\n\nThat\u2019s the risk: If we play too fast and loose with the rules, people might stop lending us so much cheap money. However, this game is played out in the open. If you can read about it on WSB, you know massive buyers of government debt are doing all of the calculations and modeling. We could literally see the cost of government borrowing go up.\n\n**Stimulus** is meant to literally stimulate the economy. Inject some government spending, watch as businesses and people put that spending to work by spending it. This is like injecting demand directly into the economy. Remember that demand drives prices up, so stimulus is expected to drive prices up - Inflation\n\nHowever, stimulus should be used to fill gaps in the economy. If COVID drove demand down and the stimulus is sized just right, it will offset COVID and smooth things over until we get back to ordering our tendies at local fine dining restaurant rather than from our toaster oven. \n\nGetting the balance just right is tricky. Too little, and we risk deflation. Deflation is bad. Too much, and we risk excessive inflation. Excessive inflation is bad. However, the common misunderstanding is to assume that any inflation is and. The truth is that some inflation is normal and okay. The question is where do we draw the line between okay and too much. \n\n**What to do about it** If you fear inflation, basically don\u2019t sit in cash. Inflation is a reduction in purchasing power because asset prices go up, so you could invest in assets. If you invest in real estate and real estate is where most of the inflation occurs, you\u2019ll float upward with that inflation. If you (or your RE investment) use mortgages or loans, even better, because inflation decreases the value needed to pay back those loans. \n\nIf you\u2019re worried about growth stalling out from too much inflation, that\u2019s a different problem. The economy isn\u2019t going to grind to a halt, but it will become risk averse and more focused on essentials.

The complication is that it's bad if size and timing are off. In the ideal scenario stimulus pre-some-vaccination threshold is basically bare subsistence level, but right as the vaccination threshold hits and companies and people can start returning to \"normal\" it's the moment that you'd want to ensure that stimulus is a little richer, possibly even at the expense of an uptick in inflation.\n\nWy?

We will see a high annualized inflation number for Q1 of 2021 due to its comparison to the stagnation we saw during Q1 and Q2 of last year. But there isn't a meaningful way to make money off that since it's just a snapshot of an annualized rate.\n\nAdditionally, the thesis here seems to hinge on the money received by rich people to eventually end up in the hands of poor people. This is not going to happen through quantitative easing. Some of this money will reach common folk, but it will be a small amount and take lots of time. Even through the past decade of stock market growth and loose monetary policy wages for the lowest 50% workers have remained stagnate. This is meaningful, because as you stated it's people on the lower income brackets that have a high propensity to spend. Inflation is likely to stay down because inequality will grow in the US. We saw an uneven recovery after the great recession which resulted in low inflation and we're seeing an even greater divide between the rich and poor develop during this recovery.\n\nWhat could cause inflation?\n\nStructural changes to the labor market. A $15/hour minimum wage, growth of unions, increased labor participation in the trades, forgiveness of student loan debt for those that didn't finish college. These are some things that would actually put money into the pockets of low income people and allow inflation to tick up.\n\nIs inflation bad?\n\nNot necessarily, We've been living in a very low inflation environment for years. The Fed actually wants to see inflation tick up. High inflation is good news for government debt and may be an indicator of a reduced poverty in a highly unequal economy.\n\nConsequences of inflation?\n\nIf you want to make money off of an inflation bump, you better get your timing right. Burry was off by a few months with his Big Short prediction, you won't have that kind of time. If we see an aggressive inflation spike it will be countered by monetary policy quickly and due to reporting only happening every 3 months, you'll likely miss the boat. Interest rates are at 0 right now, they are nowhere near as high as they were in 2007. An interest hike to 5% would bring inflation to a screeching halt and and still allow for liquidity similar to the 2000's.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Much of the cheap, low interest money, goes directly to corporations business. Think that most companies have round 40% own capital the rest is borrowed money. That might be an explanation on why we have more startups then ever. This money are partly invested in growth give more work and more profit and at the extent there is nowhere to grow for the company it gives space for dividends and salary increase. \n\nNow, the rise of consumer prices without salary increase is no inflation. It is just the life getting more expensive.\nThe inflation is rather the salary growth for the same work and production output not the price of the bred or housing. It is your annual salary growth corrected for the eventual productivity changes due to better tools or know how for the think you are working width.\n\nThe question is then when a company would increase your salary if you are an average exchangeable employee. A possibility is that It will be if the working force will ask for it in a solidarity strong, organized form. That\u2019s why companies management normally hate unions in the US and collaborate and control the union  leaders in Europe. \nThe other more lean way is if you have shortages of employees in a period of very low unemployment, high economic activity.\n\nAnother possible development is that the government would like to create inflation to clean up debt created by the unhealthy real estate pricing, and free public money for consuming even other commodities not only housing. \nBut this is probably more of a problem in Europe. When you can borrow money from a bank for little over 0% you may think is OK to pay twice your life salary for a two room apartment. Everyone considers only the monthly cost and at about 0% buying a super expensive housing is cheaper then renting.\n\nWhat I want to say is that there are more factors that can create unstoppable inflation, companies profit collapse, stock depreciation and personal economic tragedies, wealth redistribution ... and is coming. \n\nYou do not need a war or revolution neither wait 100 years for it.

I was one of he lucky ones that bought this stock while it was way down.  I LOVE THIS STOCK!\n\nMany analysts are trying to push this stock down and I hate listening to those idiots since if they have a bad cup of coffee in the morning or their cereal isnt the right temperature they are grumbly all day and take it out on stocks that are actually good and have solid futures.\n\nI bought $BB because I believe in the Company and always have.  I even still own their phones (which isnt really their phone or operating system for that matter>>>but it still has a real keyboard and I like that)  Anyway.... this is a solid Company with solid fundamentals.\n\nThey dont do phones anymore for gods sake people so get that through your retard heads!  They build and supply very specific and proprietary security software for many companies now.\n\nThey started with the most secure peer to peer communications software in the Blackberry Messanger  product which was sooooo secure that much of the Middle East banned their phone due to the fact that terrorists were using the BBM to communicate without being detected.\n\nMoving on to some DD.  Last year the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan became the **THIRD LARGEST holder of $BB stock!!!.**\n\nWhy is that important?  Because the OTPP is the LARGEST SINGLE PROFESSION PENSION FUND in Canada with $204.7B in assets.  When I heard that they had purchased a huge stake in $BB I asked a friend of mine who was very closely affiliated with the Fund for over 20 years why they did this and he basically said to me \"well....... they are a very astute Fund that is managed by very astute people\" which would lead me to believe that they wouldn;t just buy that big a position if they didn't think there would  be a payoff or at minimum be a good hold position.\n\nread about the OTPP here [https://www.otpp.com/corporate/about-teachers](https://www.otpp.com/corporate/about-teachers)\n\nIf you need more info on the OTPP and their success look here.

{"title": "Hospitality is way overvalued", "selftext": "Alright, I didn't think I'd ever try a DD on WSB but here I am.\n\nLet's get right into the nitty-gritty. There is clearly a bubble forming.\n\nCruiselines, Hotels, Themeparks, and Casinos are way overvalued!\n\nEvery day some new bad news comes out for these companies and even still the stocks soar higher. It's ludicrous to think that $RCL coming off of -$5 EPS and $CCL coming off a 1M share offering that these stocks should still be trying to push back to pre corona highs.\n\nPeople think that the \"opening of the economy\" should help these stocks but I see it as almost the complete opposite. They really aren't opening anything. To say that cruise lines can't have full capacity, [can't even sail into Canada until 2022](https://www.travelandleisure.com/cruises/canada-bans-cruise-ships-until-2022), here is the first phase the CDC has in place for cruises to even begin sailing again \"[https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/pdf/CDC-Conditional-Sail-Order\\_10\\_30\\_2020-p.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/pdf/CDC-Conditional-Sail-Order_10_30_2020-p.pdf).\" This is going to take cruise lines months to figure out and then eventually prove they can have passengers again. If most restaurants can't have full capacity then neither will cruise lines. Also just in my experience of trying to buy a cruise for the past year they are selling trips out until 2025 at these massive discount prices to try and get more people. If that's the case then when do you think they could ever grow into these new evaluations? I expect years. Eventually, there has the be a massive pullback in these stocks. I'd suggest they are massively overvalued and the market will eventually realize this.\n\nFor the other sectors, I see the exact same thing. Looking at hotels and casinos most are back to their 52-week highs and many are ATH. How could anyone think this makes sense for a company that has basically 0 revenue for the past year? I could pull up charts and show how these stocks are overbought but honestly, 90% of you don't understand it anyway so I'll leave it out.\n\nI own puts in all cruise lines and I am starting to buy them for hotels and casinos. TBH shorting the theme parks is way too expensive and might not be worth it in the end. I rode the wave up on these stocks but eventually, it gets too much and you have to say this is enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Most hospitality stocks are overvalued and you should either get out of your position or buy puts.\n\nTickers to watch\n\nCruiselines: $RCL, $CCL, $NCLH\n\nCasinos: $WYNN, $MGM, $LVS\n\nHotels: $H, $HLT, $MAR\n\nThemeparks: $SEAS, $SIX, $DIS, $FUN\n\nPositions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxlchywyagj61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=50887750408f998bc121ea565acf02dd6e08b04c", "id": "lrgahz", "created_utc": 1614182695.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "Remove $DIS.

No one believed the short sellers covered their positions when they claimed they did, and now it\u2019s being proven. Before the short percentage was ever known I wouldn\u2019t have bought GME at a fucking $1 per share, I think the company is shitty and dying rapidly. BUT. You could see that 140%+ of the shares were shorted at one point, and then all the sudden it becomes a BUY BUY BUY AND HOLD HOLD HOLD situation at any price point. When short sellers are forced to buy back their shares, they will have to do so at whatever price we have it set at. And them doing so will then drive the price up even more so, and on and on. $GME is not about GameStop as much as it is about a possible short squeeze continuation you could call it. Who cares if they\u2019re profitable lol, the stock price doesn\u2019t care about company earnings reports if over 100% of the shares even available are shorted and will have to be covered at some point. It just so happens that it\u2019s a bonus the this scenario has pulled the company out of debt and possible bankruptcy at the same time. People buying and holding for this reason will affect the price more than the outlook of the company will. Hence the current stock price of GME is where it is, even if the fundamentals say it should be much less.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "IF YOU'RE GOING TO FILIBUSTER, YOU SHOULD RUN FOR SENATE!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
