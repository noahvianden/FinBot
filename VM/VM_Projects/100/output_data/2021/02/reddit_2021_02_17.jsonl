{"title": "Journey to $1 Million - February 16th, 2021", "selftext": "It was a mixed opening day for the week. Usually shortened weeks tend to be bearish. If the markets pulled back this week a little bit, I would take that as a great chance to pick up some more long term positions. My portfolio is down 0.76%, or $5800, today. The small loss is mostly due to the ARK ETFs and tech stocks I have pulling back. I will be looking to pick up some LEAPS in ARK as well as most likely rolling my AAPL April 16th call. \n\n* SPY: -0.09%\n* QQQ: -0.34%\n* DIA: +0.17%\n\n**Notable Recent Picks Today:**\n\n* **$MVIS +21%**\n* **$CCIV +29%**\n* **$STPK +20.7%**\n* **$PSTH +9%**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**My account:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgay2i6e7yh61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1d9d1e4869ca5427c0c5c994d8570cdb92d49d0\n\n Positions filled: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10lh837f7yh61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=463400d4538956c43e7c65f12fea5e291b1522ff\n\n Positions cancelled:  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jlhv597g7yh61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=f40f6cd631abb0532f2e1b8af87355423c87aaf6\n\n Current Open and Closed Options since Feb 16th: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8z74d0h7yh61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6181ee355fde5313e76976dd089622fa09388fe\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Adding to Watchlist:** \n\n**$NNDM:** Nano Dimension LTD is a additives electronic provider in the tech sector with 3D printing capabilities. $NNDM has just had a secondary offering for $500M worth of shares at an 18% discount. This has driven their share price down about 6% today. The company stated that they will use the money for working capital to further expand their business and for corporate actions. Currently in the after hours market, the stock seems to be bouncing off a weak support. This could be a perfect time to put some money into a mid-term call if it holds the support. If not, DCA down to the stronger support. \n\n* Target Price: $25\n* Entry: <$15\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 2-4 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/omn8j1nj7yh61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=5337665a54743897fdebd49b7cfdc60052ba5840\n\n \n\n**$ACIC:** Atlas Crest is a SPAC that has entered into a definitive agreement with Archer Aircraft, a flying vehicle manufacturer, to merger in the 2nd quarter of this year. If we look to the future, we will see that there will be a huge demand for flying vehicles, especially for deliveries. United Airlines has put in a $1B order for Archer's aircraft already. Also, in my opinion it is not farfetched that flying taxis could replace helicopters in the next 10 years. Technical analysis is not needed on this one - I will be buying shares and dollar cost averaging through the official merger.\n\n* Target Price: $20\n* Entry: <$15\n* Risk: 5\n* Timeframe: 2-5 months\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Notable Mentions:**\n\n**$PLTR:** Palantir has recently came under pressure because of some negative publicity. To sum it up, the come company has some controversial clients. In an error of political correctness and social justice, this has caused the price to drop off the face of the Earth. $PLTR was down 12% today. Personally I see this as a buying opportunity. Since the last time I wrote about this, it has blown through my buy zone. Simply put, I will be watching this one carefully and will start to dollar cost average into some positions. \n\n* Target Price: $40\n* Entry: <$25\n* Risk: 5\n* Timeframe: 2-4 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ioq0dpzl7yh61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=516d093fc74b8640024f5d8a7bf3f07a02aca84a\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI will be watching all of the ARK Invest funds as well as $QQQ for a possible entry into some LEAPS.

Wonderful DD!! Keep up the great work! KEEP READING FOR \u201cFREE\u201d STOCK!!!!\n\nSo: for anyone reading this with maybe a 3, 4, or 5 figure account, I\u2019ve been doing something that I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t invent but I came up with on my own. Take this as nothing more than gambling advice; this is NOT investing advice. And dude, if you\u2019re taking investment advice off of Reddit, you get what you pay for; ya know?!  \n\n(That\u2019s my way of saying, I ain\u2019t nobody speical; this isn\u2019t \u201cinvestment advice\u201d. Proceed at your own peril!)\n\nSo I want 100+ shares of PLTR. I am a strong believer in the company and I believe this stock represents steep value potential 5-25 years down the road. Think buying Amazon in 1999. So I\u2019ve been buying an appropriately sized amount of shares on a dip then selling only enough shares on the rally to recoup my cost. This in effect is keeping \u201cmy gains\u201d in shares of PLTR, at no effective cost to me!! I typically use 10 shares at a time; but size your risk appetite appropriately. This idea is duplicatable with other assets!! Happy trading!\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Newb question: what\u2019s \u201cBC\u201d?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s just my abbreviation for Buy Call", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25073304772377014}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1996741145849228}, {"body": "Nice.

{"title": "$EH EHang Holdings - A Great Opportunity to Buy", "selftext": " **What is EHang Technologies:**\n\nEHang (Nasdaq: EH) is the world's leading autonomous aerial vehicle technology platform company. Our mission is to make safe, autonomous, and eco-friendly air mobility accessible to everyone. EHang provides customers in various industries with autonomous aerial vehicle products and commercial solutions: air mobility (including passenger transportation and logistics), smart city management, and aerial media solutions. As the forerunner of cutting-edge autonomous aerial vehicle technologies and commercial solutions in the global Urban Air Mobility industry, EHang continues to explore the boundaries of the sky to make flying technologies benefit our life in smart cities.\n\n1. My DD Research and Why Ehang Technologies  \n\n   1. January 29th, 2021 ($EH - $66.36) - EHang receives $40M investment from Carmignac. Carmignac is a French [asset management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management) firm founded in 1989. What is important to note is that they one of the largest funds in all of Europe with $35 billion under management. And furthermore their flagship fund the Carmignac Patrimoine was one of the few funds during the volatility of 2008-2011 that outperformed their peers. I would imagine being one of the premier benchmarked asset management firms in Europe that their DD would have been successfully completed. Any omissions or errors would have been an immediate disapproval. While there has been some cases of bad investment made by firms, it is on the whole a lot rarer.\n   2. December 14th, 2020 - FACC Starts Test Flights with Autonomous Aerial Vehicle EHang 216. The first test flight of the EHang 216 aircraft in national airspace was successfully carried out under the supervision of the Austrian aviation authority Austro Control at the FACC site in St. Martin im Innkreis (Austria). The close and professional cooperation between the specialist teams of Austro Control and FACC led to this milestone. With the successful completion of the system checks and the associated test flight, the aviation authority granted the experimental flight permit for the further execution of EHang 216 test flights.\n   3. **Video Link:** [https://twitter.com/facc\\_ag/status/1339922168629653506](https://twitter.com/facc_ag/status/1339922168629653506)\n   4. **Important to note that FACC is**  \n\n      1. FACC is a global aerospace leader when it comes to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced aircraft components and systems. As a technology partner of all major aircraft and engine manufacturers, we are collaborating closely with our customers in order to devise solutions for the mobility of tomorrow. All over the world, an aircraft with FACC technology on board takes off every second.\u00a0\n      2. In the short fiscal year 2019, FACC generated annual sales amounting to 665 million Euros. We have 2,800 employees from 38 countries working at 13 international sites. Our company is listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange and part of the Fortune 500 AVIC Group.\n\nEHang 216 undergoing Flight Testing in Austria\n\n1. There are dozens more of articles/videos that I will not link due to the length it may become but suffice to say you can do you own research.\n2. EHang Founder, Chairman and CEO Honored at Living Legends of Aviation Event First Chinese honoree to be recognized with Technology Innovation Award [https://www.ehang.com/news/527.html#:\\~:text=](https://www.ehang.com/news/527.html#:~:text=)  \n\n   1. The same award that was given to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, SpaceX founder Elon Musk, and Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nToday WolfPack Research released on 02/16/21, note this is important as the Chinese New Year Holiday runs from Feburary 11th - Feburary 17th and its a legal holiday week.\n\n[EHANG: A STOCK PROMOTION DESTINED TO CRASH AND BURN](https://wolfpack-whitepaper.s3.amazonaws.com/EH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUPWWN73KG77R5OP4&Signature=%2FT3%2FIZPg9Dy%2BlZhyzQjdFo8Huow%3D&x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEoaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQD2W97FtzCPNyQ4M7ubfDMWk4CZCN%2Fums06S5xKcaBubgIhAIenmbsZZEuWIag%2BekPHkJI7HYbq%2BXlrWkWdr2WPKOxuKs0BCFIQARoMMzA4NjEzNjExMjIwIgxxgZqM0Lo1NrVfgC0qqgGcxGHCGA%2B1z781XEaYJvBUmdSPL9DeFYVfbKOuFhZbilRffysWHOcsnG6al8eGNXxRcEGWCfWexoRGRIuMI0pmQ%2BVwbQ2PF8S%2BNLQLk2%2F1d1i01nqnmOTb5Ihs5i7336n9LLvslDzhaLTpAAm0D4FJb6jHOqhQt4rhQF2s6TXM4t91wNBLrZzRJUTcqhfcbXrDxlg33p2biikrEltJhpgszvEpLmf5JXwhIDCV27GBBjrfAWUlRTf0DswFo7O%2F3vINRAJ8izCaMVGKf6xaCplp6dokdgYFegOCQiC5r8b3UOOIbfSx9ZOKbWeEIOKy2pASs%2BlkBQHzjUt8WOAo4C%2BZWXmkzgscaiBP%2F2g%2Fe4ndYtpg3bzFUL0NcGaGIX0hioYgp5JY59n6PKTmXrfTG9%2Fsc82Lm4ESDXBFruPESIJ0eHXSgVC99joTMsiCATCJnRwzWR2GHgTafOqGH96f%2B20YA70nr%2FB7%2F1IT78QtYRAQIuMeYQ4UhvKrAgt735VASf2Xuayb%2F1l72sHf7tTQaa3mGSw%3D&Expires=1613529036)\n\nOf the portions of the research that are suspicious, or have clearly a bias, or have questionable content as they cannot be confirmed or verified in the report and should be ignored in the report.\n\n1. Suspicious Timing  \n\n   1. As the Chinese New Year is in full swing, it is a week long federal holiday. This ensure that panic sellers will not be able to reach with out any additional information.\n   2. Slow releases starting around 1200EST-1400EST or roughly 2300-0300 in China, which also ensures that any response will be delayed until after panic selling has been complete.\n   3. This in fact caused the stock price to drop almost 62% which brings to price back to roughly \\~1 month ago before its run up.\n2. Lack of Personnel in EHang Locations, Video Released by Wolfpack Research:  \n\n   1. No metadata on Youtube video, unable to verify date and time stamp. Claimed to be shot during January *but no exact dates are provided.*\n   2. Video taken over the federal holiday, there of course would be no people in the building.\n   3. But what we are able to see is that there are actual EH216 vehicles that are being built and/or assembled, with lots of parts in boxes. If there were actual fraud, there would be absolutely no reason to even spent the effort in having all those parts and pieces. In fact there would be ample security to ensure that no one would ever discover the deception.\n3. eVTOL expert Dr. Moore from Uber and NASA  \n\n   1. Regarding his opinion of the use of hobby motors and general quality. Working at NASA we have seen how stagnant NASA has become due to their over redundancy and unwillingness to take risk compared to how SpaceX operates. But redundancy is waste, especially in startups that do not have the federal money. If \"hobby\" motors work, then why over-engineer something? I think we can draw parallels to early Tesla motors but the key thing is that they worked and that is all that matters.\n   2. Lack of research budget, when you work for NASA anything that is not in the billions would of course be considered anemic, but the company is working first to pioneer passenger VTOLs and then moving on getting acceptance for autonomous technology.\n4. Flight Autonomy Dream (Headline: It is not, its already here and it works)  \n\n   1. Flight autonomy is already well used in the the aviation industry. In fact the majority of your domestic and international flights utilize autopilot where the pilot has pre-entered in a specific heading and altitude.\n   2. DJI with their Mavic Air series are able to perform limited autonomous flight in a consumer drone for under $1000 including takeoff, object detection and avoidance, GPS flight routine, landing, and return to base landing. If a consumer drone maker can do this it is not a leap of imagination to think that the same principles can be applied here.\n   3. ***There is nothing special regarding autonomous flight.***\n   4. In fact you can see from this Wikipedia image regarding autonomous control levels shows that as early as in 2000s with the Predator and Global Hawk autonomous flight was already widely used in the defense sector. Today the focus into the future are fully autonomous swarms, far far ahead of what is necessary for autonomous drone flight.\n\nAutonomous Control Level Trend\n\n1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Office Visit - Distributor of EHang  \n\n   1. Interview with employee who \"claimed\" to be the finance manager pushing to sell their own drones, which does not make sense because Kunxiang does not make any drones and is a distributor. Also the finance manager reportedly said that their drone had *4 hours flight time* which is an absolutely unbelievable claim versus EHang's 30 minutes of total flight time which is far more realistic. No additional evidence was provided by WolfPack regarding the \"claimed\" finance manager, name, title or any of substance.\n\nOf the portions that provide a negative attack and are at best circumstantial evidence\n\n1. \\# of NewsWire PR Articles - Apparently having 55 news article in 14 months constitutes a pump and dump scheme.\n2. Lack of Infrastructure Progress and Investments - Because not all progress has gone according to plan, I wonder what other large companies have had the same issues that have become one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n3. Misleading English/Chinese Press Release  \n\n   1. While the titles maybe misleading, Googling the original Chinese press releases identifies does not actually mislead any of the readers. It does not make any false claims regarding passenger vehicles or their permitting, in fact it is actually Dr. Mark Moore who is making the *assumptions based upon the title*. And you know what they say about assumptions, they make an a\\*\\* out of you and me. I would think that a NASA engineer would take his time reading the article, I mean they certainly are taking their time with SLS.\n\nOf the portions that have merit:\n\n1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Price Disparity  \n\n   1. Of all the points in the short research, this maybe one of merit.\n   2. The buyer purchased EH216 at widely varying prices from 1.5 million RMB per unit to 150 million RMB as stated in two difference SEC Sales Contract reports. This wide disparity is a note for cause.\n2. Rapidly Growing Accounts with low account receivable and allegation of fabricated sales  \n\n   1. Is this not similar to how TSLA presold cars? Additional research needs to be done into this.\n   2. Again the research does not say it is evidence of fabricated sales but only that is a textbook indication. ***Again circumstantial evidence is not real evidence.***\n   3. ***Why is this buried at the tail end of the report? At page 19 out of 33.*** If this was truly damning than it should have been at the forefront.\n3. Ongoing Lawsuit  \n\n   1. Could be a future issue, however without knowing the full evidence of the trial it is difficult to make judgement.\n\nWolfPack Research History so far (two words, desperate & terrible)\n\n[https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports](https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports)\n\nOf the 6 short researches, all of them insisted that the various companies committed fraud and yet ***5 out of the 6 stocks*** are up since their report. I will not mention the tickers as they have all been banned by the mods. With a singular exception, they say a broken clock is wrong twice a day. If ever there was a clear evidence of false reporting and market manipulation this is it. In my opinion WolfPack research utilizes its financial disclaimer purporting that this research is only an expression of their opinion to side step any legal ramifications.\n\nI have to state that $EH has been on a tear lately and as a very young startup it has been on a tremendous run up. It more than likely would have drop due to a pull back but I believe that air transportation will be the next TSLA, especially in China where the population density is 153 per KM2. Electric air transportation is the only way to alleviate the congestion that is plagues their streets and their cities.\n\nBut I like this stock!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclosure: Long on EH since 2020.

{"title": "Averaging down is dangerous with the wrong stock. Catching the falling knife.", "selftext": "Do to recent events there has been a large influx of new investors and traders. All these new people is a good thing for the market. More people= more money in the market which is good for all of us. But due to this new growth of investors a lot of the new people don\u2019t understand certain strategies and are being misled by other selfish investors into making huge mistakes.\n\nBringing your cost basis down is a strategy that a lot of investors use when they buy into a stock that sells off after. Generally you will see this when someone makes a large purchase leading up to an earnings report or some news event and things don\u2019t pan out. The stock sells off 10% and they buy the dip to bring their cost basis down. This only works when the company you\u2019re investing in is strong financially and fundamentally and when the macro conditions are conducive for a bull market.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t this apply to the lot of meme stocks that exploded last month? Because their value was never based on anything financial or fundamental. What I am seeing now is people lowering their cost basis based on cosmetic appearance alone. $300 costs basis looks much worse than $100 costs basis when the stock is trading at $50 right ??? Wrong! it really comes down to how many shares you own for example:\nInvestor A buys 1 share of GME at $300 and the stock is currently trading at $50 their costs basis is $300 and they\u2019re down $250. Investor B purchased 1 share at $300 and then 10 shares at $200 and another 10 shares at $100. Their cost basis is $157 but since they own 21 shares and the share price is $50 they\u2019re down $2,247. \n\nInvestor B has a much lower cost basis ($157) than investor A  ($300) but is down a lot more money ($2247 vs $300) When you chase after a parabolic stock that is not tied to fundamentals or finances and it eventually crashes you\u2019re not supposed to buy the dip. This is called trying to catch a falling knife. Buying the dip is a fundamentals play, it\u2019s a belief in the companies long term prospects and finances. What happened last month was the opposite of fundamentals.\n\nTLDR lowering your costs basis \u201caveraging down\u201d\nIs dangerous with the wrong stock. It is a fundamentals play and cannot be applied to the non-fundamental moves in meme stocks last month.

You can scream all day until you're blue in the face that they're a tech company but the reality is they have yet to prove to have the means to monetize that data.

Not a single analyst (and not even tsla themselves) are guiding towards 50% yoy production unit growth for the next decade. That would project they produce as many units per year as Toyota Motors and Volkswagen combined. The median projections in 2021 are for 780k units. TSLA's own projections and target are for 9 million units by 2030 which is a 30% growth rate from their 2021 target.\n\nAnother note, production units is not directly linear with revenue. As they scale for volume, they're not going to magically sell 1 million model S's in a 9 million unit year. To achieve that level of scale they'll have to move down the cost spectrum which inherently shifts their revenue/unit metric lower. Notice how auto production units grew 71% in 2020 but auto revenues only grew by 31%? Yeah, volume moves towards volume pricing. And the high revenue/high margin models (S/X) are stagnating in growth (down 10% yoy). Right now the street is est a median 55% increase in revenues which is dislocated from Musk's delivery target of 840k units (a 68% increase yoy). Again, in 2020 a 71% increase in 2020 only resulted in 31% top line growth. The idea that they will somehow sustain top line growth for >30% over the coming decade is unrealistic.\n\n**Re: Margins** \\- Also you're glossing over the fact that their margins are straight in line with existing automakers? Their gross margins were this high back in 2016 (when they were only producing two cars... and given only 10k model x sold that year, more like 1.5 cars). Their current \"all time high\" gross margins is within spec for where Toyota and VW both have been.\n\nOperating margin increased 660bps was a low hanging fruit. They're now in line Op% wise with TM and VW (200+bps below the TM operating margin for 2020). Moving into higher volume cars to compete with the $20k civic and corolla (which sold a combined 600k units in the US alone last year) is going to compress both gross and op margins.\n\nFinally the last untouched aspect here. When you begin talking 10 year timeframes you have to talk about competition and no disruptions to supply chain. EV is no longer set to be a TSLA only world. Not even talking about the established automakers, you have serious competition from new entrants like Lucid Motors (founded by ex-model S chief engineer), Nio, Rivian, Canoo, etc. These are no longer concepts on the horizon but actual cars being delivered in 2021 (Lucid Air est Sept) that take advantage of the capex tsla has put into pushing infrastructure forward to make it easier to own an EV. \n\nOn the supply chain side we already see the bottleneck happening in semi's. That's inevitably going to hurt TSLA's ability to execute unless tsla decides they want to go and become a chip manufacturer to compete with TSMC/GlobalFoundry/ARM/INTC/Samsung too.\n\n**Run a simple DCF and comp**: Estimating margins remain the same (on the elevated end of automakers) and revenue grows at 30%/yoy (which again, remember this is all revenue grew in a year they produced 71% yoy unit growth), use a P/E multiple thats twice what the leading automakers trade at (30x), and use a generous ER of 15% (beta 2.1, mkt ret 8%) and you get a PV of EV at $370bn or roughly 45% of where it's at now.\n\nIf we go to more realistic expectations both in the multiple being closer to peers at say 25x and the ER being at a more realistic 19% you're talking about a PV closer to the $220bn range. Again this is a very rosy estimate given its projecting they can maintain both opmarg and gross marg at industry exceeding levels even as they face higher competition and have to expand to differentiated models and down the price point per model spectrum to reach those goals. Look at the hit it took on both margins in 2017 for scaling up the model x production and in 2019 when they tried to scale the model 3 production. The idea that they will sustain these current margins over 10 years despite having to build into new models is a very generous though.\n\nA simple 10% yoy deceleration in revenue growth would make even the rosiest estimate above to be cut in half ($180bn pv vs $370bn scenario ceteris paribus).\n\nSo again, buying TSLA now under those ranges of really positive assumptions is that you're valuing the tech/data side of the company at anywhere from $400bn to $600bn in present value. Even if you believe that it's the future, that's an astronomical valuation.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Re: Production - Jesus christ what are you smoking.

They've all been off by miles while Tesla's own targets have been spot on or below actuals, even including a pandemic and multiple factory shutdowns.\n\nTesla's own guidance is that they will maintain an average annual growth of 50% over a multi-year horizon, while in the short term they're expecting to succeed that. When you look at their current monthly production capacity, they are already on track to deliver 800k+ cars in 2021, and that's if they don't ramp up any of their factories and don't produce any cars from Berlin or Texas this year. So with all due respect, the analysts' expectations are a joke and just proof that they haven't investigated the subject at all.\n\n> Another note, production units is not directly linear with revenue.

The idea that they will somehow sustain top line growth for >30% over the coming decade is unrealistic.\n\nWhile this is a fair point, the margins on the Model Y and Cybertruck are comparable to or better than the pre-refresh Model S. So until they start producing their $25k car, margins are not expected to take a hit. In the meanwhile, they have a lot of manufacturing cost reduction coming up with the new factories, so it's reasonable to expect at least a growth in margins for the next 1 or 2 years before it starts to stabilize (unless they manage to solve autonomy).\n\nAnd again, the analysts' expectations are a joke as they have been for years. I really wonder how many times these guys have to be wrong before people stop taking their word as gospel.\n\n> Re: Margins - Also you're glossing over the fact that their margins are straight in line with existing automakers? Their gross margins were this high back in 2016 (when they were only producing two cars... and given only 10k model x sold that year, more like 1.5 cars). Their current \"all time high\" gross margins is within spec for where Toyota and VW both have been.\n\n> Operating margin increased 660bps was a low hanging fruit. They're now in line Op% wise with TM and VW (200+bps below the TM operating margin for 2020). Moving into higher volume cars to compete with the $20k civic and corolla (which sold a combined 600k units in the US alone last year) is going to compress both gross and op margins.\n\nThis will at the earliest take place around 2024 and will hardly impact their margins for the period of my projections, so it's fairly irrelevant for now. You're also missing the fact that while automakers like Volkswagen and Toyota mainly earn money on the car, Tesla makes a large portion of their margin from software. Right now this is over $1,000 per car on average, and this 100% margin revenue has been increasing over time.\n\n> Operating margin increased 660bps was a low hanging fruit. They're now in line Op% wise with TM and VW (200+bps below the TM operating margin for 2020). Moving into higher volume cars to compete with the $20k civic and corolla (which sold a combined 600k units in the US alone last year) is going to compress both gross and op margins.\n\n> Finally the last untouched aspect here. When you begin talking 10 year timeframes you have to talk about competition and no disruptions to supply chain. EV is no longer set to be a TSLA only world. Not even talking about the established automakers, you have serious competition from new entrants like Lucid Motors (founded by ex-model S chief engineer), Nio, Rivian, Canoo, etc. These are no longer concepts on the horizon but actual cars being delivered in 2021 (Lucid Air est Sept) that take advantage of the capex tsla has put into pushing infrastructure forward to make it easier to own an EV.\n\nWhile this is certainly a possibility, it is definitely not a fact and something people have been saying for years was right around the corner, yet it hasn't happened so far. The fact that a company like GM announced an electric Hummer for twice the price of the Cybertruck with 2/3 the range and worse specs overall while it's only scheduled to be released 3 years after the Cybertruck doesn't bode very well for these legacy automakers.\n\n> On the supply chain side we already see the bottleneck happening in semi's. That's inevitably going to hurt TSLA's ability to execute unless tsla decides they want to go and become a chip manufacturer to compete with TSMC/GlobalFoundry/ARM/INTC/Samsung too.\n\nThis will be a much bigger issue for other automakers than for Tesla. More info on that [in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdl7PUcebT4)\n\n> Run a simple DCF and comp: Estimating margins remain the same (on the elevated end of automakers) and revenue grows at 30%/yoy (which again, remember this is all revenue grew in a year they produced 71% yoy unit growth), use a P/E multiple thats twice what the leading automakers trade at (30x), and use a generous ER of 15% (beta 2.1, mkt ret 8%) and you get a PV of EV at $370bn or roughly 45% of where it's at now.\n\n> If we go to more realistic expectations both in the multiple being closer to peers at say 25x and the ER being at a more realistic 19% you're talking about a PV closer to the $220bn range. Again this is a very rosy estimate given its projecting they can maintain both opmarg and gross marg at industry exceeding levels even as they face higher competition and have to expand to differentiated models and down the price point per model spectrum to reach those goals. Look at the hit it took on both margins in 2017 for scaling up the model x production and in 2019 when they tried to scale the model 3 production. The idea that they will sustain these current margins over 10 years despite having to build into new models is a very generous though.\n\n> A simple 10% yoy deceleration in revenue growth would make even the rosiest estimate above to be cut in half ($180bn pv vs $370bn scenario ceteris paribus).\n\n> So again, buying TSLA now under those ranges of really positive assumptions is that you're valuing the tech/data side of the company at anywhere from $400bn to $600bn in present value. Even if you believe that it's the future, that's an astronomical valuation.\n\nI mean sure, if you change actual numbers to fictional worse numbers you can make every company look bad. Fact of the matter is that even if you put a huge margin of error on Tesla's own guidance, Tesla's valuation will be fair before the end of the decade even if they don't execute on any of the gigantic list of other products they're working on:\n\n* Autonomy/robotaxi networks\n* Licensing battery and autonomy tech\n* Selling HVAC systems\n* The insurance business\n* leasing out the most powerful supercomputer in the world\n* Their entire energy business that's expected to become as big as the automotive business.\n\nAnd I probably forgot a few.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> I mean sure, if you change actual numbers to fictional worse numbers you can make every company look bad. \n\n30% yoy revenue growth IS using TSLA guidance and even then that's generous. 50% over the next few years is their production outlook.

Jesus christ, I'm not changing forecasted numbers here or putting in fictional numbers, I'm using the fucking metrics tsla gives.

{"title": "HMC (Honda) is massively overlooked, with huge upside potential", "selftext": "I've always loved Honda cars, and recently took a position in HMC after looking over their financials.\n\nWhen you look at their financials, and how that relates to their stock price, it's pretty amazing that they aren't trading *way* higher. I should disclose that this is using the year data ending 3/31/20 for HMC (I know, a bit old, but you'll see why it doesn't really matter):\n\nCurrent Market Price: $29.17\n\nBook Value per Share: $43.19\n\nPE Ratio: 5.04\n\nMarket Value divided by Book Value: 0.68\n\n2020 Estimated Shipped Cars: 4.5M\n\nGross Profit: $29.1B\n\nLet's just stop for a second after those figures. The one metric that is truly astounding is HMC is trading *below* it's book value. Honda is one of the largest automotive and motorcycle manufacturers in the world, aside from other products, and yet it trades below its book value. Call me crazy, but even if all it did was reach its book value, you would see a 48% upside. That's already good enough for me.\n\nNow let's talk PE ratio. The current S&P500 PE ratio is right around 40, give or take a bit on when you calculate it out. That's definitely high compared to historical numbers, and there are a whole host of reasons for that that I won't get into. The average S&P500 PE ratio for the past twenty years is 24.9, and its just above 20.1 for the past ten years. With that in mind, HMC's PE ratio of 5 is laughably low. Even if it gets to the S&P500 ten year average PE ratio, which wouldn't even be high by any standard, you're looking at a 298% increase in share price.\n\nAlright, so we're already looking at easy upside from those two metrics, let's slap on another one for good measure - market value/book value. As I mentioned before, you're looking at a 48% upside if the stock price just gets to it's book value. Here's the thing - many stocks these days, including HMC's competitors trade well above their book value. Toyota, for instance, trades at about a 2.6 market/book ratio. If Honda did that, it's share price would be $112.65 right now. Honestly, that seems far more reasonable than where it's at now.\n\nSo, even with just those few metrics, it seems clear that Honda is massively undervalued, but it's fun to compare it to the all-scary monster of a stock, TSLA. Take a look at those same metrics and figures again:\n\nCurrent Market Price: $29.17 vs TSLA at $798.15\n\nBook Value per Share: $43.19 vs TSLA at $24.04\n\nPE Ratio: 5.04 vs TSLA at 1246.88\n\nMarket Value divided by Book Value: 0.68 vs. TSLA at 33.19\n\n2020 Shipped Cars: 4.5M (est) vs. TSLA at 500k\n\nGross Profit: $29.1B vs. TSLA at $6.6B\n\nThat's right, HMC has a higher book value than TSLA, and not by some measly margin. TSLA's astounding PE ratio is just outright scary, and that's the type of information that makes Michael Burry's short of TSLA not so crazy, even if he does have a price target of $100 (nearly a 90% loss). That doesn't stop me from having TSLA shares though, which brings me to my next point.\n\nInvestor sentiment seems to mean more than anything right now, and HMC has none. It only takes a quick look at trade volume in the last 6 weeks to see that:\n\nTSLA: 925M vs. HMC: 20.2M\n\nMy view on sentiment is that it has a lot of power, and sentiment generally sticks for companies that are going places. In my mind it's partly what drove AMZN and TSLA share prices to such insane levels, and not to mention GME. If you look at the 5-year chart for HMC you don't see much sentiment at all. HMC is a safe haven, and seemingly forever a stock that you could sell Iron Condors on just picking up cash. That could all change if people start to catch on that HMC is primed and ready to do *whatever the f it wants* with the $25B it has in cash.\n\nSo, here's where I stand. Getting to $43 (book value) would be a correction. Getting to $108 would make it on par with market and similar to Toyota, which I could also view as a correction. If it catches investor sentiment, well, buckle up.\n\n**TL;DR: HMC is massively undervalued by any metric. Upside of at least 50%-300% is more than reasonable, it would be a correction. Comparing it to TSLA is hilarious. Solid financials priming it ready to make moves and catch investor sentiment.**\n\nPositions: 150 shares HMC, 4 shares TSLA.

Here's what I'll tell you if you actually want to listen.\n\nI think the people here are frustrated by Us and Them politics as it is a tactic meant to divide society.  Politicians create an imaginary Us and an imaginary Them and attempt to turn groups against each other to mobilize their bases. If my life isn't in some sort of distress people care less who's in office. Both parties do it.  You think you are on the righteous side of \"Us\" but there is no righteous side... just division when you prescribe to this line of thinking.  The world consists of individuals that transcends race, gender, privilege etc. so to lump another group together and label them, you become the evil you seek to destroy.\n\nI am not saying privilege and inequality exist... but these are things that are viewed at an individual and very complex level.  Is privilege just money?  Is it having parents who gives a shit?  Is it having good health/genetics?  There are so many factors for each individual.\n\nYou think \"Us\" is \"People who care\" and \"Them\" is \"Racist Privalege white people who don't.\"  They feel that you are the Them and they are Us.  And so nobody listens or has a conversation people just spout nonsense at each other and things go nowhere.\n\nTo be fair it is impossible to not prescribe to some form of \"Us\" and \"Them\" in our lives.  It helps us create simplicity in our lives to lump people together.  I am creating an Us and Them in this post by saying that you are the \"Them\" who is using Us and Them arguments.

Super cheap or free commission brokerages like RH, IB, etc. have to run their business in a certain way to make those commissions free.  It's not magic.   One of the things you get from a full service brokerage is usually a firm that has deep liquidity, the ability to stand behind it's trades, etc.  RH doesn't have that ability, and IBKR strictly manages it's risks to keep it's commissions very low while maintaining healthy liquidity.

I find that hard to believe.\n\nTheir loss could be infinite, because them trying to buy the stock drives the price up even further.\n\nSo let me walk you through this -\nThere are 270m shares to be delivered. But only 50m million shares exist. So only 50m can be delivered - right?\nWhich implies that 220m shares won't be delivered. 220/270 ~ 4/5 - which is why I said, for every 5 stocks bought, you can expect 4 to be not delivered.\n\nUsually, non delivery isn't a big deal - if someone doesn't deliver AAPL, I'll go and buy one from the market - it's easily available, and my risk is the price movement in 2 days (due to T+2 settlements) - since I'll only get the order price from the client regardless of how much I purchase it at. For a stock that isn't very volatile, that's no big deal. And AAPL shares are very easily available, and not often failed to deliver. So the risk is very limited.\n\nBut that wasn't the case for GME. The stock is  hugely volatile - as a broker, I do not know how much the stock will move in 2 days (which is when I'll get to know if the counterparty failed). So my risk is already high. The probability of this failing to deliver is quite high - based on the shares I see that have to be delivered vs outstanding. This itself is reason enough for me to believe it'll bankrupt me. Now bring into picture the fact that every broker out there will be trying to buy GME to deliver to their clients - because they're required to do that by regulations, at any cost. Means there is a price inelastic demand for something already in short supply. Which drives the prices up even further, increasing my losses even more.\n\nI'm very bothered by the naked shorting and insane short interests - and by the fact that it was so cheap to short it, until it became too volatile. Most of reddit is pissed at this too - that's the sentiment you'll find here or on wsb. If you listen closely, he's pissed at it too.

Can someone explain to me if/why fractional reserve banking is justified and different from allowing +100% short interest?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Fractional Reserve Banking is where banks are allowed to reinvest up to 90% of their capital.  What that means is if you put $10,000 into a bank, they can now use $9,000 of that to loan out to someone else for a home loan or business loan or similar.\n\nWhat makes Fractional Reserve Banking scary is the person with the $9,000 loan can instead go and drop it in the stock market or put it back in the bank in another checking account, and then the bank can now lend out 90% of that $9,000 so now there is $8,100 more that can be loaned from that original $10,000.  We now have $27,100 of cash floating around out of $10,000.  This can echo out ad nauseam, but realistically when someone gets a home loan they tend to use it on a home, so this echoing out bit is really not as much of an issue as people make it out to be.\n\n---\n\nMoving on to why it works and isn't a problem:\n\nThere are a limited number of shares a company has.  Think of them like baseball cards.  If you print more it will deflate the price of the stock messing up the whole system.  So in some cases blindly inflating items is disastrous.\n\nFractional Reserve Banking works because we're not on the gold standard.  The Fed can just print more money with little to no risk of inflation, so the risk of a bank run or any other catastrophe is zero.\n\nMost people were taught printing money leads to inflation, but inflation has more to do with how much money is in circulation, not how much money is printed.  To demonstrate this, if for some sort of crazy reason everyone in the US decided to pull out their life savings at once and the Fed printed money to counter this so home loans wouldn't go under, but then for some sort of reason if everyone put that cash under their mattress, no inflation.  Price would stay the same because spending is the same.  Inflation is the price of goods and services.  If instead people took their life savings and all ran to buy toilet paper and other grocery items in the US we'd run out of items and ration them before prices would go up much or at all, so still no inflation.  But lets say people continued to fight for items after months of rationing, then prices would start to go up and now we've got inflation.  In short, in our current system it takes a lot to create run away inflation.  As long as supply can always meet demand, there is no risk of inflation if the Fed went wild printing money to cover a bank run.\n\nBecause inflation isn't a risk, and bank runs are not a risk, it's completely reasonable for banks to be able to reinvest 90%.\n\n----\n\nNow let's talk about an actual downside to Fractional Reserve Banking:\n\nWhen regulation is low and banks can reinvest 90% they have a history of getting loan happy.  That is, they start giving out loans to people who shouldn't have them.  This is what happened in the housing crisis.\n\nFeel free to change my mind, but I am of the theory that all modern day systems, including Fractional Reserve Banking, fall down if not properly regulated.  There is no exception to the norm here.  If banks are not regulated enough, 90% is just too much money and they start feeling the need to use it in dangerous ways.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Because debt lets capital markets grow much faster than just equity, but it makes things more fragile.

It could go down 100%, or up an  unlimited amount. The latter risk is supposed to be handled by borrowing it from somebody with a margin account. They borrow money to buy stock, and the short borrows stock to get money, and everybody has signed paperwork that says their broker can settle if things blow up. Actually brokers and big players charge each other fees if there is scarcity for shares.  If it blows up, brokers force both positions to close, but the fees usually stop that.

This guy spells out the reality of the GME event, confirming that all of us on it were right (which we knew already).\n\nThomas Peterffy  \nInteractive Brokers Founder and Chairman\n\n\"On January 28, the stock opened at $355, and traded up to $480.  At the same time, GME has 50M registered short shares outstanding, and a short interest of 70M shares.  In addition, there were about 1.5M calls, which would call for 150M shares. ...If the longs repay their margin loans and exercise the calls, their brokers would have been obligated by the rules, as they are today, to deliver to them 270 million shares while only 50 million shares existed.  So when the shorts cannot deliver the shares, the broker representing the longs must, must, by the rules of the system, go into the market and buy the shares at any price, pushing the price into the thousands.  So as the price goes higher, the shorts default on the brokers, and the brokers now must cover themselves.  That would push the price further up.\"\n\n270M shares shorted, when only 50M shares exist.  THAT IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL.  And yet when asked if anyone is to blame, this guy answers that no one is to blame for what occurred.  The only answer more absurd is if he had said the retail investors were to blame.\n\nAlso, he said \"thousands.\"  THOUSANDS.  That's per share, y'all.  \n\nWE WERE RIGHT.

{"title": "Extremely bullish on apple now", "selftext": "After reading this: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came to realize how good apple management team is and how good Tim Cook is at navigating the space in terms of politics. Apple has some of the highest margins (seem to be only increasing), insane revenue (they are still growing), good moat (its a hardware company basically), immune to monopoly regulation (they only control like what? 6% of the entire smartphone market?), great marketing, and have a lot of vertical integration (iMessage, Apple m1, iCloud, Apple Card, Apple one, etc). They also have shit ton of cash (they can buy Netflix full on the spot basically), and assets (their headquarters is roughly worth around $5B for example). Lastly, they have a lot of room to grow because they are so far from a monopoly, and they going into other areas where they can dominate (Apple Car, Apple card, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade+). \n\nHere are the other areas they dominate: Apple iPad, and Apple Watch.

{"title": "$CMPS - shrooms, the new weed", "selftext": "**TLDR: Buy $CMPS. Huge untapped market about to explode.**\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\n1. CMPS is a biotech company that has received breakthrough therapy status from the FDA and is using a patented synthetic version of psilocybin (i.e., the active agent in \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d) to target the treatment-resistant depression (TRD) market of >100 million people who have tried two or more existing treatments without success.\n2. To be clear, COMPASS Pathways is a biotech/pharma company with world-class thinkers and investors. This is not about recreational drug use.\n3. Thiel is an investor, owning 7.5% of this, along with other big names.\n\n**THE TEAM**\n\n4. CMPS\u2019 stacked board of directors and scientific advisory board includes:\u2022 David Norton \u2013 former Chairman of Global Pharmaceuticals giant Johnson & Johnson\u2022 Tom Insel \u2013 former Director of the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and co-founder of Mindstrong Health\u2022 Thomas Lonngren \u2013 former executive director of the EMA (i.e., the European FDA)\u2022 Professor Alan Schatzberg \u2013 Director at the Stanford Mood Disorders Center and Professor of Psychiatry at the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine\u2022 Professor David Nutt \u2013 Neuropsychopharmacology chair at the Imperial College London, President of the The European Brain Council\u2022 Chief Development Officer Trevor Mill who spent the past 25 years at Biogen, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson leads the CMPS R&D department.\n\n**PRICE TARGET**\n\n\u201cYou get paid in direct proportion to the difficulty of problems you solve\u201d \u2015 Elon Musk\n\n5. The TAM for people with depression who have failed two or more previous treatments is over 100 million people. There has not been much innovation in mental health since the invention of Prozac in 1988.\n\n6. Tom Insel, former Director of the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) stated: \"Mental healthcare needs innovation\u2026 The COMPASS medication-assisted psychotherapy strategy is innovative in that it integrates medication and psychotherapy. And it is disruptive by offering patients a treatment that many people prefer.\u201d\n\n7. At a current market cap of 1.6B, the PT is to reach the same market cap as Tilray during the weed boom; implying a **10x** valuation to $500 a share.\n\n**CATALYST**\n\n8. Biden Administration. With the push for weed legilisation, the next step would be psychedelics, where the results have been astounding for depression (also many other uses, like reduced smoking, binge drinking, etc)\n\n9. FDA Approval - Expected 2022 - 2023. Phase 2b trial data available late this year. Expecting a huge pop when the data shows late this year. Phase 1a trial showed an incredible efficiency of 4/5 patients with significant improvement (No data collected on the 1/5 patients).\n\n**FUNDAMENTALS**\n\n[4h chart](https://preview.redd.it/zwoakavvtyh61.jpg?width=1671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f732f93b45a66d96435fecb36c0c75f2d2efefe)\n\n10. Looking at the 4H chart, the resistance SMA has become the support for current price action, with a clear bounce off the SMA line. RSI showing a reversal.\n\n11. Current market cap of only $1.6B.\n\n**CONS**\n\n12. Biggest drawback is that the company only has one drug (as far as the public knows). You are essentially banking it all on this one drug.\n\n13. Company makes $0 revenue now. Its all R&D.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nEarly mover's advantage from CMPS, pioneering the use of psychedelics to combat mental illnesses. My personal 10 bagger stock, with 250 shares in.\n\nEDIT: Position: 250 shares at 51.6585 on 12 Feb.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfxflbogtyh61.jpg?width=1124&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ad1a714453a0ed6abf35a4ee890aabeeef2c139", "id": "llk2t5", "created_utc": 1613529565.0, "score": 163, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "If their study comes out with positive results (it very probably will) then the question is can they profit from their comp360.

{"title": "DDDD - Was GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold Part 2 (A look at Jan 15 to 29 SEC Data)", "selftext": "In this DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be analyzing some Failure to Deliver (FTD) data released by the SEC for Jan 15 - 29 to definitively see if there's been any shady shit going on with GME; namely, illegal (or legal by MMs?) naked short selling. This is a continuation of a similar analysis I did [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/larhlw/dddd_is_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/) when the last data set was released, with a few modifications. Since I'm sure 99% of y'all are barely going to read this entire thing, let alone read a second wall of text, I'll just re-use some of the content and explanations in this post.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**What is a Failure to Deliver?**\n\nA Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it.\n\n**Methodology & Caveats**\n\nI'm going to process the raw SEC data and join it with some market data from an API, which I'll paste below. This processed, enriched data, which I have uploaded [here](https://www.file.io/download/SbQSw9PUtZfS) for anyone wrinkle-brained enough to dig through the data themselves, is then analyzed by another script to answer several questions to help definitively show what sort of involvement of naked short selling in GME during Jan 15 - 29. The answers we're going to specifically answer is\n\n1. How many days saw a significant amount of FTDs for GME, and how does that compare to other stocks?\n2. What was the total value of FTDs of GME during this period, and how does it compare to other stocks?\n3. **What % of the volume for GME couldn't be delivered during this time?**\n\nThe last part is the most important imo, since GME accounted for an absurdly large portion of the market's volume for multiple days in January, so if you don't normalize for volume you'll obviously have GME top every analysis in absolute terms.\n\nNow, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred (i.e. T+2 settlement), so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results if anyone goes through the raw data.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date.\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out while answering those questions, so it should give a fairly accurate, albeit imperfect, representation of this.\n\n**The Code**\n\nFeel free to skip this section if y'all are code illiterate, but putting this here for transparency and so that someone can call me out if I'm making any of the results up or if I have a bug somewhere, which considering I threw this together in less than an hour, probably is the case. If you do see something wrong pls comment and I'll fix it if it's legitimate.\n\n*Processing Code*\n\n    import json\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n

People are asking questions precisely because the data does not tell a clear story. People are also asking questions because there is reasonable evidence to suggest that a financial conspiracy did occur when buy-side was restricted. You seem like smart guy who reads the financial press, and so I know you are aware of the fact that financial conspiracies happen all the time. Let's not bandy the term 'conspiracy' around as a pejorative when historical data suggests it's a normal occurrence as far as finance capital is concerned. Is this the case with GME (ie. conspiracy)? Well the absolute hard evidence is yet to be proven, but the question is reasonable at the present time.\n\nIf you are now making the argument that people are misusing data to \"prove\" (your terms) a financial conspiracy (they do happen, right?) then it's important that you cite these examples. I say this because most reasonable posts point to FTDs and other suspicious data looking for answers that no one has yet provided. From their vantage point, GME was about to seriously pop and inflict MAJOR damage until buy-side was restricted.\n\nWith that said, I have the opposite question in mind:\n\nwhat does your analysis of the data \"prove\"?\n\nConsidering that you've decided to generously give about an hour of your time (in your own estimate) putting this analysis together (presumably for the benefit of others), it seems imperative that you address [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llmiu1/dddd_was_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/gnqysvv/) \u2013 and maybe you're getting to that.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Not sure if you saw, but I already replied to that specific comment.

Although, imo wsb is going in the complete wrong direction here.\n\nIf there is a conspiracy theory, or at very least fraud or misaligned incentives, it's with clearing houses. Central clearing houses like DTCC basically shows that they can unilaterally effectively halt buying of any ticker for whatever reason. The justification for this is risk management - i.e. because they need to insure all the transactions in the market against counterparty risk, and the risk of trading GME just skyrocketed, they needed to increase collateral. You can take it one step further and say that many institutions, especially hedge funds which take 10x leverage, could quickly become insolvent if their short on GME, AMC, etc. went badly as those tickers skyrocketed. A wave of institutions collapsing is a systematic risk to the clearing houses and might make them go under, causing the financial system to basically collapse. In effect, this could have made these institutions \"too big to fail\" from a central clearing house's perspective, so their incentives is aligned with those institutions in ensuring their solvency, and hence  having GME not moon.\n\ntldr DTCC benefits from GME going down, which they can easily do by unilaterally increasing collateral needed to trade it, which they did", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "'too big to fail' is the fundamental issue at stake.

Alibaba serves as the one stop shop for all ecommerce and even non ecommerce related goods and services. Did I forget to mention Alibaba has its own movie production company? (AMC Anyone?) The synergy of the ecommerce arm: from allowing sales and purchases, accepting payments for sales and purchases, and even potentially financing those same respective sales and purchases makes for an ironclad business model. Alibaba also has numerous investments in many different industries and regions around the globe. \n\n**Ecommerce, Online Retail, Wholesale** \u2013 Alibaba\u2019s bread and butter. Alibaba has a multitude of sales channels that have different buying and selling methods with various different products and audience targets. Their ecommerce encompasses all relationships between consumers, businesses, and both. \n\n**Cloud** \u2013 Cloud computing is a top market right now given that we\u2019re not only working from home due to the pandemic, but we will also implement many of these habits in perpetuity as many businesses switch to a hybrid WFH format. Best synergizes with AutoNavi (Google maps of China) and data collected from consumer sales.\n\n**Digital Entertainment and Media** \u2013 From streaming to video hosting or even online ticket booking, Alibaba has it all.  You can purchase tickets to your favorite sports event, movie, or watch it all online. \n\n**Notable Alibaba Owned Companies/Services:**\n\n**Taobao** \u2013 Marketplace and online retail platform focusing on **consumer to consumer** online stores and purchases. Includes Taobao Grocery, Taobao Short Video, Taobao Live, and many more to come\n\n**Aliexpress** \u2013 International retail online platform for Chinese sellers to sell products. Example markets may include: Russia, Brazil, Singapore, U.S. and more)\n\n**Tmall \u2013** Online retail platform to sell name brand goods to consumers in the greater China region. This is mainly a **business to consumer** platform\n\n**1688.com** \u2013 Wholesale platform with many digital sellers. This is the largest wholesale website in China which primarily functions as a **business to business** sales platform\n\n**Youku** \u2013 Digital streaming and online video hosting service for Alibaba; similar to YouTube\n\n**AutoNavi** \u2013 Maps services; comparable to Google or Apple Maps\n\n**Daimai.cn** \u2013 Online ticket booking service; Similar to Ticketmaster\n\n**Alipay** \u2013 Accepting payment methods for your ecommerce purchase, movie tickets, taxis, or even to send from peer to peer. Alipay is standard across many stores in China and many regions in Asia as a dominant payment platform with \n\n**Ant Financial Group** \u2013 Fintech; Use for financing for small purchases\n\n**Alihealth** \u2013 Helps consumers find health insurance and receive medical treatment\n\n# The Bull Case:\n\n**Playing Catch up:** \n\nAlibaba has crushed earnings on the past 7/7 reports despite regulatory headwinds, international/domestic political pressures, and a pandemic. \n\nGiven the previous financial data, if Alibaba were to trade at even half the P/E of Amazon (78.15/2= \\~39) Alibaba would be priced at: **$363.79**\n\nIf Alibaba were to be priced at 75% of what Amazon\u2019s current PE is (78.12\\*75% = 58.6125) Alibaba would be priced at: **$545.68**\n\nAnalysts currently have a downside price target of $270 and an upside of [$387](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-alibaba-beats-earnings-estimates-164805712.htm) [according to Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-alibaba-beats-earnings-estimates-164805712.htm) finance. These price targets can easily be revised upwards with positive sentiment and an increase of both earnings and share price. With an upside of $387 for the year, that\u2019s approximately 43% upside (even more so with options) that will make your leaps and shares mouthwatering to purchase.\n\n**Who\u2019s on your side?**\n\n[Cathie Wood](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-sells-tesla-shares-184315217.html)\u2013 As of Nov 2020 sold Tesla shares to purchase Alibaba within its Ark Innovation ETF $ARKF\n\n[Ray Dalio](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Bridgewater+Associates) \u2013 Recently purchased and currently owns approximately 400 million dollars of Alibaba in the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund which is the largest hedge fund in the world\n\n[Jim Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FASe4D_pEi4&t=140s) \\-As of Jan 2021 Lightning round mentioned to buy Alibaba\n\nMost of Wall Street \u2013 According to [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BABA/price-target/), numerous large institutional banks and equity research firms (including JPM, Citi, HSBC) have buy or strong buy ratings with price targets easily in the 300+ range.\n\n**Potential Catalysts:**\n\nAnt Group IPO \u2013 For stakeholders, this has been a long awaited IPO. Alibaba owns a 33% stake in Antgroup which was set to be one of the largest fintech IPOs in history before it was blocked by the CCP. A reintroduction of the IPO may send shares flying\n\nMore Hedge Fund Buying \u2013 This stock is one of the largest holdings of many investment funds, hedge funds, and large portfolios. This is also considered a safer stock which appeals more to larger funds who are looking for potential returns\n\nBuybacks \u2013 Alibaba boosted their current stock buybacks plan from 6B to 10B reiterating confidence within the company and ideally, will boost the stock price \n\nThe monopoly probe ending \u2013 China slaps Alibaba on the wrist with a few slight changes within the marketplace and a small fine that they can easily write off\n\nChina Friendly Political Environment \u2013 With Trump out and Joe Biden in office, we may see more relaxed regulatory pressure on Chinese stocks (delistings, business bans, etc.)\n\nOne of many of their investments kicking off: One example of this is Alibaba's recent partnership with SAIC in the EV space with improved battery technology. If Alibaba is partnered with a company that develops FSD technology, this could be one of their biggest catalysts\n\nThe JACK IS BACK: Jack Ma was recently found to be safe through various video clips and word of mouth. If he were to show his face publicly and make a public statement or apology, this could help lift off the stock further\n\nWSB!: Although this is a large cap stock with many shares outstanding, the traction and buying power of WSB collectively could easily put this stock on the radar of larger investment funds and add to share price\n\n# The Bear Case:\n\n**Equity Research Findings:**\n\n>\\-A Morningstar equity research report specifically stated: \u201cExpansion of other China digital commerce players like Pinduoduo and JD.com could slow Alibaba's growth aspirations in certain product categories.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Alibaba will STILL grow despite other players gaining in additional market share for the business. Let me repeat this: Alibaba\u2019s key bear case is that they will not decline or stagnate; THEY WILL STILL GROW albeit slightly slower \n\n**China will try to take Alibaba out of the picture:**\n\n\\-The CCP will end Alibaba and give the reigns to someone else\n\nChina and the United States have been in constant fight to come up on top. What makes the United States a dominant force is not only their policy and military, but also our **top companies and infrastructure**. China is aggressively catching up to the United States as a super power as a close second place (See NIO, Xpeng in the EV race compared to Tesla or Huawei vs Apple in the race for 5G infrastructure). Do you think that China would even consider dissolving their top company in terms of internet and consumer infrastructure? Do you think that effectively scaring off fund managers (who currently own Alibaba), foreign investors, and foreign business interests will be a net benefit to China?\n\n**CaYeMeHaN IsLaNd sToNkS aRe fRaUduLaNT!!!!**\n\n\\-If you make this claim, read this [writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4lei/vies_and_baba_et_al/) by user u/wilfredian before putting your red nose and clown makeup on. TLDR: You can convert your American shares into Hong Kong shares for actual equity ownership at ANY TIME. Meaning it\u2019s not just some pretend company; it is functionally equivalent to the shares traded on the HK exchange.\n\nThe Chinese are looking for more foreign investment in their economy (what developed country isn\u2019t?). Think about this intuitively, China would not sabotage its golden goose (Alibaba) and breach the contract with many of its foreign partners to flex its political muscle on one company.\n\n**Positions**  \nI like:\n\n**Safe**  \n Actual shares with margin  \n Jan 21 \u2013 2022 320C\n\n**Semi risky**  \nMay 21 - 300C  \n June 18 - 310C\n\n**\"WSB Autist\" Style:**  \nApril 16 350C\n\n**TLDR:**   \n\\-**$BABA is cheap when compared to its US peer, Amazon, from a P/E and business model perspective.**   \n\n\n**-If $BABA were to reach even half the PE of Amazon (with its similar business model), the upside would be huge. $BABA has many backers including Ray Dalio, Cathie Wood, and even Cramer.**  \n\n\n\\-**Buy $BABA calls**", "id": "lluszo", "created_utc": 1613569519.0, "score": 240, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": ">My credibility: ~~I previously worked for the capital markets group for a large bank.~~ **I'm also Asian.**\n\nI'm sold", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Yesssss", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05305025726556778}, {"body": "I was about to post the same.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18485796451568604}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34898805618286133}, {"body": ">Do you think that China would even consider dissolving their top company in terms of internet and consumer infrastructure?\n\nThe answer could be a remote yes, simply because the sum of its parts is so much greater than the whole.\n\nEither case, it's fucking bullish for $BABA.\n\nGreat DD!", "score": 27, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5976704955101013}, {"body": "Finally someone gives some love to Baba..   \n\n\nBalls deep in calls \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 53, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13828204572200775}, {"body": "I completely agree.

{"title": "The Rocket is still Fueling. Buy Your Tickets for $SENS ASAP", "selftext": "Here we go Gents - my first DD.\n\nI've been a casual autist for years, but I finally feel like I have something to give back, in terms of a short, succinct DD.\n\nFirst - let's make this clear. I'm an autist. This isn't financial advice. Just yesterday, I tweaked my shoulder eating dinner. And it wasn't even my fork shoulder.  \n\nI know I'm not the first to mention $SENS on here, but let me give you 5 reasons why you should put in your order for some tendies before the kitchen gets too backed up.\n\n \ud83d\ude80 ) $SENS is a company focused on Diabetes tech. Why should you care? Because us 'Muricans love our tendies and a good chunk of us have eaten so many that our pancreas stopped working. The diabetes industry is massive AND A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHUNK IS OWNED BY ONE COMPANY - $DXCM. What the fuck? This is $SENS DD and you're bringing up a competitor? Yes. I'm telling you it's 2015 and you're getting the option to buy $AMD at $5 even though $NVDA owns the space. The runway is LONG and HARD my sweet prince. $DXCM has a market cap of over $40b. $SENS is under $2b. I'm not saying they're going to switch places or even out. I'm saying $SENS is criminally undervalued right now and could easily hit $15-20 in the very near future and in my uneducated opinion - go to $50 by EoY.\n\n \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 ) $SENS has tech that is mind numbingly better than $DXCM. If you aren't aware, $DXCM makes those sensors you see stuck to hips or arms that measure tendies:blood in real time. It's a huge leap forward from the old days of having to prick your finger every hour. HOWEVER these sensors need to be changed out regularly. How often is regularly? Five to ten DAYS. I personally called my diabetic friend and he said it was annoying AF. $SENS takes a difference approach, with their sensor lasting 3 MONTHS. 3 MONTHS > 10 DAYS. This is disruptive.\n\n \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 ) $SENS has a rocky history that can be completely explained by several rational decisions. If you've gotten to my third point, there's a decent chance I have you interested by now. But eventually you're going to look at $SENS trading history and realize it was at $5 years ago and tumbled down to $0.50. WTF? Well - most of this is easily explained. They raised capital several times, which we all knows kills stock value. They were attacked by our good friends on Wall St. And the FDA delayed their testing (in various capacities) by over a year due to COVID. Raising capital is a good thing long term.

WTF? Who gives a shit about looks? Well - just about everyone. No one wants a Tamagotchi glued to their hip/arm for everyone to see. It's unsightly. The $SENS system is a subdermal (I think it means under the skin) implant that communicates with your phone every 5 minutes rather than relying on a sensor above the skin taped on like a barbarian. Not only will it look better, but it's also more reliable. Remember all the way back in 2) where I mentioned the 90 day vs 10 day thing? Imagine you're in the military and on active deployment. Which one do you think the Army is going to assign you? Word on the street is the $SENS system will be the choice of sensor by the military in the very near future and it makes complete sense when you think about how dirt and shit can mess up an external sensor.\n\n\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80 ) This is WallStreetBETS.

I\u2019m just gonna throw a couple of things out there about why this company might not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be, compared to Dexcom. For the record, Dexcom makes a good product, but I hate that company with a passion for more reasons than I can name, so I\u2019m not trying to shill for Dexcom, just offering some insight.\n\nComparing the two is apples to oranges. \n\nDexcom sensor needs to swapped out every 10 days, but it\u2019s done with an applicator that basically amounts to pushing a button. The eversense sensor is replaced every three months, but it needs to be implanted under your skin by a doctor. Also, when it comes to switching, switching sensors is hardly a problem. As you wear them, the adhesive degrades, the readings get less accurate. Swapping them out every 10 days is not a bug, it\u2019s a feature. Would you rather receive a package with your medical supplies and take a couple minutes to install them, or would you prefer to spend money 4 times a year on a minor surgical application? \n\nThis brings me to the next point. Swapping out the sensors and transmitters is exactly what enables Dexcom to sell so fucking many of them. Each sensor costs somewhere around 200 bucks more or less, whether you or your insurance pays for it. You\u2019ll need at minimum three of these per month. The transmitters cost about 300, and you need one of these every three months. If you want to use the system, you can never stop ordering their product, and it\u2019s easy to do so. \n\nThe Dexcom never needs to be recharged, the eversense does. The way the Dexcom works is there is a small transmitter about the size of a button which holds the battery. It\u2019s tiny, unobtrusive, and one transmitter lasts 3 months without any recharging. Considering that it\u2019s something we need to wear 24/7, not having to either plug ourselves in or become separated from the transmitter to charge it and stop receiving readings during that time is a huge advantage. During the 10 day periods that a sensor is worn for it takes absolutely no upkeep, no charging or otherwise. The eversense is also significantly bigger, so for something that needs to be worn on the body at all times this is a pretty big disadvantage. Dexcom can be placed anywhere on the body so people can choose to hide the fact that they\u2019re wearing it, eversense must be placed visibly on the arm.\n\nWaterproofing. Dexcom is waterproof through and through. Eversense is resistant to 1 meter for 30 minutes. This is a huge fucking difference. The eversense is recommended to be taken out during showers or baths, Dexcom isn\u2019t. You can go snorkelling, swimming, boating, etc. with the Dexcom and still receive accurate information, the eversense on the other hand is prone to water damage and must be taken off before all of these activities. What this means is a lot more upkeep, more time that patients aren\u2019t able to wear their medical device, which defeats the purpose. Patients will not like that part one bit.\n\nI could go on and on, but in the end what I\u2019m trying to say is that this isn\u2019t another Dexcom, and there are only so many type 1 diabetics who can afford CGMs (continuous glucose monitors, what these things are called). From what I\u2019ve seen this is not going to be competing with Dexcom on price, they\u2019ll most likely be about the same price to consumers, so unless they were able to offer some type of significant advantage or significant price difference it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019re going to win over much of the market. More than 1/4 of US type 1 diabetics can barely afford their insulin alone and admit to rationing it, so medical devices that cost 7-12k per year or more just aren\u2019t feasible to a lot of diabetics. On the surface I\u2019m sure 3 months vs. 10 days sounds like a huge improvement, but to a type 1 diabetic, the kind of person this device is being marketed to, there\u2019s a lot of other drawbacks that will prevent this from gaining mass approval. Take this as you will, I know it\u2019s disorganized but I just wanted to put a few of my thoughts out there before everyone falls for the \u201c3 months\u201d marketing pitch.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Very interesting response and I appreciate the points you make as an actual user. Yes - there is risk with the SENS product, but I think the idea here is the future, not it's current iteration. How often do you have to go to the doctor for blood work as a diabetic? Could the sensor be another simply part of that visit? I know women with birth control that lasts roughly the same amount of time and it's such a simple and quick procedure that it's worth the 4x a year visit vs taking a daily pill, etc. That's how I view the SENS.

With regard to the daily needle poke the Dexcom is the least of our concerns. We take 5-10 shots of insulin per day, so an extra needle poke every 10 days with the Dexcom is hardly an added inconvenience. The Sens application process is significantly more difficult, expensive, and time consuming. If there is a malfunction (which happens semi-frequently) a Dexcom user can fix it in about 5 minutes by applying another sensor, the sens would require the patient to go to a doctor that works with sens, and especially for people who travel this could be seen as a pretty big problem as it is absolutely essential to have accurate readings at all times. The way I see it this just isn\u2019t that much of an improvement over Dexcom. I can understand how this seems like a breakthrough to a non-diabetic, but I\u2019m just giving my honest opinion here as somebody who has plenty of experience in this area.

Swapping out sensors every 10 days with the dexcom just simply isn\u2019t a big deal to most people, so if the main selling point is that I can avoid that there would have to be other features that make the eversens superior, I would not switch based on that fact alone. Having to recharge the transmitter and not receive readings during that time sounds like a much bigger burden than switching out sensors. As for calibrations the less the better, but some calibrations are to be expected. The Dexcom does not require calibrations at all, but occasionally it\u2019s wise to calibrate to be sure it\u2019s giving you the most accurate readings. Lack of calibrations is nice, but we\u2019re used to a couple of fingers sticks here and there, I doubt that 1/week or 1/month or whatever it is would be a major selling point, more of an added bonus.\n\nAt face value 365 or 180 day sounds nice, but there\u2019s a lot of questions I would have. How often do they malfunction? How quickly could one be replaced or repaired if there is a malfunction? What\u2019s the accuracy look like, specifically when dealing with hypos/hypers? From what I\u2019ve read the insertion procedure is not pleasant, and in their trials apparently they had difficulty extracting them and experienced some breakage during the extraction. Without knowing more I can\u2019t really comment.\n\nBottom line, at least in my eyes, is that they\u2019re trying to fix a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. If they can significantly lower the price to something much more affordable than Dexcom I think it would have great potential, but other than that it\u2019s just a slightly different variation of the same technology, with a couple of small benefits and a few different drawbacks. For a non-diabetic I\u2019m sure that 90, 180, or 365 days vs. 10 it seems like a huge deal, but when you really dig into it it\u2019s just swapping one set of issues for another.

{"title": "Tesla Will Acquire GE - Long Tesla, Boo Boeing", "selftext": "**TLDR**\n\nTesla will buy GE. Tesla will be a direct competitor with Boeing and Airbus while capturing 25% of the market. GE will remain under pressure despite recent gains and Tesla will continue at a beautiful rate despite a few short term dips due to share offerings to generate additional capital. I predict Tesla has $50+ billion in offerings in 2021.\n\n**Storytime**\n\nIt really grinds my gears when I see analysts pontificate about how Tesla\u2019s market cap is bigger than all the other car companies combined. I will say it now, so these ignoramuses get it through their thick skull (and through their helmets), \u201cTesla is not a car company and Elon Musk is not like Henry Ford\u201d. Here is the actual comparison you need to know and allow to be burned into your skull:\n\nElon Musk is the modern day Thomas Edison (and I wouldn\u2019t put it past Elon to electrocute an elephant to put people on Mars)\n\nIf anyone knows the history of Edison, he wasn\u2019t so much an inventor as he was a main of industry, optimizing, building and yes, inventing along the way. I urge all my tri-state autists to venture to West Orange, NJ and visit the Thomas Edison National Park. - [Thomas Edison National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov)](https://www.nps.gov/edis/index.htm)\n\nWe are living and breathing modern history watching this brilliant kid smoke some hashish with Joe Rogan, all the while sending people to space. For anyone who can read here, I highly recommend the Ashley Vance book. For those who are actually able to procreate with someone, you\u2019ll be telling your grandkids about him 50 years from now. Although, the majority of you will never see your grandkids because the only offspring you provided were generated from your sperm bank deposits since you needed the money for GME shares. [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future: Vance, Ashlee: 9780062301253: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/006230125X)\n\nBottom line, Elon\u2019s goal is simple, get to Mars because we\u2019re going to \u201cF\u201d up this planet. In order to blast off and settle somewhere else, we need transportation and energy, of which Elon has been hyper-focused. He\u2019s got the SpaceX thing down pretty well. He has the individual shuttling down pretty well with Tesla. The energy side of things is ready to explode as the battery technology moves into the next phase. What we haven\u2019t seen is intercontinental travel. I\u2019ll talk about that further down.\n\n**Why GE**\n\nTo start, it was Edison\u2019s original company. There is nostalgia that Musk prefers to carry through and likely why he won\u2019t move the entirety of SpaceX away from Cape Canaveral. Even though nostalgia will play a role, it isn\u2019t enough to acquire a $95 billion market cap company. The main reason why GE is a prime target versus a Boeing is because GE is general aviation and energy, with significant downside pressure coming from years of epic failures in leadership. Musk would have been a Jack Welch fan (don\u2019t listen to Suzy as she simply milked whatever fame should could from Jack\u2019s teat and is now a memory at best).\n\nBut seriously, why buy a behemoth of corporate bureaucracy that hasn\u2019t seen any substantial growth since the 90s. Well, my friends, cronyism\u2026.and long term capital contracts that have tentacles into the nation\u2019s energy complex and aviation networks. While this fireside chat won\u2019t go into the $400 billion in annual electricity spending (US only), this would likely comprise about $100-150 billion if taken to a global level for Tesla capturing 20-30%. [table3.pdf (eia.gov)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table3.pdf)\n\nWhy lean into energy faster with GE??? Those damn Chinese. You might have seen some NIO, LI, XPEV and a multitude of others bubbling up on this channel. The infrastructure is needed to support them as well as communist overlords trying to take over the world. These overlords are doing everything they can to get the hell away from coal (not because they are hippies) because they hated wearing masks in Shanghai and Beijing when there wasn\u2019t the Rona. Battery technology represents a long-term growth investment to reduce their overall costs and seeing they keep pulling away from the world politically, they need to be sustainable without help, not even with Russian nat gas.\n\nBattery expansion will only accelerate the more the technology is used en masse. Given the aviation and infrastructure levels not yet tapped into, along with government budgets (works for SpaceX), these two segments are ripe for explosive growth. The biggest headwinds will be discussed with the aviation side in a sec. Needless to say, EV cars are exciting, but batteries are the single key which gets both conservatives and liberals to full chub. The militia types save money with cheaper energy and the flower child gets their green energy. By buying the rights that the GE connections have with governments, will accelerate their growth into them.\n\n**Aviation Domination**\n\nEveryone right now: \u201cSeriously, you\u2019re a blowhard and took forever to get to this\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYou have a point but I don\u2019t know how to take a vacation and still feel compelled to type out long, extraneous things in order to make myself appear smart\u201d\n\nEveryone: \u201cThe helmet with your name on it suggests you may need to go back to playing with blocks\u201d\n\nI digress. Aviation, the real play here. Boeing and Airbus can suck it. Any company that has a backlog of work that spans 5-10 years, is screaming \u201cI trade hookers and blow for favors from politicians and CEOs\u201d. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the capital expense needed to manage through limited demand for highly capital intensive work is a potential for that, however, the same was said about NASA. The price to send someone to space on the shuttle was around $450-500 million. The price for SpaceX to do it, $90-150 million. When Boeing\u2019s average plane costs $85 million on average (without any domestic competition), you know there is room for potential. Let\u2019s break some numbers down:\n\n*Boeing 737 Max Numbers*\n\nAverage price: $99MM (rounded) [\u2022 Boeing aircraft prices 2020 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273941/prices-of-boeing-aircraft-by-type/#:~:text=The%20Boeing%20737%2D700%2C%20listed,ones%20on%20Boeing%27s%20price%20list.)\n\nAverage Zero Fuel Weight: 138K (think passengers, baggage and minimum fluids/gas)\n\nAverage Takeoff Weight: 177K [Boeing 737 Max - Modern Airliners](https://modernairliners.com/boeing-737/boeing-737-max/)\n\n*Tesla Model 3*\n\nAverage price: $40K (rounded)\n\nAverage weight: 4.5k\n\nAverage battery weight: 1k\n\nAssuming we are looking at a 4:1 or 5:1 total weight-to-battery weight ratio, it would carry over into 40-45 batteries of capacity. There would likely be fuel still needed for initial takeoff due to thrust concerns, as well as backup for any emergency or corrective maneuvers requiring more thrust in order to conserve battery capacity. By the time production would take place, we could anticipate even further reductions on battery weight and power output which would further extend ranges. This would equate to being able to build an airplane for under $3-5MM. Given the loss of production efficiency without a true assembly line, it would hover on the higher end of the threshold.\n\nBetween vertical integration and the sheer backlog of more than 12k planes available to capture, not to mention the projected doubling of commercial aircraft demand in the next 10 years, simply matching Boeing and Airbus production would push revenues around $35-50 billion selling the Tesla planes at half the price of Boeing. If they expanded production to capture 25% of share of production over the next 10 years, you\u2019re looking at nearly $350 billion.\n\nPapa Elon is planning to bring people to Mars and will require interstellar transportation beyond 2-4 people each time on the Falcon Heavy. He is likely designing transport that allows for passengers in the hundreds beyond his Starship planning. The transition of moving scalable transportation fits into the aviation front. The only thing missing at this point are wings.\n\n*Market Potential*\n\nBoeing/Airbus Projected 2019: 1550 airplanes\n\nCurrent backlog: 12,300\n\n[Airbus and Boeing Report November 2020 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries \u2013 Defense Security Monitor (forecastinternational.com)](https://dsm.forecastinternational.com/wordpress/2020/12/14/airbus-and-boeing-report-november-2020-commercial-aircraft-orders-and-deliveries/)\n\nCommercial Airline 20-year growth: +22,500\n\n[Boeing Forecasts Challenging Near-Term Aerospace Market with Resilience in Long Term - Oct 6, 2020 (mediaroom.com)](https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2020-10-06-Boeing-Forecasts-Challenging-Near-Term-Aerospace-Market-with-Resilience-in-Long-Term#:~:text=The%20commercial%20forecast%20includes%3A,up%20from%2025%2C900%20airplanes%20today.)\n\nAverage Boeing Airplane Sale Price: $84MM\n\nTesla Costs (Tesla 3 Proxy with multiplier for inefficiency): $3-5MM\n\nTesla Airline Pricing: $50-60MM\n\n**How the hell is he going to pay for this?**\n\nTesla stock will hit $1000 this year. Heck, it may even get up to $2000. My money is on the former. During the continued meteoric rise, Elon will continue to offer more shares to further build the war chest. In the event of a GE takeover, he will do what Salesforce did. He will likely retain 20-30% of the newly acquired war chest and utilize shares for the remainder. The plan would be to sell off GE Healthcare (\\~$20 billion annual revenue) to a Philips or J&J and use that sale to offset a good chunk of the initial purchase. GE may hit $100 billion in market cap this year, but only because of this value shift from some of the tech sector. It will likely depress, to fall back into a trading range that isn\u2019t overly speculative. (Not financial advice in any way, so CYA, lol)\n\nAlso, the reason why this is important, it shuts up every freaking analyst about Tesla being a car company. They can never talk about market caps for Toyota or what Hyundai is doing. It makes no sense because this stock has not traded as a car company for the past year. They need to shut up. It will put short term pressure on Tesla in the short term as is being seen with CRM and the Slack acquisition. One thing for certain, no one has come to say how stupid CRM and WORK are together, only how they are going to be a force to be reckoned with once fully integrated. While stock in the short term is finding its path, the future is going to be incredible.\n\n**What should you do now?**\n\nAs with my other DD and hopefully future ones provided I don\u2019t get the ban stick or I lose wifi privileges, I want to try to put things on people\u2019s radars. Tesla looks like a buy at these levels, despite the swings we\u2019re going to see. GE though, meh. Tesla is building a war chest, like Apple, to accelerate development, through talent and technology acquisition. I foresee the biggest acquisitions that take place next year come from those two in a race for EV dominance. The China story, while exciting the past few months, will have headwinds with regulation, national defense concerns, and a blowing wind of political appetite which is about as easy to predict as the weather tomorrow from your local meteorologist. If China wants to play nice with the US, trademark protection becomes a big issue, and XPEV is the first to get blown off their pedestal.\n\n~~The other major catalyst is a Democratic sweep next week. While expect some pull back on a Republican win for both, either scenario will push things higher, but a Democratic sweep is not fully priced in.~~ Additionally, any significant spike in oil prices this year (a second recession will keep them lower) will further propel EVs in the spotlight. Imagine the EV conversation with $100 barrels of oil. I am still surprised how powerful it has been at $40.\n\nThere will be a moment this year that Tesla\u2019s focus moves beyond cars in the public forum. The only way for them to continue this growth trajectory given the competitive forces popping up are to attack competitors that think they have a monopoly. Ask Lockheed and Northrup Grumman how they\u2019re feeling about their margins in the past couple of years since SpaceX came. The same is going to happen with Aviation (and potentially electrical grid competitors such as Nextera and PSEG.\n\nAnd if Tesla does get into aviation, Boeing and Airbus are going to be under heavy pressure. The airlines would likely benefit heavily, but that would not be truly realized for a few years as infrastructure planning and adoption will take time.\n\nCheers gents (and ladies)!\n\nEDIT 1: Positions for the record - 125 TSLA shares (haven't decided if I'm going to enter GE or not)\n\nEDIT 2: Strikethrough on the Jan election reference (wrote some of that prior to Dem wins)", "id": "llyiln", "created_utc": 1613579701.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "My therapist says if I don't get this out, it could have long term consequences.

When the poor fight back, it\u2019s called violence.\u201d \u2013 The Apocryphal Twain*\n\nUpdate: Originally **BANNED** on WSB for posting this because it didn't relate to stocks. THIS DOES RELATE TO STOCKS. If I get perma-banned for posting literally a discussion about the integrity of the markets, I don't care. Do it. This is about transparency. Fairness. Equal opportunities for all.\n\n\\---\n\n**Yes, there is a US company with assets of $63 trillion that you haven't heard about.** That's a problem. And it's time this company that's relevant to the $GME scandal testify to Congress. The People demand to know if the system is working fairly for all.\n\n**Their name:** The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\"). *See* [*https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance*](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance). **They claim the \"\\[t\\]otal value of active issues held at DTCC\" in 2019 was $63 trillion.** Simply put, they hold your stocks. That year, they settled $120.80 trillion in securities transactions alone.\n\n**What do they do**: Not much - other than **settle almost every securities transaction in the United States.** In an SEC Sample Offering Document, DTCC claims themselves to be \"the world's largest securities depository.\" *See* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1450922/000093041309002195/c55995\\_ex10-3.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1450922/000093041309002195/c55995_ex10-3.htm).\n\n**Why DTCC matters**: Robinhood relies on their subsidiary, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (\"NSCC\"), to help clear their trades. *See* [https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/). Here's a good explanation of what they do: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/).\n\nIn a document on the US Treasury's website, it states the DTCC's shareholders are many banks:\n\n\"DTCC is a holding company of DTC, FICC and NSCC, which are independent legal subsidiaries. There is a single governance structure for the three clearing agencies. DTCC governance arrangements are available publicly and updated on a yearly basis (last update October 2009). **DTCC common shareholders include approximately 362 banks, brokerdealers, mutual funds and other companies in the financial services industry participating in one or more of DTCC\u2019s clearing agency subsidiaries, including NSCC.\"** *See* [https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/standards-codes/Documents/FSAP\\_DAR\\_Settlements\\_NSCC\\_Final\\_5%2011%2010.pdf](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/standards-codes/Documents/FSAP_DAR_Settlements_NSCC_Final_5%2011%2010.pdf).\n\nLet's get this straight, the shareholders of DTCC are the banks? They govern a $63 trillion company (in terms of asset worth, not valuation (come on, people, I know the difference)), by which its subsidiary inadvertently halted meme stock trading on? **How is this not a conflict of interest to the integrity of the free markets?**\n\nTo be clear, I don't know who these banks are. Can't find them. That seems *interesting*. One internet article claims \"DTCC\u2019s user-owners include: Citigroup, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Virtu, Barclays . . . Mellon, Bank of America.\" *See* [https://netinterest.substack.com/p/wtf-is-dtcc-the-story-of-clearing](https://netinterest.substack.com/p/wtf-is-dtcc-the-story-of-clearing). I couldn't verify this.\n\nBetter yet, read this email by Murray Pozmanter, the Managing Director - Head of Clearing Agency Services and Global Operations at DTCC, dated Feb. 1, 2019. First, he states that \"DTCC is the parent company and operator of the U.S. cash market securities CCPs, National Securities Clearing Corporation (\u201cEn Es C C (prevent auto-ban) \u201d).\" Yes, the En Es C C (prevent auto-ban) that runs Robinhood's clearing work. Second, he states that \"**The DTCC common shareholders include hundreds of banks, broker dealers, and other companies in the financial services industry that are participants of one or more of DTCC\u2019s SIFMU subsidiaries, and the DTCC board is currently composed of 19 participant and non-participant directors.** Importantly, our ownership structure also ensures that we direct our primary focus toward addressing industry needs and preserving market stability, which is especially critical during times of crisis.\" *See* [https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/DTCC-4.pdf](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/DTCC-4.pdf).\n\n**It just gets worse.** Back in the late 2000's, DTCC was sued for facilitating naked short selling. *See* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720). *Does this, uh, sound familiar?*\n\nDTCC vigorously defended themselves during the lawsuit, arguing they had no role in the naked short selling issue. There appears to be an archived article stating DTCC's response to the accusation back in 2007:\n\n\"As DTCC has explained, short-selling and naked short selling are trading strategies.\u00a0 These trading activities are regulated and policed by the marketplaces/exchanges, the self-regulatory organizations and the SEC.\u00a0 **DTCC is involved in post-trade processing, which occurs after a trade is completed.\u00a0 DTCC has no regulatory authority over trading activity or to release information related to trading activity.\u00a0 In fact, as we told the WSJ reporters, we have no power to force the closing of an open fail, no matter what the cause, and we do not have the authority to force a buy-in**.\"\n\nThey also stated that: \"**Freedom to trade is a cornerstone of our equity markets and a fundamental principle in the regulatory schemes that govern the markets**.\u00a0 The SEC has flatly rejected the argument that there are such things as phantom shares or credits being created in the market.\" *See* [*https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj\\_response.php?lpos=3&lid=3*](https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj_response.php?lpos=3&lid=3). Boy, would I love the freedom to buy a stock I want, even if Hedge Funds mess up and nakedly over-short a position during a squeeze!\n\nThe SEC also notes that the DTCC has a surprising amount of power to halt trading on a security for operational/transfer issues of a stock or fraud called \"chills\" or \"freezes.\" *See* [https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib\\_dtcfreezes.html](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_dtcfreezes.html). *But does this include jacking up capital requirements for overly-shorted stocks without any public notice and explanation behind the billion dollar deposit?*\n\n**Let's also get this straight**: back in 2007 they claimed to have no authority in **pre-trading**. Only post. So what the hell happened this month with En Es C C (prevent auto-ban) and Robinhood then? Congress, are you listening? \u00a0\n\n**Why this matters**: Recently, Robinhood's CEO Vlad spoke with Elon Musk on Clubhouse, an app where Musk interviews guests. It gets interesting when Musk questions Vlad about the decisions of the En Es C C (prevent auto-ban), the DTCC subsidiary, to post $3 billion of capital at 3 a.m. in the morning during the meme stock trading frenzy. I'll put down the most relevant parts of the conversation here:\n\n8:55 (Musk): Who controls those organizations, those clearing houses?\n\n9:02 (Vlad): \\[Awkward pause\\] Um . . . you know . . . it's a consortium. It's not quite a government agency. You know . . . **I don't really know the details of all that.**\n\n9:15 (Musk): OK . . .\n\n9:16 (Vlad): But, you know, and to be fair, we were . . . we were . . . uh . . . I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets. Like these are events with these meme stocks and there was a lot of activity, so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it's not entirely unreasonable.\"\n\n**\\*\\*Now square this with Vlad's earlier comments during the interview:\\*\\***\n\n4:02 (Vlad): The request was around $3 billion dollars. Um, which is, an order of magnitude of what it typically is. Right so, um.\n\n4:17 (Musk): This seems like this sounds like an unprecedented increase in the demand for capital. **What formula did they use to calculate that?**\n\n4:25 (Vlad): Well, um, yeah, just to give context Robinhood up until that point has raised, uh, you know a little bit around $2 billion in total venture capital up until now. So, it's a big number. Like $2 billion dollars is a large number right. **So, um, basically, the, and, you know, and I, the details are, we don't have the full details**, it's a little bit of an opaque formula but there's a component called the \"VAR\" of it, which is \"Value at Risk\" and, um, that's based on some fairly quantitative things although it's not fully transparent, but it's not kind of publicly shared. So, uh, there are ways to reverse engineer it but it's not kind of publicly shared. **And then there's a special component that's discretionary and that kind of acts like a multiplier.** And, um, basically . . .\n\n5:24 (Musk): Discretionary, like meaning it is just their **opinion**.\n\n5:29 (Vlad): **Yeah**, there, uh, it's a little bit, I mean I'm sure there's something definitely more than just their opinion.\n\nThe full interview is available on YouTube. Search: \"Elon Musk Grills Robinhood CEO Vlad Full Interview on Clubhouse.\" Can't post the link.\n\n**\\*\\*Breakdown:\\*\\***\n\nVlad is asked by this \"consortium\" to post $3 billion, 150% of Robinhood's entire venture capital amount, at three in the morning, or presumably, trading will not be cleared. However, Vlad doesn't \"really know the details\" of this \"consortium,\" but decides it's a good idea to deposit over a billion dollars in capital anyway. Moreover, this so called \"consortium\" apparently by contract can demand whatever they want to. I guess every reasonable CEO posts almost a billion dollars when asked by a group of people he doesn't really know too much about (around $700 million to be exact). *Yes, the figure was later negotiated down.*\n\nFurther, this \"discretionary\" posting requirement is completely absent in Robinhood's explanation to clients:\n\n\"**How do clearinghouses determine how much is required?**\n\nIt\u2019s pretty technical, but the process basically works as follows: clearinghouses look at a firm\u2019s customer holdings as a portfolio. They use a volatility multiplier, looking at specific stocks, to quantify their risk.\" *See* [https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week).\n\nI mean, man, is it really \"technical\" if the capital requirement can also be an \"opinion,\" that is, discretionary? That was conveniently *left out*. The fact is this: Vlad said one thing but *omitted* another. **Why.**\n\n**TLDR/ The Rub:** What is Big Money? It's $63 fucking trillion dollars. The point here is not to peddle some unsupported conspiracy. The point is to expose an **apparent** ***conflict of interest*** and demand those in charge of our markets to reestablish public confidence. If you're going to take away the People's literal \"buy button,\" the People better have a right to know why. **Don't pull a fast one on the working people at 3 a.m. in the morning.**\n\nEdit: Some of you smooth brained folks actually think I\u2019m saying this company is valued at $63T.

Which actually incentivizes them to implement policy to keep themselves from being bankrupt or having solvency issues.\n\nI think the GME trade may have actually caused the markets to blow up. In that as the price of GME mooned, hedgies would have been margin called, leading to their long positions being dumped on the market. This loss in value of various long positions would have caused some long only funds to start getting margin called, which when that happened we would have seen a chain reaction of explosions in a lot of the funds possibly even Fidelity, Blackrock and Vanguard. The most interesting thing about this situation is as GME mooned and good stocks crashed, GME and other meme stock holders would have been in cash, which would have been a huge transference of wealth across the markets.\n\nMore interestingly though is the fact that with the sell side bias on trading, is the amount of options that went OTM. This would have forced so many shares to be short that theoretically we could have seen 30 to 40 million FTDs on a single stock after that day. Which would have been rather interesting when those came due.\n\n \n\nMy disclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only. I am not a legal, tax or financial professional.

That's their first problem - a zero-down margin for *everyone* (and a standard 25% down margin for larger amounts).\n\nIn normal operations some of your customers are buying $STOCK, some are selling $STOCK, at the end of most days Robinhood probably owns roughly the same amount of $STOCK as they did at the start (*I don't even know where to look to see if that's true). But Robinhood had a heterogenous customer base that happened to be all going in on the same stock, and nuts. In GME times, RH had half of their entire userbase buying GME and very few selling, so they had to go to DTCC and buy the stock for all the transactions. As the stock went up, that meant their highest debit to DTCC went up way over the normal amount for the day. That's their second problem, and that one wasn't their fault.\n\nSo at close of market Wednesday, DTCC looked at the debit RH had that day, looked at RH reserves, looked at WSB buying in no matter the price, and imagined the stock barely even going up, hitting $500 and RH users still buying it all day. There were 100million shares traded on Wednesday. RH has 13 million users. Let's say 500,000 of those users initiated a bank transfer and used that automatic margin loan to buy 5 stocks@500 on Thursday morning, and that all the other transactions cancelled each other out as in normal conditions. (*Remember, I haven't the faintest idea what the actual nets were). At close on Thursday, RH owes $1.25billion. Will RH really have that money ready, thinks DTCC? Hmmm. And imagine if it really did rocket to $1000 AND presumably add a smaller debit of the same kind for AMC, BB, etc - wow, that could be a $3billion debit pretty easily!  HMMMMM. Even if you only rate $1k as a 1% chance....\n\nSo after that scary thought, they tell RH they need to put up $3billion by market open, to prove they'll have it there at market close if rockets, and surprise! they don't have that much cash on hand.

{"title": "GME - EndGame part 6: The Big Reset, or The Greatest Financial Crime of the Century - and how to play GME going forward", "selftext": " \n\nThis is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.\n\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. I\u2019ll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. \n\n**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I don\u2019t believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck \u201cdiamond handing\u201d, I\u2019m **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how I\u2019m trading GME. \n\n# Previous Important Posts\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read them and have time, they will provide some background on my previous analysis.\n\n* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven\u2019t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close \n* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME. \n* After the Citron tweet, I shared this [fan fiction on what looked like blatant market manipulation by shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/) on the day of the tweet, and offered some education on strengthening your position. This one got buried and is worth reading. \n* [EndGame Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/) covered the gamma squeeze, potential shady tactics by MMs, and some tips for staying safe. \n* [EndGame Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6y7om/gme_endgame_part_4_the_saga_continues/) covered the continued gamma squeezing and the resulting tenuous position of the \\~50M shorts that were still in GME. \n* [EndGame Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7clyl/gme_endgame_part_5_they_couldnt_win_so_they/) (deleted by mods, posted by someone else in comments) went into the implications of the absolute mindfuck trick the shorts pulled when they limited buying of GME (and other heavily shorted stocks)\n\n# Important External Reading\n\nThese three non-reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook. This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong-arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th. My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the **DTCC/NSCC** to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood, and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th. I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value, representing what is probably one of **the greatest financial crimes of the century.**\n\n* Anatomy of a Short Attack - Seeking Alpha article from 2014. Can\u2019t link it. Search for it. Key tactics that shorts use (and have used on GME)\n   * Flooding the offer side of the board\n   * Leveraging counterfeit shares\n   * Media assault [(see my post on coordinated put buying with the Citron post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1tg88/gme_how_shorts_manipulated_you_and_how_you_can_be/), and pay special attention to media treatment of GME to drive down sentiment)\n   * Analyst reports (BofA coming out with a ridiculously low price target)\n   * Frivolous SEC investigations meant to distract the SEC \n      * Like [this one filed against DFV/Roaring Kitty](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210216006262/en/HAGENS-BERMAN-FILES-SECURITIES-CLASS-ACTION-Complaint-against-Keith-Patrick-Gill-MML-Investors-Services-and-Massachusetts-Mutual-Life-Insurance-Company-over-GameStop-NYSE-GME-Stock-Manipulation)\n   * **Pulling margin from long customers** \n* [Illegal Naked Shorting: **DTCC** continuous net settlement and stock borrowing programs have loopholes that facilitate illegal naked shorting ](https://smithonstocks.com/part-7-illegal-naked-shorting-dtcc-continuous-net-settlement-and-stock-borrowing-programs-have-loopholes-that-facilitate-illegal-naked-shorting/)\n   * \u201cThere is an integral relationship between the DTCC and hedge funds\"\n   * On regulation SHO: \u201cHowever, Wall Street has a bag of tricks to get around this requirement.

The SEC seems strangely unwilling or unable to enforce this provision of Regulation SHO.\u201d\n* [\u201cHow phantom shares on Wall Street threaten U.S. Companies and investors\u201d](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/) (March 2020)\n   * This article is **a bombshell -** a **former DTCC employee** whistleblowing fraud in relationships with DTCC and short funds \n   * What\u2019s happening with GME **happened before** with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: \u201c**evidence that more shares were sold than ever existed**\u201d\n   * \u201cThe main problem is that Reg SHO has no real teeth for enforcement. **The brokers** are never called to be responsible for their behavior.\u201d \n   * **Banks play by different rules!** \u201cThe SEC continued to declare that fails to deliver were not an indication of naked short selling. That changed when Goldman Sachs and other financial firms needed to be protected. Trimbath pointed out that **not till the banks/broker-dealers began to see massive numbers of fails to deliver in their own shares did the SEC put a short-selling ban in place \u2013 but only for the shares of banks, insurance companies and securities firms**, including the very culprits responsible for the dirty system.\u201d\n   * \u201cWho controls the DTCC? **The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC\u2018s services, who process trades there, who fail to deliver there, are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors.\u201d**\n\n# History of shares and shorts on $GME\n\nHere\u2019s some history on GME that\u2019s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. \n\n* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GME\u2019s share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)\n\n* **GME used to be in the S&P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **It\u2019s very likely GME was shorted out of the S&P.** \n* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axl9ipwqw2i61.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd2743962405738469193d7e6c59d3068f1f8d78\n\n* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9fdeyrrw2i61.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772\n\n* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  \n* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. \n* **There are many strange connections between DTCC\u2019s actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhood\u2019s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhood\u2019s users had GME. \n   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.\n   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a \u201cturn off buying or else\u201d kind of arrangement. \n   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesn\u2019t care about shooting down Robinhood. It\u2019s a minor toe amputation to save their leg. \n   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \\- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it \n      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, you\u2019d know something interesting.** \n\n# Why GME went up\n\n* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. \n   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When there\u2019s **high trading volume relative to total float**, it\u2019s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. \n   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) \n   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: \n      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was\n      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more\n      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them\n      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME \n   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. That\u2019s why GME shot up. \n\n# The Big Reset\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. \n\n* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). It\u2019s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. \n* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. \n\n# However, this is not the end for GME\n\n* Everything started with value on GME\n   * At $50, we\u2019re back to a value play. GME\u2019s market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)\n   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, we\u2019re not too far off from that right now. \n   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink \n* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) \n   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. He\u2019s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he\u2019s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. \n      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen\u2019s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. \n   * **Regulatory involvement.** It\u2019s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. \n   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think it\u2019s unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. \n   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didn\u2019t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. \n      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhood\u2019s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on \u201cdowngrade\u201d under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** \n\n# How I\u2019m thinking about GME now \n\nThis is going to sound extremely strange, but **I\u2019ve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I can\u2019t wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadn\u2019t bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but I\u2019m slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. \n\nNone of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of \u201cGME is another blockbuster destined for death\u201d is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. \n\nSince part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). \n\nI believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I don\u2019t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m hoping for a further dip. I\u2019m **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. \n\n# Suggestions \n\nThis is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. \n\nHere\u2019s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. \n\n* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **that\u2019s a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So I\u2019m selling calls against my remaining shares. \n   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \\~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that don\u2019t sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of \u201cpennies in front of a steamroller\u201d but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**\n      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). \n      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. \n      * Two scenarios:\n      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that \u201ccan\u2019t go tits up\u201d.\n      * \u201cDownside\u201d risks:\n* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - don\u2019t fomo. \n* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it\u2019s an **attack vector** for you. \n* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn\u2019t resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you\u2019re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. \n* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and don\u2019t pay you for it, margin call you when you\u2019re winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I don\u2019t think the \u201cfree\u201d commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.\n* **Minimize regret; don\u2019t maximise profitability.** I sold some shares \u201cearly\u201d on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for \u201cmaximum profit\u201d led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.\n* **Don\u2019t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I\u2019ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I\u2019ve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. \n* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It\u2019s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you\u2019ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. \n* **Don\u2019t sell on dips.** You\u2019re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it\u2019s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.\n* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.\n\nThis is not financial advice; do your own DD. I\u2019m holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.\n\n# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?\n\nOn February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions I\u2019d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. \n\n## Dear Vlad,\n\n1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?\n\n2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?\n\n3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying?

If not, please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th\n\n5) Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME. I e. Maplelene Capital\n\n6) There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron's tweet announcing their pending argument against gme. Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame?\n\n7) What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital?\n\n8) Have you ever paid for media placements against GME\n\n9) Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise\n\n10) Did Melvin open short positions on X-\"R\"-T when they closed their short gme positions\n\n11) Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts.

When you buy 1 Call option you can execute to buy 100 shares, but when you create and sell 1 Call option you *might* be **forced** to sell 100 shares at the option price. \n\nSo looking at OPs example, he created and sold a put option that forces him to buy 100 shares for $7000. He was paid $4200 for someone else to have that right. If the option expires and the price for GME is more than $70 he made free money. If the price for GME is less than 70 then he will pay $7000, but it will only cost him $2800 because he has the $4200; and if the price for GME is greater than $28 he can still sell those shares for a net profit.", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.029449017718434334}, {"body": "High priced premiums for options.

I like hydrogen as a technology. It will eventually supplant batteries. Irrespective of iterative advances in battery tech it has always been a stop gap measure as the limitations will always exist. Hydrogen solves many problems of batteries. Yes it is more expensive now but name one tech that did not start expensive and then drop in price with mass market acceptance.

Considering that the shares are worth considerably more now I\u2019d say both amazon and Walmart made out like bandits and now everyone should be worried if they decide to sell those shares. Amazon alone got about 55 million shares in this deal, god forbid they think that plug power is overvalued.\n\n https://www.barrons.com/articles/plug-power-stock-soared-how-walmart-amazon-benefit-from-green-energy-rally-51605915901\n\nOn top of all this there is a long list of companies that were at one point in time plug power customers yet the company no longer mentions them with amazon and Walmart.\n\nCompanies such as Volkswagen, Kroger, Nike, Coca Cola, Kimberly Clark, fedex and Sysco no longer show up as customers. They still do business with the likes of BMW and Home Depot. But considering their only product right now is their forklifts losing customers with big warehouses seems dangerous.\n\nCustomers they do highlight can be found on their website.\n\nhttps://www.plugpower.com/about-us/customers/\n\nSecond point, two of the deals plug power highlights are with Renault and Acciona are Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs). In the business world that means they\u2019re basically an agreement to agree on a deal possibly at a later date. There is no plan or charter that comes with the declaration, no money is being exchanged for goods or services, no consequence for either party if no deal occurs in the future. In other words the MOU is about as worthless as the paper it\u2019s printed on.\n\nIf you need an example of this, please see Nikola and GMs MOU and see how that turned out.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding\n\nThe deal with SK group is real and props to Plug Power for acquiring it. However it should be noted that the entire country of South Korea is currently at a cross roads with adopting any green energy tech at a large scale due to many factors. They\u2019ve attempted it before in the past and failed but are making a second attempt now but they\u2019re policy seems to be all over the place, they won\u2019t go nuclear and they won\u2019t use hydroelectric so it really only leaves solar, wind and hydrogen. So this could just be a speculative investment by SK group.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_South_Korea\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-environment-newdeal-analys-idUSKBN23F0SV\n\ncurrently hydrogen power isn\u2019t really \u201cgreen\u201d in fact over 90% of hydrogen produced is done so with fossil fuels and big shock a lot of SK group business is with fossil fuels \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel#Production\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK_Group\n\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/010721-south-koreas-sk-group-to-invest-15-bil-in-us-fuel-cell-maker-in-hydrogen-push\n\nSo I wonder who will actually produce the hydrogen for plug powers hydrogen fuel cells in South Korea and who will get billed for it?\n\nThird point, their CMO idk why you mentioned because she has worked in marketing at companies I\u2019ve never heard of, so that\u2019s a ringing endorsement.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ppanded\n\nLastly I believe a lot of Plug Power\u2019s run up from last year was simple hype from Joe Bidens green new deal. Just like the hype we\u2019ve seen for legalizing weed and the effect on its stonks, or the hype around his stimulus plan or the hype around his student loan forgiveness plan. All of which he\u2019s been relaxing the rhetoric from the campaign trail and will have an uphill battle getting them approved and funded, so expect some half promises. Will he get his green new deal and if so how much of its funding will go to hydrogen power? \n\nThat part I can\u2019t answer but what I can say is that there are still a lot of challenges around hydrogen power and if PLUG has any hope they\u2019re going to need an all out spending spree and full support of the US government to build the infrastructure and acceptance needed.\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-storage-challenges\n\nhttps://dps.mn.gov/divisions/sfm/programs-services/Documents/Responder%20Safety/Alternative%20Fuels/FuelCellHydrogenFuelVehicleSafety.pdf\n\nhttps://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/hydrogen_production.html\n\nOh yeah they also sold another billion and a half in shares.
