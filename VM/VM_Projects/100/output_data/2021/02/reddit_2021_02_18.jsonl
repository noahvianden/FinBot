I took issue with what you were claiming most junior engineers enter the field making 200k and the fact you were saying $500k isn't uncommon. 200k is pretty extraordinary for juniors, hardly the industry norm. A select few unicorns will pay that and a few FAANG will pay that to some juniors but as you can see above that isn't the median for junior engineers. \n\nAlso you can see in the very data that you linked to, a $500k TC puts you in the 98th-99th percentile of engineers.

I know it probably isn't technically considered insider trading, but there has to be some sort of law against that sort of inside information, right?\n\nEdit: he said days before the spike, not day. My bad. My point still stands valid, though.\nI'm talking about what he said on stream earlier, not any speculation or other bullshit.

I'm too broke and retarded to be sued, so IDGAF about telling people I'm not a financial advisor. Buy $GME because it's a great stock, not because I told you to buy $GME.

I'm not holding any options because I'm too poor but I hold 40 GME @ $36 and 1 tesla @ $834.\n\nFinal final edit: I'm aware this isn't actually insider trading by definition.
