{"title": "Stock goes lower, puts go down", "selftext": "I've written a few posts on GME, AMC et al lately and one of the things I've been trying to point out is how risky long premium trades, especially non-spreads are when the parabolic short squeeze is over. (This post uses GME as an example but this applies to all stocks like it)\n\nTL:DR ... Vol gets crushed, even puts, and even puts when the stock is moving lower.\n\nToday is a perfect example. GME was down 100 dollars to $225 and every put from the 285 strike down *lost value.*\n\nIt's a little counter-intuitive but hopefully, it will make sense if you consider a few reasons why. Essentially, in a short squeeze the crashes are to the upside and are very difficult for options to price. Short squeeze stock options are priced more like commodities than stocks (commodities crash to the upside). As the stock flies higher implied vol rises, and when the stock reverses and goes lower, implied vol falls.\n\nHere's an interesting comparison. The first chart is the monthly expected move in GME from last week when the stock was $300, pricing in a move of about 90% and a bullish consensus near $570 and bearish near $40: [chart](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-27-at-10.28.26-AM.png)\n\nNow here's the expected move based on today's closing prices in options, about 85%, but with the stock much lower, and a bullish consensus just $369, and bearish near $30:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jl4i6nd1x3f61.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7cc4af6347dfadab62e28950d3c5851fb3a22e6\n\nNow obviously, 85% of $200 is a lot less than 90% of $300 in dollar terms. And that's a good starting point to understand what happens when these stocks go lower. In both cases, the at-the-money straddle is trying to price the risk of the stock going higher, or back towards zero.\n\nBut options can't price the straddle so that it's *below* zero. So as the stock goes lower, that straddle needs to collapse. The risk to market makers (I'm a former market maker) is getting plugged with a bunch of options premium that needs the stock to go *lower than zero* to make money. (Remember, every option bought or sold by market makers is hedged delta neutral, turning it into a synthetic straddle). Believe me, it's painful getting plugged with collapsing vol.\n\nSo what happens is vol gets crushed as the stock goes lower. And the more methodically it goes lower, the worse those puts do. (very similar to buying OTM calls, watching a stock creep up towards your strike and realizing you actually lost money despite getting the direction right.)\n\nThere are trade types that can help alleviate the pain of collapsing vol and most of them involve trying to sell options, either as outright credit spreads or at least as vertical debit spreads that lay off some of the high vol.\n\nLike a short squeeze, a vol crush does eventually end as well. Ironically it probably involves a bounce in the stock at some point. I made this point in a post last week at [Learn](https://learn.optionsai.com/how-a-short-squeeze-might-end-and-whats-going-on-in-options-with-gamestop-examples/) with some examples like bearish flies or 1x2s, and of course call spreads rather than calls for what is likely to be much more modest squeezes higher if and when those do happen again.", "id": "lajeac", "created_utc": 1612227463.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 138, "comments": [{"body": "Great post.

Retired now and just run my own family office. Yes, I will say there are some large hedge funds/global investors that are setting up retail and quite frankly outplaying other institutional investors. Not only in GME but across the board. I'll share a little on what they are doing. Let's start with the perceived Gamma squeeze where they buy a bunch of calls and jam the stock getting not only retail to jump in, but chartist on breakouts and hedges trying to cover in mass. Now, this same BigBoy (we shall call him) is also shorting the stock (boxing his long) to at a point he has squeezed out other shorts. Then guess what, he reverses his play. He buys puts and blows out of his long side and rides a short wave down. And then reverses or moves on through the ABC of stocks. The Big BOY gets to pull the strings of US puppets while hiding out of sight.  As a fundamental investor this makes it extremely difficult to invest and even short fraudulent companies. I know of numerous frauds that have tripled in the last year. Yet, this also goes unchecked because the SEC is understaffed, underfunded and the lack of true regulation and transparency, etc. etc. long boring discussion. But to get back to the topic. Yes, retail is being played to promote positions in some ways but also a retail investor has the ability to get in and out very quickly (normally). Trust me, when I had a 1/2 billion hedge fund, it is not easy to get in and out of positions. I can't imagine running a fund now and having to cover a short or get out of an illiquid long. LAST, thing I will say. I hear a lot about a short squeeze. Don't forget. The longs that push a short squeeze still have to sell. I wouldn't want to be long the \"High Short Interest Stocks\" when the market crashes. Too many sellers trying to get out at once will be one of the biggest gap downs in history in a lot of stocks. This is my first comment on reddit lol. Not sure how much I will be on, but glad to help out. Oh, one more thing. It has been awhile since I ran a fund, but I remember long time ago firms would create synthetic shorts or calls for us that likely did not show up in the \"information\". Don't believe for a second you can't be played. But the biggest accident waiting to happen is all the crappy companies that have gone up 10X their value that when the dust settles in a few years (give or take)  will be down 90%. A lot of heavy shorted stocks and \"Shit Broker\" promoted stocks will end up in a bear market back in the toilet. (watch China Hustle for a heads up on one of those firms). Lastly, GME - sorry to be a spoiler, but don't think for a minute hedge funds didn't net a profit on this one. How many people have gone to Gamestop stores lately and talked to employees? It is nice for some well known celebrity CEO's to tweet, but the reality is till GME has a makeover it is just a wallpaper trading stock and if you talk to people in the stores - the makeover is not there yet. Now, I am always thinking out of the box. What could they be doing (online, products, etc. that could transform the company) I don't know, but till they do, it is an overvalued trading stock and there are easier risk/reward ways to make money.

You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nThings looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.\n\nNow, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.\n\nBut what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.\n\nMelvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.\n\nOne of two things can happen to these people:\n\n1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able\n2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.\n\nThis logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.\n\nSo what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.\n\nNow, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**\n\nIf shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?\n\nNormally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.\n\nIf they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.\n\nAnother question to consider:\n\nIf shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.\n\nThe final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.\n\nNow, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.\n\nNow, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:\n\n1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.\n2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.\n\n**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.\n\n**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question. \n\n**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.\n\n**EDIT3:** Revolut has set AMC and GME to sell only today. I can\u2019t wrap my head around these moves, but the squeeze is over? Not likely...something simply doesn\u2019t add up here\n\n**EDIT4:** Today\u2019s volume already blows away yesterday\u2019s and Fridays giving more merit to my thesis. Trading restrictions still have complete blocks on GME but RH opened the flood gates an hour ago. My God this stock is exhilarating.\n\n**EDIT5 - 02/03 08:17** I know everyone wants an update to my option and I would love to give one. Sadly the transformer in my building has blown and the power is out on my entire side of they building. This means no heat and no electricity. My dog and I are freezing and worse than that I work from home. \n\nA quick update on my personal opinion, I\u2019m still bullish. Yesterday was expected, I didn\u2019t think it would go under $100 but we figured it would be bloody. Today is very interesting with T+2 definitely being over that means we are starting to get some Failure To Delivers. GameStop getting listed on the [short restriction list ](ftp://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210202.xls) makes things interesting as well. Apparently Warren is also pushing for an emergency meeting, just speculating but it could result in a 30 day trading halt. Moral of the story, I\u2019m still bullish, Im still holding, this is all speculation, anyone who pretends it isn\u2019t speculation is full of shit. You ultimately have to decide.

So option sellers suddenly had to buy and deliver shares that they didn't expect they needed and that caused a huge temporal spike in price.\n\nI see no mechanism for such a play with GME.\n\nInstead, I see a parallel between GME and the \"most shorted stock of 2019-2020\", TSLA.\n\nThere was no single point in time when shorts covered on Tesla. Instead, it was a long bumpy ride throughout 2020 which ended with a $40B loss for shorts. But no point in time.

I'll repost here for people to read, might be helpful to have another perspective:\n\n>Here's what I think. I'm trying to put my feet in the shoes of managers working at the institutions on both sides of this play. I'll simplify it to the **BlackRock gang** and **Melvin Gang (longs vs shorts**). Both of these gangs have **ownership of equities and debt across the markets, in every industry.** Kind of like a bunch of mob families in Little Italy New York. There's tension between them, and the conflict can spill and hurt innocent parties outside the immediate conflict (in this case, the squeeze's impact would spill into other areas of the economy and cause instability).  \n>  \n>Just like in \"The Big Short\", people high up there know each other. Probably over the weekend, they've been calling back and forth, manager to manager, to find a way to put out the fire and maintain the peace. Because if the short squeeze happens, some of the big whales in Blackrock gang would get burned (not their positions in GME, but other unrelated holdings across the market that might get devaluated). BlackRock might momentarily gain from a squeeze, but even that's temporary since the price goes back down - they'll never enjoy the inflated \"squeezed\" value long term (maybe 5 years from now it will be $150 if Ryan Cohen pulls off a Chewy). It's not worth it to them to have the rest of their portfolio be in danger with a potential downfall of the market (worst case scenario). If I were a manager at any one of these funds, **I would have been aware of a squeeze a week or two ago already** (they've got teams of analysts analyzing their equities around the clock, forecasting all potential outcomes and valuations with their sophisticated data models) and planning accordingly.  \n>  \n>Given the widespread expectation of a squeeze happening, and forecasting the impact, **as a manager at any one of these institutions I'd rather it be that a few retail casualties get burned from losing money on a risky play, bring the price of GME back to earth and stabilize it, keep the markets from fluctuating so other positions of mine remain steady, and let GameStop get back to turning around their company**. This would be in my best interest as an institution with a lot on the line, rather than letting retail investors blow up the company's price and participating in a \"major distribution of wealth\".  \n>  \n>Don't get me wrong, as a retail investor, I personally say fuck it give me the money!! I saw my portfolio go up to life changing values this week, found myself fantasizing how I could buy a house for my mom like she always wanted, and giving her the freedom to finally leave her 9-5 dead-end job. But I got greedy. I thought I was smart, joining a herd, riding a tidal wave that these sharks could never handle.  \n>  \n>But realistically, [the information out there is asymmetrical](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asymmetricinformation.asp). We don't have the full picture, whereas they do (or at least more than we do) since they probably have each other on speed dial. The media can't be trusted - we're getting updated with short interest numbers only once a month (by the time we get accurate numbers it will be too late), or some random ass estimations from S3 who change their narrative 180 degrees in a 6 hour timespan on a Sunday because of who knows what (Did Melvin capital slide some money to S3 to confuse the retails? Highly possible). These guys can call each other up and talk numbers, specifics, in a way that the public will never be able to because the average retail investors (not downplaying the amazing investors I've come across in WSB - but the majority are truly retards that follow trends) are not professionally equipped to make market impacting decisions.\n\nThese institutions can also sweep through all these (public) posts on Reddit, Stocktwits, Twitter, gather their due diligence on what we would do, what are our strategies, and pull out a card that we'd never anticipate or expect. It's like we're playing poker, but they can see our cards and also know which cards are coming next from the deck. It was never meant to be fair. u/Deepfuckingvalue was incredibly prudent, but also took a risk that couldn't have forecasted Ryan Cohen's entry or stock purchase. It played out well for him, and good for him, but if we want to make our riches it will have to be on another play.\n\n*Edit:*\n\nI'd like to specify one more thing here. Let's take things a few weeks back - was BlackRock gang in communication with Melvin gang? No, I don't believe so. Were they aware of the fact that they were trying to short the shit out of their holdings Gamestop? Absolutely. Blackrock gang have their convictions as to why they think Gamestop warrants a long position. Melvin gang have their convictions as to why GME is worthless. The >100% interest is an anomaly for sure, but neither gangs expected the media coverage that ensued along with the swarm of retail investors trying to play at the poker table. The stakes got much higher a week or so ago, the second all those call options expired ITM. Shit got a lot more serious, for both gangs, once a squeeze became realistic - which is why I believe there may have been some kind of behind the scenes communication to resolve the issue before it got too out of hand. The HFs got fucked this month, they were punished. Perhaps enough by Blackrock gang's standards.\n\nBy no means is any of this financial advice.

I could have understand if they just restricted buying on margin and options, but they didn't. \n\nWhen you buy a share on Robinhood, it actually causes Robinhood to go short on that share temporarily. That's because they give you the share without actually having it. They give it to you, then they have to turn around and go actually find it.

I'm trying to put my feet in the shoes of managers of institutions on both sides of this play. I'll simplify it to the BlackRock gang and Melvin Gang (longs vs shorts). Both of these gangs have ownership of equities and debt across the markets, in every industry. Kind of like a bunch of mob families in Little Italy New York. There's tension between them, and the conflict can spill and hurt innocent parties outside the immediate conflict (in this case, the squeeze's impact would spill into other areas of the economy and cause instability). Just like in \"The Big Short\", people high up there know each other. Probably over the weekend, they've been calling back and forth, manager to manager, to find a way to put out the fire and maintain the peace. Because of the short squeeze happens, some of the big whales in Blackrock gang would get burned (not from their investment in GME, but because of their holdings in other areas of the market). BlackRock might momentarily gain from a squeeze, but even that's temporary since the price goes back down - they'll never enjoy the inflated value long term. It's not worth it to them to have the rest of their portfolio be in danger with a potential downfall of the market (worst case scenario). If I were a manager at any one of these funds, I would have been aware of a potential squeeze a week or two ago (they've got teams of analysts analyzing their equities around the clock, forecasting all potential outcomes and valuations with their sophisticated data models) and planning accordingly.\n\nGiven the expectation of a squeeze happening, and forecasting the impact, as a manager at any one of these institutions I'd rather it be that a few retail casualties get burned from losing money on a risky play, bring the price of GME back to earth and stabilize it, keep the markets stable so other positions of mine remain stable, and let Gamestop get back to focusing on turning around their company. This would be in my best interest as an institution with a lot on the line, rather than letting retail investors blow up the company's price and participating in a \"major distribution of wealth\".\n\nDon't get me wrong, as a retail investor, I personally say fuck it give me the money!! I saw my portfolio go up to life changing values this week, found myself fantasizing how I could buy a house for my mom like she always wanted, and giving her the freedom to finally leave her 9-5 deadend job.

We don't have the full picture, whereas they do (or at least more than we do) since they probably have each other on speed dial.

These guys can call each other up and talk numbers, specifics, in a way that the public will never be able to because the average (not downplaying the amazing investors I've come across in WSB - but the majority are truly retards that follow trends) retail investors are not professionally equipped to make market impacting decisions. These institutions can also sweep through all these (public) posts on Reddit, stocktwits, twitter, gather their due diligence on what we would do, what are our strategies, and pull out a card that we'd never anticipate or expect. It's like we're playing poker, but they can see our cards and also know which cards are coming next from the deck. It was never meant to be fair.

Then I turn to the volume overall. Volume was less than 10MM a day until January 13th and then it really took off and exceeded 100MM for 4 out of 9 days. 10x increase in volume, mostly after the last officially reported short data as of 1/15. This, in my mind, was not all retail buying. You just don\u2019t see retail investors with that kind of buying power.\n\nNow, volume is back down to 35-50MM but that is still 5x+ where it was just 2 weeks ago. I see this as still high volume, not low volume.\n\nAll of this leads me to believe the early shorts have in fact covered.

I get that denison has a very good resource , but i dont see how they become a producing mine in this bull cycle. \n\nAm i nuts?

For all the reasons you mentioned, they are (and have been) a homerun uranium company.\n\nBut the reason I prefer Denison Mines, if only slightly, is because of the following reasons:\n\n1. They have the potential to have the number 1 asset in the world. If they can make the ISR mining method for their deposit work, which judging from the quality of their team and recent studies would be feasible, their all in sustained costs ($8,90) and extraordinarily high grades (19.1%) will see them generate an incredible amount of free cash flow at pretty much any spot price.\n\n2. They have the backing from some of the most wealthy people in the business. The Lundin family has a very successful record in the mining business and I believe it will not be blemished by Denison.\n\n3. They are co-owners (22.5% stake) in the state of the art Mclean Lake Mill, which processes ore from the eastern Athabasca Basin. This stake gives them a lot of leverage, since building and permitting a new mill can take several years.\n\n4. They have big stakes in companies like Goviex Uranium and Skyharbour, which essentially gives them another way to get a significant amount of capital should they choose to sell these stakes later in the bull market. Those have of course already increased in value substantially these past few weeks and should look to go much further in this bull market.\n\n5. The cash flow as you already eluded to, is not that significant, but it is definitely helpful. Their fees for management of UPC and care and maintenance on idled mines generates come cash flow.\n\nAs you can see, also a homerun company in my opinion. The key difference in my view is that with Global Atomic, you get a great company that is clearly on a great path towards production and will probably reach that target within this bull market, barring a black swan event of course.\n\nHowever, with Denison you of course buy into a great company, but you also buy into the potential. As we all know, potential is an important factor in any valuation, although it can be relatively hard to quantify. Should Denison get into production within this bull cycle with anywhere close the numbers they mentioned for Phoenix, which I think is plausible for the reasons stated earlier, they will be an absolutely incredible investment and I think the best preforming junior in the sector from this point onwards, barring some nano caps that can of course always outperform by getting a massive discovery.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Hey dude what are your thoughts on Bannerman?

Thing is, is that were likely going to need to see $75 for them to start construction on their open pit etango project.

Measured + inferred = 160 mill lbs so 160 x $4.5= 720.\n\nThis is all speculation so only time will tell but let me know your thoughts on this. I do have a question about Denison.

{"title": "What you should learn from the meme mania", "selftext": "How is it going my homies\n\nI [made this post on investing](https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8yi83/common_misconceptions_about_markets/)  a few days ago explaining all of the QAnon fantasies and why the top could already be behind us. Some people listened, processed information and asked questions. Some called me a person working for Melvin and hedge funds.\n\nIt\u2019s all in the past, but if you got burned on GME or other meme stocks, here are few things you should learn about the markets and trading these bubbles.\n\n1. Set a price at which you will exit and take profit. Don\u2019t look at what happens next, and never rebuy  if the price continues growing. Likewise, set a stop loss at which you will exit no matter what. \n\n2. Never, and I mean never put in more than you can afford to lose, or even lose sleep over. I have a pretty decent portfolio, and I only put in 0.5% of it in the play. I don\u2019t give a shit about that money, but I still took profit and got a 250% ROI. Easiest cash I\u2019ve ever made, easier than blowing a fat dude in the back alley behind a strip bar.\nAnyway.\n\n3. If you hear about shit on the news. It\u2019s probably not a good time to enter. There is a reason why some early people made money on the play. They understood mechanics of what was driving the increase in price. Many of them didn\u2019t even expect a short squeeze, they just like the fundamentals. Likewise, if your 80 year old grannie (say hi to her from me) calls you and asks you about this magical company called GameStonk, sell that shit right away. \n\n4. Always double and triple check information posted on forums and don\u2019t take it for a truth even if it has a lot of upvotes. The amount of misinformation I saw on WSB over the past week with 100 thousand upvotes makes me want to vomit.\n\n5. Stock trading is not a team activity. It\u2019s not us vs them. It\u2019s a fucking free for all, and people will drop their bags on you if they see their unrealized gain turn into an unrealized loss. You want to make money? Do your research, and be the first one on the train. Don\u2019t jump on the train when it is speeding and going off the rails.\n\n6. If you don\u2019t understand how something works, learn about it. Again, the amount of conspiracy theories that I read about ladder attacks and this grand illuminati conspiracy is driving me nuts. Always use the Occam\u2019s razor, meaning if there is a simple explanation to the situation, it is probably right. There is no need to build out this conspiracy theory for something you don\u2019t understand, it does not help anyone.\n\n7. You will get FOMO and you will get confirmation bias. Everybody does, but learning how to battle it is crucial. Look, my dad was a fucking casino gambler in his 30s playing blackjack and losing money, and I have the same traits. Does it mean I need to be the same? No, and I always remember my genes when trading. It is not an excuse to use when you lose money.\n\n8. Realize that situations like this are extremely rare, and if you expect to make 300% gain in 3 days, I have some bad fucking news for you, markets don\u2019t work like this.\n\n9. Finance gets complicated real fast. Yes, on the surface it\u2019s just buying and selling. I have been studying this shit for 5 years, and I still don\u2019t know a lot of things. There are reasons why even some of the smartest people still lose money. Shit, Newton was burned on a South Sea bubble. Yes, that guy who discovered gravity lost money just any of us. \n\n10. One bad trade does not define you. As long as you learn, and don\u2019t repeat the same shit again, you are golden. There are plenty of ways to make money on the markets, be it value investing, selling options or setting up butterfly spreads. \n\nTL;DR: Be smart, not dumb.", "id": "lb65qf", "created_utc": 1612299287.0, "score": 1046, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 379, "comments": [{"body": "Knew a guy that went through an entire 8 deck blackjack shoe and won every single hand.

{"title": "GME taught me the importance of being independent", "selftext": "I started investing right when I turned 18 in the summer of 2020. I'm talking index funds and ETFs, the boring but good stuff. Ended 2020 with a 34% return thanks to the raging bull market which made me pour even more money into it. I bought into the GME hype at $34 dollars but eventually dca'd my way to a solid $64 average cost. I got caught up in the bullish GME echo chamber that [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) now is - I was just lucky to get in and out early compared to others.\n\nAs WSB's member count went through the roof, more and more users commented price targets and abusing people into not selling. By going to these users' history, a lot - and I mean A LOT - had comments from 2 days ago along the lines of \"where to buy stocks?\". It just made the echo chamber even clearer. These people, who had no idea, were commenting advice and about the future of GME. I'm a beginner too but I wouldn't even think of pretending like I have a clue. The quote \u201cIf shoe shine boys are giving stock tips, then it's time to get out of the market\" have always stuck with me, but I never put much credibility into it, until now.\n\nI eventually dca'd my way out at an average cost of $206 after reading about the conspiracy theories regarding why the reported 53% short interest was false. Maybe it is false and maybe these hedge have pulled off a great move in suppressing this % without actually covering in order to mislead investors, but I would never bet on that. Took $3.1k profit which was cool, but this whole situation has made me realize the importance of being independent.\n\nIt has motivated me to actually learn how to read a balance sheet, do my own due diligence and come to my own conclusions - not depend on others. Reddit, Seeking Alpha and Twitter are great resources to take inspiration from, but I'll never invest through someone else's thesis again even though it worked out this time.

In reality, those should be accounted for as shorts can buy those as well as any of the original shares they borrowed.\n\nThe way it's usually explained is that the shorts must return the shares to the rightful owner, but there's nothing stopping the original owner from selling their share while it's borrowed. The short holder could just as easily buy the share they borrowed from the original owner as they could buy it from the one he sold the borrowed share to.\n\nBesides that, they are reporting the actual shorts have decreased, down to ~27M shares now.

Alas, it seems the short squeeze was cut short (no pun intended) by numerous brokers shutting down demand by limiting or outright preventing buying. It wasn't just Robinhood that did this, mind you. They were at the forefront because I do believe most retail investors use it, and they didn't handle the heat very well. Webull limited trades on it, Etrade did as well. Hell, even TD Ameritrade did for a time period, among others.\n\nI think if anything in all of this deserves investigation, it's these brokers. They had a huge impact on the outcome since this coincidently happened around the time of the spike, which is presumably when the shorts covered. But, they've laid out a reasoning that does have merit. Is it 100% truthful? Probably. This will shake the financial sector if not. Should they get off scott free? Not sure. I am by no means an expert on law or even trading for that matter. But, a class action has been filed and consumers have a very legitimate complaint.

I do pretty good diligence in the stocks I invest in, if not just refrain from purchasing random stocks and rather in companies I actually believe in.\n\nI had actually been following $GME ever since it was around $30-$40 and it gave me a good laugh. A friend and my brother messaged me about it a week later when it was around $70. I always make the joke, when regular people start messaging me about something I've known about for a while, that's probably a top indicator. I bought 1 share around $80 (<0.05% of my portfolio) just so I could track the price but never had any intention of buying.\n\nAs the price kept going up, I bought a bit more at $150 (maybe 5%), then finally put a big bag (around 40%) in around $250. Super uncharacteristic of me. I told myself wow this could blow up, but that usually means I'm too late (historically speaking). This one time I actually did buy into the hype for some reason. I never buy options because they are in my opinion, just straight up gambling, but when my friend kept pestering me and saying hey I bought an option for $1k and it's worth $50k, now I bought. I had ample opportunity to exit with a very small profit and leave this for the people who like day trading. I set a stop loss, and when it hit (5 minutes later) I bought back in.\n\nIt sucks to say, but I made my bed and now I'm lying in it. In the back of my mind, everything that I was doing was categorically what I told myself I'd never do and even after multiple chances to exit in the green or (slight red), I denied them either because of peer pressure or populism. I think I was a bit frustrated because the market been kind of wonky lately and I felt like fundamental trades I was making were just not performing as well as they should've. But, as much as I would like to blame others, I can't. Nobody forced me to do this--it was just a very expensive lesson.\n\nRegarding r/wallstreetbets. I agree with most of the posts here. I followed for the memes and never once planned on making a trade based on any information there. It's fun to see people and their huge wins, but I always understood those were the outliers and realistically most people just post loss porn on there. With all the being said, the state of that subreddit scares me. Now, it's pretty much a cult and any differing opinion on there seems to be suppressed because it doesn't hit the diamond hand narrative. There is so much information not only on Reddit, but in the news that should raise some red flags of any rational investor. I'm not sure what I would do if I was u/DeepFuckingValue. Like many have said, he was ridiculed in the beginning, but now that he is still posting his loss porn, people are holding on to that one sliver of hope and refusing to sell--people that probably have a cost basis of $400, not $20. I get it to a certain extent, if you've already lost 90% what's the point of selling the other 10%, but I just hope that people can make these decisions by themselves and not be pressured by the mob. I'm a grown ass adule, but damn I never thought I would have let my friend persuade me like this (on me, not him).\n\nIn any regard, I hope that people that were burned by this weren't hurt too bad and can take this as a very valuable lesson. If you made money, all the more power to you--wish I was there with you! For beginner investors, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU ARE PREPARED TO LOSE. MORE IMPORTANTLY, DO NOT LIE TO YOURSELF REGARDING THE AMOUNT YOU ARE *ACTUALLY* WILLING TO LOSE. It's a lot different to say I'm okay with losing $X and actually seeing $X gone from your account.\n\nI was aware of the risk I was taking, I didn't bankrupt myself--but boy does it suck going from 120% returns to only 30% over the last year.

I did cash in, not like DFV but I made a solid salary in a handful of weeks by the time I got out, which admittedly so was still too late. IMO the long term for the company is something I still believe in (right or wrong that\u2019s for you to decide). I also believe there is still an outside shot at a squeeze to some level and am prepared to hop back in if it looks to be happening. And I will definitely be buying back in for the long term once the stock settles down because I do believe in Cohen and Fis Ame for the long term. It\u2019s brick and mortar retail and could absolutely go bust, but I\u2019m fairly young and can withstand the variance. \n\nHaving said all this, I do think the hype went too far. The HF just don\u2019t lose long term. They can lie, cheat, steal, and whatever other illegal maneuvers they have at their disposal all the way until the end. Looking at the clear ladder attacks and charts of both AMC and GME it\u2019s pretty clear there is absolutely foul play at hand and the theory behind the short squeeze maneuver was and still is correct (in my belief) but when you are playing in a play field with no rules theory goes out the window unfortunately. I do think GME was still a solid play at $100+ the plus being what you defined your own risk to be, mine would have been around $185, but you had to have an exit strategy and be able to identify when enough was enough for you. Anything into the 200s and especially approaching $300 I would have said stay away.\n\nEven, quite regrettably, staying in too long I still cleared ~90k in a matter of weeks which I fear is going to be an anomaly compared to the rest of the retail investors who made the play and are left holding the bag.

And they stop realizing how much money they(some, not all \ud83d\ude02) actually made (and still could make) and start focussing on drops based on the price where it\u2019s at today.

{"title": "The dip before the Volkswagen short squeeze is misleading", "selftext": "I keep seeing people reference the dip that Volkswagen took before it squeezed, but I think that it's completely misleading. Volkswagen went from a high of \u20ac421.18 on 10/16/2008 to a low of \u20ac198.72 on 10/24/2008, a drop of 52.8%, but this had nothing to do with the short squeeze. This was part of a broad market pullback in which the DAX 30 (German equivalent of the DOW) fell over 25% between 10/14 and 10/24, and several of the largest German companies such as SAP also fell over 50% like Volkswagen.\n\nThe short squeeze wasn't initiated until Sunday, 10/26, when Porsche unexpectedly announced that it effectively raised its stake in Volkswagen to 74% through call options. This is what triggered panic among short sellers due to the fact that this would reduce Volkswagen's public float to just 1%, while 12.8% of the stock was shorted. As a result, the stock rocketed from its Friday closing price of \u20ac208.16 to a high of \u20ac978.92 on Tuesday, 10/28, a rise of 370% in 2 days. It quickly fell to a closing price of \u20ac508.84 the next day, and continued falling in the months following.\n\nSo, what I'm saying is the VW dip that has been spread everywhere across this sub had nothing to do with the subsequent short squeeze.

Friday, Thursday and Wednesday all had MASSIVELY more volume than yesterday. This indicates that the price is volatile *because all the shares are being HELD.* THIS IS GOOD! When combined with the high buy vs sell ratio this indicates the true supply-demand equation (outside of manipulators) is tipping towards our favor. This is why, even though the graph looks different, people are sure this corresponds to the Volkswagen dip just before lift off.\n\nThe reason why the Volkswagen dip also matters is because of what Mark Cuban is talking about. Dips bait short sellers into doubling down, and also indicate high volatility due to low volume. We can't be *sure* that's what was happening during the dip, but given it fell twice as far as the DAX and then rocketed higher than any other comparable squeeze, sure seems like all these factors combined into a dip followed by one massive rocket.

GME before the squeeze was at $40 and went up to $460. It 10x\u2019d compared to the VW squeeze which was 5x. (Basically my point in this is that all those posts saying \u201cyou are here\u201d and pointing to the valley before the spike in VW are WRONG. You are not before the spike, you are currently AFTER)\n\n3) there was a fundamental reason for the valley in VW stock to begin with - the whole market pulled back. For GME this confirms the end of the squeeze. The market is rallying right now and GME is down 50%. It\u2019s done\n\nI get it. We all want hedge funds to burn. We all want to stand up to wall street. But I\u2019m really worried about some of you. Some of u guys bought in massively at the peak or close to it and are \u201cholding\u201d because of some greater purpose or because DFV or some other people are posting they are. \n\nConsider that DFV is still MILLIONS or dollars in the green with contracts expiring NEXT YEAR. Some off you have positions at the peak and contracts expiring next WEEK. \n\nAlso consider that WSB isn\u2019t the only force, or even the primary force, behind the short squeeze. There was a post by someone earlier last week that showed some hedge funds and insiders had gone long because they smelled blood in the water and they knew they could take a piece of Melvin and citadel to boast their returns. You think hedge funds don\u2019t prey on each other? Come on. \n\nMy point is, I really do believe the squeeze was sqwaze already and that now we won\u2019t see those prices for GME again, just like VW never saw $1000 again. GME 10x\u2019d from December and 20x\u2019d since November. On nothing but buying pressure on shorts. You really think we are going to get more?! \n\nI say this with a lot of love for this community. I\u2019ve been here since February when WSB promised the crash was only getting started and we would see SPY 210 puts print by June. Yea you guys remember how that went right? \n\nI don\u2019t wanna see some of u guys lose everything you have. I want the memes to continue. There\u2019s always other opportunities.

On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of \u201ethis is over\u201c, \u201ewe missed the squeeze\u201c, \u201eI am going to loose it all\u201c, \u201eentered at 320$ - I am doomed\u201c. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.\n\n**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**\n\nYou realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET \u2013 yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! \u2013 and follow DD posted by people with names like \u201eSHOW\\_ME\\_YOUR\\_ANAL\\_TITS\u201c? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry \u201eOne-Wish-comes-true\u201c show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn\u2019t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don\u2019t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments \u2013 this is about \u201eget rich or die trying!\u201c. This is not r/investing!\n\n**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**\n\nIf this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this \u201eSaudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts \u2013 but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now \u2013 could be though the next big thing \u2013 got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET \u2013 the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize \u2013 you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn\u2019t do if you like the system).\n\n**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? \ud83d\ude13**\n\nSo there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It\u2019s a fucking global movement now (or not \u2013 could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8eand the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy \u2013 we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven\u2019t understand the concept or how this works \u2013 speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up \u2013 desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors \u2013 shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious \u2013 you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let\u2019s be fucking honest \u2013 most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody \u2013 I even don\u2019t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).\n\n**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**\n\nDeal with it \u2013 we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That\u2019s it. If we are right \u2013 this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock \u2013 do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought \u2013 hmmmm makes sense \u2013 I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \\[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don\u2019t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) \u2013 no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the \ud83d\ude80 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.\n\nSo please \u2013 no post without \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and if you want to fukn leave the party \u2013 leave \u2013 but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.\n\nP.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I\u2019d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  \u2013 I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e \n\nEdit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \\- so you can simply award his original post referenced. More importantly he expressed to me that he is very happy with the translation which is almost as important as the message itself.\n\nEdit 2: Please pay attention to AMA Marc Cuban - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey\\_everyone\\_its\\_mark\\_cuban\\_jumping\\_on\\_to\\_do\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/) \\- there is I think some quite enlighting answers in a very easy to understand language.\n\nEdit 3: Bought 5@103 \n\nEdit 4: Heading for dinner. Crazy times. Will check later and decide whether to buy more tickets or not. But maybe good advice for some others to make a break. Chillax :)\n\nEdit 5: Read that RH has opened up GME again. For whatever it's worth \ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 6: Thanks again for all the Awards and stuff. I can only reload in the morning. Was fun and maybe I am going to translate more in the future - if mods would consider to give me a copy cat \ud83d\ude3a flair it would be the icing on the cake.\n\nEdit 7: Obligatory salute to the one and only DFV and his \ud83d\udc8e balls.

And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock. \n\nBig hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time). \n\nBut, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:\n\n#  \u00abIf you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.\u00bb\n\nThis is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We,  the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy? \n\nThey are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to **HOLD** this is precisely what they fucking meant. **TO FUCKING HOLD**. **THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.** \n\nYou genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen? \n\nHold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, **patience is key.** Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ***\u00abPatience. Disruption is never easy or straight line\u00bb.***\n\nGuys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to **HOLD!** This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to **HOLD!** This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to **FUCKING KEEP HOLDING**. \n\n**JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?** \n\nMAN UP BOYS, AND KEEP HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE\n\nPosition: 15 shares supported by Europoor", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ups"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Legendary shotcaller grade pep talk.

Ladder attacks continue to bring prices down which short firms want so that if we decide to sell they can collect our stocks at low prices. They want all the stock back they owe brokers, but they can\u2019t win if we never sell no matter how low the price. Whether that\u2019s $0, 19 cents, or $1. If you sell your stock in GME or AMC you\u2019re only suiciding and negging. Remember that we can put in limit orders for lower prices to ensure we get the stocks we want during these ladder attacks(which will inevitably happen) but as long as we hold we keep our position in this tug of war. Ladder attacks are a double edged sword that we can use to our advantage to buy more stock at cheaper prices    to hopefully and eventually buy up any and all the stock game stock has to off(most of the reddit community knows this by now). The only hand short firms have right now is manipulation whether that\u2019s through media, numbers fudging(ladder attacks) , and ultimately emotional manipulation(if you\u2019re emotionally invested in this). Don\u2019t let your emotions make you sell.

You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nThings looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.\n\nNow, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.\n\nBut what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.\n\nMelvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.\n\nOne of two things can happen to these people:\n\n1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able\n2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.\n\nThis logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.\n\nSo what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.\n\nNow, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**\n\nIf shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?\n\nNormally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.\n\nIf they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.\n\nAnother question to consider:\n\nIf shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.\n\nThe final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.\n\nNow, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.\n\nNow, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:\n\n1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.\n2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.\n\n**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.\n\n**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze.

This seems like a de-risking action stemming from a liquidity issue because of increased deposit requirements with the clearing houses due to massively increased volatility. When you issue a buy order, the broker has to offer collateral to a clearing house until the trade settles (usually a couple days), so they need to have enough capital for all the buy orders, usually the deposit ratio is a few % but in this case it was elevated to 100%. On the contrary the reason that selling wasn't halted is because when you issue a sell order, the broker only has to have the stock being sold (which they already have access to if you are selling them).\n\nFrom a trading perspective this seems juiced out, the likely thing here is that it's going to 30-60usd in a few weeks, the stock just has no legs to stand on and if shorts have indeed covered already it will downtrend once buying excitement fizzles out.

You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nThings looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.\n\nNow, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.\n\nBut what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.\n\nMelvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.\n\nOne of two things can happen to these people:\n\n1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able\n2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.\n\nThis logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.\n\nSo what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.\n\nNow, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**\n\nIf shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?\n\nNormally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.\n\nIf they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.\n\nAnother question to consider:\n\nIf shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.\n\nThe final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.\n\nNow, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.\n\nNow, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:\n\n1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.\n2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.\n\n**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.\n\n**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze.

That means all the hedges that spent millions upon millions shorting  the stock in the 2-3-400's have made and absolute killing!! This could  be upwards of a 20-30X gain depending on where they originally shorted  GME and mostly likely it was in the 10-15 range. Even if they shorted it  at its peak in the 40's that is still most likely a 8-10x gain.\n\nWe brought it this far, and relenting would be doing a massive disservice to GME for any future plans they have! Since they have not released any news, one can assume they did not take advantage of the 3-400 price range and sell some stock to fill their company's bank. So now with it around $150 and going lower, unless this takes the rocket to Mars, we put them in an even tougher position than before.\n\nCan we trust the #'s every guru seems to be posting on Short % and all that?

{"title": "Data-Driven DD: I analyzed 265,000 rows of SEC Short Fails-to-Deliver data so you don't have to! (Extremely important data for Counterfeit Stock theories)", "selftext": "# The GME SEC Data and Hedge Fund Shitfuckery: A Deep Dive\n\nAs I'm sure many of you who have been following the \"Counterfeit Shares\" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \\[post\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\\_real\\_reason\\_wall\\_street\\_is\\_terrified\\_of\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \\[\"Counterfeiting Stock 2.0\"\\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.\n\n**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the \"counterfeit\" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Data:**\n\nI noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \\[releases\\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**\n\nFirst, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding \"counterfeit share\" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28\n\nAs you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more \"counterfeit shares\" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c\n\nGameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either \u2014 if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**\n\nMoving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f\n\nNow, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of \"counterfeit stock\" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure \u2014 when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.\n\nHere's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.\n\nA table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0pj2hh0647f61.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcf2d64f6777218dece7735075b779fb51e28cca\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**\n\nSo, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\\* or could be indicative of something more.\n\n*\\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream \u2014 GME in December was not an \"unprecedented situation\" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:**\n\nI want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \\[\"Counterfeiting Stock 2.0\"\\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)), detailing both the \"surface level\" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3io9bj847f61.jpg?width=1086&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d67bbec3d7d4e3b2012b3d51cdaf462ae3318d\n\nAs you can see, the Counterfeiting 2.0 authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been \"laundered,\" through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting 2.0 paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.\n\nIf, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting 2.0 are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.\n\nThese illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.\n\nSo, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting 2.0 were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.\n\nI'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not a financial advisor, and I do not advise any readers to make financial decisions based on my opinions or the information presented in this report.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: shout out to /u/zjz for finally approving the post, may you live long and stay retarded!", "id": "lb8hjc", "created_utc": 1612304990.0, "score": 10276, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 639, "comments": [{"body": "> my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall \n\nDD with interjections like this is what makes WSB unique, something I have missed with the current sentiment of \"hold or die\"", "score": 1298, "replies": [{"body": "Fellow analysts unite!", "score": 84, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28648725152015686}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 40, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.029453398659825325}, {"body": "Based", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14576658606529236}, {"body": "This is impressive!!
