Hopefully theta decay means it costs much less to BTC than the credit I got for selling, but if IV spikes enough it could potentially cost more (and since high volatility is exactly when the market moving around after hours is most likely, this is exactly when the BTC is most important).\n\nTo avoid this entirely I can trade index options like SPX or XPS, which are cash-settled and European, though obviously that limits my choice of underlying substantially (plus you can't trade these on Robinhood which is inconvenient).\n\nIs that correct?\n\nETA: Also because the PMCC is a diagonal spread not a vertical spread, to end up with (max? any?) loss the market would have to move far enough while I'm pinned so that it's below the strike of the long leg (and by enough that time value of the further dated option doesn't make up the difference), otherwise I just exercise/sell the long leg on Monday morning, right?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Two different things. \n\nPin risk is any short contract that gets assigned right at the last minute. It doesn't have to be in a spread. You are pinned to that commitment but can't control the deliverables (like short shares in the case of a short call) until the next market session. All kinds of things can go wrong while you are pinned to that holding, like the stock moons in overseas trading.\n\nRelated to pin risk is a diagonal where the short leg *might* be assigned, but you aren't sure if it will be or not. The market for options closes at 4pm but the cutoff for exercise can go as late as 5:30pm, so all kinds of shit can happen to the stock in after hours trading that changes it from maybe ITM to definitely OTM. It's particularly bad for a split spread, like you have a 100/120 and the closing value is 101. Your 120 long call is OTM but still has value since it is further out in expiration. It's too late to sell to close, but you could exercise. But if you exercise, you throw away any gains on the call itself. What to do? Say you put in the exercise order and then 20 minutes later the stock drops and now it's around 99. Is your short assigned or not?

You\u2019re holding 100 shares of XYZ long term. You\u2019re content with holding long term, but you\u2019d be alright with selling it off sooner for a potential profit. Because of this, you write some covered call options to collect the premiums, and hey, if the stock goes above the strike price, cool, you collect the premium, take a bit of profit, sell your 100 shares, and you\u2019re happy. \n\nHowever, if the stock falls below the strike, you\u2019re cool with still holding onto the stock, cause you\u2019re in it for the long term. You collect the premium, the value of your stock goes down, but you\u2019re still holding, and can still use the underlying for future covered call plays.\n\nIf your playing with underlying assets that you\u2019re willing to hold long term, the up and down price fluctuations of the underlying don\u2019t matter, because holding the stock is more important than the stocks current value (given a long play)\n\nNow, as the stock goes down the premiums you can collect will be lower, but as the stock price goes up, you run the risk of assigning the option and selling your 100 shares.

If you were to buy one ATM call and sell one ATM put, your risk profile is identical to if you owned the stock outright.  You're doing the same thing, but moving the strikes around.  By moving those strikes around, you have a wider range where you won't make nor lose any money if AAPL goes up or down, but stays in that range. You'll still collect the premium, so that's profit.  The movement of the underlying just won't change profit at expiration if it's between the strikes.  \n\nI've not really considered this position in much depth, but it seems like the advantage here is if you're neutral short term, you can collect the premium on the put you sell at the cost of if the stock goes up, you'll be missing out on the gains between the two strike prices.  So if the underlying was $40, you sold an ITM put with a at $45 strike and bought a $60 call, your potential profit is the same anywhere between $45 and $60.  Above $60, your profit starts increasing again.  Below $45, you start losing money, though your breakeven should be $40 less the credit you received.  But if the stock is below $45 at expiration, you should expect your Puts to get exercised.  So make sure you have the cash.\n\nAs far as how much you will lose, it would be the cost of the Call you bought that expired worthless, plus the difference of the Put's strike price and the price of AAPL at expiration.

The first - If I sell to close and it's shifted to someone else, I might have \"closed\" my trade, as in I am not long.

She was apologetic, but explained that the options were \u201csupposed\u201d to be assigned and were not assigned, and then TD spent the better part of the week manually \u201cfixing\u201d everything. She literally said we had a \u201cglitch\u201d and sorry for that, but now it\u2019s fixed.\n\nI said, well was the option assigned on 2/12 or \u201csupposed to be\u201d assigned? She said, no it was assigned, but then again later in the convo said it was supposed to be assigned\u2026 \n\nI asked, why did it not settle on the 16th like the one contract did? She said it was an error. She then described the whole ordeal as \u201cwe just fixed the display\u201d, as in your account should not have \u201cdisplayed\u201d those 400 shares. But I asked, well was it the display or were the shares sold on the 22nd? She admitted the sale occurred on the 22nd.\n\nI asked, why did it take 11 days to settle if the option had been assigned on the 12th. She again cited the glitch.\n\nAlthough she was polite, I could tell she was a bit amped (wavering voice; imprecise language) I was polite throughout - not taking it out on her and said as much, but explained that I just wanted to understand.\n\nI did say I didn\u2019t think TD could do what it did (i.e. settle past 2 days). She got defensive and tried to shame me by saying well if $1MM was deposited into my bank account, and I went out and spent it, then the bank could claw it back. She also said \u201cwe allowed you to keep the premium\u201d from those intervening calls I sold the week of the 15th.\n\nI said her analogy was imprecise as it was reasonable for me to assume that only 1 of 5 contracts were assigned, the other four were past the settlement date, and thus, I had every right to believe, and trade, on those remaining shares. I also asked what would have happened if I sold those intervening calls at a longer expiration date. She explained that I would have been \u201cnaked\u201d and that they have had that situation occur in other accounts and are working with those individuals to determine how to address it.\n\nI asked if there was anyone else I could talk to as I rejected her excuse and that I think TD violated the rules. She said, sorry, there is nothing else to do.\n\nI talked to CCO (through their chat functionality). They were not much help except to confirm that assignments would have occurred by 10 PM ET day of expiration, settlement should occur within 2 days, and that it sounded like the problem was with TD and that if I had a complaint, I should raise it with FINRA.\n\nThey did confirm that an ITM option might not exercise.\n\nI\u2019m mulling this all over. End of day, we are not talking a lot of money ($2,000 or so depending on how you want to value it all), but it\u2019s frustrating if you are trading weekly and want to know what you have and what you can sell against.

OCC further informs option writers that \"\\[i\\]t is possible that an option writer will not receive notification from its brokerage firm that an exercise has been assigned to him until one or more days following the date of the initial assignment...\"\n\nI get all that, and that is fine. I just think that TD needs to follow the rules too, and those rules require settlement within 2 days. \n\nI wouldn't be able to go to TD and say, sorry, I meant to sell the stock three days ago at its high, but a \"glitch\" prevented me from doing so. They'd laugh in my face. I know this is a different situation because according to TD the option was exercised, but if so, then the burden is on them to settle in a timely manner and they failed to do so.

I will focus my attention on say 10 strikes up and down from the ATM strikes (manually) and make the spreadsheet calculate the IV and greeks for all those 40 call/put options. Right this moment I am not looking for the spreadsheet to suggest me some trades based on some risk/reward model - I am not a programmer. But that would obviously be great. Visual P/L of the strategy etc are superb at a later stage.\n\nI am not looking for an exact solution to my requirement but **a basic structure for calculating the IV and greeks in a spreadsheet would be nice.** Then I will adopt/ replicate it to my needs/ option chain as mentioned above. I am hoping that I do not have to reinvent the wheel.\n\nPlease let me know if some spreadsheet is available or any group working on it. I am afraid since most of the members here are from the USA and have access to great platforms like think or swim etc, no one really has a reason to do all that. But please do let me know.

From what I've read, it seems that my taxable gain is calculated by adding the premium received to the strike price of the called away shares, minus the original purchase price of the underlying. Since the premium gets baked into sale price of my shares, does that mean that the premium earned would qualify for long-term capital gains treatment if the underlying shares were held for more than a year?\n\nSo then is it not true that premiums received from writing covered calls are \"always\" taxed as a STG?\n\nAny insight would be helpful!

You can buy this right at a fraction of the price of the actual stock. This price (option premium) depends on many things but it is a fraction of the actual stock price. So there is a leverage offered to you.\n\nThe large sum - actual cost of buying 100 shares of the stock at the strike price - comes into play only when you want to exercise that right.

In such a  case you never need to have the whole cost of 100 shares with you at any point of time. Once you sell to close you have neither right nor obligation with that stock. You are free to start a new trade afresh. \n\nThere are several useful links at the top of the page.

And this risk is offset by a lower premium.\n\nIt's the other way around. Premium is the money you pay the seller to compensate them for the risk they are taking. Since the seller's risk is lower the further OTM you go, the premium is lower. It's the same reason that an insurance company charges less for a fire insurance policy on a brick house in the suburbs vs. a policy for a log cabin in a forest.\n\n> So why do further OTM calls have a higher breakeven price? What's the incentive to buy a call that is further OTM? I'm trying to understand how you calculate profit on an OTM call.\n\nI'll explain why in a second, but first let's put break-even price in perspective. The full term is break-even price *at expiration*. It only applies at expiration. Since you should never hold options to expiration in the first place, it's a relatively pointless number. I'd advise ignoring it unless and until you are backed into a corner and are forced to exercise at expiration after a series of unfortunate events.\n\nFor a call, OTM means a higher strike price than the current stock price. A higher strike price means the break-even is higher, since the stock first has to reach the strike, then has to go over the strike by the cost of the contract. Break-even price = strike price + cost of contract.\n\n> What's the incentive to buy a call that is further OTM? I'm trying to understand how you calculate profit on an OTM call.\n\nThe incentive is that they cost less than other alternatives and they provide tremendous leverage. If you can buy a call for $0.10 and it goes up to $0.20, that is a 100% rate of return. If the stock underlying that contract only has to go up $1 for you to make a 100% return on your money, that is humongous leverage.\n\nYou don't have to exercise or hold to expiration to make money on OTM calls. All that has to happen is the value of the call itself has to go up. And it doesn't have to go up very much if your entry cost is tiny.

Well, as you understand the buyer of the call has limited risk. The seller of the call has unlimited risk. Hence the term \"naked\" call is used with a call that is shorted without adequate protection and not to one that is bought without sufficient money to purchase 100 shares. To mitigate the risk the seller/shorter/writer should ideally hedge the \"naked\" short call. Traders writing/ shorting a call are liable to issue 100 shares per option at the SP of the call. So, the best hedge for a call writer is to have 100 shares already in their a/c. This makes it a \"covered call or CC\" - the risk is covered and it is no longer a \"naked\" call. Same applies to a put option. A naked put is hedged by keeping the funds ready to buy the stock. This is called \"Cash secured put or CSP\" \n2.  Sorry I did not understand - \n\n>... the seller of their call option must \u2018close\u2019 that option....Durant the sale close out threat sellers option? \n\nPerhaps what is meant is that if neither the buyer nor seller are able to physically deliver or receive the 100 shares then they should close the position before being assigned or getting in to expiry holding ITM options. This makes the transaction at the level of premiums and not the whole 100 shares worth.

It could be because it doesn't make financial sense and I'm just not seeing why so i was hoping to get some clarification, and possibly a name if this actually is a popular strategy. So let me give a rundown and example.  \n\nLets say I have 100+ shares of QQQ and I am very bullish. I want to potentially buy more stock, or profit from its continued rise if possible.  \n\nSo, given a current price of $314 I use a strategy with two options. I buy an OTM 330 Call (with Aug 20 expiry) for $1670, to benefit if the stock goes above 330 (or actually 346.70). I also write a slightly ITM or even ATM 315 Put (with Aug 20 expiry) for $2537 of credit, meaning this trade net me a profit currently of 2537-1670 =  $867.  \n\nIn this situation, if the stock is below 315 (or actually 289.63) on Aug 20, I will have the possibility that I ill be asked to buy QQQ at 315. Could end up losing money in the short term, but I am bullish anyway and would hold. If the stock is between 315 and 346.70, then both options would expire worthless, and I would keep my 867 credit, but not end up with any more shares. And if the stock price shoots up above 346.70, then I will benefit from the IV of the call options and can potentially close the long call postion for profit, and leave the short put, so I will have locked in the Call gains and would be willing to purchase the Put shares if the stock for some reason plummeted.  \n\nIs it that this is basically a synthetic long, but maybe the difference in strike prices means a credit when you purchase it, but a debit if you were to sell it, so it cancels out anyway and might as well just do a synthetic long at the same strike price anyway, or something like that? does this have some sort of downside that I am not seeing (other than the stock price potentially going to 0 and still having to purchase the shares at 315)?  \n\nAlso, please correct any terminology used incorrectly or let me know if my logic is just flawed somewhere and I am missing it, it is 100% welcomed.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">If the stock is between 315 and 346.70, then both options would expire worthless, and I would keep my 867 credit,\n\nNot 346.7 but 330. Between 315-330 both options would be worthless and you will retain $867 credit. At 346.7 you gained the premium on the Put. You are required to buy 100 QQQ at 330. If you sell them then you will receive whatever you had paid for the call. So your net gain would be $2537 (Put premium)  and not $867\n\nI had made a mistake writing this earlier. I deleted the post almost immediately. My apologies if anyone has seen that post. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And if the stock price shoots up above 346.70, then I will benefit from  the IV of the call options and can potentially close the long call  postion for profit,\n\nIf the stock shoots above 346.7 then you will benefit from the price movement itself. IV and time to expire would add to that benefit. More importantly from current 314 if QQQ moves up the call prices will start increasing depending on DTE and IV. You do not have to wait till 346.7 to see a profit on your call.

{"title": "Blackberry Ivy + AWS: Deepdive", "selftext": "As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY. *Following is a deep dive into that partnership* in anticipation of the AWS and IVY webinar on Feb 23rd 2PM EST.\n\nIvy benefits the whole value-chain\n\n* IVY enables **automakers** to create personalized driver and passenger experiences by allowing for a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights. **AKA feed** **OEMs MORE DATA that is actionable**.\n* The **developers** won\u2019t need specialized or automotive software skills.\n\nModern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.\n\n* The **consumer (driver)** gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performance/experience along with safety of their data\n\nData is the new Gold/Oil\n\nBB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago.\n\nIn a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy \u201cBy the way this project, we\u2019ve **been working with Amazon** has taken us probably about **2 years**..we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, **obviously not as elaborative as today**..\u201d.\n\nHe goes on to say that this **creates a recuring data business for BB**. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckensey&Co report outlined (see my summary) connected cars (the new iPhone) will **allow for the OEMs to monetize data from connected cars**. We all know that 7/10 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from data-based services.\n\n**Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:**\n\n1. QNX provides Amazon with a secure, safety certified OS (aka the \u201cplumbing\u201d or ecosystem Ivy will be built on)\n2. BB secures all endpoints in the Internet of Things\n\nPer Frost & Sulliven report, a comprehensive endpoint-based security platform should be able to protect against 97% of cyberthreats (attacks). Per F&S, BB can currently protect up to 96% of all cyberthreats **and secure ALL IoTs endpoints.** Possible endpoints (Cars, Phones, Computers, Smart-Appliances, Drones, Smart cities, etc). Its easy to see why Amazon would partner with BB, as another reddit user pointed out, Drones being the most interesting one. By the way, John Chen also mentions Drones in a different interview.\n\n**What does Amazon provide BB:**\n\n1. AWS experience with user interfaces\n2. AWS Cloud\n3. Machine learning models from AWS Management Console\n\nCompetition\n\nChen points out that he is not worried about **Apple and Google** entering the space as they also only have experience with user interfaces and **lack experience in the OEM space with the ecosystems**.\n\nAnother important distinction is that **Ivy allows** OEMs to \u201cown their customer,\u201d Google/Apple may not allow that to happen as they want to own the data. **\u201cBB is only transporting the data\u201d** **to the OEMs**. If you\u2019re an OEM and you understand the value of data, would you choose an OS that lets you own the data or an OS that keeps it for itself..\n\nBB really has a unique opportunity in front of them, the **automotive space is rapidly changing** and 2023-2025 is going to look a lot different than it does now.

It will go up, way up (or at least that is what I believe). I am fairly confident that their profits in a decade will be massive (hundreds of billions) justifying a market cap well beyond any company today.\n\nThe simple aspect is the batteries. If they can get to 3 tWh at a cost of $50 per kWh and a retail value of $100 per kWh, that is $150B in profit pre-tax. No one else has a path to such levels of production. The 4680 cells are what enables this.\n\nThe cars, with eventually single frame casting (and 4680 structural cells), will be cheaper and better from the most fundamental aspect then anything any competitor can put out for the next decade at least. They will have very large profit margins as a result and will be able to increase sales very rapidly (as quick as they can build the factories). Profits will be beyond any current automakers.\n\nBack to batteries that will enable sales of solar panels on a massive scale. Profits there will be tremendous as well. It comes down to volume production in an efficient (and cost-effective) manner. Solid-state, even if density is higher will be slower to produce and will not likely cost less.\n\nIf FSD is realized, and it sure looks close, will afford massive opportunities in selling commercial licenses (and consumer ones). The value of this is easily going to be well north of $100B in profits. Note, every Tesla has the hardware for it. Also FSD is seemingly in large part a data collection problem, which Tesla has over a million cars and growing that can provide needed data to solve this.\n\nThere are many positives and when I get down the nitty gritty, no one comes close to what Tesla is doing. They all make it sound like they are doing great stuff, but they are not close.\n\nPorsche, is going to be years behind Tesla later this year when the 4680 cells and single casts are out. The performance benefits of the Taycan over the current Tesla's is primarily due to Porsche spending a lot of effort on temperature management for their cells (and Tesla using the 18650 and 2160 cells still). The 4680 cells will absolutely blow away what Porsche is doing. It will not be close. All that will be left for Porsche (and Audi) to sell cars on is the luxury and build quality aspects (and Tesla's build quality will increase substantially once single casts as they are inherently easier to build with).\n\nLucid, I think will be much in the same boat as Porsche. Their cars will underperform the Tesla equivalents. As to them making cheaper cars and competing there with Tesla, they are going to need to show their work. If the Lucid Air which is not out yet, is the best they can do, they are way behind as well. Don't get me wrong Rawlinson is a great guy, but he was at Tesla during Model S production. He was not involved in solving the Model 3 production issues so he does not have that experience. If M3 production almost took Tesla under with Elon Musk at the helm, good luck Rawlinson copying this with Lucid.\n\nVW, with their ID cars, are built on a skateboard and will not hold a candle to the Tesla equivalents.\n\nRivian... on paper just look at the price and specs of their truck versus the CT. The Rivian will appeal to people who want a certain look, but in terms of functionality the CT will crush.\n\nNio - they use swappable batteries. This adds weight to the cars and requires a more expensive infrastructure (manned) to handle the swaps. The 4680 structural cell will make a fundamental better car.\n\nThis goes on and on...\n\nI am just typing this off the top of my head and already spent more time then I intended on this.

Higher interest rates reduce the relative attractiveness of equities vs. fixed income investments and increase the discount rate on future corporate earnings.\n\nBond yields are rising because investors fear inflation from the prospective post-covid recovery (Covid cases dropping sharply in the U.S.). Inflation erodes the real returns from bond interest, so investors are selling off bonds, which increases their yield.\n\nHowever, a recovery will also drive a big uptick in economic activity across the board.

{"title": "The Greatest Market Bubble of All Time. A Full Bear Counter-Thesis.", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhh32rft3yi61.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dee34103f8ecdf4a758f94418f3f6c477e89644\n\n**The more things change, the more they stay the same. There is nothing new under the sun.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn every market bubble, you always hear the same language, the same rationalizations, the same absurd arguments. These people think they are offering some new, unique insight... in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history. Let's address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) Interest rates are low. Nowhere for money to go except stocks.**\n\nWhen you really drill down into it, this is some bizarre logic. It's essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable. In other words, it's a manifestation of the greedy, FOMO mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles.\n\nUltimately, these bull aren't even arguing that we aren't in a bubble. They are arguing we are in a bubble, but that the bubble is JUSTIFIED.\n\nThe obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a low-interest rate environment. What's the worst that can happen if I sit on a pure cash portfolio? I lose \\~2% per year. Not good, of course, but not the end of the world either. What's the worst that can happen if I dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes? I lose 50%+ of my funds in as little as a month. Ouch.\n\nThe idea that I'm forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing 2% a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset.\n\nOf course, the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply won't crash... or, that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious. But the whole point is that the crash is never obvious, especially to permabulls. They see a dip, and they buy it. They see a deeper dip, what a great opportunity, so they buy more. And before they realize the dip isn't simply a dip, they are already fucked. Tale as old as time.\n\nThe funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment, no matter how irrational. Why hold cash when bonds pay more? Why buy bonds when index funds pay more? Why buy index funds when SPACS pay more? Why buy SPACS when flipping cocaine pays more? After all, if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible, since it loses to inflation, what sort of high risk investment can you not justify?\n\nWhat's most interesting is that this argument isn't even new. The ridiculously low interest rates set by the Fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the 2008 crash. The Fed is ultimately a bubble creator, something even WSB is well aware of...\n\n**2) If you sit out this rally you will end up behind, even if you are right.**\n\nThis is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls. They argue that if you sat out the last 10 months (something this is essentially a straw man argument, except in reference to perma-bears), then you would have missed out on massive gains. And therefore, the implicit argument is, you can NEVER sit out.\n\nIf you carefully analyze this argument, you will realize it is literally nothing more than FOMO to the extreme. It's Fear Of Missing Out disguised as macroeconomic theory. I have to stay in the market perpetually, I can never sit out, because if I do I will MISS OUT on gains. And you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too, dummy!\n\nFirst of all, I will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately perma-bears. People who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains. But not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are perma-bears. There are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble, and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out, they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed.\n\nAn intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear. They adapt to the market. And when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market, you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid perma-bear. The bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them, but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Major Indicators of the Great Bubble**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) MASSIVE retail investment. Worldwide.**\n\nWhat are some signs of bubbles, historically? Well, a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market. Do we have that today? CHECK, on fucking steroids. We've got people who can't change a fucking tire on their 2008 Civic downloading Robinhood and gambling options on margin. Like WTF?\n\nThe 80 IQ mongoloid who was washing dishes at Papa Johns last Tuesday (do they even have dishes? I don't fucking know) is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking China or some shit. Are you kidding me? Do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching?\n\nNot to mention the entire short-squeeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire... Now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in Bangladesh is downloading Robinhood to buy calls on fucking SNDL or whatever the fuck.\n\nPast US market bubbles were largely restricted to the US population. It was mostly Americans buying American stocks during the dotcom boom. But wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized. Now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into Tesla at a 1,300 PE ratio. What's that noise? Is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance?\n\nThe \"Max Pain\" theory (which is ironically popular among permabulls) argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors. This is of course bullshit, but it's food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7r7kv00v3yi61.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d74d856187f569d73e04c47746f4a8bd16f700c\n\n**2) Ridiculously speculative \"investments.\" AKA SPACs.**\n\nCCIV is worth 15 billion dollars. And it owns literally nothing. No deal is in place, no announced deal figures have been offered, obviously the SPAC has no earnings or revenue to speak of... just 15 billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium. I can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed.\n\nWhat is a SPAC, at the end of the day? A rich guy steps up and says \"give me your money, and I'll decide what I'll do with it in a few months...\"\n\nAnd a million retards step up and say \"SOUNDS GREAT!!! TAKE MY MONEY!!!\"\n\nTell me this SPAC shit isn't exactly like the dotcom boom, when literally anything with a .com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the \"hot new thing.\" There is no way this SPAC mania lasts, and lots of people will be hurt in the end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhof6o3w3yi61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b9623780a63517644627087106c2d2078950e7b\n\n**3) Options volume absolutely exploding.**\n\nOptions are becoming the vehicle of choice for \"investors\" AKA gamblers in the current market. Stock represents actual ownership of a company, the foundation of the actual market. But what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term? I just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker.\n\nThe question I sometimes ask is how much of this market \"growth\" is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume. You know, like derivative CDO's leveraging worthless mortgages back in 2008? It's something to think about.\n\nI'll just leave this chart here, since it makes the case for me. This is neither natural nor sustainable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8fw4d8x3yi61.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=71fba76d2aba8f7cc69891f6b71cc1a0d6b0875c\n\n**4) \"Greater Fool\" logic.**\n\nI'll just quote investopedia since I'm getting lazy here...\n\n\"The greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities, whether or not they are overvalued, by selling them for a profit at a later date. This is because there will always be someone (i.e. a bigger or greater fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.\n\n\"If acting in accordance with the greater fool theory, an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality. If the theory holds, the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another \u201cgreater fool,\u201d who could also be hoping to flip them quickly. Unfortunately, speculative bubbles burst eventually, leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices.\n\n\"The greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances, as well, including economic recessions and depressions. In 2008, when investors purchased faulty mortgage-backed securities, it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed.\"\n\nBasically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy. Nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value. This is talking about you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rldwaltx3yi61.jpg?width=415&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d3de4faea5a050df1c346dd278b1e18302b9a9e\n\n**5) Buffet Indicator through the roof.**\n\nThe Buffet Indicator has reach it's highest ever level. For noobies who don't know what this means, the Buffett Indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by US GDP. A very high Buffett Indicator suggests an overvalued market, and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom.\n\nThere are two arguments against the Buffett Indicator as a useful metric. The first argument is that GDP is a backward indicator and therefore doesn't account for future growth. While this is true, it misses the entire point. The point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles. The point is to tie market valuations to some real-world metric, which is necessarily backward looking.\n\nThe other argument against the Buffett Indicator, which holds more weight, is that US stocks consist of global companies and therefore aren't adequately represented by US GDP.\n\nI will say these people have a good point, but they are also missing several nuances within GDP and market valuations, which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post. Suffice it to say the Buffett Indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation, and can't simply be discarded.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o40ug9fy3yi61.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf50b19f3f7019ece0ddca6ce1b010ab7db84f5e\n\n**6) Valuations divorced from reality.**\n\nDuring every major bubble, people like to come up with new, fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company. Back in the dotcom boom, companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of \"eyes.\" That is, the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website.\n\nThis internet thing was a \"New Paradigm\" and so obviously we needed New Metrics to determine how valuable these companies were. Needless to say, the vast majority of these companies, many of them worth millions, were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight.\n\nTake your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation. I like to pick on Tesla, personally, because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0m9f9dz3yi61.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8cb2ccfbe076dd55b16841fca70d40ad6840410\n\n**7) Fed Manipulation.**\n\nMost bubbles have been created by Federal Reserve control of currency and interest rates. This market is no different. They create a bubble, and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new, bigger bubble, until that pops, and so on. It's like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house.\n\nThe catch is interest rates can't drop below zero. I mean, they can... But who wants to be Japan for the rest of history?\n\nAlright I've written enough already and I won't write a whole thesis on Fed action and its consequences for now global markets.

Luckily we have vaccines coming out and decreasing hospitalization rates.

Ultimately the FED does not seem to be as focused on equity markets as it is on **credit** markets. The spillover you are seeing on equity markets is the result of a monetary policy put in place to help individuals and businesses get through one go the biggest health crises we have ever seen. The objective of the FED seems to be to ensure **unemployment** does not spiral out of control and is therefore keeping a substantial amount of large and mid caps on its payroll in order to prevent defaults. Government seems to be subsidising smaller businesses.\n\nA serious discussion can be had as to whether FED/government intervention to prevent mass layoffs is justified. I personally think it is important to keep companies afloat until the economy can be opened up and business can pick up. In the meantime, the monetary policy is indeed having peculiar effects on the stock market, which looks to be benefitting from the seemingly free availability of money and limitless supply (needed to prop up comatose business).\n\nYou will see this in various places but the bull case ultimately is that companies will grow into their current valuations as pent up demand is released. It functions as a self-fulfilling prophecy and can happen provided there is sufficient belief and trust amongst investors. It does imply contained inflation and therefore no significant pressure on interest rates in the short to medium term. If you look at Japan, they never went as big on monetary stimulus and have experienced severe deflation for the past two decades. Based upon some of this evidence, rampant inflation seems to exist more as a theoretical consequence of classical economics but yet does not materialise in the real world.....\n\nUltimately, if the fear mongering does provoque a massive equity sell-off in the short term, it will not change the fact that the FED needs to keep a lid on rates to prevent a chain reaction of corporate defaults....and the money would likely come flowing right back to equities.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

{"title": "Thoughts on the recent crash hysteria", "selftext": "Time for a different type of DD.\n\nI've been seeing a lot of talk and posts recently about a supposed crash being right around the corner. Mentions of the post WWI Weimar republic hyper-inflated Germany, USD collapses, and mass transfers of wealth from the poor to the rich. **An autistic hedge fund manager with an MD tweets a few times and everyone loses their minds (insert Joker reference).**\n\nSo let me impart to you some of my wisdom and knowledge as a finance major and risk management professional.\n\nHere's the rub. Is a crash going to happen? **Yes.**\n\nIs it the end of civilization as we know it? **No.**\n\nAre you going to be ok? **Maybe.**\n\nWe're a genuine conglomerate of retards. Some of us are figurative retards, others of us are actual retards. No disrespect to the actually mentally handicapped.\n\nTake the latest GME craze for example. We had folks yolo their literal life savings into this. I don't care if the price of this is ballooning into the tens of thousands... you NEVER invest all that you have into one single thing. Didn't you ever f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* learn to not put all your eggs in one basket!?\n\nWe always joke about being apes, but even monke no touch poisonous snake...\n\nHere's what happens with crashes: the rich get bailed out by the taxpayer, the poor get absolutely destroyed, and the wise/prudent get to keep their house and food on the table.\n\n**What you dipshits need is wisdom.** Are you living paycheck to paycheck? Stop buying useless shit you don't actually need. This isn't some r/financialindependence circle jerk post, this is just basic common sense.\n\nSave your damn money, get yourself an emergency fund, cut back on your variable expenses, budget your money.\n\nThe people who actually get screwed in financial crashes are those of you who aren't prepared for one. Here's a tip: **THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN.**\n\nYou don't buy car insurance because you're terrified of driving, you buy it because you know the probability of getting into a crash isn't 0%, and you want to be covered in that eventuality.\n\nIt's the same with your finances. Risk is inherent to life. ***And the chances of a massive financial disaster is never 0%.***\n\nSo quit freaking out about a financial collapse, because it's always a certainty. What you need to do, is instead start preparing for one. If you were to lose your income tomorrow, would you have a six months breathing period? Would you be able to pay all of your bills for an entire six months and not starve?\n\nThis is what the majority of you new beautiful retards don't get. Those of us who have been in here since before 1,000,000 subs actually have our shit together. Most of us didn't start investing and \"yoloing\" until we had a 6 month+ emergency fund, or some sort of a financial parachute. And we never touch that fund, because as we saw with GUH-boy, things can literally go tits-up for no reason whatsoever, and next thing you know, your wife's boyfriend is jerking off to the loss-porn you posted because she's giving him blue balls just like you.\n\nThe spirit of WSB isn't trebuchet-ing your entire net worth into a single security and going full GUH when it inevitably goes tits-up, **it's taking the net-worth that you can afford to lose and yeeting it into gourd futures while still being able to feed yourself/your family without having to suck dick behind a 7/11.** So embrace your inner monke, but remember that even the dumbest of apes still know not to fuck with dumb shit...\n\n***TLDR; Financial crash is always a possibility. Don't be a dipshit. Prepare for one. Be smart with your money so you can eventually be dumb with it without losing it all because some WallStreet pricks ran out of devil's-dandruff to snort off of hookers and intentionally tank the economy.***\n\nObligatory *non-zero-amount* GME @ *$none-of-your-business* 1/25\n\n\\*Not a financial advisor, but this is literally common-sense financial advice\\*  \n\n\nEdit 1: Forgot that car insurance is compulsory in the US.

I also made sure to go with a mortgage that would allow me to pay larger chunks with no penalty (put parts of bonus towards this). So, after one year in the house, I will have spent less than $600 for PMI and will have reached 20% down so I'll never have to pay PMI again.

And the thing is the fed has kept rates at historic lows for well over a decade now and the screaming of \"Zimbabwe is coming\" has ended up a cry of wolf.\n\nLabor is being destroyed because of corporations getting the *lowest taxes in US history*, making huge profits as a result funneled to the boardroom's pocketbooks which keep off-shore accounts happy. Then they use that cash to back candidates that further deregulate their businesses opening the market to monopoly, while also allowing for union busting across the board. If corporate taxes were even half what they had been before Reaganomics, corporations would be investing in their workers and businesses to lower their company to a lower tax bracket. That's how it worked in the past.\n\nAs for ***debts***, corporations love them because they ***make bets against people's ability to pay and they always win***. They short stocks, and they short us. They know full well what they're doing and they know if that bubble pops (too many debtors defaulting/bankrupting/going delinquent) ***they got their's***. After all they're the ones living in compounds.\n\nThe way to deflate that bubble safely IS to raise wages. Yes the rich fxxks lose their leverages, but it defuses a time-bomb of their own making. And the funny thing is the majority of wagies contribute to the economy meaningfully enough where federal taxes provide the cooling of the economic engine to prevent inflation and state taxes ensure local services keep going.\n\nThe *real issue* is speculation and the speculators. For far too long most of the market has had *false inflation*, inflation created more by speculation than actual market forces. Also notice that the price of OIL and Food NEVER get calculate into inflation rates. Wanna know why? Those two are manipulated to high heaven (In fact Goldman Sachs has been caught playing a clever shell game with commodities by moving them from warehouse to warehouse in a manner where the supply stored isn't reported... and I wager there's other sleazy tricks), and if people saw that and the fed based policy on that, their money train would be gone and their house of cards would scatter. \n\nThat and there has been economic warfare going on across the world, particularly between the EU, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China, and the US. When the Euro, Ruble, Yuan, and Dollar can be manipulated by both currency speculators AND governments with their hatchetmen well... Why you think China keeps their currency low indexed to the US dollar? It's so Chinese goods are easy to export. Tariffs don't hurt them, it hurts the businesses in countries that have those tariffs.\n\nThere's dynamics that most people are NOT seeing but they sure as hell think they know considering \"but muh inflation!!!\" is screeched whenever someone mentions raising the minimum wage to a level where someone could actually not have to work two full time minimum wage jobs just to barely live.\n\nAnd remember, the Fed isn't a government agency by any means.

{"title": "Volume the final frontier and why itll help you make money", "selftext": "I made this to help you noobs who dont know shit about stocks. This is part 1 of a series aimed at helping you guys have a fighting chance against wallstreet. Remember you are going against the sharpest minds in the world and you will lose. But you have me in your corner and im rooting for you guys, I believe in you\n\nVolume\n\n-A trend that moves on steady volume means that its likely to continue aka price is rising or price is lowering\n\n-Falling volume means that a trend is likely to reverse, whether price is going up or down, it applies to both\n\n-A burst of extremely high volume means that its trend is likely to reverse. Usually when the stock reaches its peak or when all of a sudden it crashes, keep your eye on the volume\n\n-If there is Low volume and the price stays the same, it usually means thats this is the new normal price. People are unfazed by slight price changes here, this is the new normal\n\n-A second price breakout after one just occured is usually marked by yet another high volume spike. It usually means losers are heading for the exit because theyve been bag holding and cant take the pain anymore or bulls are jumping back in\n\n-a price breakout in low volume means that its fake, the price will recoil\n\n-rising volume during a rally(after a stock crashed)means that even though the bagholders are leaving, new losers are coming in\n\n-When volume shrinks during a rally, it means that bulls arent as eager to keep buying at these high prices. Fuel is being removed from this ship. A reversal is imminent \n\n-When volume dries up during a decline, it usually means a reversal. That is the bears are no longer shorting and the intelligent bulls who got out a long time ago are ready to pounce yet again\n\n-As a rule of thumb, if todays volume is higher than yesterday\u2019s, it means that a trend is likely to continue \n\n-Volume is relative, what is high for ibm may be low for apple. What is low for apple may be high for ibm\n\n-As a rule of thumb, high volume is 25% higher than the avg volume of the past 2 weeks and low volume is 25% lower than the avg volume of the past 2 week\n\n-High volume confirms new trends. If prices rise to a new peak, and volume reaches a new high, then prices are likely to retest, that is go below the peak and come back to the peak to see if it can exceed it or go back down.\n\n-If a stock falls to a new low, and volume reaches a new high then that bottom will also retest- that is go up and come back down to that bottom to see if it goes even lower or stays there\n\n-the true bottom of a stock occurs on low volume and is always retested at low volume. If it stays the same then this is a great buying opportunity \n\n-if volume shrinks during an upwards or downwards trend then that trend is ripe for a reversal \n\n-When a stock reaches a new peak than it was yesterday, but the volume is lower today than yesterday- this is a great shorting opportunity, that is: Now is the time to sell or time to buy puts\n\n- This does not work on a downwards trend as a stock can keep going down even with low volume. It takes buying to move a stock up, but a stock can go down on its own weight\n\n-Watch volume during a reaction against the upward trend(aka panic selling). If the dip continues but volume shrinks, it means bulls are no longer running or selling pressure is spent. When the explosion of selling volume dries up, then it means that the upwards trend will resume. This presents a good buying opportunity or to buy calls\n\n-Many downtrends are punctuated(occurs at intervals) by rallies(price goes up momentarily)which begin on heavy volume. These shake out weak bears which causes volume to shrink and gives a signal to sell short~ this means that short sellers are now sure that the stock will crater because no more rallies\n\n:thanks for the love. I just want to help people\n:but i feel that the Reddit users with flair despise me because im teaching yall. So i want to level the playing field as flair helps you get taken more serious here. Ive asked the wsb mods for flair so i can reach a wider audience.

{"title": "O I L", "selftext": "So let me explain why oil worth looking into. It's due to three main factors, supply, demand and inflation.\n\nFirst lets look at demand. Oil demand got crushed during the covid-19 pandemic, with oil futures going well into the negatives as people ran out of space to store actual physical oil. All the evidence we have points to the covid-19 vaccines being safe and effective, the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, is vaccinating over a million people a day. With the covid-19 pandemic most probably soon to be behind us, oil demand is bound to increase as people resume travel and similar activities that consume lots of oil.\n\nSecond lets look at supply. [Over 100 oil and gas companies went bankrupt in 2020.](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/More-than-100-oil-and-gas-companies-filed-for-15884538.php) When these companies go bankrupt, they stop being able to do what they do, which is generally to supply oil. Without new sources being tapped, existing sources gradually run out, which naturally lowers supply. This means that even though oil demand is likely to scale up rapidly, the supply can't scale up as quickly. What does this do? Of course it increases the price. Now on top of all this, we're going to get political. President Biden pledged during his campaign to ban all fracking on public lands. His nominee for interior secretary, Deb Haaland, is someone who has views that are very hostile to the oil and gas industry, and is likely to aggressively move against fracking. It's hard to say exactly what will happen, but there's a fair likelihood this reduces the supply of oil.\n\nThirdly lets look at inflation. Michael Burry has been sounding the alarm bell on this lately, saying that the US could undergo huge inflation. There's been lots of joking about the sound money printers make, and President Biden has pledged to send direct financial relief of some sort to Americans. It's hard to say what will happen, but if there's inflation, having money in real goods, such as oil, will help partially protect against it.\n\nDisclaimer, I am not an investment advisor and this is not investment advice. I'm not advising to buy or sell any financial instrument or security. I'm merely sharing my thoughts and speculations online.

{"title": "NVAX - Don't miss this perfect vaccine play headed strait for the MOON", "selftext": "Ladies and gentlemen strap on because I'm about to learn you a thing or two about a vaccine company that I sincerely believe has the best in class technology, is undervalued, has tons of upcoming catalysts, and is in perfect position to 2x in the next few weeks. I've never been more irresponsibly bullish on anything else in my life and the stock just tanked 12% today so you smooth brained mfs have the PERFECT entry. I'm a PhD student working at the interface of genetics/biochemistry so I'm hoping I can put your tax dollars to work and give back to the community by chewing and feeding you information in digestible pieces that even the newest of members can digest. Why am I doing this? I don't know, I guess I LIKE THE STOCK and I feel it has been left to the side by mainstream media. I also LIKE YOU GUYS AND GALS and want to see you make well earned money. So let's get this going:\n\n**NVAX Technology rundown and why it is best-in-class**\n\n1. **How does it work?** The NVAX covid vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) is a protein vaccine, much like many traditional vaccines. This means they designed a protein that mimicks the spike protein of the coronavirus and they inject this into you. It is impossible to get sick from this protein (it's only part of the virus) but your body will detect this protein and make antibodies for it, granting you immunity.\n2. **Ok...so what is special about it?** The big deal about this vaccine is the use of their proprietary adjuvant called Matrix-M. An **adjuvant** is a chemical that they put into a vaccine that makes your immune system have a more robust response. The benefits from this are significant:\n\n* **You need less protein in every dose.** Protein is super fucking expensive to make, this lowers the cost of each dose.\n* **Requiring less protein means you can put more than one protein in every dose.** There's a limit to how many micrograms of protein you can safely inject into a person at once. It has become abundantly clear in the last few weeks that COVID-19 variants are going to be a problem and we are going to need to make \"booster\" vaccines to combat each additional variant. How about, instead of getting an individual injection for every variant you have a single vaccine that is a cocktail of all the variants? **This is called a multivalent vaccine and it's the reason NVAX is gonna swing it's big old dick around and gobble up market share in the next year or so.** Additionally, they made an amazing Flu vaccine, Nano-FLU, that has shown to be more effective than the current gold standard for Flu vaccines and they are **working on a combination COVID+Flu vaccine.** There it is. Once a year you're gonna go get a flu shot but from now on once a year you're gonna get a single vaccine that protects you against this year's Flu and all of this year's COVID variants all at once. The flu vaccine passed phase 3 and it's submission to FDA accelerated approval is imminent.\n* **Last but not least this adjuvant is great for old people**. Old people don't have great immune systems so they often need higher dose vaccines. Well this adjuvant get's your grandpappy's immune system friskier than a stray cat waiting to be fed and as a result the vaccines have shown great success among the older test subjects. You know what else loves old people? COVID-19. It's imperative to have robust protection for our geezers.\n\n1. **Well is it effective?** YES. The covid vaccine (and their Flu vaccine for that matter) work amazingly well. Their interim Phase 3 results from the UK and South Africa show the covid vaccine is 95.6% effective against preventing the original covid strain (best of ANY covid vaccine to date), 89% effective against the UK variant, and 60% against the South Africa variant. Additionally, this is the ONLY vaccine that has clinical trial efficacy data for the UK and the South Africa strain. Everything you've seen about the PFE and MRNA efficacy against these strains has been done in a laboratory i.e. not in real people out in the real world.\n2. **Where are they in the regulatory process? Aren't they a little late to the show?** NO they are not late to the show. As much as you'd like to believe COVID will go the way of Swine Flu and just be a scar in our past I believe COVID will be much more permanent. We'll probably have to get booster vaccines for years to come. While life will return to normal there will always be breakouts or new variants that we'll hopefully closely monitor. That being said here is NVAX's status in the trials:\n\nUK/South Africa Trials: Phase 3 is ALMOST done. In fact, when compared to [previous](https://twitter.com/RNAiAnalyst/status/1363897821569699844?s=20) timelines we can expect to see finalized results this week. Regardless, interim data from Phase 3 showed [stellar efficacy and safety numbers](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3). NVAX [submitted an EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-starts-rolling-review-novavaxs-covid-19-vaccine-nvx-cov2373) for approval of the vaccine in Europe. Additionally, the UK is getting pretty close to blowing our load and giving NVAX its **first vaccine approval ever.** Just take a look at what [British Donald Trump said when asked about the impending approval of NVAX in the UK](https://twitter.com/NovaCapital2020/status/1363931703161585666?s=20).\n\nUS/Mexico Trials: Phase 3 enrollment is complete officially announced TODAY. This means that we can expect to see final results sometime in April. I actually tried to sign up about a month ago and they were full (that's how much I believe in this vaccine). Hopefully, though, we won't need US Phase 3 results though. That's because there are plans to use the UK/SA trial data for FDA Emergency Use Authorization. After all, the UK and SA trials were [specially designed to fit the requirements of the US FDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novavax-ceo-uk-data-should-be-used-for-quicker-us-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-145332626.html).\n\n5. **Why will this 2X? They're up 2,885% YTD what makes you think there's any juice left in them?** THIS is what is holding NVAX down. People's perception that they've run up too much, too fast. After all they were a trash penny stock one year ago, what would justify a $600 price target? People are too quick to whip out their crayons and tell you about the Fibonacci moving average MACD rainbow ribbons who GIVES A FUCK. This stock is not running on technicals. It's price action is largely dictated by NEWS and FUNDAMENTALS. Short sellers have pounced on this stock like a group of lions trying to take down the most juicy, succulent giraffe in the Savannah. I mean just LOOK at all that those beautiful gaps to fill right? WRONG. Let's get some numbers up in this bitch.\n\n\\-Current market cap is $16.11 Bn. This is TINY given the size of most of the main covid vaccine players (PFE = $192 Bn, BNTX = $27.59 Bn, MRNA = $65.74 Bn) which is why this bitch can go down 10+% on low volume with [high short interest](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/NVAX/short-interest/) on a bad day like today. But just take a look at their revenue prospects with their current deals:\n\n* [SHIT TONS](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum) of manufacturing deals leading to production of 2+ BILLION doses every year across the world\n* [1.1 BILLION dose deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with COVAX the majority of which will be vaccines from NVAX\n* [40 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-expanded-collaboration-and-license-agreement) to South Korea\n* [6 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-government-switzerland-announce-agreement-principle) to the Swiss\n* [76 Million Doses + Manufacturing Deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-produce-covid-19) to our Poutine eating brethren\n* [51 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-finalizes-agreement-commonwealth-australia-51-million) to Australians\n* [10.7 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-agreement-government-new-zealand-107-million) to the Kiwis\n* [60 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase) to the British\n* Additionally they have announced today they're prepared to deliver 110 Million Doses to the US. While it is true US market share has been mostly taken up by PFE and MRNA I think NVAX will play an important role in supplying doses to the US longterm and to much of the world immediately.\n\nDo you still think they're late to the party?\n\nAdditionally they are expected to price each dose somewhere between $8.95/dose - $16/dose. It's hard to say what the final revenue will be since they will price doses differently for different countries but even at the lower bound of $8.95/dose for AT LEAST 1.35 Bn guaranteed doses is $12 Billion dollars in revenue. At that revenue a $16.1 Bn valuation is RIDICULOUS. If you're looking for value this is it. The writing is on the fucking wall. It does not get any better than this.\n\nI leave you guys with the most inspiring quote I've seen from the man himself, CEO Stanley Erck.\n\n\"Novavax hopes to be a dominant player. CEO Erck says that he expects the Covid-19 vaccines to compete on quality, and that his company's vaccine can stand above the others. **\"The revenue projections are going to be enormous for our product in 2021 and 2022, and beyond that\"** he says. \"Beyond \\[2022\\]...it's going to be a commercial market based upon the competitive advantage of your vaccine.\"\n\n6. **What catalysts are on the horizon and how do I play this?**\n\nBiggest catalysts on my list are 1)[Finalizing deal with the EU for doses](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-novavax/eu-close-to-vaccine-supply-deal-with-novavax-sources-idUSKBN2AB10H), 2) Approval by the UK any time (prob 1st week of March), 3) Endpoint data for phase 3 from UK/SA trials, 4) confirmation from the FDA that they will accept UK/SA data for emergency use authorization, 5) filing for NanoFlu EUA in the US, 6) data from their RSV vaccine (yet another cool vaccine they have in the works!), and 7) **Earnings on March 1st which they moved UP by 9 days**\n\nHonestly you can play this anyway you want. My price target is $500 at least. Shares are nice because they don't expire, are liquid, and the IV on these calls are ridiculous. But I have calls because I'm jacked to the tits because I believe in the fundamentals. I believe so hard.\n\n$300c 4/16\n\n$250c 4/16\n\nEDIT: [Useful infographic comparing vaccines](https://twitter.com/LifeScite/status/1364036968921849858/photo/1)", "id": "lq3ksw", "created_utc": 1614037555.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Invested in novavax last year and I'm up more than 3000%.

My 12 month price target is $1631.76 a share. This assumes an FDA, EU, and UK approval of the Covid Vaccine.\n\nI derived this price by reviewing the current contracts or agreements in place, and assigning probability of each contract/agreement coming to fruition.  I also assigned a value to the Flu and RSV pipeline.  The Flu vaccine assumed a $1.5 billion annual revenue with an 85% chance of FDA approval and the RSV assumed a $5 billion annual revenue with just a 15% chance of FDA approval.  The overwhelming majority of the stock value is definitely from the covid vaccine but the flu and rsv potential are definitely worthwhile.\n\nAnother key assumption of the analysis is that there will be a need for annual covid vaccine in the future due to variants and reduction in neutralizing antibodies over time.  Novavax\u2019s potential for a covid/flu combo booster is incredibly promising. \n\nHere are some key facts about Novavax\n\n1.      2 billion annual production capacity (Reaching full production capacity middle of 2021)\n2.      Contracts for 2.8 Billion doses\n3.      Lower efficacy for South Africa and other strains means people will likely need an annual booster or a multivariant shot each year (Like the flu)\n4.      MRNA strains are not suited for multivariant boosters due to poor tolerability\n5.      Novavax is the only company in world to test flu/covid combo in phase 3 trial (UK)\n6.      Potential for annual flu/covid booster is enormous\n7.      Nanoflu is best in class and the flu vaccine market is likely to explode as there is a new focus on using vaccines to fight disease.\n\nCovid Contracts\n\nUSA- 100 Million $17.5 per dose. 1.75 billion profit tbd (a lot of this funding goes towards running trials)(Letter to congress indicated the 1.6 was bumped up to 1.75 billion) The extra 150 million may be needed to do the crossover phase 3 trial.\n\nEU-  100 Million and 100 million option.  Estimating $16 per dose $3.2 billion revenue.\n\nCanada 52 million with 24 million option. Estimating $16 per dose $1.216 billion\n\nAustralia \u2013 51 million doses.  Estimating $16 per dose $816 million\n\nNew Zealand 10.7 million estimated price $16 a dose total revenue 171.2 million Profit\n\nIndia- 1 Billion estimated price $15.77 (per india today newspaper)  Guessing split with Serum.

{"title": "$NVDA Long Thesis", "selftext": "It\u2019s been a crazy past week+ into today with rising yields and stocks that were on breakout tracks for new highs pulling back.\n\nSo what do you do when all hope seems lost?\n\nIdk, I\u2019m not a financial advisor, but what I did was double down.\n\nAfter experiencing a net loss this year of over $30k with GME, AMC, TSLA, AI, and more, I\u2019m more determined than ever to ignore the pullback while my options bleed in delta and time decay and instead just buy more and hold.\n\nThis brings me to NVDA. NVDA is the undisputed king of semiconductors (although some AMD fans try to dispute) with a market cap of $355B and a P/E ratio of 93.83. That P/E ratio is arguably high even for a bull market but let\u2019s be clear, not even 1 week ago NVDA reached a new ATH $614.90 blowing past its previous one of $582ish in this most recent breakout run.\n\nSo what has changed from last week to today? Absolutely very little except a massive increase in fear due to a slight 10yr treasury yield increase from 1.25%ish to 1.36%ish. \n\nA treasury yield increase is actually good as it indicates sentiment from bond holders that the economy will grow faster than expected. Inflation of 1% - 3% is even healthy for large tech companies such as NVDA as they can increase the price higher than the increasing cost resulting in greater earnings, especially in high profit margin areas with its Mellanox acquisition. \n\nFor the fundamentalists in the room that don\u2019t buy stocks because they like the company nor believe in their long-term values, high P/E ratio is justified in believing the E (earnings) will grow higher in the coming year. Chip shortage (indicating growing demand) is expected to continue for another year, https://www.marketwatch.com/story/worldwide-chip-shortage-expected-to-last-into-next-year-and-thats-good-news-for-semiconductor-stocks-11614020156, which will massively increase that earnings potential and the data center will continue to grow with growth from last quarter 162% YoY - https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/nvidias-rapid-data-center-growth-is-here-to-stay/. \n\nInflation increases the cost of debt but NVDA doesn\u2019t need debt and has been cash positive for a while. It\u2019s debt-to-assets ratio has been decreasing YoY (short of 2020 because of COVID and growth expenses) and it\u2019s on track for record breaking results this earnings report on Wed.\n\n \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 A growing economy is good for profitable companies like NVDA and even if this price is a premium, it\u2019s worth it because NVDA delivers the goods. Even Wall Street agrees with analysts raising PTs to $700. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nNote: I\u2019m long NVDA because you would be crazy not to be.\n\nWarren Buffet said, \u201c... be greedy when others are fearful\u201d and now there is a lot of fear with TSLA and large tech stocks and high valuations. Now is the time to double down in this bullish market because here is the best news, on Wed 2/24, our buddy, Powell, is gonna buy a ton more 10yr bonds driving the price up and yields back down. https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details#current-schedule. And in a few weeks from then, he\u2019s gonna do it again, and then again and again and again. Yield rises will be capped at an upper limit because of $80b/mo coming into them. The Fed has made it very clear that it has no intention of reducing that for years+ as it will allow inflation  to rise beyond 2% to average 2% across a multi-year period. The government wants inflation to rise because it wants to wane away its debt and so there will be Yellen support to keep the money press printing longer than people think. \n\nIn conclusion, patience is key \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc = \ud83e\udd11\n\nI\u2019m not a financial advisor, buy/sell at own risk.", "id": "lq3qc6", "created_utc": 1614037994.0, "score": 296, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "NVDA in this decade will be a rocket ship to the closest planets of andromeda.
