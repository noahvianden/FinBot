{"title": "Chinese companies are working together to pump up AMC stock", "selftext": "Realize a lot of people here have been burned both ways on AMC, and this is not meant to be a jab at that. Completely unrelated to Melvin, and their mess, and illegal shorts - Chinese companies have found an opportunity and are swooping in and making fools of everyone.\n\n**Some back ground information for your reference:**\n\n1. AMC was and potentially still is controlled by Dalian Wanda, a Chinese Media conglomerate. Source: [link](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-does-chinese-communist-party-own-amc-entertainment-legendary-films-1565254)\n2. Forbes is owned by Integrated Whale Media, another Chinese Media Conglomerate (more on why this matters later).

Wanda filed last week to convert their Class B shares to Class A shares after the recent craziness, in order to facilitate a sale of their shares. Class B shares have more voting power but cannot be sold on an exchange, so Wanda needed some time to be able to pull the trigger. Source: [link](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/1d54a760-d61f-4470-bf51-102e8de0f733.pdf)\n\nThis number of shares can't be dumped all at once on an open exchange. It's usually passed off to the sales and trading desk of large bank, where it's gradually sold off in blocks to maximize profit and minimize noise.\n\n**The juicy part:**\n\nA few days ago, Forbes' (Chinese company #2) official Twitter account \"randomly\" re-tweeted an article on AMC dating back to May 2020. In May last year, there was still red-hot speculation on an AMC/Amazon acquisition. This later fizzed out, and it turned out that journalist got AMC and AMCX mixed up. That article is below:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2020/05/22/amazon-goes-to-themovies/?sh=2f44ebcf7bdc](https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2020/05/22/amazon-goes-to-themovies/?sh=2f44ebcf7bdc)\n\nThe retweet got some traction and made a small dent in the price, but was largely brushed off. Three days ago, Forbes doubled down. They translated this article and published it on [Forbes.fr](https://forbes.fr/), updated the date to from May 2020 to Feb 2021. They then changed the originally innocuous title to \"Amazon on the verge of acquiring AMC, the world's largest movie chain\". You had to get to the middle of the article before there was a note that said this was all pure speculation and simply a translation of a May 2020 article.\n\nThis article was widely circulated (was the major source of the recent Amazon rumor), everybody went nuts, and led AMC to being up almost 15% pre-market on Thursday. Then for the first time in weeks, massive volumes of shares were sold through the exchanges (aka Wanda dumping their shares) - notice how nobody is calling this one a ladder attack. Forbes then wiped their hands and DELETED the article to cover up the evidence, but I was able to find it on WayBack Machine [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210217214856/https://www.forbes.fr/business/amazon-sur-le-point-dacquerir-amc-la-plus-grande-chaine-de-salles-de-cinema-au-monde/).

It's in the best interest of both bulls and bears to report this to the SEC tip line.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound \u2013 financials, airlines and industrials \u2013 stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n> \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,\u201d said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. \u201cIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.\u201d\n*****\n> But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n> # Improving forecasts\n> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n> \u2033[Powell\u2019s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He\u2019s going to be supportive of the administration\u2019s effort to get a big package through,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n*****\n> # Key data during the week\n> Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy\u2019s and TJX.\n*****\n> Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n> The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n> \u201cI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> \u201cThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that\u2019s going to go away sooner than we think,\u201d Keon said. \u201cRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That\u2019s also due to the fact we\u2019re likely to get a big stimulus package.\u201d\n*****\n> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We\u2019re still bullish. We\u2019re still overweight stocks,\u201d Keon said.\n*****\n> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n> \u201cThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,\u201d Keon added. \u201cHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.\u201d\n*****\n> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see an incredible boom.\u201d\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n> While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n> Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n> Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals\u2014as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index\u2014are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n> Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n> Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-2.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-4a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak\n\n> \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n> Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage \u201cstairs up, elevator down\u201d certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn\u2019t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it\u2019s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in \u201cstay at home\u201d themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. \u201cIt\u2019s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,\u201d noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.\u201d If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year\u2019s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December\u2014ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales\u2014consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau\u2014the most in seven months\u2014and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,\u201d added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.\u201d\n\n> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January\u2019s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn\u2019t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4\u20134.5% to 5\u20135.5%. Yesterday\u2019s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target\u2014and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden\u2019s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n> # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n> One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n> We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5f4b2427b7d5d4b28aae29e57eecf9b/74d4cbea052ab1c5-33/s500x750/45f747ae1ae952b17ebfa05517216899ec4f49ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jtxCols.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/b6PPTlQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EcVeV4l.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5xLzt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  2.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4p4q8a9.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EgzN86P.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ODRTBoH.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3udXvVZ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sMcEWeM.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EHTrDMd.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bzVMSxO.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/79N1qSy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WwOgLCj.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wZD3pAb.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoNlM.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MuAL2DJ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gkCoskC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UCHvMLo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/To6WCZh.png))\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06\n**NVIDIA Corp.

Largely the historical record and looking for holes and oversights with WHAT EXISTS.  Mistakes with inventory, over investment, temporary slowdowns, commodity price dislocations, missed earnings, etc. basically stuff that can be managed and figured out by another MBA type with a spreadsheet.\n\nSteve Jobs once said something like this (loosely paraphrased) \"I don't do market research, because what I want to make doesn't exist, and people don't know they need it: I will create something new to generate the need and be the one that can fulfill it\" and fulfill it brilliantly he did - and that is the story of Apple.\n\nThat's the difference between stodgy \"value\" investing, and growth investing.

It may slowly devalue cash held in hand, but it stimulates spending, investment, and the economy.\n\nAnd for businesses, a stable currency is necessary to plan for the future, make capital investments, plan payrolls, pay suppliers, taxes, etc. An unstable currency adds risks, complexity and costs.\n\n-----------\n\n>If the US only wants USD, then that's fine, liquidate a portion of your BTC and give them USD. \n\nIf you want to pay capital gains taxes (or take a capital loss) every time you spend U.S. dollars, that's your choice. But the importance of the dollar goes far beyond your personal finances.\n\nThe Fed supplies banks with liquidity and credit, and they in turn supply the economy. Without that liquidity and credit, you get a [credit crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_crunch) and the economy stops functioning. Banks can't lend and businesses can't borrow. Business investment, mortgages, insurance, consumer loans, the stock markets, the entire bond market, and even the most basic banking functions all come to a stop.\n\nThis was what nearly happened in 2007-08, and it brought the global economy to the edge of collapse.\n\nThe Fed can't supply bitcoin liquidity or credit.

I've never been involved in the finance industry at quite that level so I don't know what _exactly_ is involved in the transaction, but this is not that uncommon; I know the Bloomberg Terminal has some NAV percentage offset screener the big money guys can use to find ETFs that are far enough away from the NAV to execute this arbitrage by redeeming ETFs or handling bundles of shares to ETFs. It's a bit trickier to execute it in the \"create shares\" direction with index-tracking ETFs because you have to hand them shares in a close enough ratio that they aren't diverging too far from the index but most ETFs deliberately reserve a fraction of a percent of a cash buffer which they can use to even things out, or they could charge a fee for this, etc. To tell the truth, this is all probably detailed somewhere in the prospectus none of us ever actually read.\n\n> The other thing, is that really true that every time we buy an ETF there is a new share issued?

The AUM and number of shares doesn't change with an ordinary ETF transaction - this is the whole \"Exchange-Traded\" part of \"Exchange-Traded Fund\", after all.\n\nBut remember, ETFs came _after_ mutual funds, those were the original. When you buy into a mutual fund, yes, new shares (or fractional shares) are created, but that's not dilution because you've added your money to the pool of investment that the mutual fund uses, which they buy stocks (or bonds or whatever) with. In fact, you're going to get exactly as much out in the mutual fund shares as what you put in.

Or if the ETF is trading at 5 cents above its NAV, how are you going to be able to get enough shares of everything in the correct ratios to cash in for shares of the ETF? You have to have giant piles of money in order to do this kind of arbitrage, and realistically it's only going to make you a relatively small percentage. But this is of course exactly what (some types of) Wall Street specialists _do_ for a living, scalp these tiny percentages using giant amounts of money, and that makes the market super efficient, which is generally a good thing.

Even HFTs, which get a bad rap overall, buy and sell shares across different exchanges in order to bring their prices closer together (taking the pennies' difference for their own profit, of course). \n\nIn the GME case, the GME squeezers are upset about this because they want the squeeze to fire and make a bunch of money, but from an economic perspective, \"unlocking\" the shares that were in the ETFs was a good thing as it brought the price of GME closer to the \"correct value\".\n\nI don't think the market is efficient in the super-strict sense of \"everything is at exactly the correct price no matter what, just buy VT and go away\". (If it was, the put/call ratio would forever be 1, right? If the put/call ratio isn't 1, either the stock market is wrong or the options market is wrong!) The stock market is efficient in the sense that big money is going to swallow damn near all the arbitrage opportunities out there unless you come up with something really really clever nobody's thought of before, or you just find something that's out of whack by so small an amount that it just isn't worth it for the big guys to scalp. (Say you find $10 on a low-vol options arbitrage, minus transaction fees, and there's only 1 available on the market at that price, so who cares really? Certainly not the guys throwing around millions of dollars at once.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6675648093223572}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4090530276298523}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6921690106391907}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5817237496376038}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5390903353691101}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47391849756240845}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.031270768493413925}, {"body": "Less than the squeeze.

The premium was way too high, and based on the 12 billion$ valuation @ 10$ a share, I believe 95$/a share is 114 Billion dollar valuation of Lucid motors (someone correct me if I'm wrong).

The average rate on so-called \u201chigh yield\u201d bonds recently fell below 4% to a record low. In the late 1990s, even corporate borrowers with the best reputations paid average interest rates on the order of 7%. There is so much money looking for a place to go that companies are being contacted by investors asking if they would like to issue bonds rated below investment grade rather than the other way around.\n\nIt is a seller\u2019s market for all manner of risk. While the 10 year U.S. Treasury Note yield has been edging higher since the summer, interest rates have mostly been in decline for decades. Policy makers at the Federal Reserve and other major central banks have indicated that major changes are unlikely anytime soon. Government rescue of private enterprises facing insolvency, once an unthinkable intervention, has become somewhat commonplace. As the Clovers once sang, though not about monetary policy, \u201cyour cash ain\u2019t nothin but trash.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment isn\u2019t quite universal, though.\n\n\u201cWe take a lot of pride in the Triple-A credit rating, and we see it as a potential competitive differentiator,\u201d says Joseph Wolk, chief financial officer at Johnson & Johnson, which is one of only two U.S. firms remaining with that sterling designation. Prudence helped the company, founded in 1886, survive two world wars, the Great Depression and other calamities.\n\nYet the most recent catastrophe to befall big business saw the federal government ride to the rescue as never before. Companies facing major pandemic-related challenges such as hospital systems, movie theaters and sit-down restaurant chains have had little trouble accessing capital. Airlines, no strangers in bankruptcy court over the decades, have successfully navigated nearly a full year of badly hobbled travel demand. Even newspaper chains have been able to sell debt.\n\nIt is about a lot more than survival, though. This environment has opened the door for management teams to get creative and ultimately take more risk. In this kind of low-rate world, paying out debt-financed dividends to investors or investing in risky growth opportunities has beaten a frugal mentality hands down. In certain industries a large cash pile can actually result in a lower valuation because investors perceive that future opportunities for good investments are dwindling.\n\nPrudence, meanwhile, has been downright costly. Take an index of \u201chigh quality\u201d U.S. stocks selected by financial return and borrowing levels, of which Johnson & Johnson is a major constituent. A $10,000 investment five years ago in an Invesco exchange-traded fund tracking the index in the five years through last week would have turned into about $21,500 compared with $24,100 invested in large U.S. companies generally.\n\nMeanwhile, those executives taking chances are reaping the biggest rewards in their stock prices and for themselves personally. In an alarming trend to traditionalists, companies like Tesla and Square have chosen to speculate on bitcoin with their corporate cash. Earlier this week, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy sold $900 million in convertible bonds that pay zero interest for a bitcoin purchase; high investor demand boosted the offering from a planned $600 million. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk allowed Thursday on Twitter that Tesla\u2019s bitcoin purchase is\u201cadventurous,\u201d he also said Bitcoin \u201cis simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash.\u201d The cryptocurrency\u2019s price has quintupled since Square first announced its purchase last fall.\n\nThrift is unmistakably in a bear market.\n\nBut this sentiment is underpinned by the belief that conditions in the bond market will remain stable. Even with central banks being so friendly recently, speculative grade bond yields have spiked from time-to-time, cracking 10% in 2016 when several energy firms went bust and nearly that high again last March amid nationwide lockdowns.\n\nContinuing to roll the dice also assumes money remains cheap in general. While a world in which interest rates march ever higher seems otherworldly to most contemporary executives and market participants, it shouldn\u2019t be: A multidecade bear market in bonds preceded the current go-go era.\n\nAn end of the bear market in thrift could sting even companies with the fattest wallets. When rates are falling, refinancing debt is easy. In a weak market, rolling over maturing debt with new bonds and loans is costly and limits a company\u2019s set of investment opportunities. For instance, splashy acquisitions of the sort that dazzle Wall Street would happen less often. More marginal borrowers would struggle to get by altogether. In that scenario, a large cash pile might regain its appeal to investors.\n\nEven for a blue chip like Johnson & Johnson, flexibility can pay off. The company\u2019s drug development business already is risky enough without financial engineering. Consider that only three in 10 early-stage candidates actually reach the market, making some bad investments unavoidable. As for the general responsibility of a CFO to plan for unlikely, unpleasant scenarios, Mr. Wolk channels William DeVasher, the security chief played by Wilford Brimley in \u201cThe Firm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get paid to be suspicious when I\u2019ve got nothing to be suspicious about,\u201d he says.\n\nImagining an eventual end to the easy money era could help spare the C-Suite a big headache down the road.\n\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Charley grant???

Citadel Partners LLC.\n\nI was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn't seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords. Just... a really funny coincidence. Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol\n\nBut then I did some other digging and found a random document:\n\n[https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&id2=0](https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&id2=0)\n\nWhich is a voting form for Ascena Retail Group's bankruptcy filing.\n\nOn page 49 and 50 something jumped out at me:\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS & CO -- F/A/O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP -- ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT\n\nIdk if it's well known, because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin's accounts.\n\nI looked further into it and found:\n\n[https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd](https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd)\n\n**Custodian** Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley & Co LLC, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, National Financial Services LLC\n\nMelvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan.\n\nAnd it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory.

People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they\u2019re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They\u2019ll get it.

{"title": "$1.6T Treasury General Account, Yellen, and the Market", "selftext": "There's some big important news lately, and I haven't seen it discussed enough. I came across this info in the most recent Macrovoices podcast episode, and decided to do some more research on my own, which I'm sharing below.\n\n**$1.6T Treasury General Account**\n\nMnuchin out, Yellen in, and it turns out Mnuchin left Yellen about $1.6T in the [Treasury General Account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasury-general-account.asp) for her to do with as she pleases. This is the general checking account from which the US makes all of its purchases. [Here's what it looks like now](https://i.imgur.com/ogJzIue.png).^1  The government raised $1.6T and its just been sitting there, not used.\n\n**So?**\n\nWell, for context, currency in circulation has risen from about [$0.8 trillion in January 2007 to $2.07 trillion today](https://i.imgur.com/vndHJ7h.png).^2\n\nWe know the Fed has been buying Treasury assets at a decent clip of around $120B per month since last year. Zooming out just a little, lets put into context that currency we just looked at as part of the [liabilities of the Federal Reserve](https://i.imgur.com/UlJwNtv.png) ignoring repos, which for reference are relatively small.^3 \n\nAlright great, so we now know there's a lot of money out there already, but the Department of the Treasury is sitting on 1.6T that's been printed but hasn't actually been sent into the economy yet.\n\n**Why does this matter now?**\n\nThe interesting news then, is that Yellen [has made it clear she'll be reducing this cash pile, *quickly*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/yellen-shift-on-vast-treasury-cash-pile-poses-problem-for-powell). Whoa, hold up. So what are the effects of this going to be? Glad you asked. \n\nAll this cash is going to flood the financial system with liquidity. Credit Suisse is calling this unleashing a \"tsunami\" of reserves into the financial system, swelling Fed reserves from $3.3T to about $5T.  \n\nPreviously, banks have been able to absorb the excess liquidity in the system, but they have limits and need to manage their own liabilities. So this $1.6T needs to find somewhere else to go. The likely alternative is the money markets. \n\nIf you're getting 1.6T in free cash money, you might as well park it in low yielding treasuries while you figure out what to do with it. But those are already trading at about 0. That means these short term yields are going to head toward negative territory. And at some point, the money markets will stop taking in new money. There's only so much appetite for investments that actively lose you money.\n\nLet's think about the implications here. \n\n**Possible Implications**\n\n* Short end of the yield curve is going down.\n\n* The Fed may have to raise short-term rates like IOER, interest on excess reserves, during their March meeting.\n\n\n* People will hear that the Fed is raising rates in March and think that the Fed is scared of inflation and thus raising rates, when they're just trying to accommodate the extra liquidity. If this causes a market sell off, it will be a massive buy the dip opportunity.\n\n* The yield curve may steepen. \n\n* As we know, 10 year bond yields have been flying higher lately, [up to 1.34%](https://i.imgur.com/Bb351OL.png) currently.^4 This has been likely action in anticipation of reflation, perhaps even inflation. The rate of change here has been pretty aggressive, and I find that concerning, because it may lead to volatility caused by news that's not fully understood. \n\n* Rates on the long end may keep increasing in anticipation of inflation, despite the low end being heavily depressed.\n\n* Higher rates on the longer end *may* lead to a sector rotation out of riskier equity assets to beefier 'value' stocks.\n\n* All this additional liquidity will probably be a risk-on event. Buy. The. Stocks.\n\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMassive liquidity increase incoming. Equities might briefly dip, but then up. SPX over 4000 within a month. SPX 4500 a month after that. As much as we're up already, we're melting the fuck up from here.\n\n\n-------------\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.  [Treasury General Account](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WTREGEN)\n\n2.

He even talks about how he still expects them to likely fail going forward he just doesnt think its in the next 5 years so its a value play til then or at least it was when he made his analysis on 4$ GME not 40$.\n\nBut as a long term investment the analysis is dogshit, its built upon assumptions like Gamestop just straight up taking over incredibly difficult niches in the gaming space and doing it based on nothing but hopes and dreams and then somehow making those niches into ultra profitable sectors.\n\nLike for one it talks about the gaming industries growth as a sign that Gamestop (a gaming retailer) will also grow with it.\n\nIt ignores that Gamestop business however is shrinking significantly and they are far too late to transition to the digital space and in many case literally cant (walled garden storefronts that are straight up blocking 3rd party resellers like Gamestop). It also ignores that the digital space is incredibly competitive with companies that have REAL brand loyalty already reside and Gamestop is a known negative brand.\n\nSo why does the industry getting larger matter to Gamestop when the revenue is straight up going in the exact opposite direction of their specific business?\n\nLike part of his analysis is based on digital media transition being overblown but this year was staggeringly digital focused and Sony and Microsoft straight up are now selling consoles without disc drives which completely cuts Gamestop out.\n\nThis also ignores that second hand markets are easier than ever to utilize. Gamestop made much of its money on 2nd hand upsells where their margins were huge. Now that market is far more crowded with Amazon/Best Buy/Target/Walmart/Ect. all offering trade ins and also the fact that Facebook and many other apps now facilitate easy person to person sales which are far better for both the seller and buyer cutting out the middle man that is companies like Gamestop.\n\nAt the end he even boils it down to the fact that he clearly knows Hedge Funds are trying to execute incredibly risky shorts on the company and is looking mainly to exploit that. He straight up ends his analysis essentially saying he thinks the company is still in serious trouble but thinks it will outlast these bets that it will be bankrupt by a certain date and is willing to counter bet on it.\n\nYou bag holders with anywhere north of $100+ stocks are mega fucked and even he knows it.

They also have exclusive games and content to bait people into using their service and people STILL wont do it if given the choice.\n\nAnd Gamestop has none of that, they dont have exclusives they develop in house, they dont have the cash to buy said exclusives compared to others in the market, and they sure as hell dont have the reputation to pull people in without those incentives.\n\nAnd Streamers? Really? I mean come on this is literally something every company does and it doesnt just flip a switch to success nor work.\n\nLook at how much money Microsoft tossed at the biggest streamers on the planet to pump up their streaming platform and that still didnt move the needle in the slightest.\n\nAnd again, their reputation is BAD, like REALLY FUCKING BAD.\n\nI get that we are memeing here with regards to GME and its resurrection but as far as a brand goes Gamestop is reviled.\n\nAnd by the way, not just reviled by consumers but Developers alike, they fucking hate how Gamestop pushed used sales that completely cut them out. Which is why you saw so many developers straight up talking about one time sale codes (these actually existed in EA games for a time) that you had to activate to play and couldnt resell afterwards.

Endless amounts of misinformation being spread and pushed by politicians, influencers and alt media with clear agendas. Take your time to go through this to have a true understanding of what actually happened.**\n\n\"All of the relevant financial terms one needs to understand in order to have a decent grasp of these topics can be learned in a couple of hours, tops, yet it seems that not one, single, alternative media creator took the time to read up on any basic finance. Large creators with millions of followers including Kyle Kulinski, Tim Pool, Hasan Piker, Vaush, TheStockGuy, Steven Crowder, and influential politicians such as Ted Cruz, AOC and Ilhan Omar, and thousands of smaller \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cfinance\u201d channels on both YouTube and Twitch, and even some people who should know better like Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and Chamath Palihapitiya were so hungry to shove their ideological narrative into this situation that they abdicated the great responsibility they have when it comes to informing their audiences.\n\nAside from the propagation of misinformation, this is a very rare media frenzy that had the ability to directly and negatively harm audiences because it drove them to throw their money away on a garbage gamble, expecting a massive payout near the end. ( [1](https://i.imgur.com/Tb0FOhw.jpg) | [2](https://imgur.com/a/xN3aMNl) | [3](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/lbxn76) | [4](https://i.imgur.com/4VMXhiC.png) | [5](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55948550) | [6](https://www.pcgamer.com/after-gamestops-share-price-plummets-reddits-wallstreetbets-investors-are-hurting/) | [7](https://www.businessinsider.com/addicted-to-robinhood-wallstreetbets-day-trading-lost-everything-2021-2?IR=T) | [8](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EugXH9yXcAEUUG3?format=jpg&name=large) ). Many large content creators including LinusTechTips and H3H3 either spread the \u201cdiamond hands\u201d meme or showed themselves buying into the stock, undoubtedly driving their viewers to do so as well. It\u2019s impossible to document the myriad of stories of people negatively impacted by this, and r/wallstreetbet deleting a lot of the negative stories continues to misrepresent the narrative as \u201cretail winning big against the hedge funds.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that so much hate and vitriol is directed towards members of the finance community and mainstream media when the alternative media got this situation ubiquitously incorrect, sometimes in embarrassing ways. It\u2019s obvious that there was a political narrative to be spun here, but this was done almost entirely to the benefit of the content creators and politicians spinning the narrative and to the detriment of both the public discourse and the victims who were goaded into buying this stock. It\u2019s also unfortunate because there are very real criticisms that could be levied towards the financial industry in regards to this situation (Perhaps no commission trading is irresponsible? Perhaps gamifying investment apps is tantamount to gambling? Perhaps margin requirements should increase as short interest increases?), but we won\u2019t hear any of it. Instead, it will be a barrage of baseless claims by uneducated entertainers lamenting about the \u201cunfairness\u201d of the world of finance, despite them not understanding anything they\u2019re talking about beyond the basic definition of a short sale.\n\nI am also incredibly disappointed in media consumers. Over and over again, people on both the left and right say they wish they had more factual media, and less sensationalist reporting. And yet, over and over again, you, the consumer, prove yourselves wrong. The majority of consumers are just interested in the most sensationalized piece of media they can find that conforms to their pre-existing political beliefs.\n\nI hope, at the very least, that anyone who\u2019s listened to me review this document or talk about it on video will have a slightly better understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play here, but I won\u2019t hold my breath.\" - from the GameStop Manifesto", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "So youre telling me theres a chance.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09625974297523499}, {"body": "Destiny's manifesto is trash and he has no idea what he's talking about.

I've seen you make this point on your channel, and it betrays a misunderstanding of what liquidity means. A business that can't afford its operating expenses isn't necessarily facing a liquidity problem. A broker finding itself unable to meet a margin call is EXCLUSIVELY facing a liquidity problem. If that's not a liquidity problem, what is? And yet millions of people have likely watched the first interviews of the CEO.

{"title": "What if I told you, you could buy a Rolls Royce for \u00a31 gbp?", "selftext": "Thats right, a whole share of RR for \u00a31. \n\nBut RR is boomer stock, it makes luxury cars and not even electric ones. It's not a tech company and it's on the LSE. It even pays dividends! \n\nJust like BB and NOK, that's exactly what they want you to think. While we are chasing TSLA, APL and other big tech. The smart money is holding RR, BB and NOK. \n\nRR isn't a car company. BMW bought the RR brand. RR instead are a heavy industries and tech company. Their main business is Jet engines, with side ventures in Nuclear power plants, rocket engines and ship engines. \n\nJet engines: unless you've been under a rock these last few hours you will know that a jet engine blew up recently. That engine was attached to a Boeing 777 and was a Pratt and Whitney engine. NOT A RR ENGINE. \n\nThe scare from this event might ground all P&W engines, it might not. But what it will do is give manufacturers (airbus and Boeing) a clear reason to choose RR over their main competition. Airbus already use RR engines, Boeing uses it on some of their back room stock. If they do get grounded, RR will go to the moon (we'll come back to that) if they don't,  then it still bullish.  \n\nNuclear power: RR have developed small scale nuclear power plants.  With Texas losing power, small nuclear back up power plants might be seen as an alternate way to ensure 24/7 power to a local area. Oil, gas are on the way out and while sustainable power is good, nuclear will play a big role in meeting the needs of the future. \n\nShip engines: RR make the engines for the Royal Navy (the fourth largest Navy in the world) including the engines for HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. \n\nThat means RR is a crucial part of the UKs defence system and as such will not be allowed to fail. Thats right, it doesn't matter how bad RR finances get, the UK government will bail them out. Because they aren't going to allow their new multi billion dollar aircraft carriers to go out of service due to mechanical failure. \n\nNot only that but Boris Johnson is investing into the Royal Navy like no conservative Prime Minster before. There are 8 new Royal Navy Frigates currently being built with the Australian Navy in line to order 1 for themselves. While BAE is leading the project, RR are heavily involved in propulsion and steering. Again, their involvement in ongoing defence contracts means the chances of bankruptcy is 0. \n\nSpace: Here is how we get to the moon. The UK space agency has signed a contract with Rolls Royce to look into nuclear powered space flight [link](http://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/12-01-2021-rr-uk-space-agency-launches-first-study-into-nuclear-power.aspx)\n\n[A full list of the services RR provide](http://www.rollsroyce.com/products-and-services.aspx)\n\nNow is your chance to get in to a 10 bagger before the rush.

The person who understand the business and company the most in this world, is basically telling you to buy the fking stock as its value is not reflected. He then said this software is going to be the future, it was a luxury in the past but a necessity now and in the future as companies emerge as winners using Palantir. Palantir also helps with company transitions.\n\nAlex Karp then politely ask short-term investors to f-off and diss the wallstreet analysts who doubted palantir and how palantir time and time proven itself, diss the other tech companies who serve wallstreet and thus failed and also not serving long-term goals and average investors, basically mentioned confidently on how Palantir is going to strive in the future; which also means moon now in the short-term due to how undervalued the price is now.\n\nTo end off, he mentioned AT LEAST 45% revenue growth for the next 5 years, 4 bil revenue or more by 2025 then.For those who dont know, in Q3, Alex Karp confidently mentioned AT LEAST 30% revenue growth, and he delivered 47% revenue growth in Q4.

I'm applying for a loan to have work done in the garden, both my father and my sister have been bombarding my wife and me for months now about not taking a loan for anything at all ever. And my father who owns part of the house I live in (I bought it together with my parents, when my mother passed away her share of the house was supposed to go to me but then my dad went to the notary on his own and claimed her share.) Had called me last week to yell at me that this is his house, and he doesn't want me to have any work done on HIS house, and that since I met my wife I've lost all sense of financial responsibility, I used to have plenty reserves and now it's loan here, loan there etc... etc... And if I do get a loan and have work done in the garden he will throw us all out of HIS house that he owns!\n\nThis happens all the time, 11 years ago when my wife was pregnant both my father and my sister kept pestering us to have our daughter aborted my father going so far as to cut off all contact with me during the pregnancy until the day when my daughter was born and she became his favorite child in the world and the only thing he ever talks about... And my sister coming over all the way from Spain where she lived at the time to tell me to not have a child because there's a financial burden and it will be inconvenient etc... etc... etc... And now she's constantly talking about how much she loves my daughter and constantly interfering how I should raise her so she can get a doctorate in 20 years time and how I must do this and that and stimulate such and such etc....\n\nEven when we buy a car my dad will interfere and push us in the direction of the car brand he feels we should have. We once planned a testdrive with a hybrid toyota, and when I told my dad he called us every day yelling about not buying anything electric and certainly not a hybrid electric/gasoline aspirated car! We had to buy a Diesel and he forced us to buy a Mazda 3 Diesel version because Diesel would always always be the financially better option, a few years later my country decided to discourage polluting diesels by raising taxes on diesel cars and on Diesel fuel itself making it just as expensive as gasoline and at the same time giving subsidies and tax exemptions for electrical and hybrid cars (you don't pay the 21% VAT or road taxes or first time registry tax if you buy an electric car in my country as opposed to a fossil fuel car where you pay all these things).... When I confronted my dad about that he just said Electric is a dumb fad, governments are out to bully car drivers, and how cars aren't bad for the environment and that Elon Musk and his stupid Tesla can go bankrupt any day now and if he doesn't then that's proof of foul play....\n\nThe bank had also denied our loan last week because there's not enough they can confiscate despite my wife and I meeting the monthly income requirements needed to get a loan. So now we are looking to split the loan between the bank for a small amount and an independent creditor for the bigger amount.
