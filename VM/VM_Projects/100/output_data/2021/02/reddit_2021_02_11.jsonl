{"title": "Journey to $1 Million - February 10th, 2021", "selftext": "Today was a mixed day, but mostly flat. There were a lot of stocks off my watchlist pull back closer to the 'Buy Zone'. This could be a good opportunity to start dollar cost averaging into some long term positions. Most notably, the ARK Invest ETF's pulled back with K, G and Q more than 1%. \n\n* SPY: -0.08%\n* QQQ: -0.31%\n* DIA: +0.18%\n\nNotable Recent Picks:\n\n* $FUTU +9.2%\n* $PHUN +12%\n* $GEVO +9.6%\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMy portfolio is down -0.58% today, mostly because TSLA dropped 5%. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vc4efq0lerg61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf1ea49855b5cab0b313ec8a492fbd786b9743f\n\nPositions filled, including closing for profit/loss. $IPOD was the only one I closed for a loss of $110. I'll reevaluate that one later. Remember, the higher the risk, the smaller the position should be. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5kf1r95merg61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2ca5f1be0efe47a868f2b679765b51b03a6530e\n\n Current open and closed options positions since January 27th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22d79jfnerg61.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bd8a2fb1f3ecce4ba38ffed6a582cf3d66a028b\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Adding to Watchlist:**\n\n**$BIDU:** Baidu is basically the Google of China. There is a rumor I've recently come across that $BIDU reportedly aims to address chip shortage plaguing the gaming, crypto and car industries. The are considering setting up a dedicated subsidiary backed by crypto-friendly venture capital firms. There is a global chip shortage, partly fueled by the rise of BTC and partly by Covid-19 uptick of gaming. Baidu has a strong grasp on their market in China; they aren't going anywhere, so even if the rumor falls short, it is still not a bad hold. I'd b interested in mid term calls. \n\n* Target Price: $330\n* Entry: <$290\n* Risk: 3\n* Timeframe: 1-2 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/slfa9aaperg61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa4f91f0e807db093be946696b6244b533630c5c\n\n \n\n**BLDP:** Ballard Power is a developer and manufacturer of proton exchange membrane fuel cell products for markets such as heavy-duty motive, portable power, material handling as well as engineering services. A day ago, they launched a $350M bought deal offering at $37a share which was $3 under the market price at that time. This caused the price to drop 13% today. If you take a look at the chart, it looks like $BLDP could stand to drop another 5-10% and fill the gap from January. I'd set that as a buy zone to pick up cheap shares, or mid-long term options. Overall, this company is set to have continued growth, and I think this sell off is temporary. \n\n* Target Price: $45\n* Entry: <$31\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 3-6 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sn2adreqerg61.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=def05bede208665c31c614249ef4200acb1d77f7\n\n \n\n**Notable Mentions:**\n\n**$ELY:** Looks like earnings came up short and Callaway has entered our 'Buy Zone'. Here is the chart from a couple days ago when we first wrote about it. (you can go back and see our past write up on $ELY)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxk82bererg61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e4383306eab354d857443f5dee1f6edf129a0ba\n\nHere it is today: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zs2y459serg61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=69f5dd91de5025c644085a51cf03373fddaee2fa\n\nI see some people thinking it is not a good buy anymore, but when I first drew the 'Buy Zone' I believed then that it would hit it and is a good buy at those levels. My opinion on $ELY hasn't changed. Congrats to anyone that picked some ELY up. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**$FUTU:** Another one that we called correctly from yesterday's write up report. It was up 9% today overall, but right after opening bell, you could have taken profits at around $204. I'll keep watching this one to pull back further into the 'Buy Zone'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$ARKK/$ARKG:** Like stated above, the ARK ETF's are on sale today. Usually when that happens, I will add money to these positions in some way. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNote: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.", "id": "lhap47", "created_utc": 1613010540.0, "score": 445, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "God damn I need to get my ADHD treated", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "I have no problems with ADHD.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m very, very glad to hear that!

{"title": "Using math, I came to the conclusion that APHA options is a better investment than TLRY options.", "selftext": "At the time of this post (Feb 10, 2021, post-8pm) APHA closed at $28.15 and TLRY closed at $67.80. With the upcoming merger (around May, right?) where APHA will be worth 0.83 for ever 1 TLRY share, that means, should both stocks trade sideways from now until the merger, APHA will be worth around ($67.80 x 0.83 = $56.27). So......if that's the case, that means if you buy the highest OTM APHA leaps ($35c, which is selling at $11.60 which is $1160/contract at the time of this post), and APHA/TLRY trades sideways until the merger happens, APHA will be worth $56.27, which means it will be over $20 ITM of the $35c strike price. And if you bought those APHA at $11.60, which means the break even is at $46.60, you will still be ~$10 ITM, which, for every one contract you buy, is $1000 gainz since the delta will be at 1.00.\n\nThis ALMOST seems like a sure thing. Why not a sure thing? Well, as the merger date gets closer and closer, there is a chance that TLRY will slowly start decreasing in price and/or APHA will start increasing in price to reach an equilibrium. Assuming a bearish stance, imagine APHA trades sideways the entire time and remains at $28.15 until the merger, and TLRY decreases in price to become the same price as APHA (ie: $28.15). which means APHA will be worth $28.15 x 0.83 = $23.36. Therefore, those $35 c strike price leaps will be OTM by ~$11. With the $35c strike price having a delta at .6868, that means a loss of 68.68 x $11 = $755.48 from your $1160 $35c leaps investment (it'll probably be more since I'm not taking gamma into consideration).\n\nIf you wanna be bearish and don't want to risk losing $755.48 out of your $1160 investment. for a $75.548 / $1160 = 65% loss on investment, then this post is not for you because you worry about the loss more than the reward (which should not be that case since we have no problems seeing GME shares waaaaay in the red while diamond handing those shares. ) Perhaps you should step away from weed-stops because there may be a chance the stocks for both TLRY/APHA crash like weed stocks crashed in 2018, which may leave your options expiring worthless.\n\nHowever, my thought process is that TLRY/APHA SHOULD not crash soon (not unless it rallies too high too quickly and people think those stock are in a bubble about to pop and wanna cash out their profits before they fell so they won't be left bagholding and start selling which'll cause the stocks to drop which will/may cause panic selling from newbies here in WSB wanting to cut their losses ) before the merger (ie: Democrats are in power and speculation is good that weed will become legalized, and thus, further rallying) which means buying APHA leaps may be a good choice.\n\nAm I mathing correctly?\n\nMy positions before I get banned.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/pngSqjy\n\nhttps://ibb.co/fpVczf1\n\nhttps://ibb.co/z5XcJ9r\n\nIf you click on my profile, you'll see that I bought 100 contracts of TLRY at 0.77 a month ago. I've since sold 75 contracts of them as the stock rallied so I could use the profits to buy leaps in other stocks and APHA. Man, had I held till now, I'd be able to sell those contracts for $346k. Oh well, gainz is gainz.\n\nHere's a screen capture of the APHA contract I yolo'd into using some of my TLRY profits.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/2MPH6bK\n\nLook at those dates. I bought APHA leaps options the day before this post, and the morning of this post. Anyway, who's ready to lose money yolo'ing into weed stocks like I did?\n\nTLDR: APHA seems like a good choice moreso than TLRY since those Dems are in power and there is good speculation play with the legalization of weed.", "id": "lhbbqj", "created_utc": 1613012439.0, "score": 844, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 323, "comments": [{"body": "> With the upcoming merger (around May, right?) where APHA will be worth 0.83 for ever 1 TLRY share\n\nI think you got that backwards, so all of your math was based on what looks like an incorrect assumption.\n\n\"Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the \"Aphria Shareholders\") will\nreceive 0.8381 shares (the \"Exchange Ratio\") of Tilray for each Aphria common share (each, an\n\"Aphria Share\").\"\n\nhttps://www.m-x.ca/f_circulaires_en/210-20_en.pdf\n\nThat's a prelim Canadian adjustment memo.

Anyway, here's my take on TLRY:\n\nWhy are the options on these weed tickers so expensive?  Because market makers have priced in the possibility of an explosive move in the near future.  This is reflected in implied volatilities exceeding 300%.  For reference, implied vol on AAPL is between 20-30%...even during earnings the share price of Apple doesn't bounce around too much.  Everybody knows it's a solid company with a reliably predictable amount of annual growth.  Market makers have no reason to expect a big surprise with Apple, and as a result the price tag for APPL options is relatively cheap.  In WSB parlance, they're cheap because it's unlikely that a YOLO play on AAPL calls will yield heaps of tendies.  More likely than not, you'll be holding FD's. \n\nEssentially, buying calls or puts reflects a conviction that the price movement will be larger than what the options market makers have baked into the price tag for the option.  In technical terms, going long an option (held through expiration, not scalping intra-day price changes) is only profitable if realized volatility exceeds implied volatility.  Historically, options are overpriced -- implied volatility is larger than realized volatility.  Retail traders can exploit this discrepancy by selling options instead of buying them.  If realized volatility is less than implied volatility (ie the price movement is less than what market makers have baked into the cake), the option expires worthless and the seller keeps the premium.   \n\nSo right now, options across the board for weed names are expensive.  How would retail traders potentially capture an edge?  One way is to sell out of the money puts.  20 - 40 delta depending on your risk tolerance.  I sold TLRY $40 strike puts with Feb 19 expiration for $500 and the same strike for the March 19 expiration for $1100.  My worst case scenario for the Feb 19 puts is that the price drops below $35 and I get assigned shares.  Which I'm ok with -- even at a loss -- because I believe the price will recover in time and I'm willing to bag hold.  For the March 19 expiration, I'm ok as long as the price of TLRY trades above $29.  If the share price trades above those values, I make money.  If they trade at or above $40, I keep all of the premium at expiration.  You could trade the higher strikes for even more premium...but the risk is higher.\n\nNow, if the price of TLRY blows sky high, I can close out my puts since the price of the puts will drop since they become even more out of the money.  I may be even so inclined to roll the puts to higher strikes to collect more premium.  \n\nIn the event that the price falls, say to around $45-50 range, I believe I can still collect a good percentage of the total premium even way ahead of expiration due volatility crush.  If the hype is over and the price of TLRY stabilizes, the implied volatility of the options will plummet, probably below 150%.  When that happens, the options become much cheaper.  If I want, I can close out my position and collect a portion of the premium --  I'd still be leaving some money on the table because I'm closing prior to expiration (I won't get all of the $500 or $1100), but I'll bank a decent chunk of it and eliminate assignment risk in the process.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the explanation, I really think thetagang is the way to go, I just need to dial in my strategy based on risk tolerance and start cashing in instead of trying to time buying calls and hoping that I\u2019m on the right side of the IV.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5689473152160645}], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11390668898820877}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5421667695045471}, {"body": "and APHA just wiped 50% of my profit when the market opened.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4370048940181732}, {"body": "Redo the math after today lol what is it at now", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I think 0?

{"title": "A historical survey of the systemic problem of shorting non-existing stock (naked shorting) in relation to recent events", "selftext": "A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME\n\nTLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**.\n\nI was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:\n\nOne of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\\_institutions\\_hold\\_177\\_of\\_float\\_why\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\\_points\\_to\\_gme\\_shorts\\_not\\_having\\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.\n\nI\u2019m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). \u201cFailures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from \u201cnaked\u201d short selling**.\u201d\n\nInteresting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.\n\nAccording to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, \u201cAbusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago\u2026 Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**\u2026 We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))\n\nIn a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent \"irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market \u2013 it is undermining it.\u201d** Mr Cox also \u201creferred to \"the serious problem of abusive naked short sales\u201d as \u201c**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**\" and that the SEC is \"concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**\" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\\_points\\_to\\_gme\\_shorts\\_not\\_having\\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman\u2019s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))\n\nAs another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))\n\nI also read \u2018**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create \"**phantom\" or \"counterfeit\" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price\u2019**\u201d. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a \"push\" into extinction from \"a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling\". (Source: [https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/))\n\nAll these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.\n\nOn 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.\n\nApparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.\n\nThen I read something that caught my eye\u2026 DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, \u201cDepository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These \"failures to deliver\" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.\u201d (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))\n\nApparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal \u201c**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.\u201d (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).\n\n\"It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))\n\nAs a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn\u2019t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn\u2019t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would\u2019ve happened that day.\n\nFrom the Wall Street Journal: \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**\u2026 Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This \"phantom stock\" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply\u2026 Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.\u201d** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))\n\nFrom everything I\u2019ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:\n\n* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)\n* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\\_points\\_to\\_gme\\_shorts\\_not\\_having\\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to \u201ccover\u201d their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close\n* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float\n* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)\n* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may\u2019ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME\n* There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.\n\nWith the GameStop hearings coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez [https://twitter.com/AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC), email: [us@ocasiocortez.com](mailto:us@ocasiocortez.com)\n\nAl Green [https://twitter.com/repalgreentx](https://twitter.com/repalgreentx), email: [al.green@mail.house.gov](mailto:al.green@mail.house.gov)\n\nMaxine Waters [https://twitter.com/maxinewaters](https://twitter.com/maxinewaters), email: [maxine.waters@mail.house.gov](mailto:maxine.waters@mail.house.gov)\n\nNancy Pelosi Email: [https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi](https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi) email: [sf.nancy@mail.house.gov](mailto:sf.nancy@mail.house.gov).\n\nAnd you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to: [https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm](https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm)\n\n**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC. Here's an actual recent example where Prime Brokers are accused of coordinating naked shorting** [**https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\\_id=224548&navigationaction=home&page=1&newssection=industry**](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548&navigationaction=home&page=1&newssection=industry)\n\n**This brings up another interesting thought experiment a commenter brought up. On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then if the squeeze was about to happen or happening, if they margin called the shorts, they would go down as well as shorts would not be able to pay and brokers would be holding the bag. They have every incentive in this case to NOT margin call because doing so might also taken them down, instead the most logical option would be to make a backroom deal which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**\n\nAlso, a [compelling theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lglkwv/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/gmsll2k/) put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read", "id": "lhta3u", "created_utc": 1613073775.0, "score": 1581, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 255, "comments": [{"body": "Absolutely, things were ready to pop off massively on the morning of Thursday, January 28.

There is zero doubt in my mind that GME was about to hit 700+ dollars that day.

Have you looked into market makers and delta-gamma hedging? For me, this is where the issue arises. \n\nIf someone buys a GME call option there will generally be a market maker on the other end of the trade. The market maker needs to balance the risk of selling the option, and they do this by delta-gamma hedging the position. Likewise if lots of Put options are purchased then a market maker can hedge this risk by shorting stock and buying a long Call option to delta-gamma hedge. \n\nAs the GME stock price rose, interest in buying Puts rose which created further naked short selling by market makers fulfilling their market maker regulatory requirements. This isn't usually an issue but became one as GME was already greater than 100% short, and there are no shares to actually borrow for the purpose of this hedging. I believe the large increase in fail-to-deliver shares comes from the market makers hedging their positions. \\[Note: As you say fail-to-deliver shares happens if not delivered within 3 days, but I believe market makers have 21 days(?) rather than 3 days according to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8ox3/at\\_these\\_levels\\_its\\_not\\_about\\_the\\_price\\_of\\_the/glmmlsa?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3\\].\n\n   \n \n\nSay a Robinhood retail investor buys a GME put option, then from my perspective the parties involved are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Robinhood investor (put      buyer)\n* Robinhood clearing house\n* DTCC \n* Market maker (put seller)\n\nWhen the Robinhood investor and market maker make this transaction then the market maker can hedge their sale of the Put option by shorting stock and buying a Call option. This would delta-gamma hedge the position.\n\nDTCC increased the collateral requirements on GME to 100%. This essentially led to Robinhood stop buying of GME, but why did DTCC do this? Probably because they saw the market makers on the other side of the trade can't carry on operating in this manner. The market makers can't possibly fulfil their positions as greater than 100% shares are already short. It makes sense to me that DTCC would raise collateral requirements in this circumstance as there is significant counterparty risk, but it would be interesting to know if any market makers put pressure them to do this (wild speculation on my part). \n\nNote that Citadel is key option market maker. Whilst there should be Chinese walls between the Citadel market maker division and the Citadel hedge fund division (who directly took up Melvin Capital's GME short position) it does make you wonder whether they flat out told DTCC about the default liability on GME; if GME had truly squeezed then it's possible the market makers wouldn't have the capital liquidity to put up for all their positions.\n\nHere's a delta-gamma hedging example with numbers if it's a new concept:\n\n[https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/108888/how-to-hedge-delta-and-gamma-of-a-put-option-simultaneously](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/108888/how-to-hedge-delta-and-gamma-of-a-put-option-simultaneously)", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5978204011917114}, {"body": "I guess the question is, so what does that mean to those of us with shares?

For easy math let's even say that the stock is worth $365 at closing.

It is pervasive. \n\nAnd it just hit terminal velocity yesterday when the story hit the major news. \n\nIt's the new fad now. Fad buying will ensue.\n\nSo today is likely the final explosion (or one of the 3 or so final explosions) of dumb money chasing FOMO, profiteers from GME buying more stock because they have money to burn, GME bag holders trying to break even, some guy who caught the news last night and hates his boss and wants to quit.

They hype the stock now, it sustains a stupid price, then blows up when merger is finalized and then blows up for legalization (in whichever orders those occur). Like $300-$400 territory.

Ive been studying call and put options but am having a hard time finding an answer for 1 huge question i have about put options... I understand why a call options works, you are signing a contract to BUY shares at a set price for a set amount of time, regardless if the stock was to surge, and thats how you would profit. What i dont understand is, if you are the seller of a Put option, so you sign a contract to SELL 100 shares at a set price, regardless if it falls, dont you already have to own 100 shares of said stock?  everything i keep reading and watching talks about how if you buy a put, but the stock goes up, it expires OTM, and you lose the premium you paid for it. ok i get that, but wouldnt you still own the 100 shares you originally made the Put contract for, and therefor be positive whatever the difference is between the premium vs the new stock price? unlike a call option where you dont own anything and the only gamble is the premium you could lose, for a put option dont you need to own the stock, therefor you are already invested in it, right? so unlike a call, you are already financially invested in a Put because you already had to buy the 100 shares to make a put contract for? so is the only reason to buy a put contract to hedge your bets and guarantee it wont fall below a certain price? thats where i am confused, all the write ups and videos keep saying you can profit by the stock falling, but the profit isnt true \"profit\" because you already bought into that stock at some point. it seems more like insurance on the money you spent. the only scenario i see that being beneficial would be if you bought stock XYZ at $5, held it to $20, then rather than sell, bought a put option with a strike price of $20 because you want to wait and see if it can go up even higher. is that correct? you couldnt buy a stock at $20, then buy a put with strike of $20, because even if the stock dropped to $0, you wouldn't technically profit, you would simply not lose the different of your initial investment minus the premium?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "For both calls and puts, you don\u2019t have to own the shares. IF you choose your right to exercise your options, they play out like this: \n\nFor a call, let\u2019s say you want to get a 100 shares of a stock that\u2019s $43. That\u2019s $4300 you don\u2019t have. But you know the stock is going up to $50 or more and you know you\u2019ll have the money next week. So you buy a call option and pay the $1 insurance ($1x100 shares = $100) to secure your shares for $5000. Even if the stock is $60 at the time of expiration, the premium you paid secures your transaction for $50 a share. \n\nNow let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want to buy the shares but think a stock is going up and want to make a profit. For the previous example of the $43 stock, simply buy a call $50 and sell the call when the price gets above $50 before expiration. You\u2019d subtract the premium you paid $100 to buy, and $100 to sell from the $7 the stock rose. So $7 at 100 shares is $700. So your profit in that scenario would be $500. \n\nFor a put option, you know a stock is going down and you want to sell it. In this example a stock is $15 a share and you know it\u2019s going down. So you buy a put option with a premium of $0.50 to secure a price that you will sell it at. If you buy a put $11, you secure your right sell at $11 even if it falls down to $8. \n\nYou can do the same with puts to make profits without owning the shares. If you think the price is going down, you\u2019d just buy the put option and sell it by expiration. Your profit on the previous example would be $1500 - $1100 - $50 - $50 = $300.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8146942257881165}, {"body": "Please don\u2019t SELL a put until you know more.

Some stocks have warnings. \n\nUnbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.\n\nFinviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .\n\nMy stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .\n\nTD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.

Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. \n\nI trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .\n\nThe general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. \n\nWe all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . \n\nI don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. \n\nI go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. \n\nBefore a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.\n\nI also go to Stocktwits for the same .\n\nSomeone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. \n\nBut these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.\n\nFinally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

So you can set an activation number, say 100$, and then a sell number, let's say 75$. Once it hits 100$, if the stock drops to 75$, it'll automatically sell whatever you set it to sell at that level.

You could do a sort of staggered approach, like set stop limits at 80, 90, 100, that would each sell if it got down to 50, 60, 70, respectively, if you really wanted to hedge your bets. I'm fairly new to this myself, so trying to figure out these buying and selling balances can take some time. \n\nI'd say it also depends on volatility. If, like me, you decided to invest in a 3x ETF, which is a highly volatile stock type that can swing up and down wildly, setting a high activation point with a fairly low, but still above investment cost, sell point helps hedge against the volatility. But it's not perfect exactly because it still has to hit that activation point first. There's always the chance the day you decide to set a stop limit is the same day the stock just fucking tanks. \n\nIf you're dealing with less volatile stocks that don't seem like they'll swing up and down, you can set tighter limits, like activate at 80, sell at 60, just in case something happens that day. \n\nOr, and I'm just thinking out loud at this point, you could double up your limit types. Maybe you're hoping to sell at 100, so you could set a regular limit for 100 and maybe it'll get there. But, you could also set a stop limit that activates at 90 and sells at 75, so if it doesn't actually make it to 100 and it dips down instead, it'll just sell off.

Some stocks have warnings. \n\nUnbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.\n\nFinviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .\n\nMy stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .\n\nTD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. \n\nI trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .\n\nThe general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. \n\nWe all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . \n\nI don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. \n\nI go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. \n\nBefore a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.\n\nI also go to Stocktwits for the same .\n\nSomeone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. \n\nBut these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.\n\nFinally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

I noticed around 7 years ago it was worth billions but now its less than a cent, and is suddenly exploding", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There are many negative views on here stating that it is impossible for HCMC to reach a dollar. They all spew the same rhetoric, that there are too many outstanding shares. Here I am breaking down why this may get to $1 or above.\n\n1. The lawsuit vs. PM is seeking approximately 1.5-1.7 billion usd. It is also very likely there will also be a royalty payment for PM to continue use of the iqos technology. They have made billions on this technology, and it is in there best interest.\n\n2. PM does not want to take this to court. This will be a very bad image for PM, even if it does win the case (which is not likely). Legal issues being resolved in court will drive the stock price down, and investors will exit upon arrival of the court date. Further, this will attract more option and short sellers, which will further drive down the price. By settling out of court, PM will avoid negative publicity, will preserve for the most part, its stock price, and will most likely be able to continue to use the technology.\n\n3. There is a possibility that PM buys out HCMC. This gives a lot of room for growth, whether they continue the HCMC brand, or incorporate directly to PM brand. Stock price will still rise significantly. I don\u2019t see this as the probable solution, but it is a possibility.\n\n4. Most importantly, there will not be a reverse split. The ceo owns 11 billion shares. Many company employees own preferred stocks that are in the process of being converted into common stock, which will allow them to watch their portfolio grow. This happened last week, which, given the 20 day requirement on notification, lines itself up perfectly with the court/likely settlement date. Something is happening, and the company is giving very good hints.\n\n5. The most likely outcome is what most are neglecting to see. The company, upon a settlement, will most likely buyback most outstanding shares, and retire them. They can do this with roughly 400-500 million USD, which leaves still another 1 billion USD from a settlement for their usage. This will send the stock price soaring. Due to the number of insiders who own common shares, including the ceo, along with the new investor at 3 billion shares, and most likely a partner/supporter/confidant of the CEO, this is all their best interests to drive the price up. Reverse splits will rise the price, but lowers the number of owned stock, this have no influence on the value of your portfolio. The buyback very well could have started already, as there is a decent chance that a settlement has been reached, but just not yet announced.\n\nIn summary, this company, which is already quite profitable and successful, will win its lawsuit against PM, most likely via settlement. This will send the price quite high, and the price will soar once the company starts buying back and retiring stock, which very well could have already started.\n\nRide this to the moon.

I'm just a novice and never had any interest in this stuff so have been doing the stock thing through an app and just kind of fooling around. First off, I want to say that if your job offers a 401k, do it - my job matches up to 5%, so hey, free money! It's better than any savings account and I'd rather leave that up to the experts. I quit a job in my 20s and took out my 401k there fearing that I'd be broke but I wish I hadn't and instead, rolled it over to an IRA (which I wasn't aware of) - I'd have way more money now... also, you have to have money to invest - when all of your cash is going to rent and necessities, it's virtually impossible to get started, so don't invest more than you think you may need in the future for emergencies. \nWith the stock thing, I've been doing a lot of reading and watching YouTube videos to learn the ins and outs. It's a lot like gambling and no one really seems to have a sure bet answer to making a lot of money fast. I'm a skeptic at heart, so will not allow myself to follow anyone's advice or claims 100% so I browse recommendations like I do Yelp reviews and average out the pros and cons, lol. I follow some of the stock sites like StockTwit just to see what people are saying and have found some good ones based on their perspectives but by following up with my own research - is it a company I believe in? Have their earnings been good and steady? What's the future look like for them? Am I willing to take a risk for a reward- because it's risky, especially with penny stocks and low volume companies. I started building up my stocks by buying some (I try to keep it around a steady 10-12 different comapanies) and selling off about 25%-50% of my shares of whatever stock had a good return and then buy some shares of another stock, hold and repeat (I hold some for the long term and others I go back and forth on). Diversification is definitely important - 'don't put all your eggs in one basket' as the saying goes, and it's been a trip to see how when one sector drops, the other is in the green. It's a crazy world, thats for sure, and it's all speculation when it comes down to it, plus there's tons of manipulation so don't beat yourself up if things don't pan out right away. Patience is key. I've taken a small loss just because I got bored looking at a stock but I sold and put it into something that made up for it. I'm just a little obsessed now seeing my money work. I've made more in an hour than I do in an entire work day which is like, woah... there have been downs that really freaked me out but it always goes up again in time. I see now why people get into this. I just have to keep myself in check and not get too excited or too down about it or put more money than I'm able into it and there's no way I would/could commit to day trading or anything like that. I put a lot of money into CDs as a safe investment but the rate of return is still slim - I've made more on stocks with a tiny fraction of what's in those CDs in far less time. It's a trip.

It's like witnessing a war between the Amazon peoples and America where one side has stealth bombers and the other has sticks.

All I did was strict buy and hold, literally never sold a stock. Built a portfolio of 17 different stocks. Now I'm 26 and my \u20ac20k turned into \u20ac70k. It's nothing flashy consdering whats going on today but I performed better than the S&P 500 and I was able to sleep well, its called risk adjusted returns, I think most of the new investors dont know what that means. I was probably lucky because I had a few years without crazy Reddit pumps which allowed me to build confidence in my strategy. \n\nJust rebuild and stop trading, you're so young you can still reach anything. Your initial choice of stocks sounds good to me, it was a good start. Also stop listening to Reddit when it comes to stock choices, the stock market related subs have gone to absolute shit lately, it appears to be all about pumping small caps now. You will miss a lot of good stocks because Reddit doesnt like to circlejerk around them and you will buy garbage that got pumped and will get dumped. Literally just pull up a list of the S&P 500, or of global stocks and pick companies you think will have a bright future. Ignore the price.\n\nIf you invest in a company see it like marriage. Only leave them if some very very serious happens or the relationship is so bad that you just need to end it. Personally I prefer to just never ever sell, makes things simple. Maybe more boring, but simple and the average investor will perform a lot better using this strategy because most will get tempted to do the things you ended up doing. If you make the choice to never sell a stock, you will be more cautious with your choices and do more DD before you buy. If you want to have some \"fun\" then have it in a seperate account, not in your serious but successful investing account. \n\nYou will rebuild and there are strategies out there that can work for retail investors, but you need a strategy and stick to it religiously. Take some time to think of a strategy, maybe even write it down and that then is your bible. If you want to have success in the long run then trading doesn't work for 99% of people. Being 20 and already having made that experience in the stock market is very valuable. \n\nMy largest position is NVDA which I bought in 2016 at $60. Even if the long term chart looks flashy, there were some rough times me and NVDA went through. You've also experienced NVDA trading sideways for half a year. When see your NVDA position doing that and you're actually investing then you don't really care. You know that right now they are printing as much money as they possibly could and are doing many various great things. You probably sold NVDA because you got bored of it and saw people tripling their money within a week in GME. Don't do that, in the long run pigs always get slaughtered. Ironically NVDA has broken out and is now above $600. \n\nThe fact that you've written this thread shows that you can absolutely do it. Get yourself a strategy and stick to it. Realize that it takes a fuckload of humility to survive on the stock market. Everyone on Reddit is acting like they know it all when in fact noone knows anything, not even the big guys on wallstreet.

You will get beaten down, stepped on, pushed around in a number of ways throughout life, but the ones who come out of it smelling like roses are the ones who learn from their mistakes and fight back harder.

I even tried to opt out once by taking a ton of pills and leaving a note and thought about it trying again a hundred other times.

WSB is a bunch of idiots that blindly followed some dumb advice of \"diamond handing\" the stock, even though the people giving that advice were selling off their shares whole the rest of us watched our values plummet.\n\nThe one thing that you and I will learn from all of this that has given me confidence in future investing: always have an exit plan for yourself. Don't get greedy and think you should hold just because some idiot tells you to. If you are in the green and have mad enough, well your shares, and most importantly use stop limits to minimize your losses.\n\nYou aren't alone in this, and if it is any consolation, it could be worse. I saw some idiots putting in over a million on GME when the stock was around $350. I also saw other idiots that used credit to buy GME and are now just stuck with a ton of debt for nothing.

I think your post is invaluable to all investors and not just young investors.   I think it\u2019a great that you\u2019re putting money away already in some equities that you believe in. Your picks before the whole GME thing are excellent conservative investment vehicles. That is \u201cinvesting\u201d because you did your DD and you picked them for a reason for long term holds. \n\nLiquidating your positions in your long term portfolio and speculating on BB is considered \u201cspeculation\u201d. This is different from investing. I know most of the more experienced people on this sub are probably thinking \u201cwhy are you explaining basics?\u201d  It\u2019s because I think strengthening basics and re-evaluating your portfolio on a continual basis leads to smart investment decisions. I\u2019m not saying that nobody should speculate but if your main purpose of having an investment account is to invest in your future, you shouldn\u2019t be liquidating your long term positions in order to speculate.  I would recommend keeping a 10-20% pool of funds kept in money market cash for speculation purposes instead. \n\nAnyone taking more than a 50% hit to their portfolio would be in a similar situation to you. It sucks to be down that amount on your savings. You are right that you are still young and you can recover. I\u2019ve seen many people hit rock bottom and come back and beyond where they had been. Remember your investment goals and look at a lot of different investment vehicles to spot opportunities for long term growth. You learned a very valuable lesson here that is worth more than what you held in GME and BB. Keep your chin up and get back on that dance floor because the music only stops when you stop. \n\nJust so you know you\u2019re not alone, I went in on the whole GME craze too but only with a small portion of my surplus cash portion of my accounts because I did my DD and saw an opportunity with the surplus short interest in the stock. I figured that it would have about a 80% chance of it dropping significantly or a 20% chance it would go through the roof if the institutional players were stubborn enough to not cover their short positions. Knowing some fund managers and their hubris, I knew it was a possibility but a small possibility. I knew the short interest data was out at least 15 days and I warned others on WSB too. I knew short squeezes have about a 2-3 month duration from historical data and that there is normally 1-3 spikes in price 8x the 52 week avg. I knew that Chewy.com ex-CEO was going into GME so even if the short squeeze didn\u2019t pan out, the shares are still worth more than they were trading for.

I am 30 years old, never invested before.\n\nFirst things first is, I made sure that I had easily accessible money in my checking account for day to day living and a 6 month emergency fund in my savings account. You need this because it is easily accessible when you need it. You dont have to sell off stocks or ETFs and then wait for funds to settle and then to withdraw and wait for the funds to show in your bank account which can take a week or more. The size of your emergency fund and day to day living fund will depend on your salary, savings, and spending. \n\nPay off all debt first. Long term debt and high interest credit card debt should be targeted. Check r/personalfinance for more info about paying off your debt. I managed to do this and this allowed me to finally start investing.\n\nAfter paying off my debts and establishing an emergency fund, I started investing. \n\nIf I worked for a company that matched contributions to a 401K account, I would have 100% taken advantage of it and contributed the max allowed per year. You basically get free money from the company. Unfortunately, my company is trash so I decided to not contribute and instead invest myself. \n\nAfter all of that, I looked into the stock market. After research, my best bet was to invest in an index fund or a mutual fund. A mutual fund is actively managed which comes with fees. An index fund is passively managed. Historically, their returns have been similar so I decided to invest in index funds. Many index funds have ETF equivalences, the difference is that ETF's can be sold and bought like a regular stock. \n\nSo, I decided that the majority of my savings will go into a 4 ETF portfolio, these ETFs track the market so its a set it and forget it (unless you want to balance it etc). After some research, I decided that my four main ETFs would be VT, VXUS, BND, BNDX. The split will depend on your risk assessment. Stocks are riskier than bonds  but also have more upside. The younger you are, the more risk you can take because you still have time to make up any losses. \n\nFinally, with most of my savings in ETFs, I set aside a little bit of money for individual stock investments and day trading. This is the riskiest bit and dont ever play with money you cant afford to lose. \n\nIf I had a nice chunk of savings (which I dont) and I was in my 40's or 50's, I would stay away from individual stocks unless I worked in that field or had a ton of experience. I would just put those savings in a nice ETF or mutual fund and let it gain. \n\nSo, to recap what I did. Created a 6 month emergency fund, paid off my debt, invested most of my savings in ETFs (safer than individual stocks), set aside some money for individual stock plays.\n\nPlease keep in mind, I am still learning and none of this info is designed to advise you or anyone reading this.

I dont really buy the fact that it is going to happen, but its not completely insane either so I want to at least check the hypothesis of this to happen.\n\nFirst, I guess one would need to find out how much float of TSLA really exists. For that, I guess one takes the number of issued shares, minus the number of shares bound by insiders minus the number of shares in funds, S&P, etc.\n\n[From Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tsla/key-statistics/) and [this list](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tsla/holders/).\nShares Outstanding:\t959.85M\nFloat: \t769.14M\n% Held by Insiders:\t19.99%\n% Held by Institutions:\t42.53%\n\nLeaves about 360 M shares.\n\nBut this doesnt include the recent purchase of 15M shares by Vanguard. So about 345M shares left.\n\nSay Sarajah thinks that the mysterious undisclosed purchase of Buffett would be TSLA, that amounts to another 50M shares undisclosed, so 295M shares are left. Thats still a sizable amount. However, according to some people like Gary Black, most managed S&P funds didnt buy yet. But if they did, it would take another ~150M shares out of circulation. This has not happened yet, but given that a share price increase would fuel a performance miss by these managers, pressure to fill their books increases. So at this point, we have about 145M shares in 'circulation'.\n\nWhy 'circulation' in parenthesis? Well, because there is an army of retail that doesn't actively participate in 'circulating'. Its hard to find data on how many shares are held by you and me, so lets say we trust [this article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kind-shareholders-hold-majority-tesla-143211543.html) from October which states that the general public owns about 28%. So thats another 270M shares.\n\nThis leaves only 15M shares not accounted for.\n\nHowever, that is not the true \"free float\" is it? Going back a few steps, the managed S&P funds have (probably) mostly not bought yet, so they dont contribute all of it to a squeeze scenario. Say, they bought 50M and have an outstanding of 100M shares to buy. There is a sizable 'float' of 60M shares that are short and increase the liquidity for active trading. Say half of the 'general public' has diamond hands on their TSLA shares (I for one dont plan to sell mine before 2030). That makes 15+60+135+100 = 240M shares in circulation.\n\nI fail to see how this is any potential for a short squeeze. Did I miss anything?

On a side note, is the best evidence you have of that really two random tweets you found?\n\nB) I'm honestly not quite sure how to respond to this. [Top 20 Plugin Vehicles China 2020](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2021/01/Top-20-Plugin-Vehicles-in-China-January-December-2020-CleanTechnica.png). That looks like a few more vehicles than the one you listed. Furthermore, China sold 1.3mil Plugins in 2020, so add another 500k in unit sales not on that top 20 list. Take your head out of the sand, China is more competitive than Europe. Tesla is lucky if it has 12-15% market share of Plugins in China.\n\nC) When has Tesla ever met their guidance? Like realistically? I'm still waiting for the 2018 FSD across the US. Didn't Tesla provide guidance for 500k in 2018/2019? I can look it up for you if you're really feeling zealous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>More importantly, Gary's 4Q argument also ignores the fact that **5 large Tesla factory expansions are imminent to go on-line**:  \n>  \n>GF3 Model Y expansion already went online. [January GF3 production already went up +10% sequentially.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/li401s/news_giga_shanghai_made_248k_mode_3sys_in_jan/), target is +95% production capacity growth in 2021.  \n>  \n>GF4 a few months away from first production: earlier this week they got a permit to install already present equipment in the body shop and the paint shop.  \n>  \n>GF5 a few months away from first production: megacast machines & robots already being assembled.  \n>  \n>Panasonic & Tesla is expanding GF1 output by about +15% - part of it already online & boosting Q1 production.  \n>  \n>Tesla has started expanding Kato Road battery production capacity from 1 GWh capacity to 10 GWh, all new equipment was already on-site in January.  \n>  \n>2021 is the largest production expansion of Tesla to date, both in absolute and percentage terms.\n\nWhy do you think this is a counter-argument towards a claim on a demand problem - I honestly don't know? This simply addresses Gary's concerns about further price cuts in order to match demand with supply. YoY Q4 comparison for Tesla, average selling prices per car are down 11%.\n\nYou want a real life example of a supply problem? Look at the semiconductor industry right now, majority of the hardware is in shortage and in some cases prices are marked up to 50%. That's a supply problem in reality.\n\nSo, if you really want to try arguing that by increasing supply capacity with the additional GFs, that will somehow have a reversing affect on the ASP, go ahead. However, it makes zero logical sense.\n\nThe reason I respond for the petty posts is I get enjoyment out of the silly arguments. Keep doing you though, keep making condescending irrational posts trying to argue wild things like economic theory of increasing supply and falling prices isn't the result of a demand problem.

If I left with a full charge and it said I had 180kms of range often I would arrive there with 185 showing.  The car is just doing an immediate calculation based on how you are driving.  So it assumes since you are going downhill that you will always go downhill.... until you don\u2019t.  Then it starts recalculating.  So if I just turned around and went home (all uphill) it would then think all your driving is going to be uphill now so the range estimate just plummets.    On a cold day I say the range estimate in that case drop from 185 to 120/110 after driving only 20kms.

How does tesla do range differently?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla doesn't do real time range estimates on their screen.   So the icon on you can set in percent or distance doesn't do what the leaf does.    That range estimate in a Tesla is just a simple calculation by the BMS.   It takes the built in efficiency of the car works out what it thinks the capacity of the pack is and then spits out a range number.     The number in a Tesla is best case.    If it says you have 500 kms of range in the morning when it is -20 you will never get 500 kms of range.   500 kms is a best case.    In a Tesla where you get the range estimate is in the trip meter when you are navigating.   It will give you real time estimation of arrival.     The Leaf makes this calculation right on what it shows as range on your main screen so that can fluctuate wildly.     \n\nExample is that it is also historical in the leaf and not in the Tesla.    So in the case of the leaf it will try and estimate from your previous driving what your range will be.  Now that is fine if you do the same commute day in and day out so it should be roughly right.  In my case I am self employed and day to day I don't do the same thing so this range estimate was worthless.    So the one example is above.    Another is what happens when you do a unique drive one day and then the next day look at what the range does.   My leaf i used one time as car in a road bike race so speeds were very low.    On that car I could normally get 160km on a perfect day at 100 km/h.   But that day I was able to do close to 300 kms on a full charge because of the slow speeds.   The next day my range estimate was 230 kms because of that.   230 kms are possible at low speeds but not at highway speeds that most people will drive long distance at.  \n\nHonestly having driven a leaf for 4 years Tesla's way is the best way to do it.    Day to day I don't even keep my car in distance showing.   I just leave it in percent.    In my normal daily driving most people will not come close to maxing out their range on a Tesla.

When I said margin left I meant how much more money can you borrow on margin. Assuming you can borrow 150,000 more I would do this:\n\nSell OTM Puts. The greedier you are the closer ITM you can sell. I for one sold a yearly 680P for 16k. If you want to be insanely risky you can sell ITM yearly puts if you think the stock is going up. Sell a yearly 850P I think you'll get like 25k for it. Keep in mind they can exercise the option any time but it's rare someone would pay 25k for a yearly put and then exercise it straight away if the stock went to say $750. Their breakeven is $600. You can also do something even more dumb by selling a 1000+P yearly. You'll get 40,000 or something and you'll basically be hoping the stock goes above 1,000 by year end so the contract is worthless. I don't recommend you do this btw lol. I did 680 because I thought that was safe lol. Breakeven on 680 is almost $500. You are not limited to yearlys. You can do monthlies weeklies etc. Just giving you examples. \n\nAny ways those are the put plays you can play around with those.\n\nYou also have a lot of shares.

You sell them far OTM and then if they hit you just sell and cover some of your expenses. I mean you have a pretty good grasp of it already. You just need to figure out your strikes and expiries. Not much more to say on that. I guess one thing I can say is if you think TSLA will trade flat and want to get greedy I can recommend you sell fairly low strike prices like 850 or 900 weekly calls. You get big premium for these and if TSLA trades flat you pocket a lot of it. You have 400 shares so if you sell 1-2 contracts and you are wrong your remaining shares still have an upside. Do not sell 4 contracts because then you kill your entire upside lol.   \n\n\nI'm personally doing the above strat.

{"title": "NTDOY is the most undervalued company, how do you not see this?", "selftext": "Srsly, how has everyone missed this undervalued gem. Let's break this down simple:\n\n1. This thing has a PE ratio under 18 putting its valuation lower than other boring value stocks like Cisco, Comcast, or Walmart. You even get a 1% dividend yield which is more than your Chase saving account provides you. You'd think having such a low PE under JPow's economy would mean this is a dead company with no prospects, but...\n\n2. Their latest game console, the Nintendo Switch which has been out since March 2017 keeps selling units by the millions. 80 million Switch devices sold to date, 15 million of them in 2020 alone. They're still selling at a consistent pace at the mid-cycle of the console's lifespan. This would be bad if they sold it at a loss like new game consoles from the competition, but...\n\n3. The Switch is cheap. You can get the Switch Pro for less than $300, or the lite for $200. When your console is so cheap not only can you sell it at a profit but your customers have more money to buy games. And who makes those games?\n\n4. Nintendo has basically a monopoly on Switch games taking all the profit. This isn't particilarly hard when you own excellent IPs that raise nostalgia levels so high. All their 15 top selling games are self-published, 9 of them solely developed by then. Their top 6 each sold over 20 million copies, they're in 25+% of Switch owners. This is important when you factor in that 80% of games sold in 2020 were released in prior fiscal years so new Switch Owner will buy these same old games that already broke cost. And with such popular IPs they can even release phone quality games or emulated 10-20 year old parts at $50 for cash grabs. Only stronger competition could stop them, but...\n\n5. You can't get a new Playstation or Xbox. Srsly, have you tried buying one? You get a notification from Best Buy that they have some in stock and that same minute when you try adding to cart it's already sold out. Despite the demand, the supply chain is so backlogged that less than 5 million PS5s have been sold.\n\n6. CHINA - did you know that video game consoles were banned there until 2014? The Switch wasn't even launched there officially until 2019. This is a nascent new region for the expansion of the videogame industry, especially today when less than 2 million Switch/Ps4/xbox ones were sold. Of those, 1.3 million were Switch meaning they already have over 2/3s of this nascent new market share. As more chinese come out of poverty and try out these game consoles from their rich software engineer cousins who came to visit them from California, they will demand regulatory change to make it easier for video game consoles to sell in the country.\n\n7. What about growth outside the videogame market? Well, they might be the future leaders of AR games. Mario Kart Live? Mario Legos? What other toy companies have you seen pushing the boundaries of AR? With their excellent IPs it should be easy to dominate the toys market, with total global market size of $100B.\n\n8. All that hype is all well but what to the actual numbers say? Well, this baby had a Q1 - Q3 YoY growth in Net Sales of 37.3%! But there's more! The Operating Profit grew by 98.2% and the Net Profit by a similar 91.8%. How is this not a growth company? Stock is up 67% YoY but keeps being valued at low PE \ud83d\ude2e\n\nPrice target? Do I look like an analyst?

{"title": "A Strong Case for the TLRY Shorts - Don't be left Holding a Bag", "selftext": "TLDR: Are you really going to tell me that a merged Tilray and Aphria warrants Tilray trading at 4x Google\u2019s revenue multiple and 2x Tesla\u2019s multiple when they don\u2019t even have positive cash flows? No EBITDA? Don\u2019t let yourselves get caught up in the hype brother monkeys. **EDIT: Stock go down. I have been wrong many times and this is in no way advice**\n\n**EDIT:** Because some are bringing up \"hurr durr bad multiple choices\", here are some quick comparable companies:\n\nOrganiGram: 21.7x\n\nAphria: 18.3x\n\nAurora: 18.6x\n\nHEXO: 16x\n\nTerrAscend: 31.7x\n\n**EDIT 2:** My bad I had the wrong conversion rate. It's late where I am. Just updated to reflect that. The point still stands: It's not that I'm bearish on weed as a whole - I think TLRY's rise compared to its peers in the industry is may present a bear opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nListen up y\u2019all. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather \u2018round. Remember, true diamond hands don\u2019t care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits. Now let\u2019s learn some basic corporate finance together.\n\nWe need to talk about TLRY.\n\nAs you all know, TLRY spiked today\u2026and the day before\u2026etc\u2026up to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and I\u2019m proud of you, but this pump is going to end and I\u2019m here to explain why.\n\nObviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. I\u2019m not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead I\u2019m going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. I\u2019m going to use only numbers directly from TLRY\u2019s merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find [here](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/42b99b9b-5574-499d-b266-aabd0393103e).\n\nLet\u2019s start with two basic facts:\n\nTLRY Current Share Count: 158.3 million\n\nAPHA Current Share Count: 316.7 million\n\nNow, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company \u2013 nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphria\u2019s stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of 0.84:1. This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.\n\nWe can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \\~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.\n\nNow, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $30 billion US dollars!\n\nCarrying on with the valuation\u2026we add the merged company\u2019s debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here) \u2013 and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.\n\nNow we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, \u201cWhy do multiples matter?\u201d. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. Other weed companies are in the 20s geenrally. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to\u2026..43.9x. Let me say that again: 43.9x. That\u2019s saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzvunu13trg61.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=0534676fa415203dce905ff045d66bb79e37695d\n\nJust for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!\n\nI just want to make sure you all don\u2019t get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And don\u2019t tell me \u201cit\u2019s about the potential\u201d. Potential isn\u2019t realized through a press release, and you know it.\n\nFurthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren\u2019t even US focused. Seriously \u2013 read their securities filings.\n\nAlso, keep in mind this merger was announced in December, and nothing materially altering profitability has been announced since then.

{"title": "WKHS DD: Zero chance of winning a significant portion of USPS contract", "selftext": "I fully expect to get pushback for this, but here goes.\n\n**THESIS**\n\nWorkhorse (WKHS) is a self-promotion scheme more than anything else. It has a history of making grandiose claims of massive contracts with big respectable corporations, yet *somehow* they never see revenue or sales from them. And finally, the USPS has zero interest in dealing with WKHS, because they already kicked them out of the contract bid before.\n\nIn short, there is a near-zero chance that WKHS will see any significant portion of the USPS contract.\n\nPart 1: History of Self Promotion\n\nPart 2: The USPS Contract\n\nPart 3: WKHS Manufacturability\n\nPart 4: Positions or Ban\n\n\\---------------\n\n**PART 1: HISTORY OF SELF PROMOTION**\n\nWKHS has a history of claiming big contract wins. Yet time and time again, these contracts never materialize to any significant sales. Lets review:\n\n* [In 2017, the CEO claims they had $300 million in pre-orders](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1113616_workhorse-ceo-300-million-in-preorders-for-plug-in-hybrid-pickup-trucks?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)\n   * Near-zero revenues for the subsequent 4 years, need I say more?\n* [UPS orders 950 vehicles](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/)\n   * In reality, WKHS delivered 50 vehicles in 2018. [Workhorse still boasts about UPS as a \"blue chip customer.\"](https://workhorse.com/company.html?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) But the standing 900 vehicles are *on-demand*, so UPS could do a test run with the first initial order. How'd it go? [Workhorse has been removed from UPS's sustainability reports.](https://sustainability.ups.com/media/2019-progress-report.pdf)\n* Fedex ordered 20 trucks in 2016\n   * Only 2 were ever delivered. [They tried to make a whole press-run about the one delivered in 2018.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1493806/0/en/Plug-Power-and-Workhorse-Provide-FedEx-Express-With-First-ProGen-Fuel-Cell-Powered-Electric-Delivery-Van.html)\n* Several other examples of press releases for small amounts of trucks ordered. Many only have a small fraction of the ordered amount delivered.\n* Most importantly, as far as I can tell, there's NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RE-ORDER.\n* [Now the company boasts of an order for 6320 vehicles](https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/workhorse-receives-purchase-order-from-pride-group)\n   * Let's take a look at that fine print: \"The order is split between Workhorse\u2019s C-1000 and C-650 models and is subject to various production and delivery conditions.\" Yeah, we'll see how that goes.\n\n\\---------------\n\n**PART 2: THE USPS CONTRACT**\n\nThere is a near-zero chance WHKS will see any significant win from the USPS contract. This is best conveyed by the below timeline and the statements from the competing bidders Oshkosh-Ford.\n\nFirst, lets go over the situation. The USPS has been looking to find a partner/s to replace its long-life vehicles. This is a massive fleet, and the contract's estimated value is around $6.3 billion over a few years. The Workhorse timeline in this multi-year bidding process is below, but the takeaway is that there are three bidders left:\n\n* Workhorse\n* Ford-Oshkosh\n* Karsan-Morgan Olsen\n\n*I'll get in to the bull arguments and the zero-emissions vs hybrid vs diesel issues further below.*\n\nHere is a timeline of our Workhorse bid (CREDIT TO FUZZY PANDA RESEARCH):\n\n1. In April 2015, Workhorse advances from 40 interested suppliers to the top 15.\n2. [In September 2016, **Workhorse fails to advance to the top 6.**](https://www.postal-reporter.com/blog/usps-awards-37-million-in-contracts-for-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-prototypes/)\n3. Later that month, Workhorse joins a team that did advance, VT Hackney.\n4. From 2017-2019 USPS tests 50 prototype vehicles\n   1. In Spring 2018, a USPS employee was hospitalized when a VT Hackney-Workhorse vehicle's brakes failed and the vehicle ran uncontrollably downhill. Testing was paused for their vehicles.\n   2. Other failures during testing reportedly include: Vehicle running out of range (stranded), suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks, door failures, safety belt failures, and motors failing.\n5. In November 2019, VT Hackney sold its stake in a potential $6.3 billion contract to Workhorse [for a mere $1m + $6.6m WKHS stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425287/000162828019013414/wkhs-20191031.htm).\n\nSo, given the above, how are WKHS bulls so optimistic on their chances of winning? Well, it has to do with Biden's statements that he wants to [replace the entire US fleet with EV](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-starts-the-electric-vehicle-race-with-big-plans-to-replace-the-federal-fleet-11611697897). He's also made comments on targeting a large percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Remember, Karsan-Morgan Olson's proposal was a hybrid. And Oshkosh-Ford's proposal was Diesel. Only Workhorse had a true zero-emission proposal.\n\nI use past tense because these are dynamic situations. And recent comments by Oshkosh management indicate that they plan to leverage Ford's recently announced E-transit (100% electric) as a potential option. See the following statements:\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, I\u2019ll repeat that, we do meet all the needs of the U.S. Postal Service. Meaning, if they want, under the Biden administration, more weight toward one type of propulsion than another, we\u2019re ready for that. Now we\u2019ve got our fingers crossed. We believe we\u2019ve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call,\u201d John Pfeifer, president and chief operating officer of Oshkosh, said in a call with investors last week.  \n>  \n>Pfiefer said he expects the Postal Service to make a decision in March. [\\[Source\\]](https://www.trucks.com/2021/02/01/electric-mail-trucks-make-sense/)\n\nAnd in the very recent earnings call (you can google transcripts, this website cannot be linked):\n\n>**Michael Shlisky (Analyst)**  \n>  \n>I also want to ask a quick follow up on another question about the USPS contract. Your opinion is based on the Ford Transit, I believe, and we've gotten since this last quarter, we just announced we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021 so you comment that you can address whatever the USPS\u2019s needs are as far as our power train. Is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit or do you have to have a special reopening on the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?  \n>  \n>**John Pfeifer (COO, Oshkosh)**  \n>  \n>So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs that as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit ban, because of confidentiality, but I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.  \n>  \n>**Wilson Jones (CEO, Oshkosh)**  \n>  \n>I think the foundational statement there is we furnished a program vehicles that meet their current and future needs. I think that's the best way to leave it, Mike.\n\nSo USPS has the following options:\n\n1. Work with the no-name vendor with a history of catastrophic vehicle failures in its small testing batch.\n2. Work with Oshkosh-Ford to update their proposal to include some reduced-emissions diesel vehicles for 2021/2022 delivery. These can be used in the future for rural environments with limited charging infrastructure. The 2022-2025 deliveries could be electric vehicles based on the best selling cargo van, the Ford Transit (E-transit).\n\nNote the specific situation in #2 is pure speculation on my part. But either way, it is not a hard choice. Ford-Oshkosh has this in the bag. \\[I haven't gone in to why Karsan-Morgan Olson isn't a strong candidate, since it seems like that is universally understood. I do believe they are likely a solid backup for a small % of the USPS contract, though.\\]\n\n\\---------------\n\n**PART 3: WKHS MANUFACTURABILITY**\n\nI'll keep this short because it is already getting long. Workhorse has never produced its vehicles at this scale, ever. This is a massive risk. There's zero reason for USPS or others to take that risk on. I know, WKHS bulls say \"Lordstown\" like it means something.\n\nThis means nothing. Having a facility is not enough. Cars have tens of thousands of complex moving parts and require precise assembly and process controls.  If you don't work as an engineer, you cannot imagine the effort that comes in to developing, maintaining, and scaling a manufacturing process this complex. Until Lordstown can demonstrate that it can crank these vehicles out, it is simply a manufacturing space.\n\n\\---------------\n\n**PART 4: YOLO**\n\nFord calls, Oshkosh calls, Workhorse puts. For those less risky, be sure to buy April calls and puts, since the USPS contract could be announced in late March. I have enough fodder to double down on FDs if my current March 19th OSK and WKHS positions expire before a decision.\n\n[31k Ford Calls \\(LEAPS and medium-term\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rgsgv499lsg61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b5bcaf94aa11a2471a3f26da7e72ab191700604)\n\n[6k Oshkosh Calls \\(short-term\\)](https://preview.redd.it/yvpad8aglsg61.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc698692d00726805fc03d456a1e56dcf5f812f)\n\n[9k Workhorse Puts \\(short-term\\)](https://preview.redd.it/b7wqswymlsg61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=38fb339ee6e4153b592bdb01f4313ddf375024dc)", "id": "lheq8x", "created_utc": 1613024994.0, "score": 455, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 243, "comments": [{"body": "Told you all.

This isn't financial advice in any way shape or form.***\n\nTLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*\n\nOk, listen up normies.\n\nYeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**\n\nI used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***\n\n**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**\n\n1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you\n2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.\n\nThat's all you need to know.\n\nSo in response to all you posting \"real DD\" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:\n\n**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.\n\nThis place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling \"MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS\"\n\nLet's take a look at some of today's gainers:\n\n(changed tickers for automod avoidance)\n\n**$USMJay** \\- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason\n\n**$SNDL** \\- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day\n\n**$TeeRTeeC** \\- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly\n\n**$OhGeeEye** \\- lol\n\n**$HUGE** \\- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) \"$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE\" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.\n\nIf you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:\n\n**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629\n\nTilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.\n\n***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***\n\nSmart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d\n\nIt's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.\n\nMight it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...\n\n# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.\n\nNot to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.\n\nOh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**\n\n200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.\n\n**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**\n\nBut, this IS a casino after all...\n\n# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p652mvgreug61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95f2b0ccf946717859bffb28601dfd29e999e0b\n\nLooks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.\n\nFor those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**\n\nEventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.\n\n***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTimeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:\n\n1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off\n2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)\n3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon\n4. $TLRY gets a UK deal\n5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on \"overall strength\"\n6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.\n7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**\n8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.\n\nThe Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.\n\nTHIS IS ALL JUST \"SENTIMENT\" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***\n\n# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.\n\n*IF ANYTHING: IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT, WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*^(Who are the real players? (Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF)* *^(- do your own DD or wait for a post next week)**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion: Nobody should plan on holding these long term. Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play.**\n\n**You likely will not time the top. Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade, exit the trade or slowly shave your position, close the graphs and don't fomo back in. Just be done with the trade afterwards. You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one, unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago, and in that case, you belong here, congrats on your gains and fuck you.**\n\n**THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE. AND IT WILL END. THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER.**\n\nAnd if you think *WE* are the ones driving the price up, the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want. You're holding a lit molotov, the only question is: will you throw it before it blows up?\n\nThe rest of you? Plz fuck off with you 20 shares @ $2 on Sundial, fuck off with the \"HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW\", fuck off with your fomo, and **fuck off with the \"movement\" and \"lets push this to the sky\" stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on.**\n\n***You know what \"lets push this to the sky\" sounds like? Market manipulation.*** We're not in this together, I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month, eventually, that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it. I ain't tipping you either.\n\n**These prices are insanely high for these companies. The multiples are out of control, and if you buy in at these levels, well, best of luck, I hope it works out for you. I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains, and will continue to put my money elsewhere.**\n\n# SIR, THIS IS A CASINO.\n\nPositions: I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC. I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1,000 tomorrow, and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent.\n\nDisclaimer: I have Tilray puts I'm prepared to average down on and diamond hand like a real boss because this is coming back down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** You know what I forgot to add? Some of the biggest holders, the cannabis ETFs and funds, you know what they did today? They trimmed their positions. And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de-concentrate shares into the retail's hands, the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent.\n\n**Edit 2:** Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill, [https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC](https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC) \\- I had thousands of shares, these are just the trades from this month, and I'm not advocating a buy, I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in. You want the gain numbers? You do the math, I'm not your math tutor, I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them. I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb.\n\n*Yeah, I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later, that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person.*\n\n**Edit 3: I'm getting piles of messages from people who used to follow my DD back in 2018/2019. Yes, it's the real SoRefreshing, proof:** [**https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe**](https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe)\n\nEdit 4: Eh don't request me with \"What should I do with XX\" be a big adult grown up and decide your own risk tolerance and exits.

If you legit think your measly drops of cash can compete against tidal waves of institutional sellers you are in for a bad surprise. There is nothing wrong with cutting trades off with minor losses or taking profits. As someone who has rode trades up 100k profit and lost it all multiple times- I can tell you from experience that it's better to live to fight another day than hold onto a dying position and living on dreams and wishes. All of the stoner stocks are way over priced compared to where they were just a month ago. Everyone in market knows this. Any ppl not in this sub will be trying to sell on top of you all day on every uptick. I know this is true because I did it today, along with my boomer father and his business partners(all been trading for 20+ years) . We literally were on the phone talking as we all sold into the upward momentum early in the day. People are watching you, joining you then taking profit and dumping on you. That's just us with a couple 100k all together(we mean absolutely jack shit in comparison to rest of market) . Now imagine a group of institutional investors doing the same shit but 5x more ppl with 50x more leverage/equity to sell off. If you need proof of this go look at all the other meme stocks and their charts- notice a similarity(AMC, gme, all weed stocks currently, even some bio stocks sectors of wsb pumped) The big players are literally handing off their bags to you for your cash knowing you'll ride it down happily like a fool. I get it, ape strong, blah blah, but if you live to fight again you can use your leftover to pile into next one and use this experience as a lesson about pulling profits and make your money back. If you don't understand the game, and specific stuff like the op is posting above - you most likely will lose in the end.

I saw the business with gamestop, FOMO'd a bit, but was still early enough to make money if I bought when I wanted to (around $120). I download RH, because it's supposed to be easy to use. Have to create an account which takes a day or so. \n\n2. Finally am able to trade, but that's the day RH blocks purchase of GME. I have to find a new brokerage while also working all day. A lot of talk how this could go way higher, so I'm not worried, but I still don't manage to get my trades in by the end of the day. End up buying literally at peak (380). \n\n3. RH little stunt \"very likely\" broke the momentum of the stock, and it starts to go down. At this point I realize I'm not going to make a lot of money, but hope to break even. A lot of conjecture and bad information around this sub, I decide to hold on another week. \n\n4. The RH dickings are done, but of course at this point I'm screwed. I buy some more to average down, but now I'm just hoping to squeeze a few nickels selling above $60. \n\nI realized a couple days ago I have NO business being here. I didn't invest more than I could *afford* to lose (my bills are still being paid, I still have savings, etc) but $5k is still a painful amount to lose.  At this point I'm just hoping I can ride one gravy train back to where I started and walk away, but I feel like this sub isn't going to ever be helpful for that. For one, between the specific slang on this sub, and stock market jargon, I have no idea what anyone is talking about. And another is it seems like most people just post gain/loss porn, which isn't really helpful. I'm not blaming anyone for my losses, but just realizing this sub isn't what I thought it was. Now before anyone mocks me for that, I knew all along it was a casino, but the expectation vs reality is I thought people would post their bets, not their results.\n\nHonestly I'm starting to see the Ponzie scheme of people posting gain porn in the hopes that others will FOMO and drive the price higher.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My point exactly.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0682845339179039}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19897782802581787}, {"body": "Advice from one newbie to another.

While I like $SPCE, I have a few questions.\n\n- Why do you predict $SPCE will acquire Boom? Boom is in a fantastic position and yes, while a lot of the components of the XB-1 are built by Branson/Rutan's company, the Boom guys don't need a buyout. They have their own funding and they have plenty of ties to Lockheed and the Skunk Works on their board. I think it's far more likely you'll see them slowly gobbled up by lockmart. Yes, they're collaborating with Virgin on the Airliner but believe me, commercial applications for quiet boom tech pales in comparison to the defence sector. Not like Lockmart can't throw more money at the problem than Virgin can.\n\n-Regarding Space launch, what about LauncherOne makes it succeed where Pegasus failed? Is there a large enough market for 10 cube sats at a time? They currently have a single White Knight Two, which they aren't using to launch LauncherOne. StratoLaunch is a competitor that has the Roc, it's got a MUCH larger payload capacity than SS2 and Cosmic Girl, but the market isn't there for them, why is it there for $SPCE? Consensus in the airplane nerd world seems to focus on defence applications for these programs more than commercial, due to the relatively low payload capacities. How many more airframes (both SS2, LauncherOne, and WK2) will they need for it to be practical? \n\n-People have been predicting flying cars for decades, why are we going to have them now?\n\n-Space mining is the real shit, it's going to be the next \"scramble for africa\" imho. What about $SPCE makes them more likely to get in on that than SpaceX, Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockmart, Northrop, or ULA?

{"title": "(2/11) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday morning-\n\n*****\n\n# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-11-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday\u2019s record high close\n\n> * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.\n\n> * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.\n\n> * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay \u201cpatiently accommodative\u201d to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is \u201ca long way\u201d from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results\n\n> * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday\u2019s closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.\n\n> * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday\u2019s premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber\u2019s ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop\n\n> * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray\u2019s short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday\u2019s premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO\n\n> * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she\u2019ll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That\u2019s an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/spT0oOh.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yk3czfV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/cp4ZO2h.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/hloQBbG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/1aI3OXL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7f4pptB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/qhUF3iO.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vaQAqc7.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/as9MYPP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UHUQITx.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Whbh3P7.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IdivVuT.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MCdjdGs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/FSAy7KM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/GLy06ZJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IFIF4ed.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/CcvSt3u.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/8SjY5kH.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/rfFbrv8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/VX52HqC.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #6!](https://i.imgur.com/zBUkfG2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #7!](https://i.imgur.com/nYUKURp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-pepsico-generac-tempur-sealy-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **PepsiCo (PEP)** \u2013 The beverage and snack giant beat estimates by a penny with adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.47 per share, and revenue was above estimates as well.

{"title": "GME was a game. Weed is an artificially inflated bubble. There is a much better opportunity to make money and help society at the same time.", "selftext": "I am an economist and a psychologist, I've been on reddit forever, and I've always been a market index etf/hold type of investor (optimal balance of risk/reward) so I had no use for subreddits like r/wallstreetbets in the past.\n\nWith all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:\n\nGME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.\n\nWeed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.\n\nPsychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  \n\nIn other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to \"stick it to the big guys.\"  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.

Lots of drones. Our cities will be swarming with delivery drones in the near future, and Amazon needs a way to:\n\n1. Control a vast network of drones that can delivery 2+ billion parcels per year \n\n2. Prevent them from running into other drones/evtols/planes/vehicles \n\n3. Prevent them from being hijacked by hackers and demonstrate to the government that their millions of drones are safe and secure (Blackberry has highest security rating)\n\n4. Collect live data from the drones for package tracking, delivery times estimation , route optimization etc (IVY)\n\nAndy Jassy, the current CEO of Amazon Web Services, will be taking over as CEO of Amazon in Q3. The same Andy Jassy from this article about BlackBerry IVY:\n\n\u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences,\u201d said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. \u201cThrough this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d\n\nBlackberry IVY isn\u2019t just some pet project for Amazon\u2019s incoming CEO. It is quite possibly their MOST important project. Drone Delivery means that your Amazon Orders can get to you in MINUTES rather than days, and that they can come to YOU based on your GPS location instead of just your home or work address. \n\nAmazon\u2019s plans for drone delivery is no secret, but always seemed like a far-flung future kinda thing. Until now. \n\nThere must be a reason why Jassy of all people was chosen to take the helm at Amazon.

For USD, the central bank prints because of crisis, the world (i.e. foreign central banks) panics and flees to USD because it's the world's reserve currency, no real inflation happens. \n\n\nThis gives the Fed more room to print than any other central bank normally would have, but now they've already lowered rates to zero so what can they do? They use quantitative solutions through open market operations aka OMOs (Like printing and swapping USD for debt securities with the investment banks) which *should* spur inflation. However, this also causes a flight from debt to equities/derivatives among institutional investors because by doing all this the Fed had suppressed the debt markets (a function of supply and demand, Fed is adding trillions of dollars worth of demand)\n\n\nNow the banks also have a lot of liquidity from swapping debt for USD and don't really know what to do with it. They're not confident in the real economy to lend it out as loans (and even if they were, the debt markets aren't providing that much return because of the Fed's interest rate policy and the Fed's OMOs messing with the bond markets), so they use it to provide liquidity into the equities and derivatives markets. \n\nThe end result of all of this is we arguably *are seeing inflation* but it's inflation in stocks and derivatives instead of 'real' inflation in actual goods and services. \n\nThe pandemic and lockdowns certianly aren't helping because *maybe* once consumers can freely spend they will. Right now *maybe* the liquidity that is flowing to them is *maybe* going into the market instead of the real economy due to being stuck at home. Also *maybe* then the banks will feel more comfortable shifting liquidity into debt markets because the real economy will be stronger post pandemic. Also by then the Fed won't be suppressing bond markets and you *maybe* won't see this irrational allocation of capital by institutional investors and the old conventional rules *maybe* will come back into play. Who really knows though? There's too many maybes lol. There will be case studies written about this time period and USD's irrationality for decades to come probably lol", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hmm... doesn't inflation in the market manifest as \"faux growth\"?

When I find that keystone, it will be the money maker above all the other effluence in the drone delivery market.\n\nClarified: This is just my hunch.  Not that drone delivery is really a thing of the future. \n\nSo set a path.  Follow the meme or sentiment market if you wish or follow but do opposite.  Focus on what is forth coming.  Sure there will be all kinds of talk of the opening of the economy which will lead to more burger and taco sales.  More gas sales, more convenience store stops, etc.  Or find another object to focus on.  Maybe one in your profession that you see up and coming as a need or improvement which the employers, buyers etc, in your profession will attach too.\n\nA while back, I focused on wheat, grain in general, plus crops, farm equipment, because nobody else was doing it.

These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.\n\n9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!\n\n9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.\n\n10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.\n\n11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to \u2018drift\u2019 for the next hour or more.\n\n11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.\n\n1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.\n\n2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.\n\n\\---\n\n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big \u201cShake-out\u201d points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.\n\nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.\n\n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It\u2019s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or \u201ccross\u201d.\n\nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade\n\n1. Portfolio fit \u2013 Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.\n2. Liquidity Check \u2013 If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance \u2013 look for \u201cAverage Volume.\u201d Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest \u2013 this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.\n3. IV Percentile \u2013 Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it\u2019s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it\u2019s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it\u2019s current volatility is low \u2013 and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.\n4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.\n5. Strike Price \u2013 First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity \u2013 delta \u2013 to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well \u2013 higher intrinsic value.\n\nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.\n\n6. Expiration \u2013 Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta \u2013 a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date \u2013 your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.\n\n7. Position size \u2013 This is important \u2013 BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It\u2019s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.\n\n8. Future moves \u2013 Think beyond what\u2019s going on with a stock than just in the current day \u2013 unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don\u2019t rush your entry \u2013 You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I\u2019d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.", "id": "lhp50l", "created_utc": 1613063028.0, "score": 633, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 184, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 283, "replies": [{"body": "Inverse WSB positions used to print lol.", "score": 114, "replies": [{"body": "The old SPY days", "score": 32, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14616404473781586}, {"body": "Those days are back i think", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah it\u2019s hard to filter out the noise from newer members who think this is r/investing.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06428169459104538}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0052605667151510715}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.049048811197280884}, {"body": "Made 800% going up, and when I found out you retards were jumping in, I made 400% on it going down.

I also have had a lot of vaccines... \n\nYou are unlikely to find much value in $0.10 options. You are also unlikely to find good value at $1 stocks. The reason, stocks less than a dollar run the risk of delisting from major exchanges, which is not bueno. Don't spend your time kicking around stocks just because they are cheap. If you want to trade options (a generally terrible idea, but god I love them), look for things YOU think are likely to move big in one direction or the other and buy something that actually has a chance to end ITM. Keep in mind I am/nor is anyone here your financial advisor. Play these games with money you can afford to lose and not care about. If $100 is a lot, DON'T DO IT. If you are learning, I highly recommend stock purchases. Why? if you are wrong, you won't BK on your first roll of the dice because you actually own something that is probably not going to drop to zero in a week.

And it gets more complicated from there. For instance, you can shift the risk/reward so it pays off if the stock moves more than a certain amount in either direction, and only lose money if it moves less than that amount. You can change it so your losses are fixed... you lose if the stock moves against you at all, but the amount you lose doesn't depend on how far against you it moves.  There's a million variations.  \n\n\nBut if you don't have a pretty good idea of where the stock is going, options aren't going to help you, because you can't change the *overall* risk/reward to make it more favorable to you overall. You can only change it to make the risk/reward more or less favorable within certain pre-selected price ranges, and if you're wrong, the loss is going to be proportionally higher, because you can't eliminate risk, you can only move it out of the way to where you think the price won't be.  \n\n\nI think the easiest way to understand it is to look up \"beginner options strategies\" on Google, and look at some graphs that show you how the different options change the risk/reward of a trade compared to just buying the stock. I actually downloaded an option grapher into Excel (google *corporate finance institute option graph excel*) and played with it for hours, that helped a lot.   \n\n\nThe only other thing worth saying is, options differ from buy & hold in that it only matters where the price is by a certain date. If you usually trade with stoplosses, and the price dips below your stoploss, you lose the trade. With options, *sometimes*, it's se up so your only possible loss is the money you paid upfront for the option, so you don't need stoplosses after that, either it's worth something by expiration or it's not, and no other movements matter, even if it temporarily dropped to zero the meantime. Geneally, this costs you some profits, but as someone who gets stopped out of a lot of trades at the bottom only to watch price immediately recover, I see the appeal in this.   \n\n\nWhew, didn't mean to write a novel.

{"title": "Adaptability makes HYLN a diamond in the rough [DD]", "selftext": "**TLDR: Hyliion is a gateway drug to EV and their adaptability in the Class 8 industry makes them a great long term play with deep fucking value\ud83d\ude80.**\n\nIt seems like everyday there is a new company coming out of the woodworks with a plan for hydrogen fuel cell trucks or fully electric powertrains. While the Biden administration has certainly added some fuel to the EV fire, everyone (including that gay \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Mark Delaney from GS) seems to be sleeping on a company that is poised to succeed no matter what renewable energy solution is chosen.\n\nWhile still in its early stages as a company after going public (via S word) in late 2020, Hyliion (HYLN), provides **full powertrain solutions** for fleets through 2 main products:\n\n1. **Hybrid Diesel or CHG** \u2013 as the name states this is an electric hybrid powertrain with either Diesel or renewable natural gas. There are some interesting differences between the diesel & CNG options, but we\u2019ll save that for another time. These **powertrains are available now** and they have been shipping in low volumes this year with volume expected to increase throughout the year. The great thing with this solution is it can be **installed on most major Class 8 trucks with no additional driver training**.\n2. **Hypertruck ERX** \u2013 this is the secret sauce that our buddy Thomas Healy will (IMO) change the world with. This is a fuel agnostic, fully electric powertrain that uses an **onboard generator** powered by RNG (for now) to locally charge the truck. This reduces the need for a large battery pack that cuts into the payload capacity of the truck while also extending the range of the truck to well over **1,000** **miles.** Hyliion has already partnered with American Natural Gas (ANG) to ensure they can not only meet the demand for RNG, but they can leverage this partnership to offer fleets better pricing across the country.\n\nThese two products provide HYLN the adaptability needed in these uncertain times. Right now, their approach is to go with RNG since the infrastructure is already there across the country & it is ready to be rolled out in full production by 2022. \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b Mark Delaney must have had Elon\u2019s cock in his ear during the last Tesla earnings call, because he seemed to miss him saying \u201cit would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint\u201d. Never doubt Elon, but it doesn\u2019t sound like they will be in full production with the Semi by 2022 (even if they plan to build a plant in NV this year). With that being said, Hyliion is already producing & selling their Hybrid solution, with the hope to launch demo ERX with fleets this year, while starting production in 2022.\n\nWhich brings us to the most important question, how are they manufacturing these things? Unlike building their own plants, which has its own pros/cons, HYLN is partnering with others. This accelerates the timeline of getting products to the market and allows them to **focus on what they are good at.**\n\n***Isn\u2019t the increased demand in Hydrogen fuel cell a concern for a company that is focused on RNG***\\*\\*?\\*\\* No and no. Everyone loves to talk about hydrogen but no one seems to be realistic about when it will be ready. Aside from the lack of infrastructure across the country that will take years to build out, the cost of hydrogen is more than **10x higher than natural gas**. Not only are the costs higher, but the way a majority of hydrogen is currently being produced is coming from steam methane which is more pollutive than a diesel truck. AND even if all of those negatives were solved by next year, Hyliion is still working on a hydrogen solution (in addition to RNG) for their onboard generators for the Hypertruck. Essentially they have you covered if you want to go the RNG route or Hydrogen (when ready).\n\n***The cost of Diesel is below $3, will this affect the appetite for companies to adopt EV?*** [According to Healy](https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1425939&tp_key=75b5f9e241), with diesel at $3 there is a **2 year payback period** for fleet operators. Obviously as prices go lower this payback period increases, but most fleets have a 5-7 year lifespan so adding a year or two to the PP doesn\u2019t have much of an impact considering the benefits.\n\n***Price target?*** I am not a financial advisor, but I am a little autistic so I dug into [Hyliions original investor presentation](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm) from their pre-IPO. We haven\u2019t really gotten any new updates to these numbers, but I still think this is a hidden gem based on their projections. Assuming the Hypertruck meets all of their expectations, they anticipate around 2% of the Class 8 market share by 2024 (a more than $94 billion addressable market). If they can reach EBITDA of $602m by 2024 as projected, then a price of $18/share should be the floor right now. However, with some good/bad news on the upcoming Feb 23 earnings call this could all change in an instant.\n\n\\*I am not a financial advisor, do your own DD.\n\nPosition: 1,700 shares @ \\~17.34.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edit for positions: [Brokerage](https://imgur.com/WKHx8Kg)   [Roth](https://imgur.com/qjvAafL)", "id": "lhsm8e", "created_utc": 1613072116.0, "score": 341, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Since when does this sub do shares?\n\nPosition: HYLN $17.5 C 4/16", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "Since GME, AMC and BB noobs came in", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12162604928016663}, {"body": "Had he done a straddle strategy then i'd be piqued", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20457617938518524}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Been a buyer since Sep 2020.\n\n[Roth](https://imgur.com/qjvAafL)\n\n[Brokerage](https://imgur.com/WKHx8Kg)", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "I wish you\u2019d written this post yesterday lol", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09652203321456909}, {"body": "Wow bro you held thru 50s and didn't sell?

{"title": "PLTR DD - Earnings Play - Why This time is Different", "selftext": "\\*not financial advice.\n\nPLTR is an amazing opportunity rn. I did a DD on here for Nio when it was around  $39. Today was a bad day and we're still over 60. It doesn't make me more credible per se, but hear me out. \n\nI'm a catalyst trader. I go in before huge events. PLTR has an upcoming catalyst, and a compelling reason for the stonk price to be super high in the lead up to earnings.\n\n**Catalyst:** PLTR's earnings is scheduled before market on Tuesday, 16th. \n\n**I. What happened before?**   \n1) On November 12, PLTR's Q3 earnings was a whopping +125% surprise. Stonk prices skyrocked in the following weeks.   \n\n\n2) On January 26, PLTR had a Live Demo Day. The stonk prices went from 26 to 39 leading up to Demo day, and then all the way up to 45 after Demo Day.   \n\n\n**Thesis:** PLTR's scheduled events tend to pump the stonk prices in the build up and in the aftermath as well.  \n\n\n**II. Earnings are volatile. Why play this one?**   \n**A) Incentives:**  \nPLTR's share lockout expiration happens days after earnings. Better earnings, equals better stonk prices, equals a better payout for those with the stock options. It's much more logical to pump the price up (legally through enthusiasm, etc) because the expiration will tank the price anyway, even if it's the bottom. \n\nI was offered share options from a startup once and understand the psychology of how this works. Imagine waiting for years to have your shares worth something, secondly, imagine owning tens-of-thousands of shares that you could just sell and become an overnight millionaire. If you never had a million dollars before, you wouldn't really care about timing the sale tbh, unless you're DFV (I don't think he works for PLTR). So the lockout expiration will very likely lead to a temporary selloff.  \n\n\n**B) IV**  \nThe IV for PLTR is high. If you buy calls, buy leaps. I'm buying calls because I'm an autist. But if you wanna play it safe, do something else. Like play iron condor. Or just sell puts. Or ignore IV, buy shares, sell calls at the top. You'll have to time the top during/after earnings, but sell before the IV Crush. You could literally go about this in so many different ways and still make money.   \n\n\n**C) Solid Performance and Partnerships**  \nIBM, Rio Tinto, Cathie Wood's addition of shares, Blackrock's increase of shares, and a potential Facebook partnership. To be honest, the FB partnership rumor is probably fake, but, there was promise of another announcement near earnings. \n\n**TLDR -** I don't normally play earnings, but PLTR seems like a great play rn with many different opportunities.   \nI apologize if I'm wrong about an earnings beat. I'm not a psychic. But I believe in the long term--this guy's going to 100+. So buy leaps and shares.", "id": "lhtkgb", "created_utc": 1613074467.0, "score": 332, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 215, "comments": [{"body": "OG PLTR holders know... good news = red day.

At the same time there's intense demand from traditional high-performance compute and mobile chipmakers (AMD, Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, anyone-that-isn't-Intel). TSMC is literally operating at 100% capacity at all of their fabs: 5nm for Apple and Qualcomm (who missed hard on earnings due to lack of supply), 7nm for AMD's CPUs/GPUs/console APUs and Nvidia's datacenter GPUs, with 3nm coming online for Apple in 2022, and a shiny new 5nm fab scheduled to open in 2024 in Arizona.\n\nThe demand is so intense that even Nvidia with their unlimited amount of money can't get their 30-series GPUs manufactured at TSMC because there's simply no more capacity. The rumor that was floating around a while ago was that Leather Jacket Man supposedly wanted a discount for all Ampere products and TSMC said no, hence consumer GPUs having to being made on Samsung's 8nm node (where yields are very low, one of the reasons for the Great GPU Shortage of 2020-21). Nvidia recently doubled down by signing a new agreement with Samsung to increase production of dies for 30-series cards, but who knows when that'll resolve itself. It also doesn't help that AMD is allocating 80% of their capacity for consoles and 20% for their own products at TSMC on 7nm.\n\nI dont know why governments around the world are blaming* TSMC for the automotive semiconductor shortages, when less advanced semiconductor companies (like NXPI, IFFNY, STM, etc.) are the ones to blame, along with the automakers themselves. When COVID-19 hit, automakers decided to scale back on purchasing less advanced semiconductors (we're talking larger chips for stuff like power steering, not infotainment systems) from these smaller companies because they thought they wouldn't sell any cars last year. Instead they saw increased demand to the point where even Ford shut down the plant where they build F-150s, their most profitable vehicle. Automotive semiconductors literally make up only ~3% of TSMC's sales - compare that to 48% for mobile and 33% for HPC.\n\nPositions: heavily long on TSM, AMD, NVDA, MU, AVGO, might pick up some more QCOM if they dip further. If I could somehow invest in Samsung's fab business or just the chipmaking side of Apple instead of the entire companies, I would.\n\n**tl;dr**: I like the stock.\n\n\\* \"help us by making products you don't usually make or else we won't sell you weapons or help you defend yourselves if the mainland decides to invade\"", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Phenomenal write up my man or woman.

Right now, Micron stock price is at an all time high.\n\nAnother one of the factors of why there's a huge GPU shortage currently is because Nvidia can't get enough GDDR6X for the 3080/3090 and GDDR6 for the 3070/3060Ti from Micron. Why Nvidia didn't partner up with Samsung (since they're already partnered up for die fabrication) is beyond me.\n\n(This is not financial advice.

{"title": "PSA: Don\u2019t throw good money after bad", "selftext": "To all novice investors now frequenting this sub, here\u2019s some helpful advice. It\u2019s a trap to continue investing in your losing positions. If you\u2019re a bagholder, the way out is not to funnel more funds into a sinking stock, averaging down. The better strategy is to invest in other stocks with clear upward momentum and trends. Use gains to offset your losses. Diversify your portfolio for better results.\n\nIt sucks being a bag holder. I know the feeling. I owned CCL for the dividend before Covid. Then the pandemic crushed the cruise lines and my position. Suddenly I was down 70% on the stock. But I did not invest another dollar into CCL since the health crisis began. Instead of averaging down, I put that money to better use in stocks that could benefit from the pandemic and economic recovery. Subsequently, I\u2019ve enjoyed an incredible past year, making a ton of money while leaving my CCL loss in the rearview mirror. \n\nThrowing good money after bad is a self-defeating move. Remember: the point of investing is to *make money* \u2014 not gradually lose more and more of it in a position that\u2019s clearly shrinking in value. Invest in winners, not losers.\n\nThis is not professional financial advice. Do what you will, of course. I just hate seeing newer folks lose money when they don't have to.

{"title": "AMKR - Amkor Technology - A Great Play in the Semi Conductor Space - CRIMINALLY Undervalued, literally can't go tits up!", "selftext": "EDIT: So we are are almost up over 10% since I wrote this DD. Steady 3-4% both days. That is what we need, slowly ride this baby to to the moon\n\nBeen a member for about a year and seen some great DD, so about time I do one of my own. It might be a bit long, so a summary upfront:\n\n**AMKR \u2013 Amkor Technology** \\- is an undervalued stock in the semi-conductor space, which is going to be a super-hot sector in 2021 and beyond. The stock has great financials and the P/E ratio is killer, even better than any of your established boomer stocks.  The company has a market cap of 5B on revenues of $5B\n\nThis is not a get rich quick scheme or a pump and dump. Invest wisely and this one should rise gradually during the year.\n\nPosition \u2013 16c , 3/19 and 24c 3/19 and 2k shares. I got into the stocks couple of weeks back when it was at $16\n\nNow that is out of the way, lets get to it.\n\n**What do you look for in a great DD:**\n\n1. Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment\n2. Financials are solid\n3. Outlook is great\n4. Company is a bit of an unknown and undervalued\n5. There is an upcoming catalyst\n\nBefore I get into each, let me simply tell you what AMKR does. The company provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. So it works with companies that need to develop chips for your 5G phones, for your future EV Lambos. Basically it provides critical services to companies that manufacture or deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and has big players like Qualcomm, Sony, AMD etc as its customers.\n\nSo now lets get to it:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. ***Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment.***\n\nUnless you have been hiding under the rock, semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board. This is a hot sector to be in the moment. Don\u2019t believe me here you go:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef](https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef)\n\nEverything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2.*** ***Financials are solid***\n\nI can more with you all the details in the world, on how the company is constantly reducing it\u2019s debt and increasing operating income or how it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends, but I am going to focus on one metric. P/E ratio.\n\nWhile I was typing up this DD the P/E ratio of this company is 15.91. So is that good or bad, well to put it in context, Apple is 36.57 and Microsoft is is 36.35. Even your boomer stock PepsiCo is at 26.7.\n\nOkay, but what about other companies in this space. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17. Another favourite of this reddit, UMC 78.63, QCOM 24.81. AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79\n\nLike I said, that metric alone tell you how criminally undervalued this company is.  Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Outlook is great:***\n\nWell, I am not going to say much, but just copy paste the closing statement from the last earnings call:\n\n\u201cOkay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.\n\n2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor\u2019s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021\u201d\n\nUMC has a revenue of $5bn and a valuation of $25B which is 4X of this company!AMAT as 3.5 times the revenue and 20X the valuation\n\nAlso to recap their 2020 highlights\n\nFull Year 2020 Highlights:\n\nNet sales $5.05 billion, up 24.6% year on yearNet income $338 million, earnings per diluted share $1.40EBITDA $960 millionNet cash from operations $770 million and free cash flow $221 million\n\nSixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow\n\nFinancial information on the company:\n\n[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Company is bit of an unknown and undervalued***\n\nI mean, come on, everyone talks about TSM, AMAT, UMC, but has anyone every mentioned this company? It is literally the definition of an unknown.\n\nUndervalued, it is CRIMINALLY undervalued compared to it peers. Look at the P/E ratio, literally better than anyone else. Its revenue to valuation ratio, literally better than anyone else. I mean I don\u2019t know what else to say. This speaks BUY BUY BUY!\n\nI mean, this company should have a valuation of at least $10B, which would shoot its price past $40\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*5.* ***There is upcoming catalyst***\n\nWell company just become a strong buy on Zacks, but there is a bigger catalyst coming up on Feb 16th, which is the reason for some price action today:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html)\n\n**The company is going to join the S&P Mid Cap 400 on Feb 16th.** This is probably the reason why the stock moved so much today.\n\nThis alone will bring more capital into the company. More and more people will look into this company and realize the absurd valuation compared to its peers and yes this rill rise more. Today was just the start of what might happen over the next week\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nYes I know the stock has doubled in the last 6 months and jumped 20% today, but\n\n1. The outlook is better than ever in company\u2019s history\n2. They delivered their best ever quarter and will even pay dividends\n3. The financial ratios are best in class, even better than all your boomer stocks\n4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today\n5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space\n6. There is an upcoming catalyst on Feb 16th - S&P 400 Mid-Cap inclusion\n7. Another stock being mentioned here ON has the same revenue and income and is valued 3X more. if you think that is  a great play, which it is, think about this one!\n8. The volume is lowish, but again I see that as a positive as this will climb quickly once there is interest. The avg volume on this stock is 1M, it was 5M today and already 700k after hours\n\nI am balls deep on 24c, 3/19, which was looking risky two days ago, but it looks juicy as fuck now.\n\nAs always do your DD, and enjoy the tendies!\n\nI am no financial advisor, but some guy who thinks we all can make money from this GEM\n\n\ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\ude80", "id": "lhv717", "created_utc": 1613078695.0, "score": 181, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "I think every DD should come with a counterargument as to why the stock will fail.

{"title": "Deepest Value Stock Near Book Value Rdy for a Squeeze ($UWMC)", "selftext": "First off, the obligatory, I used to be a financial analyst, but this is not financial advice and you should do your own DD.\n\n\nLike my hero DFV, my bread and butter is to invest in extremely undervalued value companies in this frothy market environment with vix spikes happening every few days. If you follow DFV and watch his vids, you'll know that he bought GME for its value, and the gamma/short squeeze was icing.\n\n\nThis might be a long post, so skip to TLDR if you don't care about market logic. To begin, why is the #1 wholesale & purchase mortgage lender in USA so cheap you might ask? Well, I can't give you any one particular reason, but GHIV was one of the biggest spacs merger ever, and it might have suffered from the a spac speculative life cycle, and the shorts are in control, and oh boy, are they in control. Money these days have been flowing from GME/AMC and the like to weed, looking for whatever the next trend is--Twitter or not (yes, Zack Morris and the Atlas crew also love UWMC, and their cost basis is a lot higher than today's price).\n\n\nIt is borderline shameful how low this stock is, I mean I like me some FUTU and SNDL too, but I'd have to make it a point to check futures along w/ my midnight pee sessions if I were to dump my entire portfolio in those names. This thing has a **tangible book value of $7.75/sh**, that means if the company's financials were horrible, and they made no money, and decided to declare bankruptcy, and after they liquidate all their assets to satisfy their debt, shareholders will get back $7.75/sh. But no, their financials and balance sheet are immaculate, and they absolutely smashed earnings, originating 54.7B in loan volume, up 71% y/y, with a 4th qtr net income of  $1.37B vs. 108.72M (that's billion vs. million) in the same qtr last year,  and FY20 net income of  $3.38B, an **821%** and **715%** increase over 4Q19 and FY19, respectively.\n\n\nAlso, during the earnings call, they declared a dividend of $.40/yr, as of today's price, this is a **4.5% div. yield** with ex. div date on 3/9. Their EBITDA growth has outpaced their top line revenue growth, which signifies a margin expansion. They are getting more profitable every year, with good guidance on their call. Their forward P/E was 6.21 this morning, compared to that of RKT at $10.94. UWMC should be at a good value of around **$16.5** if we use RKT as a fair comp, although I would argue that RKT is slightly undervalued as well.\n\n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nAs of yesterday, it had a short interest of **36.2%** with only 50k shares available to short at a 7.9% fee. When I tried to short 1 share on IBKR this morning, there were none available. I don't normally pick stocks based on short interest, but like DFV, this is an added icing for a major squeeze. It also has a short ratio of about 1.6, so it'll take at least 1.6 days for shorts to cover if there is a day of pure buys. The higher the ratio means more covering with higher volume spikes, which brings in more buyers.\n\nhttps://www.algowins.com/ search for uwmc\n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC\n\n\n**Gamma Strip:**\n\nThe option flow on this is absolutely bonkers with 45k calls and 2k puts, there are gargantuan gamma ramps at 10, 12.5, 15, and 17, with $15 being the largest at every expiry. Once volume picks up and people realize how undervalued this stock is, it will quickly ramp to 15 via MM's delta hedging.\n\n\n**Ownership:**\n\nThis is 34% instutionally owned with Phoenix Holding buying 2.5M shares today, making them 5.88% owners of the company. After today's buy, I would expect that institutionally owned number to reach 40%.\n\n\n**Max Pain:**\n\nI posted a DD on PCG a while ago and I rode it up from $8.50 to $13, so I understand how these stocks are artificially suppressed. PCG had a larger institutional ownership at around 80%, and it was curious to me how every opex date ended right around max pain. So even if that were the case here, max pain is at $10 on Feb 19, with the next lower strike ($7.5) losing 184.72% of contract value vs the next higher strike ($12.5) losing only 59.839%. I am fairly confident this will be above $10 by then.\n\nhttp://maximum-pain.com/options   search for uwmc\n\n\n\n**TA:**\n\nUWMC is at the bottom of a channel with a lot of support from hfs buying anything below today. It is trading very near their book/NAV, and I think today's Phoenix 2.5m, a new 5.88% position will get some eyes on this gem. I have no doubt it will run up for ex-div date as well. There is bullish divergence and I see volume coming in the next few days. My personal price target is at $25-$30 within a year, and this constitutes as a long term hold for me.\n\n\n**Tech:**\nOne of the things I like the most is their mobile app that gives independent brokers the ability to underwrite a loan from open to close, their companion app can pull credit reports, get e-sigs, and act as a point of sale and loan origination system. If they make it user assessible to retail clients, like how they do it in Asia with BEKE, I can see a big bottom-line bonus here.\n\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n**Heavily shorted, highly undervalued, hf darling with a book/sh of $7.74 trading at a forward p/e of only 6.21. My position: Breaking my rule of 2-5% allocation per ticker; 60% of my portfolio in shares @ 9.70s average; 10, 12.5, 15 calls.**", "id": "lhvcol", "created_utc": 1613079077.0, "score": 329, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 304, "replies": [{"body": "Thats some good DD right there buddy", "score": 311, "replies": [{"body": "He didn't even shill pcg...", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1383344531059265}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10497463494539261}, {"body": "I checked OPs wife and she agrees he is a short who is often wrong", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08638100326061249}, {"body": "I've only ever posted about one company, and it was a 50% gain on shares.", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Oh shit!

Those expiry dates and conditions are going to be very important in understanding this one.\n\nShort interest is small and only slightly levers this.\n\nTo OP's point, options open interest  is  QUITE significant, and a head scratcher, since locked up people shouldn't be able to sell calls as an example. If the calls out there are short gamma, there's enormous gamma ramp to about 15.5 or 16... basically 735k calls at 10 and 621k puts, then 815k calls and 100k puts at 12.5, and then 515k calls at 15. That's an awful lot of shares, more than are in open circulation, so I kind of doubt they are all short gamma. But, it does look like it has a ramp to run to 15.5 or 16. I suspect call spreads, otherwise the dealers would not place themselves in this position, perhaps 10 to 15 spreads or something. Even then, big ramp. \n\nAll that being said, this is a much more conventional company that is going to be valued on much more conventional terms and it has a lockup. Once that takes place, it's going to be large enough to trade on normal valuations by normal securities analysis. Any window to 'play' the stock is going to tend to be well before the lockup.

But how much growth can this keep company keep matching with so many people out of work and the huge amount of mortgages in default (not theirs) that nobody talks about?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6433119773864746}], "tickers": ["vix"]}
