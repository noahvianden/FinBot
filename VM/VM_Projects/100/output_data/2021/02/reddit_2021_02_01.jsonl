Sold my first covered calls this week. For the most part, I think I understand the basic mechanics of options trading, but I had a few questions on the details:\n\n* How do I close out a covered call (sell to open)? It's pretty clear when you buy a call, if you want out of the contract, you just sell the call that you bought. But if I want out of a covered call (perhaps I suspect it's going to hit the strike and I don't want to be assigned) do I just buy back the exact same option? Does that effectively close out my position entirely? That isn't very intuitive to me, but I guess if I buy the same thing I sold, it's a wash and the brokerage just wipes the slate clean?\n* What does it mean to \"roll\" an option? I was reading about the wheel strategy and it says to just \"roll your cash-secured puts (CSPs)\" if you think you might be assigned or when you've reached your profit goal on the option premium (e.g., 50%). What are the mechanics of this? Do you just close out (by buying since you sold the CSPs) and go on to sell your next CSP? The term \"rolling\" makes me think you somehow are extending or modifying the original CSP, but I don't think that's possible.\n\nAny input would be much appreciated!

Why can\u2019t I just sell an ITM covered  call *where the premium and the strike price give me more* than I paid  initially for the stock. \n\n(1) You can. (2) You get only the premium and not \"premium plus strike price\". (3) When you are writing a covered call you want to write ATM or OTM calls because you are interested in grabbing the extrinsic value priced in that evaporates with time. ITM options have less extrinsic value and hence less attractive for a covered call strategy. (4) The premium+strike price for any call is your \"break even\" price and it would always be higher than the current price for a liquid contract with some time to expire. \n\n> For instance: I see a call on the Jan. 22 chain (almost a year from now,  with a bid of $5.70 and a strike of $12.50.

Of the $7.45 bid $6 is intrinsic price and just $1.45 is extrinsic price. On the contrary if you write a SP 15 call (first OTM) of same expiry you get $5.1 if the stock remains here or even moves up 10% to $15 Your break even is higher and chances of assignment are lower. \n\n> ... but if I use  the premium to purchase more... \n\nThat may not be a good idea. If the stock falls then you are falling on a higher volume and make losses on the premium received and invested in the same stock. \n\nA small disclaimer: I am from India. I trade options all the time in Indian markets. I do not know some minute details of US markets but the option basics are the same. I am definitely not an expert. \n\nWhen you write a covered call you are looking to grab the extrinsic value while keeping your risks low. This translates in to (1) Choosing ATM or one OTM call SP (2) Choosing the expiry at around 30 days out and more - unlike your choice of Jan 2022 for example. \n\nSome explanation is needed on both the points.\n\n(1) Choosing ATM or one OTM call SP \n\nATM calls have max extrinsic value. ITM calls have less extrinsic value - the quote may be higher but most of it is intrinsic value that you will get only when the stock falls. In a covered call situation you do not want the stock to fall and you do not want it to sky rocket. So ATM or OTM calls are better than ITM. \n\nOTM by how much is a good question. I have said ATM calls have max extrinsic value an it tapers off as you move farther in to OTM. The obvious risk in writing ATM or nearer OTM calls is that the stock will move up and you could be assigned. So, some traders want to write farther OTM calls and take correspondingly less premium. Again how far OTM. The measure used is the Delta of that option. Traders choose delta of around / less than 0.3 Mostly you are aware that ATM contracts have delta of 0.5 and it tapers off as you move farther OTM. ITM calls have delta higher than 0.5 amd their chance of getting assigned is higher. So choose SP that is not ITM, and perhaps not even ATM or 1st OTM but OTM where delta is 0.3 or less. This basically depends on whether you want to hold the stock a little longer and avoid early assignment. \n\n(2) Choosing the expiry at around 30 days out and more \n\nWhen you are writing a call (even covered call) you are exposed to risk. Three types of risk. (a) You may lose on upside if the stock shoots up.  (b) If the stock falls down then your premium received may not be sufficient to compensate (notional) losses in your stock portfolio. (c) And this is not apparent or even clear to me vis a vis US markets. The opportunity cost. When you write a call the broker is going to take a lot of margin from you to cover possible losses. In India brokers/ exchanges/ SEBI (Indian SEC) does not recognize that I have underlying stock in sufficient quantity to cover the upside risk. I have to put extravagant margin with the broker as if I do not have the stock. I can take loan against the stock at some interest but as you can see it is completely stupid system. I hope the US systems are better and you do not have to lock some margin amount. But if you do then you want to book your profits fast, release that margin and use it for new trades. For this you need closer expiration of the options you are writing. How close?  about 30 days. Why not less? Because the premiums are way too less and a brief short term swing can ruin the trade horribly. In fact once you go nearer than 5 days to expiry and the premium has halved or even less better buyback that option, book profits, and close the position. You may want to roll over the position to next nearest contract. The time decay of the extrinsic value is the fastest in last month or so. Therefore it is important that you choose expiration date about one month away. \n\nIn Indian markets only the current month trades are liquid so this is just not possible here. But you are lucky to be in the developed markets with plenty of products available and ample liquidity. \n\nIn short:  When you are writing an option you are basically after grabbing the extrinsic value in its price as fast as you can so as not to be exposed to any risk. \n\nHope this helps.

That is the intrinsic value of that option. Remove that from the current quote of x and what remains is the extrinsic value (or speculative value). In our BB example the current BB price is ~ $13.5 and the 7.5SP call is quoting at 7.45$ If BB was to expire right now at $13.5 this call would be worth ($13.5 - $7.5=)$6 This is the intrinsic or \"built in\" value. The rest ($7.45-$6=)$1.45 is the extrinsic or speculative value.  \nIntrinsic value moves with price of the ul and we do not have control over it. Extrinsic/ speculative value varies with the volatility/ expectations of large price movements. Again volatility is not in our hands. However extrinsic value goes down with time to expiry. Like how much move in ul can you expect in last 1 month,  week, 1 day, 1 hour .... that expectation goes down and so does the speculative component of the option price goes down.

With a strike of 12.50 and 5.70 premium you will collect the 570 of premium when the contract is sold, and if any time before 22nd Jan 2022 $BB goes above 12.50 and the shares get called away, then you also make the difference between your buy and sell price ($12.5-$11.89 = $0.61x100 = 61$)\n\nYou make a profit between $570 and $631.\n\nBUT, if the stock crashes, yes you made $570 but now you're holding shares that have less value. Now if you decide to sell another covered call using these shares once the other one expires, you'll have to sell a covered call that is HIGHER than your cost basis otherwise they may get called away for less than you bought them for.\n\nIn your case, if the stock crashed to $3, you're cost basis per share is $6.19 ($11.89-$5.70 premium).

It's an indictment of people being unable to trade without emotion. Ideally, one should feel no different about a $1000 loss than a $10 loss, if you did everything right according to the available information. I know that in practice that is very hard to do, but hard shouldn't stop us from trying.\n\n> So I thought it would be a quick crash course in buy $BB puts.

What's your position delta? Even for a cheap put, your position delta is going to be around $1000.\n\n> So I didn't understand before that selling the options would/could be magnitudes more profitable than exercising them. \n\nThat's right. Forget about exercise, trading options is about buy low, sell for high premium, long before expiration. For long trades anyway. Short trades would be sell high and buy back low.\n\n> How can you calculate or predict this extrinsic value? ... Is this always the case?\n\nYou asked about extrinsic value, but I think what you are really talking about is leverage. OTM options are cheaper than ITM options, and so give you more leverage. It's just a coincidence that OTM options have 100% extrinsic value. The point is, if you buy cheap options, you increase your ROI for the same dollar return. If you pay $5000 (cost of the option plus the cash to exercise) and earn $50, that's only a 1% return. But if you paid $5 for the contract and earned $50, that's a 1000% return. Same dollar return, drastically better ROI.\n\n> Lastly, the main question how the hell do I know if I should sell the options now or wait and exercise later? I guess if I think it's a temporary dip, then sell now? and if not, wait and see?\n\nWhenever I face a choice of present profit or maybe more profit later, I consider how much I stand to lose as well as how much I stand to gain. If you are up $500 and you might get another $200 by holding, you are risking that entire $500 plus your initial capital to earn a puny $200. The risk/reward is out of whack. So its almost always best to take the profit now, bank the profit, then redeploy the original capital in a new trade. Optimize risk/reward, not just reward.\n\n\nMore here: [Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hg8ce9/risk_to_reward_ratio_changes_over_the_life_of_an/)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your detailed reply and for that link - both very helpful.\n\n> I disagree in the strongest of terms.

The call can be any moneyness, closing the call will almost always earn more money than exercising, unless it is expiration day. Do the math, you'll see that as long as the value of the call is at least $0.01 over parity (the value of exercise and then instantly selling the shares received -- which is not realistic in practice, but for the sake of comparison), closing is better.\n\nYou don't have 200 shares of collateral.

I went long on GME a couple months ago (cost basis around 20 bucks), so obviously all this latest craziness is awesome for me. Unfortunately, I missed the peak last week, coulda woulda shoulda sold when it was over 400, but still have over 100 shares. Well, *had* \\-- liquidated the remainder to make back my original investment and change, then left 100 shares to use it as collateral for covered calls.\n\nSo I sold a call contract with 100 shares as collateral for a couple weeks from now for a value wildly OTM, and as predicted as everything winds down its now worth less than I initially sold it for. Now, I'm kinda unclear on this, but can I somehow \"buy back\" the contract for the new, lower price? From what I gather, you basically buy a contract of the same strike price and expiration and the two \"cancel out\" in your portfolio, leaving you off the hook for having to cover it, but I wanted to be sure before I did so. I changed my mind on it, wanna 'regain control' of my shares, and/or be able to just sell weekly calls and profit off of IV spikes, but I'm not entirely sure that's how it works or whether I'm gonna be on the hook somehow for one or the other of those contracts, assuming it isn't ITM on expiration.\n\n2.) General call option question: a coworker and I are both playing the market, and I'd like a clarification of something regarding calls if they're ITM on expiration and you don't have enough liquidity in your portfolio to exercise.\n\nHe says that his understanding is that it goes something like this:\n\n\\- Strike price is 100\n\n\\- Stock hits 200\n\n\\- Contract is exercised by the broker, buying those 100 shares for $100 each, then immediately selling them on the market for $200\n\n\\- The contract writer pockets the premium he/she initially got paid, and the $10,000 (100 shares \\* $100) their shares' strike price was\n\n\\- The \"extra\" $10,000 (from the difference of $100 per share strike and $200 per share market) is handed to the contract owner\n\nSomething about this just doesn't seem right, though, and I realize I'm maybe blowing it out of proportion by using a 200% gain for my example. The contract holder gets the difference?

Most importantly (for options players), is the fact that the period of days prior to an upcoming test flight later this month will see higher volatility on option premiums due to the speculative nature of this company.

Theoretically works fine. \n\nProblems: In India stocks move a lot. So that 2% per month (24% per annum) though fabulous is pittance and fraught with risk. What is the risk? Let me give you an example. Say you purchased stock A at $100 and wrote a 100 Call for $2 premium (2% typical in India). Now let's say the stock moves a lot (Indian scenario) and closes the month at $110 So you made $2 and you had to give up $8 May be you are still okay because your risk was minimal and you actually made money. Now you have net $102 as capital and A is at $110 So you want to sell a PUT to buy the stock back. Which strike you will choose? The $110 PUT will offer $2 but if the stock falls you will have to buy it at (equivalent price of) $108 But you have only $102 Now if you try to sell a PUT at strike of $102 then you are not getting $2 in premium as it is far OTM. Lets say it is 40 cents. Is that acceptable to you? Perhaps it is. But then you are losing all the upside the stock may have. Or if the stock crashes back to $100 You will be purchasing it at an equivalent price of $101.6 So at the end of 2 months you have your shares of stock A and 40 cents with you. That is too less on an investment of $100 after 2 months 2.4% Worse case if the stock falls to $90 then you are still purchasing at net price of $101.6 but the ATM call is now at strike 90 and you will fetch $1.8 (2%) premium for selling it. If at the end of that month of the stock is at $95 You will have to sell it. Effectively you have no stock now and holding cash of $91.8 which is loss of $8.2 from your initial capital/ Stock A worth of $100 \n\nNow, one might say that this is too much movement/ volatility. That is true. But my experience in Indian markets tells me that at least here the markets being shallow or plain criminal activity the option prices do not take in to account the volatility. So may be you want to go on buy side but that is just like buying lottery ticket. I have tried several ways to find which stock/ index is about to make a massive move so that I can buy related options. But at least I am not able to make some real money in this manner. \n\nSo please see what applies to your markets. Do the option prices truly take in to account the real volatility the stock experiences? If you choose a stock with low volatility then the premiums are low too (not 2% as above) and the stock can still move massively at some point of time crushing your months of small gains.\n\nSorry for the long answer.

Also, unlike poker, you know exactly what your max profit and max loss will be (you define an exit strategy for those cases that are open-ended). So you can basically constrain your plays to fit whatever variance you define up front. This makes it easier to estimate depth of money. For example, a common rule of thumb is to risk no more than 5% of your total liquidation value (your bankroll) on any one trade. That scales to any practical bankroll size.\n\n> So I'm wondering if there's anything that says 'if you do 100 trades correctly ', you can expect either to win x% or lose x% etc.\n\nSort of. You can definitely compute expected value. Since you can define your win$ and loss$, you only need to estimate your win rate, and there is a way to do that for every option strategy. You have all the elements necessary to calculate ev.\n\nFor example, for a long call, the delta of the call at open can be used as a win rate estimate. A delta of 40 at open is approximately a 40% chance to expire in the money.\n\n> Edit: Another 'sub-question' I have would be: what's the catch? I watched a lot of option alpha's videos and it seems like it's all mathematics, that you can't lose over a long period of time if you do it correctly with low risk and with enough trades. Obviously, that's not really true, otherwise he wouldn't sell products where he tells you what moves to do - he could just do them himself and benefit - over time, shouldn't he be a multi-millionaire if it's all mathematics? Anyways, where are people losing money if they just have to follow math calculations?\n\nOption Alpha staff **do** trade for their own accounts and make money the way they explain. That's their main source of income, and then they add to that income with the training site and whatnot. Most of the training sites work like that. Tastytrade and projectoption are the same.\n\nThis is not like secret dice control strategies for craps, where the value is in the secrecy. Nothing these guys say are secrets. They are features of the theoretical pricing model and practical market and trading experience that anyone can figure out, and many do.\n\nFor example, theta decay is relatively easy to exploit, because its impact to contract price is very predictable. Variance can distort short term results, but if you run hundreds or thousands of trades a year, like those guys do, you average out the variance and hit your expected value.\n\nIt's surprising that you started by talking about poker, but then doubt that Kirk at Option Alpha can earn a living trading. You know that there are many pros in poker that make a living playing poker, right? Why is it so hard to believe that people can do the same thing trading options? Arguably, options are easier, because you can only trade online. ;)\n\nAlso, by your logic, Barry Greenstein and Phil Hellmuth should never write poker books, because they would be giving away their pro secrets and wouldn't be able to make a living any longer. And yet they did and do.\n\nAnd like poker, following these option strategies are easy, if you are perfectly disciplined, grind like a machine, and never go on tilt. Since that's not easy for any human being to do, training sites, books, and even discussion subs like this are necessary to help people learn how to exploit the math and then have the discipline to do it correctly as close to all the time as humanly possible.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> If somebody I don't know tells me there's a way to make money easily while trying to sell a course, it's always a signal to be cautious.\n\nYou're right. When it comes to trading and speculation, skepticism is essential. We don't have the Hendon Mob DB equivalent with public trading wins/losses. However, there are a few things you can do to validate these claims: (a) look at what other knowledgeable people say -- similar strategies are recommended by other successful sites, so unless you think it's a huge Illuminati conspiracy, it's expected that the math will drive people to similar optimizations, (b) look at the strategies they recommend and work out for yourself if the math makes sense, (c) look for evidence of losses. The real crooks never admit to losing. The legit traders incorporate losses into their planning and treat them matter-of-factly.\n\n> I'll try to explain.. His video feels like if you had a button that you can press and you have 50.01% chances of doubling your money VS 49.99% to lose. It's pretty easy to calculate everything and know exactly when you'll turn out a profit etc\n\nI don't see how that's any different than poker books telling you to just call behind a rockish UTG open raiser with pocket deuces, because you have a 12% chance to flop a set and stack him. It's the same simple win/lose recipe, that glosses over things like what if the flop is all hearts with a deuce or what if the flop is AK2 rainbow? The devil is always in the details. Strategy explainers like that are only ever going to give you the basics. Applying them in real life is always more complicated. Like what underlying to use the strategy on and when. Those decisions are often more important than the strategy itself.\n\nBesides, those explainers are just starting points anyway. A 50.01% nominal ev for some strategy should not scare you into thinking something is fishy. It's *nominal*. Your mileage may vary.\n\nPersonally, I've taken all those basic explainers and created my own variations on the recipes. I keep tinkering with them as I learn more and keep enough records to track my improvement. Just like for poker, don't get results oriented and don't make big decisions on small sample sizes.

Obviously, these greeks will change as the underlying moves, so  you would need to constantly readjust, which is not practical, but I'm  curious from a theoretical perspective as to where the ideal ratio comes  from.\n\nMy intuition is that the  correct ratio is a function of the rate of change of the underlying  price with respect to a change in implied volatility. Is this a  derivative that's even sensible to talk about? Does it have a name?\n\n[This segment](https://www.tastytrade.com/shows/market-measures/episodes/understanding-vega-10-19-2015)  offers the suggestion of a rough 1:2 ratio between delta and vega to  hedge volatility risk for positions on SPY. I'm not entirely sure how  they arrived at that ratio, but I assume this means that, if your  position (or portfolio) is beta-weighted against SPY, you should be  looking for this ratio. In practice, this is probably a good enough rule  of thumb to go by, but for the sake of my own edification, I'd love to  know how this ratio is arrived at for securities in general. I realize  that this is pretty niche, and don't intend to actually put this to  practice (using a 1:2 ratio with beta-weighting against SPY seems  sufficient), but would be interested in getting some insight on this out  of curiosity.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> That short vega means I'm  exposed to downside risk on the underlying, since a downside movement  corresponds to IV expansion\n\nEither direction, up or down, can lead to IV expansion.\n\n> My question is, for a given underlying, how do I determine what the correct ratio is between delta and vega to hedge against this volatility risk?\n\nThe way pros do it is with a fast pricing model and algorithms and HFT.

If you are selling a call you bought earlier then you are without any right or obligation to buy. \n\n Long Answer: \n\nThe person who sold to you - assuming s/he had not bought the call already from someone else - has the obligation to deliver the stock to **whoever shows up with the contract on expiry settlement and not specifically to you**. As long as you have the contract, you have the right to demand the stock delivery (or cash if the contract is cash settled). Now when you sell the option you had bought, the liability of the original seller to deliver doesn't vanish. There is no reason for it to vanish as may be s/he is okay/ happy to have that on books. S/he has received the premium and would settle it as per his/her wish and that can not depend on what you are doing. Right? \n\nThe contract can change hands many a times or just be extinguished from existence. That is the concept behind \"**Open Interest**\". \n\nLet's say there are 1000 lots being traded in a specific options contract. Also there are multiple traders in the market with no initial options position in that specific contract. Now one of these traders, say A, \"***writes\" (sells afresh)*** a call and another trader B buys it.  This has created a fresh contract that did not exist before. So now the number of lots being traded becomes 1001. We can say the open interest has increased by 1. This also moves A and B out of our initial group of people who do not hold any contracts. Now say B makes some profit and sells it to C who also did not have any initial position in that contract. This transaction does NOT change the open interest. It is just changing hands. B moves out of the pool of the traders holding position and is replaced by C. Number of open contracts aka open interest remains 1001. Only when two traders who hold opposite contract positions (one buy other sell) transact within themselves then those contracts are extinguished and the open interest comes down. On expiry day for ITM contracts the traders still holding Buy and Sell positions are required to bring the cash / stock and settle their positions. OTM options are extinguished worthless. \n\nHope this helps.

However, I'd like to describe what happened to me this week and see if anyone can offer any insight for me on how I could have done better.\n\nThis past Thursday, Feb 4, I decided to buy a few really OTM $GME puts and make a little money from its downward slide. I chose far OTM because I didn't have a lot of spare cash and they were all I could afford. I got some weeklies at the 20 SP, expiring the next day. I wasn't expecting much, but it worked out great. I managed to 3x my money. Naturally, I decided to try it again the next day, Friday Feb 5. \n\nI bought some more weekly puts expiring that day, this time for the $25 SP. I ended up having to average down when the price shot up from around $60-ish to $95 briefly but once that run was over I was the holder of about 30 contracts at an average cost of $.073 per share, or $7.30 per contract. Their market value at this point was about $3 per contract. I thought, great, all I gotta is wait for the underlying to drop.\n\nAnd drop it did. $GME continued to drop all the way back down to the $60 range, and I was ready to make some bank, but the contracts never came back above $3 in value. I'm trying to understand why not.\n\nI know that going long either calls or puts leaves you vulnerable to theta decay and that theta is worst on the last day of a contract's life. I also know that the further OTM you are, the less delta you will feel. Trying to day-trade OTM weeklies on a Friday is therefore maybe a bad idea. So, I will assume my failure to profit was due in part to me not having correctly anticipated just how bad theta decay is on the last day of a contract's life. \n\nIs that the main reason why that massive drop didn't cause the value of the puts to rise? Was something else going on with the value of the contracts being affected by the insane volatility? I know that vol favors sellers and that it is what makes them money because it drives up premium. But what about after you already own the contracts and volatility continues or increases? Does this have any effect on the market value of the contract?\n\nAlso, I admit I didn't actually check either theta or delta on these puts before I bought them. I felt super rushed when buying, because I felt like I only had a minute to establish a position and that if I missed this window I would miss out on the trade completely. This turned out to be a mistake, as it always does. I ALWAYS regret rushing into a trade and I ALWAYS do it again the next time anyway, because I feel panicked that I'm going to miss out. How do you guys deal with this feeling and how long do you usually take to plan out your trades?

This is one method of generating income by selling calls against your deep-in-the-money option. Ideally, you want to have a strike price that has a Delta of 1.00, but's that's not realistic because it would essentially be the price of owning the stock. There are some varied thoughts on the Delta value that you should have for a Stock Replacement Strategy buy almost all thoughts that I've heard range from a delta of .87 to .90. I usually settle in at .89. That way if there is significant movement, I'm probably still in the range. If it starts getting into the .90s, I can roll it up a strike. A second good test I use and another way to make money with LEAPS: can I get 80% or more of the value if I were to move up a strike.

It depends on your risk tolerance and what you are willing (smartly) to spend.\n\nIf you're talking about LEAPS and Stock Replacement together, there is no OTM (out-of-the-money) option you would buy. Stock Replacement needs to be deep in the money - in this case, probably a $15 or $20 call.  If you are speculating on a stock that will move up 100% to reach your goal, it's much different. Example of a stock around $50 that people love right now: SPCE - Virgin Galactic currently about $54 at Friday's close (also a pretty high volatility stock). March 2022 options could be considered LEAPS. A $90 option for that costs about $1600 ($16x100) and they get more expensive as they go down in strike price until you get to the $60 strike at about $2200. The cost is 100% extrinsic value for any of those. If you know what that means then you know the price is made completely of Time Value/Decay and Volatility. A strike of $20 in that same month is about $38, but $34 of it is real or intrinsic, to the extent that if you sold the $20 option when the stock was at $54, you could generally get at least $34. My personal risk/reward guidelines would not permit me to commit to the first trade, but everyone's r/R is different. If it did fit my guidelines, I would buy the $60 strike for $6 ($600) more and be $30 closer to the underlying stock price.\n\nNow, here's a perfect example of how volatility affects an option price. AstraZeneca (AZN) also closed about $50 on Friday. There are no March 2022s, but Jan 2022 is close enough. There isn't even a $100 strike price on the board for Jan. There is a $90 for $0.35 ($35) and $60 for about $2.30. That's a completely different r/R in my personal guidelines. But again, you could buy a $30 strike for about $20 and nearly all of it would be intrinsic value. Every trading style is different from person to person and you will need to try several to see which one suits you best. Often it will be a combination of a few strategies. Hope this helps.

So, I recently thought of this option traiding strategy and since I have a smooth brain, I was wondering if anyone can find flaws with this tactic so I don't lose all my investment before I go into real market action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe strategy is to use poor man's covered call and covered put at the same time on the same stock. If the stock tanks to the bottom or rockets to the moon, the loss on either put or call would be offset by opposite side. So, why would I want to do this zero sum tactic? Because I am after the option premiums I would be selling every week or bi-weekly. In order for this to work, I would have to choose a stock with medium to high volatility rather than low volatilty so the option premiums are higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, let's say I'm going to invest 10k on a stock ABC, current price @$50 per share. I'd buy 2 of $30 strike price call option at $25 which will expire in a year, and I would also buy 2 of $70 strike price put option at $25 as well. Then, I'll be selling 2 of a week long short call option with $55 strike price @$1.5 per share, and also sell 2 of week long short put option with $45 strike price @$1.5 per share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf stock price stayed within the strike price and both short options are OTM, then I would profit $600/week, giving me $2,400 profit /mo with just 10k investment. If one side hits strike price, then I would buy to close the one hit the strike price and leave the other side of call option since it is not going to be ITM within the same week most likely. In that case, I would've not make any money in that week (or lose a bit from the premium), since the price of the short call or put will be sitting around $3-4. However, in most cases, even very high volatile stocks should have longer stabilized period than the period where it takes extensive movement. If the stock moves drastically in either direction, I buy back the short calls/puts then wait until stock price stablizes again. Then sell my long call/put (whichever the side that gained value) to profit from that movement. I would leave other side of long option alone (even if it is OTM) since there's a good chance it would come back to ITM zone. Re-position my long calls and puts then get back in the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom rough calculation, I would lose about 30-40% if I held both call and put long options near expiry date (If stock price remained within $30-$70 threshold) because I would lose money on time value, but I would've already made more than enough within first couple months from selling the premium. If the stock were to skyrock or tanks, I would actually make money from my long calls or puts as well. Let's say if the stock price skyrocketed to $100 per share. I would've lost money on my $70 put call, but the long call at $30 would offset all the loss from $70 put call and still leave me a bit of profit. Vice versa if the stock price tanks to $10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, only way I'd be actually losing money is if short option sale does hit the strike price every single time, or even worse, both call and put options hit the strike price within the same week or two, which is almost impossible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I should consider, as I'm just getting into the option trade.

But I am a patched brain myself so got curious :-)\n\nTwo points before we get in to the mechanics.\n\n(1) Why choose two lots? It is much easier (at least for me) to calculate with one lot (in butterfly 1-2-1) and then multiply the whole thing with as many lots as I wish later. LoL. Unless you want to close part position etc it is much easier to think in terms of 1 lot - at least for me.\n\n(2) You have taken ABC which is perhaps a hypothetical stock. So after spending a lot of time we may come to the conclusion that all the hard work put in is just hot air. Always take real life examples so our hard work is on sound footing and immediately applicable.\n\nIn your example the $1.5 you expect to collect on 45P and 55C is unfortunately not available. Why am I saying so? Well, initially I doubted the availability of the 1 year far 40% deep ITM options with extrinsic value just 20% of CMP.  (30C and 70P are $20 or 40% away from 50CMP in your example. They ask a total of $10 in extrinsic value that is 20% of CMP)\n\nWhat I have done is to apply your strategy to SPY. I chose SPY because that is the only option I know to be most liquid. As index it is obviously not that volatile so I will be okay if the weekly return is slightly muted and for the same reason I would expect the annual contracts to extract at max 20% and not more as in our assumption.\n\nI checked for options with 1 year away expiry and 40% away SP from the current price. In SPY (CMP \\~390)this approximately translates to 230C(ask 160) 520P(ask 180) and Jan 21, 2022 expiry. These contracts are actually available and tight bid-ask quotes in after market. Great. They are asking $50 in extrinsic value which is less than 20% of CMP. So far so good. Now we need to see the other side - premium collection - to balance everything off. So moving on :-)\n\nI wanted to know how much premium is available on a weekly contract with strike 10% away from CMP. (45P and 55C are 10% away from 50CMP). We are assuming they offer $1.5 or 3% of CMP each or total of $3 or 6% of CMP in premium. Considering SPY is an index I want to see at least 1% of CMP in total premium. Time for reality check. 5% away from current SPY of 390 would be 370P and 410C and expiry ........ does SPY has contracts expiring every alternate day ????? WHAT ???? ..... Anyway I chose 2/16 which is 1 week away from today. 370P (LTP 46c) and 410C (LTP 4c) and neither has any OI but there is some volume. So availability should not be a problem. In any case the total premium collected is just 50c which is only 0.13% of CMP and not 6% of CMP as assumed or our muted expectation of 1% of CMP. This is too less and so the rest of the math won't add up.\n\nIn the best case that you collect 50c every week for next 52 weeks you will collect 26$ where as you have paid an extrinsic value of $50 on the annual contracts.\n\nHope this helps - in kind of negative way. Sorry about that. Let me know if I am making any mistake. BTW, does SPY has so many contracts expiring every alternate day?! I gathered all the data from Yahoo.\n\nDisclaimer: I am from India.

I need a lot of negativity to tell me the reason not to go with this strategy rather than people tell me it is a good plan and I should dump all my money into this.. and if shit hits the fan, I'm at a loss.. LOL\n\nYou are already giving me the terms I haven't heard of yet (such as butterfly 1-2-1), so that prooves you are smarter than me :).  I'll go study little more about it so I can fully understand what you are referring to.  I do believe my strategy does already exist, I just couldn't find the name for it yet. if I can think of it, there's plenty of people who already did.. and I do believe there should be a reason why this is not popular method.\n\nAnyways, it seems like I need little more clarification on the condition.  This does not work with all the stocks.  First, I would need to find the stock that gives fair amount of ratio between the long and short options.  Such as $25(year long contract):$1.5 (weekly/bi-weekly contract).  ABC was just a fake stock I used as an example.  If I was able to purchase actual ABC at $50, I would go all in on it and I'd be set :P.  SPY wouldn't be a good set of example either, because it would cost me around $100/share for $300 strike price year long call option and $90/share for $470 strike price year long put option.  Yet, I would only make .45/share for $395 strike price week long call option and .78/share for $382 strike price week put option.  If I were to invest 19k on SPY to do this, I'd only make $123 per week, $6396 per year.  Minus all the commission fees (roughly around $1248.  $12/trade, selling call and put option each week X 52).  And I would lose all the time value on the long call/put option.  In the end, I would most likely to profit a little, but it's not worth the effort.\n\nThe actual price model I used was WEED.TO. This is TSX exchange since I'm Canadian.  Current price of the stock is sitting at $56 range.  Let's say I purchased $32 strike price 1 year long call contract @24.90 and $80 strike price 1year long put contract @32.85.  I purchase 2 options each, so in total I invest $11,550.  Then, I would be selling 1 week long call and put contract every week.  $60 call contract that expires in a week is @1.5 and $52 put contract is @1.02.  So in a week, I'd make about $504 ((1.5+1.02)*2=504) a week.  $2k a month and $26k a year.  I'd have to factor in time decay on my long options, so if the price remains same as current price (which never will with this type of high volitile stock, but since we don't have a reference), I'd lose about $5/share for call option and $15/share for put option.  Therefore, I'd lose about $4k and will be able to salvage around $7k from initial investment.  In the end, I'll be able to walk out with $33k from initial 11.5k investment in a year.  Again, this is just speculation, and of course, I would have to hope that the short options doesn't hit the strike price too often, but it would be worth the risk.  Problem with WEED.TO is there's too low volume on options in TSX market.  So, I would have to find a stock that meets these conditions on NYSE or NASDAQ, but I believe I should be able to find some.

If your calculations are correct (I believe you have a lot better understanding than I do), then I'd even lose less money than I originally thought.\n\nSo, I was doing a lot of research to run some simulations on my theory today and I realized I this works the best with stocks that are at 100% or higher IV.  WEED.TO was kinda in unique place where 1yr term IV was sitting at only 50% range whereas near expiry dates were sitting at 121%.  However, I found that most of stocks in US with high IV can bring good outcome.  Try BB, PLTR or TLRY.  It even works with GME Lol.  1yr IV on GME option is 172% (so I'd have to pay more for these options..) but the current IV is @313%.  Since a lot of people are speculating that GME will go back to $20 range, let's say I purchase year long call @$15 which cost $42 and put @100 costing 68.80.  In total, it would cost me $11080.  Then, I'll be able to sell $66 call option @5.80 and $50 put option @3.60.  Returning $940/week!!

I looked it up, but it's not exactly the same as what I'm trying to do.  Iron Condor tries to profit from time decay, so the safer way to do so is by using less volatile stock with longer period in place.  However, what I'm trying to do here is more time sensitive.  I try to limit my sell options within a week or two to minimize sudden movement of stock price (because I'm dealing with highly volatile stock). Even if the stock moves drastically in one direction few weeks down the road, I can quickly buy back the one side of sale close to strike price to minimize the loss yet I get to keep previous weeks' profit (most of it anyways).  If it keeps moving after I close my sell position, I can wait until the movement is settled and should be able to profit from the deficit by selling my long term contract.  Secondly, I should be able to snowball the income with every week's income by keep purchasing the long term options and sell more short term options.  In first two months, I will be profiting about 10-20% per months, but after that, I can reinvest that profit to increase my options... to maximize compound interest effect.\n\nAnyways, let me know what your thoughts.

All factors are now more limited.\n\nI could be wrong but here's my sense of the situation (none of this is investment advice of course)\n\n1. **Shorts in the market have entered at decent prices** - short borrow rates for $GME were still 30%+ all week which means that as some shorts exited to cover, others were clamoring to get in. Especially with the Thursday dip, the shorts in place are in a comfortable position in terms of squeeze pressure. 140% short interest two weeks ago is different from 120-140% short interest now because of entry prices. Interest levels are high so there is that pressure though\n\n2. **GME is just too expensive** - even without brokerage restrictions, most retail won't be able to afford to risk more than a few shares and institutions aren't going to risk buying at these levels in a game of chicken. It's one thing to buy a few hundred shares at $10/share, it's another at $300/share. And whatever legit value story is likely gone - most value story ranges were probably capped at $30-$90.\n\n3. **Options are juiced and gamma squeeze potential is gone** - there's not much delta hedging needed when massive volatility is priced into premium. An expiring 1/29 $500 call yesterday morning was an insane $500+/contract - you now neither have the volume of calls necessary nor the volatility potential to trigger a massive gamma squeeze.\n\nIn short, the drivers of the GME run are more limited and it's hard to see what is going to drive more squeeze. Notably, these 3 interact meaningfully (e.g., cheap GME => retail can buy more and more likely to be underpriced options => more likely to gamme squeeze after a big run up => hits shorts that entered at cheap prices forcing them to cover) - with all 3 deflated, there's less of a feedback loop as well.\n\nThe answer? $QQQ has been inversely related to the high short stock runs - probably driven by systematic risk fears, but also because long tech / short B&M retail has been a popular HF strategy. \n\n$GME puts are hella expensive so just going $QQQ calls might be a decent proxy to inverse although there's probably no free lunch out there either way.

They likely don't do the offering unless they need to finance something big). So you're talking at least $1 billion in liquid assets to finance a rebuild of the company without having to do any major liquidation. That's huge.

You likely blew up and so you're forced to buy these retailers. This causes the retailers to go up, making your short book even worse off than it otherwise would be.\u00a0\n\nKeep in mind the multi managers are pretty levered. So let's walk through an example of a consumer/retail pod at\u00a0Millennium (MLP) specifically. MLP\u00a0has an un-leveraged\u00a0AUM of $40B but I think they lever their book up at least 5x, probably more so they have a GMV of $200B+. I really think the number is 10x but we will act like the number is 5x. They have something like 200 portfolio managers so each one is managing $1B. Lets say you are a typical consumer/retail PM at MLP and you have a 1% short in GME which is worth $10M and then GME goes up 10x. You bought the GME for $10M but now you have to buy back $100M of GME to repay your shares, so you've lost $90M on a GMV of $1B, which contributes to a drawdown to your PnL of 9%. Keep in mind that MLP levered the money 5x before they gave it to you, so to MLP you really lost 45%. (Note that these funds are down something like 10% on the year, which makes sense if you think that 20% of the funds were in consumer/retail pods; down 45% \\* 20% = 10%+). MLP has drawdown limits of something like 5-10%. My understanding is you basically are fired if you hit these drawdown limits. Simple put: if you were short GME, I imagine you probably had a tough conversation with the fund.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe great thing about the multi-manager model is that it looks amazing to LPs. The LPs I know all talk about how the sharpe ratio is excellent at Millennium and how it is essentially a money making machine. The same is true for Citadel GE. It's unsurprising how much money has flowed in this direction. The size of these funds today if you include leverage is MASSIVE. P72 manages $20B. Not sure what\u00a0Citadel GE manages, but let's say its similar. Not sure about leverage here but I am guessing it is 5-10x, much like Millennium. So adding up the size of these funds including leverage equates to a MASSIVE amount of money in this strategy. If you include all the smaller multi managers, you start to see how it adds up. For each of these funds, your book size may have been cut if you were short GME. In these cases, you are forced to de-gross your book.\u00a0\n\nHow likely was it that you had to de-gross? Well, it turns out multi-managers are a tough model. You have a limit menu of what you can be short, since it is limited by industry. In theory, this helps you better capture idiosyncratic return (which I believe is true). That said, it means your menu of shorts is limited.\u00a0If you were a consumer/retail PM, you probably thought shorting GME was a good idea because it was among the shittier retailers out there.\u00a0\n\nOK, so if you were short GME in one of these multi-manager funds and you are told to de-gross your book, what trades do you have to do? You have to buy your shorts and sell your longs. What does this mean? It means you have to buy your shorts higher and sell your longs lower. The accumulated affect of many disparate actors doing the same trade at the same time means that the typical short book\u00a0goes up and the typical\u00a0long book goes down. This includes the entire book, not just GME. So this means that other high short interest retailers are just going to go up in value, even if they were not targeted by WSB.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat happens next? Well, it turns out the Tiger Cubs are generally long internet short retail. So they are unfortunately squeezed here. You can see this plainly evidence by their recent performance numbers. Some of them now must de-gross\u00a0because their retail trade has worked against them. To de-gross, they have to buy retail and sell tech; this unwinds the trade they have had on for many years. What makes matters worse is they all copy eachother, so they are concentrating this trade in the typical basket of ideas they all mimicked from each other. In particular, they must sell some of their favorite\u00a0tech names, concentrated in FAANMG stocks.\u00a0\n\nYou know who else is long tech? It turns out the index funds are very overweight tech. They are market cap weighted so it turns out they heavily are weighted towards FAANMG. When the Tiger Cubs are forced to sell FAANMG, this causes the overall indices to print down.\u00a0\n\nYou know what is modeled off of the indices? Individual stocks. If the indices print down, so will the constituent stocks.\u00a0\n\nAs you can see there is quite a lot of contagion that is possible from even a single squeeze. Excessive leverage and mimicry has created a\u00a0fragile ecosystem amongst hedge funds. I am personally very concerned.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Part of a healthy market evolution.

There\u2019s no possible way the hedge funds could have covered their positions, most likely sold to each other. On Thursday we saw the worst of manipulation, only some what 20-40 million ik volume right after Robinhood\u2019s restriction, with a 75% dip! The hedge funds took the advantage to super manipulate in ways god know what, and to show us how it works. Same thing with today, super low volume within the 20 mill range, gme significantly drops in value to low 200\u2019s with no moving trades.

It will become a domino effect,- AS LONG as we can\u2019t maintain the support level and holding onto our shares- once one or few hfs give in, the prices will soar as they are recouping shares they borrowed, meaning other hedge funds with near position will give in as the price will raise and they will get called on or will cover, same to all hfs.

Around 2016 (I think) there was a massive dump in US oil which pretty much broke the us oil economy. Since then, especially in the trump era, there was a big push against foreign oil which has been taking effect these past few years. The idea is mostly in sustainability and independence in the oil market. Because of this, we\u2019ve seen US oil doing really really well these past few years. Last year March, the Middle East were aggregated and pushed the oil price way way down in retribution to punish non-middle eastern oil industries. That took a big hit but our oil market has fully recovered (look at TPL) and is now working to become more resilient against foreign markets. This is a really important governmental issue as well because the US doesn\u2019t want to get fucked by foreign oil dependence during times of need and war, which is something that really hurt us following the 2008 recession when oil prices skyrocketed.\n\nIn this push, I think American oil will do really well. The large push towards the EV market is great and people will think it will heavily affect the oil prices, but I disagree. Until the EV market is much much bigger, IE 2025+, oil will stay strong. Plus the EV market is big, but it\u2019s not as big as people think it is and the demand for oil is still massive. As of next year, flight and transportation is rising like never before which is going to skyrocket oil demand. (Planes are one of the largest oil consumers).

{"title": "FOR EVERYONE NEW TO INVESTING: A COMPREHENSIVE BREAKDOWN OF TRADING AND MANIPULATION STRATEGIES!", "selftext": "**Current Conditions of the Market:**\n\nLet me be clear: this is not the typical conditions of the market where stocks fluctuate double and triple digit percentages per day. There\u2019s a place for that - the casino. In recent weeks, herds of new traders are pouring into the trading scene hoping to get a piece of the volatile market that has turned the rags to riches, or the other way around. The stock market as a whole, under normal conditions, moves gradually in both directions, guided by trends, innovation, speculation, earnings report, and financial changes. What we are in right now is a hysteria-filled environment that is risky for both veteran traders and novices. Any uninformed, reckless decision can produce different results - by chance. Be wise and do not let chance underlie your success or bankruptcy stories. Please do your research first before investing into anything and whatever you do, do not make the mistake of over-extending yourself with margin (brokerage-provided capital) that you cannot repay should things go south. People have and continue to make this fundamental mistake that will ruin them financially for years. Stock investments should be about long-term growth, stability, and supplemental to your income. Investments should give you access to the opportunity of financial freedom, but should not be your primary source for income. Do not listen to stock gurus and paid-only discord groups - they don\u2019t make money from stocks, they make money from you. Lastly, this atypical market condition is the perfect storm for spontaneous \u201cpump and dumps\u201d where stocks become inflated, and based on fool\u2019s theory or musical chairs (whichever you prefer), the last one that gets out gets burned. Be smart, be patient, do the research.\u00a0\n\n**Basic Stock Jargons & Short/Long Positions:**\n\n*Long* \\- you\u2019re buying and holding a stock with the intention for it to increase in value.\n\n*Short* \\- you\u2019re borrowing shares from a lender (brokerage, investment firm, individual investors), selling it to someone, and hoping to buy it back at a lower price. Your profit is the difference in the sell and buy back price. I\u2019ll provide a real world example because this concept it a bit more complex:\n\n* Person A is a share lender. They want to lend the share and get paid a small interest rate as compensation.\n* Person B asks Person A to lend him that share temporarily. Person B does not pay anything upfront, but he promises to pay Person A in the form of interest over time.\n* Person B finds a buyer Person C. Person C wants to buy a stock so it can go up. Person C is \u201clong\u201d on this stock. Person B, however, is short on this stock because he wants the value of the stock to go down.\n* Person C pays Person B $10 for the stock. Now, Person C has spent $10, and Person B has gained $10.\u00a0\n* Two hypothetical situation happens now:\n   * Scenario 1: Stock value increases to $15. Person C is now up $5 and he sells because he\u2019s making nice gains. Person B needs to buy back that share at $15, but he only gained $10 profit initially. Now he needs to fork up $5 to buy back the share, and then return the share back to the lender + any interest accrued. In this scenario, the \u201cshort\u201d lost money, the \u201clong\u201d gained money, and the \u201clender\u201d made interest money.\u00a0\n   * Scenario 2: Stock value decreases to $5. Person C is now down $5 and he sells to cut losses. Person B needs to buy back that share at $5, but he already has $10 in profit initially. Now he pays $5 for the share, leaving him still with $5 profit, and returns the share back to the lender + any interested accrued. In this scenario, the \u201cshort\u201d made money, the \u201clong\u201d lost money, and the \u201clender\u201d made interest money.\u00a0\n* The above scenarios help to show why \u201cshorts\u201d (typically hedge funds or experienced traders) might want to manipulate the stock price to go down. Hedge funds have an incredible amount of power in the market, which I will explain in a bit, and can often create serious price movements to invoke price action that benefits themselves. Shorts, therefore, have the opposite intention of longs. They want share prices to go down, and in the process, can bankrupt certain companies that rely on the stock market liquidity to stay afloat. In other words, when investors leave a stock because it is dropping in value, the company loses that money that they could have used to pay off debt, grow the business, develop new products, pay for expenses, etc.\u00a0\n\n**Market Manipulation:**\n\nMarket manipulation is not new to the scene. Investors have long known of the existence of stock market manipulation tactics, and every day, we may observe some levels of manipulation in specific stocks, specific categories or industries of stocks, or the entire market. Market manipulation is defined as any actions performed with the intention of moving a certain stock price in favor of the manipulator. In this case, these are the wealthy \u201cwhales\u201d or hedge funds, both of which have enormous capital capable of shifting stock prices at alarming speeds. Keep in mind, not all hedge funds do this and not all hedge funds are \u201cshorts\u201d. Some are \u201cneutral\u201d and act as lenders to make money, some are \u201cgrowth-based\u201d and invest just like everyday traders with the intention of raising share prices, and others are \u201cshort\u201d which are probably perceived to be the sadistic groups of the bunch. Below, I will be discussing how manipulation occurs and on different scales.\n\n**Manipulation Tactics on a Spectrum:**\n\nMarket manipulation can happen in certain stock, sectors, or the entire market. There are probably far more types of manipulative tactics than we know, but I will describe the most basic types and the strategies behind it.\n\n*Scenario 1:*\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. Hedge funds are not too excited about this increased share value, so they can \u201chedge\u201d or protect themselves, by selling put options. When they sell puts, they are anticipating that the stock will continue to surge, which causes the puts to become worthless at expiration, but on the contrary, they will be collecting the \u201cpremium\u201d or money paid upfront by traders that bought the put. At the same time, this hedge fund will slowly \u201ccover\u201d, or buy shares of Stock X, so that the increased value of the shares will offset the short position which is losing money. The manipulation here is by using the sheer amount of capital in hand to bolster the stock, both creating favorable conditions for the puts that they sold and the share that they purchased as cover. If they want to add another level of manipulation to this, they can also purchase call options, which will result in profit if the stock price goes up. In this scenario, hedge funds make money at the expense of put option buyers and other shorts that do not have manipulative power or capital to recreate this same strategy.\n\n*Scenario 2:*\n\nLet\u2019s say a hedge fund just opened a short position on Stock X. Stock X is rising in value because general investors see it as a potential growth stock. This hedge fund does not want to risk extra capital to cover their short position (by buying shares, selling put options, or buying call options), so they try a different route. Keep in mind that hedge funds are typically heavily invested in many stocks and assets, meaning they have a lot of power in deciding the direction of many stocks that have potential to instill widespread fear across the entire market if it drops. Take for example, if Apple and Google began to hurl downwards, this can create panic in the market where everyday traders might sell their shares at a loss. This in turn might ripple through the market as other investors in other stocks are predicting a downward trajectory across the market since these big name stocks are losing value so rapidly. Conveniently enough, hedge funds own a lot of these big name \u201cFANG\u201d stocks.\n\n\u00a0If I am a moderately sadistic hedge fund, I can sell off a large holding of shares (in the scale of multi millions or billions) that are in the same sector as Stock X, which would incite fear across the sector, creating panic sell offs. The price will drop sharply across the board, including Stock X, and the short position will produce big profits. Because this hedge fund sold off a large chunk of their shares at a good price, they can now cover their short position (essentially getting rid of it), and then buy up these same stocks that were let go earlier, only this time at a much cheaper price. The hedge fund has now made money not only on the short position, but now they got into the stock at a cheap price in which they can explore other manipulative tactics to bolster the price again. This can be done by encouraging analyst upgrades, publicizing \u201cnewly\u201d purchased positions without disclosing the fact that they previously owned it, etc.\u00a0\n\n*Scenario 3:*\n\nThis one involves technology: algorithm trading (commonly referred to as algo trading). This one is a really intricately designed manipulative tactic that investors really have no way of getting around. Algorithm trading is the process of using high-speed super-computers and a team of traders to constantly monitor market activity and trade when opportunities arise. In this case, the hedge funds do not have to do any direct manipulation of the market, which makes this 100% legal. How this works is by taking advantage of how trading works and the time it takes for a trade to be made. For you general investors, we have mobile apps and web-based trading platforms to trade. When we like a stock, we have to go through the motion of inputting the stock ticker symbol, the amount of shares, the price we are willing to pay, hit submit, and confirm the trade. For hedge funds using algorithm trading, all this is done autonomously, which makes submission of an order several magnitudes quicker. When an order is submitted, it goes through a brokerage (Fidelity, Webull, ETrade, TDA, RH, etc.) and the data is rerouted to a clearing house (intermediate party that verifies and processes the trade). Clearing houses are responsible for making sure your orders are filled, but they take it on a first come first serve basis. So if a stock is moving quickly, hedge funds have a serious edge in getting in cheaper and faster as well as getting out higher and faster.\u00a0\n\nAlgorithm trading is integratable as part of the buying and selling strategies mentioned in the two previous scenarios, which is why they can almost guarantee profit. Algorithm trading also uses a lot of data in their backbone to determine the trades that have a high chance of profitability, and it acts on various factors such as volatility, volume, interest activity, news, etc. In some cases, these algorithms can be set to do some extremely sadistic things. I\u2019ll start by talking about \u201cmarket orders\u201d vs \u201climit orders\u201d. Before you make a trade on your brokerage, you will notice an option that says \u201cmarket order\u201d or \u201climit order\u201d. Market orders are an agreement that you will purchase the stock or option contract at the best price in the market in the momentary space in time. There is of course a huge risk to that because in that short moment in time, there may not be anyone selling at a good price, and instead, some people might set sell limits at ridiculous prices. For example, some people set a sell limit at $1000 for GME. If you did a market order, and you get really unlucky, you might end up snagging a share for $1000 each, when the actual share value might be $300. However, when you set a \u201climit order\u201d, you are agreeing to buy a share at a maximum price that you designated.\u00a0\n\nIn the event that a hedge fund siphons a ton of shares of a company, the algorithm can be set to sell these shares at a ridiculous sell limit. Remember, when they buy or sell, it\u2019s processed significantly faster at the clearing houses, so if you\u2019re that one unlucky trader that went for a market order on a stock, you might end up purchasing it at a huge premium set by the hedge funds themselves. Moral of the story: DO NOT PURCHASE AS MARKET ORDER - ALWAYS PURCHASE AT LIMIT ORDER.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m am not a financial advisor, so take everything I said as gibberish.", "id": "la9w0j", "created_utc": 1612203353.0, "score": 1577, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks!

A company's solvency in pretty much every case has nothing to do with its share price, because the company only receives money when they sell shares to the market (either via an IPO or a follow-on offering).  The only scenario in which the share price could have some impact would be a *highly specific situational liquidity need that can only be done through share issuances.*  In other words, if a company *needs* to raise money through the equity markets, and it can't because its share price is depressed, and as a result it can't service its debt.\n\nThis is highly unlikely for a few reasons, the most obvious of course being that, if the company was that close to a liquidity crunch, their share price would already be heavily depressed anyways due to the risk of impending default.  Given that equity sits at the bottom of the cap stack, its value is going to fluctuate more wildly than the debt above it.  Pretty much every company facing a liquidity squeeze will try to work with their lenders to waive covenants, extend maturities, convert notes into new notes with more accommodative features, etc.  If you aren't able to work with your debtors, and you're about to hit a liquidity wall, your stock is already going to be worthless because you're on the precipice of filing Chapter 11.  Shorts may have had a hand in driving that price down, but it's not without justification (equity becomes worthless in Chapter 11).\n\nAdditionally, this is misleading because short interest alone can't drive a price down to nothing, it also requires corresponding counterparties to facilitate that downward price movement.  In other words, other players in the market have to be buying in at lower prices to drive the price down.

While a drop in share price does not affect a company\u2019s financial health on any particular given day, lower share prices contributed to higher borrow rates to qualify for extended loans, reduces the amount of cash raised during stock offerings, and yes, in come cases, can directly drive company\u2019s out of business as the public market liquidity is vital to its business model.

Why? Because it was a frail business model in covid conditions and they were unable to get outside loans to inject liquidity into their business as a result of increased borrowing rates. Banks did not extend the credit they needed and that\u2019s exactly why Hertz began liquidating their assets. They didn\u2019t even both going for a stock offering, why?

Why? Because it was a frail business model in covid conditions and they were unable to get outside loans to inject liquidity into their business as a result of increased borrowing rates. Banks did not extend the credit they needed and that\u2019s exactly why Hertz began liquidating their assets. They didn\u2019t even both going for a stock offering, why? Because the share prices were so low, there was no incentive to dilute their already diluted stock, and people did not want to buy into a stock that\u2019s near delisting levels.\n\nWhat are you talking about?  Hertz's bankruptcy had nothing to do with its share price.  Hertz's business tanked when demand for rentals / used cars dropped off a cliff during the pandemic.  It defaulted on its loans because it didn't have the cash to pay them so it filed Chapter 11.  The share price tanked because of the risk of default and bankruptcy which ultimately happened.\n\n[Here's](https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/hertz/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=NDAyMjM2&id2=0) their first day motion (PDF warning).

A sharp and unexpected reduction in used car values precipitated by the coronavirus crisis burdened the Company with a substantial cash payment due April 27, 2020 in connection with its primary U.S. rental fleet financing arrangement. The Company elected not to consume its precious liquidity and did not make that payment. A short forbearance and waiver period allowed the Company to reach accords with creditors in Europe and Australia on additional temporary or permanent waivers. However, it failed to yield a longer-term solution with the Company\u2019s primary U.S. and Canadian creditor groups. Accordingly, the Debtors commenced these Chapter 11 Cases with the goals of stabilizing their operations, assessing their options, and charting a course for a strong future.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The short interest didn\u2019t kill them either because they had positive cash flow and had the cash in hand to burn for another year without going bankrupt.

It's February 2020 and Tesla raised a secondary at $2 billion. Let's also remember the Tesla narrative at that time. For most of 2019, Elon vigorously stated that he had no intention of raising capital. Wall Street kept asking and he kept replying \"NO!\". And yet he ended up doing so... Many investors were puzzled and couldn't understand why the company would do that. Now, let's also remember the broader narrative at the time one year ago. Democrats were trying to impeach Trump and oh that virus going around in China is just the flu. One month later, the entire world went into lockdown over Covid-19. People started mobbing stores to buy toilet paper and the Pope was giving prayer in an empty Vatican. Now investors began to realize why the $2 billion secondary happened and why it was a good move. Having extra cash during an economic crisis is a good idea. Come to present day. Trump is getting impeached again, more stimulus is coming, the vaccines are coming and we're going back to normal. And why the hell did Tesla invest billions in Bitcoin?\n\nI am by no means an economist. All I know is that the money printers worked like crazy last year and yet all we have gotten so far are zombie companies and stonks. But let's just imagine the Tesla board making this decision to buy Bitcoin. Remember, $1.5 billion is a lot of money. They're looking at the future and trying to make moves for the benefit of the company. Without delving too much into Bitcoin, the only serious reason I can see them purchasing this much Bitcoin is as a hedge against inflation. Why don't all companies do this? Well, Bitcoin is a new concept and companies will have a tough time explaining to their investors. Boomers simply don't understand it. Tesla investors are a bit different. They are the black sheep doing a Naruto run down Wall Street.\n\nThis is just a hunch.

This kind of polarization of Wall Street consensus is very rare for megacap companies like Tesla - I'd say it's unprecedented. Usually the price targets are ***much*** more tightly clustered.\n\nThis means, as a practical consequence, that if one of the ~4 remaining bearish analysts capitulates and boosts their price target, that will result in the capitulation of all the bearish clients they had influence over. 1 out of 4 is a 25% catalyst.

Second, logistics and labor costs were impacted due to supply chain instability and pandemic inefficiencies. Adjusting for items such as these as we do in our internal management views, we saw an improvement in auto gross margin.\n\nAnd SBC impacted both gross margin and operating margin:\n\n>Stock-based comp increased, part of which is driven by the rise of the stock price over the course of our 2020 employee performance grant process and a portion of which is unique to Q4 only. The impact of SBC increases is seen across both COGS as well as operating expenses.\n\nAdjusting for those, Tesla would have made a huge profit without regulatory credits.\n\nMore importantly, Tesla is still in growth phase. Investors should focus on positive Free cashflow and solid balance-sheet.

Instead ... they are silent, and there were only price target upgrades.\n\nAlso note the serious bifurcation of price targets: there's the cluster of very low $300-ish price targets, and the $1,000-ish price targets. This kind of polarization of Wall Street consensus is very rare for megacap companies like Tesla - I'd say it's unprecedented. Usually the price targets are ***much*** more tightly clustered.\n\nThis means, as a practical consequence, that if one of the ~4 remaining bearish analysts capitulates and boosts their price target, that will result in the capitulation of all the bearish clients they had influence over. 1 out of 4 is a 25% catalyst.

Or at the very least checkout the website www.wtfhappenedin1971.com .\n\nThe dollar\u2019s demise started in 1913, and has been slowly headed towards a cliff for over 100 years.  Eventually it\u2019ll reach the edge and fall over.\n\nIn 1913 the \u2018Fed\u2019 was instituted.  The Fed is not part of the US government.  It\u2019s a private corporation with shareholders.  The Fed printed extra dollars and lent them to the US Govt.  This was great for the politicians because they could spend money they didn\u2019t have and tax the people.  Incidentally, 1914 was the first year of income tax in the US.  Well this ended up going as poorly as you could imagine and the money printing got out of control.  Eventually they started taxing the future and thus the national debt started.  The Great Depression was one of the first big signs of instability of the financial world.\n\nI can keep going on how things progressed through the years, but bottom line - is that no FIAT currency has ever NOT hyperinflated.  Not a single one has ever lasted.  They\u2019ll go on for a couple hundred years at most and then collapse because politicians have the power to just make as much of it as they want to fulfill campaign promises or to bailout companies or to protect \u2018the economy\u2019.  And the same thing that has happened hundreds of times in the past is happening to the USD.  It will collapse.  Will it be next year?  Maybe not.  But there will be significant inflation of the CPI in 2021 - you can be assured of that.  By contrast, cryptos can\u2019t be controlled by politicians.  They can be inflated because there\u2019s nothing stopping anyone from just making new types of cryptos, but on balance they will fare much better than the dollar.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want Tesla to invest all their capital in cryptos right now..

A weak dollar is not good for anyone. That's why countries keep money in several different currencies.\n\nLet's imagine a world where bitcoin is the single currency. That would mean government would have zero control of currency. THAT WONT HAPPEN! Don't be naive.\n\nAnd that is actually a point against Bitcoin.

If the USD collapses they all collapse.\n\nYour other points are all very good points, however I think you overestimate the amount of control that the regulators still have at this point.  Yes they have buttons and levers, but eventually those will stop working as inflation runs away from them.  I agree that politicians won\u2019t want a currency they can\u2019t control.

The only way a short squeeze can happen is if there is something that will drive the price up. There are no value investors, which is the vast type of investment in the market, coming into GME because literally no one, not even yourself, makes the case that the price should be this based on value. Rather the argument is if the price  goes up there is potential for a short squeeze.\n\nLet's see.. Chamath and Elon already tweeted about GME last week and seeing the decline and recognizing the coming bloodbath they are backing off here. They don't want people accusing them of driving investors into this at this point. So where is your hype coming from. Belfort (a scam artist)? Tucker Carlson (a populist liar)? Your Viking God, KjetillStjerne, who deleted his tweets (I suspect rather then buying he was probably selling on Friday... I just don't trust someone who is so good at writing emotional appeals)? I mean, you are running out of people to get caught up with this and hype this.\n\nWell that means, that the price likely falls. The more it falls the less costly for anyone short to ride this out and so on.\n\nBut, maybe you are right, and it does go up. I am not saying it is impossible. But it is just pure gambling at this  time and not based on any sound logic that I can discern. Calling yourself smooth-brained and retarded will not magically make you money.\n\nYou don't even know who is short this or necessarily what the short interest means. It might be mostly hedged and impossible to move the stock price. Do you think when Melvin told CNBC they were out of their position they were lying? That would be fraud and could end with someone in jail. Even if they did lie, you don't think they closed the position on Thursday? These hedge funds are not emotionally attached to their positions.\n\nBottom line, my advice is get out while you can. Better $190 a share (after market price) or even $100 a share then $20 a share.\n\nI am not on the hedge fund side here. I actually made a few hundred thousand off this. I closed most of my positions on Wed and the rest Friday (had I closed everything Wed would have made another $120,000). But this thing has gone crazy and people are getting hurt and will get hurt worse. I moved on and my account  was up today. You can still get out and  make money. More important time then timing.\n\nI actually was messaging with someone on Friday and told him to stay away as it is too toxic. I don't think he listened to me. I find it distressing watching what is going on, but at this point it is a ponzi scheme and the quicker you get out the more you walk out with.\n\nIt was a smart investment prior to Thursday when the shorts were deep in it. On Thursday there was a likely a lot of covering and as a result we did not see a squeeze (or much of one) on Friday nor Monday. It is unfair how the system let them get out easy, but the other side was the system itself facing insolvency. It is not fair but that is how it works. An expensive and costly lesson to investors that touch an investment that risks the system itself collapsing. That is actually why I sold most of my investment on Wednesday (and the rest on Friday) as I realized that there was no way it can go on without insolvency being an issue, which would result in holders of this getting the short end of it when the SEC would step in and order trading halts or naked short exemptions (i.e. making the investment near worthless... For some history read up what happened when Hunt tried cornering the Silver market and lost everything when the government decided to change the rules mid-game... and no, don't try to squeeze silver).\n\nGood luck.

{"title": "Why WSB is now running the entire equity market pt.2 - Investment Professional here", "selftext": "[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\\_wsb\\_is\\_now\\_running\\_the\\_entire\\_equity\\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)\n\nI wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. \n\nI won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.\n\nThis time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  \n\n**GME Misconceptions**\n\nThe two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.\n\nThe other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. \n\n**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**\n\nIf one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. \n\nThe narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these \"evil\" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. \n\n**What Happens Next**\n\nThe effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. \n\nIf the market does crash, congress may blame this on \"reckless speculators\" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. \n\nI have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions.", "id": "l9qx8p", "created_utc": 1612141461.0, "score": 99, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 259, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I do have a couple of comments related to portions of the below remarks. \n\n>The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. \n\n>If the market does crash, congress may blame this on \"reckless speculators\" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. \n\nRe the shrinking world of hedge funds, there are some larger dynamics at play here. One is that in a years long (and eventually roaring) bull market, it is very difficult for hedge funds to match or exceed the performance of the market. The resulting carcasses are everywhere. \n\nWhile I expect that, coupled with things like what\u2019ve we\u2019ve seen with GME and other popular hedge fund shorts, will create a few more defunct asset managers and lead to a lot less shorting in specific issues, I can\u2019t help but wonder why some managers (apparently) thought that shorting specific stocks would provide any sort of hedge against systemic risk. Unlike the tradition hedge fund model of going long on stocks that were expected to outperform and short on the market as a whole, replacing the short market position with short specific risk merely amplifies the already leveraged risk model on which funds were premised. \n\nAnd, for the reasons stated by OP, the effect of so much of the market being held by monstrous passive funds has (perhaps ironically) amplified the swings driven by specific risk in individual issues. That\u2019s a discussion that has been going on for years in the world of academic finance and fund managers, but is a whole \u2018nother can of worms. \n\nAs for the point about Congress and others blaming \u201cretail speculators\u201d, without warrant, for all of the market ills that may follow (directly or not) from this, I completely agree. We\u2019ll see the regulators overreact and do something in the name of protecting retail investors, like restricting any sort of derivatives trading, that instead has the effect of shafting the relatively few such retail investors and traders who rely on derivatives.

It protects the value of the securities held by the broker-dealer as of the time that a SIPC trustee is appointed. Trustees are appointed through a SIPC-initiated court proceeding to supervise the liquidation of a SIPC member that is insolvent or cannot return customer cash or securities.\n\nAn example shows this risk: A broker is shut down owing a customer 100 shares of ABC stock that was worth $50 a share, for a total value of $5,000. Five months later when the SIPC trustee is appointed, the stock has dropped to $30 a share. SIPC coverage would be limited to either replacing the 100 shares of ABC or the $3,000 in cash that the customer\u2019s stock is worth at the time of the appointment of the trustee. Conversely, if the stock rose to $70 a share when the trustee was appointed, SIPC would either give the customer 100 shares of ABC stock or, if the shares are not available, would give the customer $7,000. In short, the fluctuation in the value of the shares represents the market risk that is not covered by SIPC. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" In the rare event of a SIPC liquidation, SIPC will generally ask a court to appoint a trustee to supervise the liquidation of a SIPC member that is insolvent or cannot return customer cash or securities.

Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)\n\nSoybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sy5wfcme0se61.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9c103918acf66501dab0840737a52e3a4381308\n\nInsect Protein Animal Feed Industry\n\nArcher Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world\u2019s largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.\n\nPROS:\n\n\\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.\n\n\\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.\n\n\\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**\n\nCONS:\n\n\\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/12/31/worlds-largest-insect-protein-farm-signals-future-of-food-supply/?sh=4309e14606a9](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/12/31/worlds-largest-insect-protein-farm-signals-future-of-food-supply/?sh=4309e14606a9)\n\n# TLDR\n\n\\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)\n\n\\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.\n\n\\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.\n\n\\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nPositions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nSorry this isn\u2019t GME.

I presently raise livestock and am intimately involved in the industry, both conventional and sustainable/organic/regenerative. \n\nWhile I like the concept on the surface (food waste converted to a protein source for feed) I would advise you not place much value on the black soldier fly concept, it will require a complete redesign of large scale feed production infrastructure across the country. Soybeans are not only sold for feed but often grown and fed on farm. The beauty is they can store dry by the millions of bushels, then have a mobile roaster roll up on a truck and roast them for feed, then you grind/blend. No moving low value food waste scrap, growing out larvae, harvesting, further processing, etc. No indoors needed. Corn is even easier, just grow and grind. We are already able to do this on a massive scale. The cost to produce the larvae will need to be very low to cover these changes on any meaningful scale. \n\nThe land and water component is really poorly understood. Vast majority of cropland and pasture is not irrigated, and as such is produced via rainfall. Water use is not a serious issue for this. Largest use for our major crops is actually biofuels, that is more of an issue. For both land use acres, energy inefficiency, inputs needed, etc.\n\nADM is an interesting company and I would suggest looking into their dominance in the neutral grain spirits market (vodka)...they provide something like 80% of all base neutral grain spirits in the US. Very few domestic brands actually produce their own alcohol anymore, much cheaper to buy food grade ethanol from ADM and blend.

First, they are big in the feed ingredient market (remember that movie The Informant about fixing the lysine markets, great film if you haven't seen it). I wouldn't be surprised if they plan to produce a line of feed or feed ingredients to sell to feed companies and co-ops that they can market as sustainable/lower emissions, etc. Think backyard chickens, homesteaders, very small farms, people who buy a few 50lb bags a week instead of a few truck loads. That may be a way to avoid the economic issues of production via a marketing premium. Somewhat limited market, but a good market and they know feed ingredients. \n\nThis could maybe supplant the use of fish meal in non-soy organic feeds, although I'll have to look into the amino acid profile. Methionine is typically lacking in feeds that don't include some soy for hogs and chickens. You get around this with things like field peas, fish meal, alfalfa meal, sunflower meal, peanut meal, etc. Fish meal is expensive and not sustainable. In the organic world you can't use synthetic MET.\n\nThe other side may be the PR angle, some big companies are looking into regenerative Ag stuff (General Mills a good example). \n\nAg expects significant shifts in regs and/or incentives for environmental changes in the coming years. These will be targeted at livestock and crop production. A desire to make production more efficient and lower GHG emissions. There are a number of startups in this space looking at the potential for new carbon markets. This could be something there as well. Perhaps the tech can be used with crop residues or some in-house byproducts as well, that would be something.\n\nI'll do some digging on it tho.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "All plants seemingly have a \u2018Scientific name\u2019.

But first, something to cover my ass for the SEC investigators combing through this Subreddit\n\nDisclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.\n\n## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I\u2019ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the \u201cofficial\u201d reason given by Robinhood.\n\n[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)\n\nThis statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn\u2019t believe the Sequoia part since I don\u2019t really know what they would gain from it - they\u2019re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I\u2019d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop\u2019s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I\u2019ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it\u2019s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn\u2019t happen in the first month in office.\n\n**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**\n\nThis was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don\u2019t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood\u2019s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).\n\nTheoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There\u2019s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn\u2019t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.\n\n**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**\n\nLet\u2019s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren\u2019t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren\u2019t able to trade through them. Let\u2019s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There\u2019s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don\u2019t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that\u2019s where the clearing house comes in. Let\u2019s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.\n\nSince GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller\u2019s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.\n\n## What\u2019s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?\n\nRobinhood\u2019s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here\u2019s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood\u2019s decision, for fun\n\n* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)\n* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)\n* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)\n* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood\u2019s office saying \u201cSuck my nuts Robinhood\u201d\n* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)\n* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood\u2019s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)\n* [SEC investigation to Robinhood\u2019s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)\n\nClearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It\u2019s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally \u201cdemocratize finance\u201d, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood\u2019s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.\n\nThe people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we\u2019ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn\u2019t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash\n\nLet\u2019s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I\u2019ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.\n\n>*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*  \n>  \n>*1. If you are \"smart money\" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  \n>  \n>*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  \n>  \n>*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 \"gross\" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  \n>  \n>*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an \"ideas dinner\".*  \n>  \n>*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  \n>  \n>*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  \n>  \n>*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*  \n>  \n>*8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.*  \n>  \n>*9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!*  \n>  \n>*10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?*  \n>  \n>*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*  \n>  \n>*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*  \n>  \n>*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*\n\n[Hedge fund grossing \\/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)\n\nIn other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are \u201chedged\u201d by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they\u2019re \u201csafer\u201d. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable \u201cNet Exposure\u201d, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.\n\nA very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN\u2019s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would\u2019ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It\u2019s very likely that if Robinhood hadn\u2019t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we\u2019ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn\u2019t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).\n\n**TLDR**\n\nIn case your attention span was too short to read everything above,\n\n1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d\n2. Much of the stock market\u2019s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**\n\n*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it\u2019s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it\u2019ll fall below $100.*\n\nOr in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).\n\nEDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=announcement&utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.\n\nEDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs.

In the app, go to More... \u25ba Settings and Profile \u25ba Quick Access \u25ba Turn on Watch Lists & Real Time Quotes. This feature is turned off by default and means Fidelity has a 15 minute delay on live ticker prices.\n\n\u2705 - Activate \u201cExtended Hours Trading\u201d. This allows you to trade on the markets before and after close for a set amount of extended time. To do so, you HAVE to be on the Fidelity website. Search in the top right hand search corner \u201cExtended Hours Trading\u201d and pick the article titled exactly that. Walk through the process to enable it. Others are saying to call Fidelity. Don\u2019t. Customer service simply walks you through how to do it on your own from the Fidelity website.\n\n\u2705 - Rate Robinhood a 1-2 on the app and playstore.\n\n\u2705 - Rate Fidelity a 3 or 4 on the app and playstore. 5 star customer service but they deliver a 2 star experience on their god awful UI. Let\u2019s do this to help convince Fidelity to modernize their brokerage app platform & leave Robinhood in the dust.\n\n\u2705 - File complaints on Robinhood using SEC. Link\n\n\u2705 - Class Action Lawsuits. If you believe you were negatively impacted by Robinhoods actions and believe you are entitled to compensation.

To show the purchasing power of that $1.25, 5 90% silver quarters has a value of about $27 dollars today. So in 1960 on minimum wage you earned the equivalent of $27.00 an hour when adjusted for inflation. \n\nWe lost our purchasing power. Thats why this push for Silver now is so important because it is taking back our purchasing power.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08536618947982788}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08536618947982788}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0770430788397789}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8482751846313477}, {"body": "Hope you got out of your GME Friday, that might have been the last chance", "score": -3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07086837291717529}, {"body": "\"Politics aside..\" after literally talking about politics for however many paragraphs. \n\nYou can go ahead and get fucked.

{"title": "Drawing with crayons (update and prediction)", "selftext": "I believe The market is going to crash and the media is framing the narrative with big money to blame WSB. i saw the headline trying to get WSB to sell or the market will crash. forget the implications that a few retards could bring the world economy to its knees. I want to put this out there prior to anything happening in hopes of possibly helping my fellow smooth brains in the event i am correct. If this happens WSB had nothing to do with it the pattern has been forming since before most of you started trading.\n\nAfter mixed reviews and some interest in my dms, I thought I would put a time table to my theory and possibly earn some Nostradamus style prophetic infamy or go down in a blaze of glory.\n\nI believe SPX/SPY has created the largest three peaks and a dome house chart pattern ever seen. Typically these patterns are seen over a period of months, but, I believe this has been forming for years. I am predicting a severe economic downturn with a depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPX current comparison](https://preview.redd.it/jexd28xazre61.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac7b64688498b98ec83c2f57aae10b620d29c7b0)\n\nThe above chart shows the current 5 year SPX chart compared to an example of a past three peaks and a dome house pattern. Based on this March was not a crash but a signal of what's to come. As you can see if i am correct this will be the only time in history this pattern has occurred over a timeframe this large. I am not screaming the sky is falling, but facts point to the very likely possibility. 6/10 of the largest market rallies were during the great depression and 2/10 were during the 08 crisis. this is no different.\n\nTiming\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohnywa5s3se61.png?width=2178&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a5c4e040e89f8da81ba20420ee9390d324422eb\n\nThe above is the current spy chart over a 5 year period. I am operating under the theory that in april we entered the deflationary spiral seen in depressions, through fed intervention, stimmys, and other market factors we have yet to see the full brunt. My prediction is that the market will rally a bit over the next 2-3 weeks, and then begin its descent with the large drop coming in 4-6 weeks. This can be affected by an infinite amount of factors which could accelerate or prolong the pattern. According to pattern, we will see new ATH or near it on SPX then we will go down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to be extremely clear, I am just like you in the worst possible ways.

The reason that I would still buy shares is because I'm perfectly comfortable waiting out the shorts, who I believe didn't cover entirely based on some sketchy trading volumes and price action on Thursday known as ladder attacks, which is basically artificially lowering a security's price by selling it back and forth between two parties. (Note: the WSJ is reporting that Melvin closed their positions at a loss of 50% to the fund. Maybe they did, though I don\u2019t trust Melvin or the WSJ. Regardless, I have no doubt that other HFs are salivating at the short opportunity given where GME shares are currently trading.)\n\n**The key is the somewhat unreliable short data which comes out next week.** As I mentioned in a previous post, getting accurate short data is next to impossible. It makes polling data look flawless by way of comparison. It has gotten to the point that I don't believe anything I read because there is not only time lag but synthetic longs and ladder attacks all of which serve to obscure the data. No firm wants it positions known so there is a strong incentive to obscure/hide the data. Another reason why Melvin publicly releasing its positions is just highly unusual/odd.\n\nI would also be aware that a lot of HFs are making bank off the GME volatility by selling options and taking long positions. Just look at [r/thetagang](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/). The group is making their entire investment decisions based solely on the option premium without any concern for the underlying narrative to the point where they're short GME puts at the 200 strike. (And they think WSB is full of retards!)\n\nTo use an analogy, I'm a lifelong Giants fan who put a $1,000 down on the Giants beating the Pats in the 2008 Superbowl. The Pats went undefeated all season and the Giants entered the playoffs as a wildcard. The bookie even told me when I placed the bet that I was just throwing away my money. I bet the money line, i.e., no points, and ending up winning $5,000. The bookie just smiled at me when I handed him my ticket. Sometimes you just gotta trust your gut and stay loyal to your instincts no matter what others think. It's what separates the men from the boys.\n\nTLDR: It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but don\u2019t invest in GME what you can\u2019t afford to lose. At this point, you're going against some very powerful hedge funds, i.e., the Pats in 2008. That said, WSB already scored a very impressive victory and is retarded enough to not realize how good their competition really is (just like the Giants in the Super Bowl).\n\n**How will the media portray the narrative?**\n\nThe media have already started spreading the narrative that WSB is going to cause a financial collapse rather than the true culprits, namely, the HFs which leveraged up 5x to short 120% of a company's shares outstanding setting the stage for an infinity squeeze, which is the financial equivalent of a nuclear chain reaction.  I mention this because the greatest risk IMHO is government intervention to quell the markets when the HFs start unloading positions to meet margin calls and borrowing costs. Nobody will lose sleep over a few billionaires losing a few commas in their net worth but hitting 401Ks, pension funds, and endowments is a different story. The official narrative will involve large commercial banks which loaned Melvin and other HFs billions to leveraged up with. These banks are regulated by the SEC and FDIC because they hold commercial deposits. When the narrative shifts from Melvin and HFs to names you recognize, e.g., JPM, BofA, Citi, rest assured the game is almost up. My guess is we're in the seventh or eighth inning of this game before it's stopped.\n\nWhen people ask me about WSB I first discuss the HFs who created the conditions and then secondly note that thankfully we're dealing with a relatively small company in GME with a market cap of $20bn (so far!) compared to a company in the S&P 500, which is the basis for index funds and portfolio construction. In short, WSB did everyone a favor by calling attention to such a disastrous scenario in as optimal circumstances as possible. We should be very thankful WSB alerted the public to a systematic flaw in the financial system before a much greater meltdown occurred.\n\nTLDR: The media are the PR firms for Wall Street. They exist to promote a narrative and receive access and compensation in return. They have no interest in reporting how the retail investor is being swindled. In contrast WSB did everyone a favor by pointing out a very serious systematic flaw in as optimal fashion as possible. This is the truth and the message that needs to be heard.\n\n**What\u2019s the next step?**\n\nFINRA releases short data next Tuesday, February 9th for the period ending this past Friday, January 29th. Roughly 700mn GME shares changed hands last week or 10x the total shares outstanding so I'm pretty sure the short interest (SI) has fallen below 100%. However, I expect it to still be well above 50% given the typical HF\u2019s risk appetite by which I mean they expect the retail investors to run for the exits sending shares back to $20-ish levels. I would love to know the borrowing costs for these firms because it basically tells you how long they can wait before such costs negatively impact their returns. My guess is until March when they have to report 1Q results to investors.\n\nTLDR: Short data will show a decrease in SI, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it\u2019s important to note that the risk/reward profile of the trade has moved.\n\n**How much good did this GME trade really do besides transfer a lot of wealth?**\n\nA heck of alot. At a minimum, WSB drew well needed scrutiny to the role of option clearings firms such as Citadel\\* and Wolverine, i.e., the shadow economy, and their dual roles as market makers and hedge funds (players and referees). This screams conflict of interest. A revolution doesn\u2019t happen overnight but this is another step forward in demonstrating how rigged the game is against the retail investor and guy in the (Main) street. Our regulatory agencies exist to enforce transparency and fairness. WSB has demonstrated that the derivatives market and particularly short selling lack both and have the capability to cause a financial panic. And of course, there is the unbelievable amount of charitable donations from WSB gains which prove who the real Robinhood is. (Sorry, couldn\u2019t resist).\n\n* Citadel alone handles more than 25% of US equity flow. The company is a monster and barely anyone knows it exists, which is how they like it. They tell Wall Street what the regulation is and they pay Washington to enforce it. Former Fed heads Bernanke and Yellen have received almost a million in combined comp for speeches and advisory services from Citadel. In short, Citadel makes Goldman look like the United Way. And oh, yeah, 40% of Robinhood's revenue comes from Citadel in return for order flow. Assume what you will.\n\nTLDR: Sunlight is the best disinfectant \u2013 Justice Brandeis\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor the questions below and messages:\n\nAs I tried to communicate in the write-up, I would characterize the trade as more risky than a week ago when the SI was above 100%. I have no doubt many shorts have since closed. That said, I suspect the SI is still well above 50% given where the stock is and typical HF risk appetite. This is not a trade for your parents or grandparents.\\* There is serious risk here that the share price collapses based on who the counterparties are and the lower SI. That said, I still like it and I'm in it. IMHO, it comes down to a game of chicken in the sense of who is willing to hold longer. HFs have investors to report to in 1Q vs. WSB who have bills, rent, and life to deal with. As my old coach would say, who wants it more.\n\n* The market has returned \\~11% per year for the past decade. A good HF aims for 2x that. You guys are banking +1,000% returns on a trade lasting approximately a month against the best HFs on the Street. These returns are not normal or even within several standard deviations. They are clearly not for the faint-of-heart. We are in unchartered waters here. No shame in heading back. The fact you've come this far is simply amazing. Even you wife's boyfriend would be proud of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "l9ul1c", "created_utc": 1612153147.0, "score": 1192, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 223, "comments": [{"body": "TL; DR  We retards only believe in holding and liking the stock", "score": 347, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Nope.

If each share of  GME has two owners and a counterparty who is indebted to one of those  owners for the value of a share of GME, why shouldn't everyone on the  planet spend all the money they can afford to gamble with to buy shares  of GME until each share has one owner?  The shorts will buy.  They must.   The question is when, and at what price.  The value of GME has nothing  to do with Gamestop and everything to do with game theory.  The shorts  placed a wager.  Their reasons for placing that wager do not matter.   Only the terms of their wager matter.  What were those terms?  At some  point in the past, the shorts decided to borrow the value of one  Gamestop share \\*now\\*, and in exchange, they agreed to repay the value of  one Gamestop share \\*later\\*.  They had beliefs about what a Gamestop  share represents, and beliefs about what makes a Gamestop share  valuable, but their beliefs do not matter to me.  What matters to me is  that when the value of a Gamestop share times the number of shares an  entity sold short is greater than the value of that short seller's  current liquid assets plus the amount their creditors will allow them to  borrow, the short seller is forced to lock in losses and spend all of  their money to purchase Gamestop shares to cover their bet, ending up  with nothing and transferring their wealth to the shareholders.  Our  target isn't a price.  Our target is one owner per share.  Fuck the  shorts.  Let them double down.  And quadruple down.  And octuple down.   More shorts is more money for the shareholders when the shorts get  liquidated because they don't have enough assets to equal the value of  the shares they promised to repay. I see no reason why we shouldn't  continue to buy GME at any price until the shorts have closed their  positions.  The value of a Gamestop share is the dollar value at which  every short seller has closed their position and each share has a single  owner.  No less.  We are playing musical chairs.  Eventually, the music  will stop.  When it does, you will either be part owner of Gamestop, or  you will not.  Owning part of Gamestop will either be worth something,  or it will not.  The music is still playing.  Which is worth more to  you: the number of dollars it currently costs to purchase a share of  Gamestop, or the prospect of owning one share of Gamestop in the future?   If you're not sure, consider opening your bible to Matthew 25.  I  would say that anyone who asks me to trade my infinite amount of tendies  for their finite amount of tendies is calling me a retard, but I  consider that term to be a badge of honor.  I was reading earlier and I  came across a word which, with regard to GME, was not in my lexicon:  sell.  After much research, I discovered that, in context, the word  meant \"to voluntarily not own GME.\"  I must admit, I am too retarded to  understand the concept.

{"title": "$GME Caution (actually just Gay Bear) reporting in with some DD", "selftext": "**TLDR: \"CoNtrARiaN\" but actually just a\ndick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.**\n\n_Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I\nam saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at\nthe same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for\nmemes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &lt;3_\n\n**\n\nTHESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.**\n\n**\n\nWhen?**\n\nApproximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out\n(sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks\ntime) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.\n\n**\n\nWhy do you think this?**\n\nFirst, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just\nthe slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for\nbukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).\n\nSecond, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per\nshare by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float\nupdate (I\u2019ll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex\nlater on, and why I don\u2019t trust them).\n\nTo put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal,\nBIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time,\nthat\u2019s already a 750% loss.\n\nIf someone had put in **JUST** $1M in August 2020 (by the\nway, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short\nafter this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers\nwould have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K\nshares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =\u00a0 $7.4M.\n\nSo, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy\nback and return your shares. You now have a $6.4M loss.\n\n**WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ,\nuncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They\nGOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.**\n\nYou could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these\nwhite-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.\n\n**\n\nHere is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right\nnow:**\n\nMelvin wasn\u2019t the only short position. Just the most\nretarded one that didn\u2019t cover in time, so they had to go through a whole\nfucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while\nliterally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short\npositions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did\nget squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on\nsomething else.\n\n**First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin & Citron)\ncontinue to push the narrative: \u201cThrow Melvin & Citron to the masses and\nkeep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school\ndiplomas.\u201d**\n\nSecond, **hedgies go LONG on GME shares now**. WTF HOW?\nWell remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares.\nThese lenders would happily let go of their positions at the \u201ctop\u201d of a\nsqueeze. (It\u2019s ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).\n\nThird, you now have a long position with underlying shares.\nWhat\u2019s the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol\npremiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I\u2019ve been on WSB long enough\nto know that WSB\u2019s risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ\nto afford the option premium on FDs.\n\nLastly, you push the narrative of a \u201cGAMMA SQUEEZE\u201d which is\nJUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand\nwith his Algebra 2 from high school \u2013 Essentially telling him, \u201cHEY THERES\nSTILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nREAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:**\n\nLook at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for\nGME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to\ncapitalist gods. \n\nWhich means for hedgies with wedgies, it\u2019s no longer a\ntail-risk, blind-side event, it\u2019s time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check\nfool, by \u201cMaRkET MAkInG\u201d.\n\nIf I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining\na fa\u00e7ade that I will \u201crationally\u201d hedge those positions by buying more of the\nunderlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.\n\nYou stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because\nyou heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this\naction to \u201cSTICK IT TO THE MAN\u201d because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal\ndescent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple\nmore days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being\nlifted on trading platforms.\n\nSO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do\nis collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying\nshare positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I\u2019ll\nsell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of\nYOUR options.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also have an expectation as to where GME could\npotentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that\nby the avg retail trader account liquidity.\n\nYou guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the\nman is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and\nemotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall\nStreet system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there\u2019s 20 other\nhedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it\u2019s\ndone, they\u2019ll even make you feel bad, saying you were \u201cGreedy\u201d and \u201cReckless\u201d,\nfurther perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep\nprofiting off of.\n\nSo while the retail GME HODLER thinks there\u2019s still enough\ngold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they\u2019re getting is piss and\npre-cum.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nAPPENDIX \u2013 Ortex & S3 Partners**\n\nIf you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my\nlack of presentation in this thesis, it\u2019s literally 3AM in the East Coast US\nbecause I\u2019m up for 4AM pre-market (don\u2019t fucking judge me, I\u2019m a retard too).\n\nSo I\u2019ll explain that point from WAY up there about short\ninterest estimates.\n\nI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says.\nI do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data\ncame out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on\n1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would\nhave literally gone bankrupt if they\u2019re still short, NOT just Melvin.\n\nSee, here\u2019s the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with\nthis **two weeks lag** on short data for individual stocks, what fucking\ndata analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of\nthis time & information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets\nperpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.\n\nOrtex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they\nhopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks\non their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds\nlater on.\n\nAnd even if they believed in your cause, no smart data\nanalytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the\npublic, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in\ntown.\n\nTherefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the\nsystem is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a\nlittle bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and\na total fraudulent bull-trap at worst. \n\nAgain, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub\nwill always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife\u2019s\nboyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained\nalong the way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\n\nThank you for listening to my ted-talk.

In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday\n\n>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers\u2019 attempt to corner the market on the metal.\n\n-\n>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926\u20132014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers\u2019 Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.\n\n-\n>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged\u2014March 27\u2014silver fell to $10.80, the metal\u2019s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, \u201cA billion dollars isn\u2019t what it used to be,\u201d the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.\n\n-\n>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978\u201391) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.", "id": "la1o04", "created_utc": 1612181291.0, "score": 86013, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 2019, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5315, "replies": [{"body": "Just bought 10 more GME, I\u2019m doing my part \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc8e.

They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!\n\nAS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They\u2019re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!\n\nBrokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there\u2019s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that\u2019s why they\u2019re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That\u2019s why there are lawsuits. \n\n1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS\n\n2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU\n\n3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest\n\n4)HOLD AND BUY\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15\n\n5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f\n\n6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN\n\n7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS.

Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.\n2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.\n3. Spread disinformation through \"analysis\" to get people to sell their stocks because \"the fundamentals aren't there\". Again, this is all over the place right now.\n4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.\n5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.\n6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.\n7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.\n\nBasically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.\n\nConfused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:\n\n[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n**Need more proof?**\n\nJim Cramer himself, [\"here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly\".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)\n\n**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**\n\n* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n\nWhen (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\\*\n\nInvestopedia \\[\"Short and Distort\" - illegal short tactic \\]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))\n\n**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)\n\n**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are \u201cforced\u201d sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.\n\nSome of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or \u201cprop\u201d desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.\n\n**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing \u201cvolatility\u201d**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.\n\nThe compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated \u201cdumps\u201d of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.\n\nMost of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.\n\nsource: [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html)\n\nStill TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us.

They're betting the stock will go down enough and that people will lose interest so that they can cover their shorts over a very long period of time and still profit. I'm not saying the squeeze won't squoze, but in order for that to happen, all lenders must call back the shares they lent in a similar timeframe. With the amount that lenders are making on interest for this stock and the amount of collusion and corruption going on, I don't see that happening for a long long time. Melvin will gladly lose 25M a day for months if it means they don't liquidate their entire firm in full public view. VW was different, as the announcement that Porsche had locked up a high fraction of the public float meant that at the time of the squeeze, VW had a much higher short interest than GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know why they're pushing silver so hard, but my only bet is that they're trying to direct mainstream attention and paper-hands away from GameStop so that this doesn't happen so publicly.

On WeBull, I see commenters seeing short squeezes going on EVERYWHERE - including stocks with under 20% short interest. We have here an influx of retail investors.

Many of them don't understand the situation beyond what the price reflects at the moment and think that every dip is a short ladder...what's worse, many of them are vulnerable to emotional trades, having put in more than they can afford to lose but without the conditioning many traders develop after years of seeing the ups and downs.\n\nNot everything is a short squeeze.\n\nNot everything is a conspiracy theory (although the recent $SLV situation given Citadel's positions is very suspect - infer what you will)\n\nThere is no set date for the squeeze - There is NO set date for shorts to have to cover unless market conditions force them to.\n\nThe only way to win this, is to hold. Turn your share lending off if your broker allows. Ride the ups and the downs. Set you limit sell much higher than the market value - this will influence the price.\n\nMost importantly, understand: a true short squeeze will happen if shorts are FORCED to cover their positions at whatever the current price is. This is not the same as contract expiry - they are two different things.\n\nShort sellers have likely been covering as much as they can on every dip, to cover themselves. This is because shares are still being traded.\n\nDon't sell. We need to limit the supply.

{"title": "Questions on Short Float, Short Ladder Attacks and Short Squeeze.", "selftext": "Here are the main questions many have. Post will be updated with more answers and questions from the comments. This will help a lot of people!\n\n#**Q1) The short float % seems to be going down from a number of sources. Why are these not correct?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- From u/kevinjing11: Short float % is what's publicly reported. Many ways that MMs and hedge funds can essentially fake this number through unreported phantom shares\n- From u/Candle-Sticks: The short float % numbers we've been seeing are all estimates. The official reports don't come out until 2/9.\n- From u/JesusHimself69: There's no way the hedges could have paid out their shorts that fast without the stocks rocketing up. Some on Thursday/Friday? Sure. But not over the weekend. It's just a scare tactic.\n\n- From u/ whateverathrowaway00: \nhttp://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html and \nhttps://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf\nThe documents listed here show that the DTC ( central clearing house for stock trading ) has allowed counterfeit stock trading to occur for a long time. It is this environment that allows naked shorting to occur.\nThe SEC article above is from 2008 basically laying out how the restrictions put in place could be side stepped and it lines up. With this explanation, no one needed to call the DTC. There are no more shares of GME... period. That\u2019s why even though short interest is being manipulated exactly as spelled out in the SEC paper above, there are no available shares to short in most brokers. The DTC raised deposit prices. They didn\u2019t need a phone call. They\u2019re not doing it to help any brokerages or hedge funds. They\u2019re doing it to save their own ass. This is an opaque company that has the ability to shrug off congressional subpoenas. Independant actors all acting for their own gain is a much more likely explanation then widespread collusion. This is what makes sense to me. DTC raised deposits, allowing the shorts to unwind over time. The media will vilify the brokerages and hedge funds and no-one will ever ask where all the shares are. If that tactic does not work they will crash the economy in response.\n\n\n#**Q2) Can't the hedge funds just keep doing more short ladder attacks and drive the price down?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/FudgieThaWhale: No, because they're losing money doing ladders in an attempt to acquire additional shares. If investors don't sell a dip then they just flat lose the money. They won't keep doing it because they can't.\n- From u/Candle-Sticks: The ladder attacks rely on the HF holding shares, they can keep selling and laddering until they run out of shares. Of course they can easily buy more at the dips they artificially create.\n- From u/storyhungry: Interactive Brokers currently says that the borrow rate is 16.97% for HFs\n\n\n#**Q3) All these hedge funds are saying they're out of their short positions to align with question #1, we obviously don't believe them and they're probably racking up a ton of fees. How long can they really last?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- From u/FudgieThaWhale: It can last as long as they want to pay margin fees. I imagine that won't be for very long.\n\n- From u/autodrafter2020: There is a massive amount of Failure to Deliver, and short sellers have to pay the clearing houses soon, it could be just days: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n#**Q4) When the short squeeze happens, what period of time are we talking about? Does it last 10 mins, 2 days, etc?**\n\n\n#**Q5) How do I know if it's a short ladder attack?**\n\nResponses:\n\n- Click and read through this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/glmatag?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\n\n#**Q6)  What % of the float do we need to own before this starts to squeeze (and is this publicly available)?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/thejewsdidnothing :It is possible (and likely imo) that we already hold over 100% of GME\u2019s float. Why haven\u2019t we squeezed? Because the shorts are able to dilute the float with fake shares as much as they want. The real question that should be asked then is \u201cat what point does the government step in to stop them, or when do the shorts accrue such heavy losses that they have to cover?\u201d The answer is that we don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\n#**Q7)  Why can't I buy more on Vanguard (relevant to other brokers too)**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/Tainthairtwizzler : Vanguard no longer allowing you to use money transferred immediately. Just got off the phone with support and the funds need to be cleared through the 7 Day Hold before you can spend them. Must have been set over the weekend/today because I was able to buy BB from the same account but wasn't allowed to buy GME all during this morning.\n\n#**Q8) Isn\u2019t it plausible that HF have been shorting at 300- 400$ level and are now taking in big time on their own ladder attacks to around the 250$ level?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/Thefsm93: It is possible that they have been shorting at 300-400, except that the volume of shares being traded doesn't match the volume of shares needed for the short. If the question is more geared at them buying in at 300-400 and trying to short at 250, that would just make this situation worse because they would still then need to BUY.\nPlus, why would they be artificially driving the price down with ladder attacks?\n\n#**Q9)  How does the short % of the float matter if there are approximately 10M shares to cover with?**\n\n#**Q10) (from others) I\u2019m trying to get into the gme/amc craze but public / webull apps is taking anywhere between 1-7 days to confirm deposits before i can use the funds in my bank account. is this new? is there a way to expedite the process?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- From u/waqas961: If you have a cash account linked to your bank on webull and you transfer an amount it will be available same day if did in morning or available next day as provisional funds to trade with until your actual deposit goes through which can take upto 5 days. I bought on 27th and 28th Jan but my actual deposits still show pending. Wire transfer however is different and for that you need to actually wait the whole time till it gets processed.\n- From u/sutsusame: If you want to invest money right away, see if the brokerage will let you do a wire transfer. I use E*TRADE and incoming wire transfers usually clear within minutes, with no hold period. You will probably need to pay a fee to your bank.\n\n#**Q11) What are some in depth posts that people believe should be read?**\n\nResponses: \n\n- An insane amount of deception has been in the works for a long time: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n- Shit's about to get crazy: https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/\n\n- Why the squeeze hasn't happened:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ladv7v/gme_will_squeeze_and_heres_the_10_reasons_why_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n- Shorts covering:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lae73m/psa_remember_shorts_have_two_days_to_deliver_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n\n#**Q12) I've read a couple of posts that casually mention the possibility that GameStop could issue more shares, pulling in a bunch of money and essentially letting the shorts off the hook. Can GameStop do that? If so, why the hell wouldn\u2019t they?**\n\n\n#**Q13) What happens if HFs have artificially created the counterfeit shares to the amount we hold which they exactly need and then when the short squeeze takes place, restrict all of us \ud83e\udd8d and basically resell it to themselves and make our shares burn to the ground?**\n\n\n#**Q14) What happens if the short squeeze takes place and all of the brokerage houses crash, as we have seen they have restricted us from buying? Wouldn\u2019t be surprised of seeing them not allowing us to sell at the most important moment. Btw, as we see that there is an insane amount of counterfeit shares, does that mean that this is hope they will save their asses by restricting the fake shares to be sold?**\n\n----\n\n\nI really want this to be helpful for everyone.

{"title": "PSA: remember, shorts have two days to deliver. This was why there was no squeeze today.", "selftext": "**EDIT: I am not claiming that the squeeze will be squoze tomorrow (prepare to hold for weeks). My claim is that another gap up this week is guaranteed if we hold $300.**\n\n**EDIT: you diamond hands really need to step up. If we break today, past two weeks will be all for nothing. As another post pointed out, shorts will do anything to break the 13-day failure to deliver chain, as otherwise the SEC will immediately force them to cover.**\n\nWith GME pushed above $320 Friday, a huge wall of calls were exercised. Anyone who sold calls is now deeply, deeply underwater.\n\nThe longs haven\u2019t won the battle yet though: holders of the short calls (largely Citadel at this point) have **two days** to deliver the shares. (See source below).\n\nIf I was in their position, would I start covering today  and therefore trigger a gamma squeeze? HECK NO. \n\nInstead, If I was a short, I would kick the can one more day while I try one more hail mary. I will attempt a large short-ladder attack to at least push the price down (if not outright induce panic-selling). At the same time, I would approach a large institution with shares (think Fidelity or Blackrock), and make an offer for a large volume of shares.\n\nBy pushing the price down, I can reduce my losses, and at the same time strengthen my hand in negotations with institutions that can offer shares.\n\nIf the hail mary works, shorts can at least get away alive tomorrow without even incurring \u201cfailure to deliver\u201d\n\nHowever, if retail is able to kill them at $300-$320 by open tomorrow, there will be a gamma squeeze the likes we have never seen this week (probably not THE squeeze yet, but a squeeze nonetheless). \n\nPanic-buying will start. Not all firms will do this panic buying, but I figure there are enough smaller HF shorts who don\u2019t have a legal team to temporarily stonewall failure-to-deliver lawsuits. Those have no choice but to start covering.\n\n\n**TLDR: no squeeze today because shorts still have one day of breathing room.

It currently specifies the delivery date for physically-settled options as the third business day following the day on which the exercise notice was, or is deemed to have been, properly tendered to OCC. Rule 903 also generally specifies the delivery date for physically settled security futures as the third business day following the maturity date. Under the proposed rule change, these references in Rule 903 to the \u201cthird\u201d business day would be changed to the \u201csecond\u201d business day.\u201d", "id": "lae73m", "created_utc": 1612213698.0, "score": 4945, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 488, "comments": [{"body": "Get ready for the media to completely try to demoralize us tomorrow and tonight.

You buy a share, but your broker ever only receives it 2 days later, which is the time for both sides broker's (buyer and seller) to \"match\". In the meantime, you have an IOU from your broker saying (in the buyer's case) \"you will own X amount of shares at Y price in 2 days\".\n\nBasically, the back office of a bunch of these firms spend 2 days making sure shit actually moves around correctly.\n\nI fully except tomorrow and/or Wednesday to be a shitshow.\n\nBy my calculation: 80M shares could be bought through ITM call options expiring last Friday if exercised (might be less, the after hours price closed below $320 iirc). The float is 50M shares (total shares is 70M, but some are tied up with management, etc. so can't be freely traded). Of course some of those option contracts will be rolled forward (for a later expiration date) because you have to have $320 (approx closing price) x 100 shares/contract to exercise one contract.\n\nNow this is where my understanding of the financial system decreases slightly but, my understanding is that exercised contracts have that same 2 day settlement period. Your call expires ITM on Friday, you say \"yo, I want those shares\". Right, well the seller of the option contract has two (trading) days to find them and \"deliver\" them into your account. That means tomorrow by EOD.\n\nI expect $GME to be simply \"permanently\" (as opposed to for 15 minutes periods when circuit breakers were triggered previously) halted by 10AM Wednesday. Everyone is going to be scrambling to \"find\" the shares they need to settle and match. The unveiling of \"counterfeit\" shares may even happen for all I know. Tomorrow I except this to drop even more than today. The pricing is going to be **completely** fucked during that period.\n\nSource: I work as an accountant in the back office of an investment manager, though not in settlement's, so I \"kinda\" know how this works. I spoke to someone with 30 years of trading knowledge who basically said \"I don't know what happens and I don't touch what I don't know (so sell)\". We may have participated in completely fucking the \"plumbing\" of the financial system as it relates to settlements (who would've thought shorting a company to up to 140% could lead to that? SEC Intern, you reading this? Please take notes and talk to your boss). RH finding 2.4B in capital today probably isn't a coincidence, the DTCC (where the brokers meet to clear/match trades) probably wanted to make sure they had sufficient capital (for all those IOUs they wrote).\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

{"title": "Concerns about this sub. A cult-like mentality is starting to form. And its dangerous", "selftext": "So preface, I'm not a bot and my positions are short on the S&P 500. I think this GME squeeze will cause a liquidity crisis so the market corrects. So GME going up is good for my account.\n\nI've been on this sub for a few years and its rise in popularity the last few weeks has brought some concerns to me. Namely that this sub has the potential to drive some serious cult like behavior. \n\nThis GME squeeze is an interesting story, it started out as a play to make a metric fuckton of money and has grown into some weird psuedo-social movement, or at least disguised as one. You have people new to trading (As seen by the constant questions asking basic questions about the market) on this emotional trip to steal from Wall Street and give unto themselves. In an era with a lot of uncertainty due to the rona I get it. \n\nMy concerns now is there seems to be a quickly rising culture of if you do not love GME you are a bot/dissenter/evil wrongdoer with the intent to take the ship down. And I agree there has been a lot of not so legitimate people here the culture is slowly turning to join the hivemind or go. I am already seeing people talking about \"our next target\" as if this is now some group intended to take down wall street from within.\n\nThis sub has made this short squeeze a little guy vs Wall Street thing, and while there is plenty of shady shit going on, people don't seem to understand there are institutions long GME, they want to take Melvins money just as much as you. It's a short vs long battle. \n\nThat whole Robinhood fiasco, it was a legitimate issue handled HORRIBLY. They ran out of money and were going to go insolvent, and they handled it quite possibly the worst way, adding even more fuel to this us vs them fire.\n\n\"It can't go tits up\" -  Words someone says right before it goes tits up. A lot of you all will make life changing money off GME, and I am glad for you. But you also have to understand for a lot of yall, you're going to lose. The market giveth and the market taketh away. I've blown up my account twice so I've gone through the emotional rollercoaster before. I remember my first 10 bagger off TGT when $BECKY was memeing. I am worried that for those people this GME play goes tits up on, someone will wrongly focus that energy into being someone else's fault and not them not understanding the play they were making.\n\nThis sub has grown exponentially and the mods have been doing there best, however this one tweet definitely added fuel to the fire in my opinion, \n\nhttps://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1356338243554304001?s=20\n\nI think this perpetuates the message that its someone else's fault GME went down today and that the \"elites\" are out to get us.\n\nThis is reminding me of an Alphabet soup themed cult. And we all see how that's going.\n\nThis sub was always about making money and being dipshits doing it. And I am worried that culture is going to transform into something much much worse. My biggest fear is that people who blow up their account off this play are taken advantage of by others and lead down some crazy shithead path.\n\nEdit: I can't blame the mods for this.
