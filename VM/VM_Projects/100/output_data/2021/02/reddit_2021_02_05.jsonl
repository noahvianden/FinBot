{"title": "Stocks to Watch 05/02/2021", "selftext": "Good morning,\n\nYesterday was a crazy day with AACG showing some ridiculous moves on the upside. Congratulations to those of you who managed to catch it. That said, there are equally stocks like CPSH which temporarily show potential and then flash-crash down, so be careful out there. Here is my watchlist for today:\n\n1. **$LAIX (LAIX Inc) -** I can't see a catalyst with this stock, but it's made some crazy moves pre-market. Similar to AACG, this is an ADR based in China and this is very likely another 'pump/dump' like we have seen a lot lately.\n2. **$JG(Aurora Mobile)** \\- This is another ADR but does actually have a catalyst, which seems to be an announced partnership with Kuaishou to increase monetisation efficiency. This has ripped up in the last 20 minutes and at it's all-time-high. One to watch, this will be our leading gapper going into the open at this rate.\n3. **AAME (Atlantic American)** \\- We've seen this rip up a few hours ago and then followed by a selloff, but it keeps testing the VWAP (currently acting as resistance) which shows promise. A break of this VWAP and a push through $5 would definitely attract a lot of attention.\n\nOther stocks I will be watching: STG, AREC, KRKR, TTOO (High float), TDC (High float)\n\nAs a reminder, trading is risky, make sure you put stops in place and follow your initial plan regardless.\n\nHave a good weekend.\n\n\\-Rep", "id": "ld7zx6", "created_utc": 1612534544.0, "score": 318, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 136, "comments": [{"body": "Dude idk if they are all up because of fundamentals or because everyone is following your posts and just buying them up (like GME) or both.

{"title": "I think a market crash is coming in 2021", "selftext": "I am a 40 year old investor that owns a small investment company; lucky enough to have survived 20 years of investing to be self-sufficient.  In my life I haven't experienced inflation, or high interest rates which is the same as many other investors.  I used to think my father was crazy for his love for yellow metal until recently.  I understand my father better because at my age he experienced inflation, 15% interest rates, which is something I can only read about.  It is estimated after the next stimulus is passed 25% of the circulating US dollar was printed in the last 12 months.  You don't need to be an economist to understand that the dollar is going to be worth less; not worthless, but worth less than today.  I am building two apartment buildings this year (Canada and US), and price increases are very apparent in both countries.\n\nIt is beyond my capability to fully understand despite being a professional electrical engineer with business background, but I will cite some investors whose opinion I value:\n\n1. **Warren Buffet** \\- Specifically the Buffet Indicator which is the ratio of the stock market capitalization to GDP ratio.  This is the highest it has been since 2001 before the dotcom crash.  I attached a graph this below.  His right hand Charlie Munger - called it a \"speculative frenzy\" just recently;\n2. **Ray Dalio** \\- thinks this is the end of the long-term and short-term debt cycle and sees a similar crash coming soon which will lead to a depression.  He frequently compares the 2010s to the roaring 20s which led to a wealth divide, tribalism and WW2.  We see similarities now, and in 2018 he said many times the long-term debt cycle will end soon.  His most recent portfolio reflects this by holding 26% gold with diversification in other markets; and\n3. **Jeremy Grantham**  \\- known for avoiding bubbles like the 80s in Japan and the dotcom crash.  He is sitting on 2.2 billion and telling his fund to be patient.\n\nThe more I read about debt cycles, over production of cash, and the difference between currency and money the more I agree with them.  Could it be confirmation bias?  Maybe.  Did I miss some gains in the last few weeks after exiting the market for the first time since 2016 --- 100% yes.  Only time will tell if I made the right choice.  FOMO is real and I feel it right now.

PDT's are regulated differently due to considering that style of trading to be riskier. If you get flagged as a PDT, you must have $25,000 minimum value in your account at all times, but you will be able to day trade without restriction.\n\nPDT restrictions apply *only* to margin accounts and not cash accounts. If you have a cash account, you *cannot* be labeled a PDT. However, platforms have their own rules regarding day trading for cash accounts and generally require you to wait until the funds from a trade settle before you can use that value to purchase something out. There's also freeride restrictions for cash accounts - when you open a trade without enough funding in the account and close the trade before making the funds available. [Here's E-Trade's rules on those as an example](https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/library/stocks/understanding-cash-account-violations).\n\nYou can also get around PDT rules by limiting your day trades to less than the 4 in 5 days, or by holding positions overnight. Futures also are not subject to PDT rules, but I absolutely don't recommend trading futures if you're new to trading.\n\n**TL;DR: If you get marked a Pattern Day Trader, by day-trading more than 4 times in 5 days, you must have a $25,000 minimum value in that account. These restrictions only apply to margin accounts, and not cash accounts, so if you have a cash account you cannot be marked a PDT.**\n\nEdit: I've done some more research and Robinhood accounts are margin accounts by default. You have to manually downgrade to a cash account. For clarification, a cash account is one that can only trade using your own funds that you input into the account. A margin account is one that can trade on margin - or, in simple terms, using money you borrow from the broker-dealer to give you an extra 50% of leverage/investing power.

They have benefits (e.g. nurses union protesting lack of protective gear to administration/management, ), but I def. don't think they're a panacea and I think they'd be a detriment at Tesla at least in regards to business efficiency (I'd wildly guess that Unions encourage^[1] outsourcing by partially to totally undermining the cost benefits of vertical integration depending on local labor/flexibility costs per widget) --and especially in instances where an antagonistic and/or short-term centric relationship develops with management, it's detrimental to long term company competitiveness.\\*\n\n(e.g., cases of union inefficiency:\nhttps://www.mercurynews.com/2012/11/22/thomas-sowell-killing-the-goose-that-laid-the-golden-egg/)  Note: they're quoting Hoover Institute which is conservative leaning.\n_____\n\\* Things that can be assets to an individual can hurt the company/team in long run.  Union amplified job position stability/longevity can undermine company adaptability and efficiency improvements by making it hard to reallocate labor positions that have become or can be made redundant.  Just cause firing requirements can make it onerous to let go poor performers.  Union associated focus on seniority in raises/promotions can undermine meritocratic individual excellence.  Pensions that enhance retirement security can become a ball and chain on company finances in contrast to 401k type retirements.  These are just tradeoffs that Tesla investors, employees, fans may want to be cognizant of.\n\n[Edit]^[1] Clarification.  Obviously not sole cause; I merely think that any cost increases due to labor and job position inflexibility makes it more cost effective to outsource to a cheaper and more flexible supplier (regardless of said supplier's union status or lack thereof.)  Likewise, in NY subway construction/expansion(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-construction-costs.html) , unions weren't necessarily sole contributor to exorbitant costs per mile, but it was them in combination with an ossified system that all had contributory role due to lack of non-union labor competition in a niche market combined with byzantine rules that served multitude of parties with vested interests.

{"title": "Village Farms International - VFF", "selftext": "VFF has been in the business of growing and selling vegetables in Canada/US for the last 30 years.  As a result, they've amassed quite a few things along the way.  They currently have approx 5M sq ft green house in TX and 5M in BC Canada as well as several partners in CAD/US/Mex (approx 12M sq ft of growing space).  On top of that, they've been selling to all the major grocery chain (Loblaw, Safeway, Trader Joes, Walmart, Wholefoods, etc. for years).  On top of that, they have decades of experience navigating the regulatory obstacles that is the USDA.\n\nWhy is all this relevant you ask?  Why should you give a shit about a vegetable grower who was able survive for 30yrs on razor thin margins (\\~3-5%)?  Because they are pivoting to Cannabis and making a big splash.  They operate their cannabis division in Canada under the name Pure Sunfarms and have curretly dedicated 2 of the 5M sq ft space to it and able to grow more as necessary.\n\nAll numbers in USD\n\nLow 2.07, High 15.05\n\nQ4/FY20 ER expected - My service say 2/16 but they've traditionally released it mid March\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR;\n\n\\- Only profitable Public LP in Canada (not squint real hard adjusted ebitda profitable, but actual fcf/net income profitable)\n\n\\- Grossly undervalued compared to their peers (by marketcap)\n\n\\- Recently came in 4th for retail sales in Ontario only after 1yr of receiving their sales license compared with other LP's having years head start.  They hold the pole position for flower sales (by brand) at OCS online\n\n\\- Lowest cost producer (can grow at \\~.45/g and all in cost around .60/g)\n\n\\- CEO/founder owns about 13%+ of all the shares\n\n\\- Large LPs (like ACB) have pretty much given up on growing in bulk and buying from them wholesale b/c it's cheaper\n\n\\- Already have US presence\n\nProfitability\n\nCheck any LP on ycharts and you can see most LPs have been losing money since day 1 compared with VFF.  It's patently absurd how poorly these companies are run wrt shareholder dollars.\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/companies/APHA/free\\_cash\\_flow\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/companies/CGC/free\\_cash\\_flow\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/companies/ACB/free\\_cash\\_flow\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/companies/TLRY/free\\_cash\\_flow\n\n[https://ycharts.com/companies/VFF/free\\_cash\\_flow](https://ycharts.com/companies/VFF/free_cash_flow)\n\nGrossly Undervalued \n\nGiven all the money losing companies, we have the marketcaps (from YHOO finance):\n\nAPHA - 5.2B\n\nCGC - 16.5B\n\nACB - 2.6B\n\nTLRY - 4.2B\n\nVFF - 1.15B\n\nSales Performance\n\n4th on retail sales in ontario per[ https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235](https://twitter.com/itsdgc/status/1356604397267124235)\n\n\\#1 dried flower on ocs online[ https://ocs.ca/pages/insights-publication](https://ocs.ca/pages/insights-publication)\n\nAgain, all this only after 1yr of receiving their sales licenses.\n\nLowest cost producers\n\nAs noted, they had to survive for years on razor thin vegetable margins so they've learned a thing or two about growing things cheaply.  While other LP's were spending millions/billions building/acquiring space, VFF quietly and efficiently converted their existing greenhouses for growing cannabis with the single goal in mind of producing it as cheaply as possible realizing that cannabis is just another commodity.  They've since stopped publishing their costs to produce for competitive reasons but left it last year in the .4-.5/g range and recently said they feel they could do it much cheaper based on tech advancements and picking out strains.  To punctuate their commitment to low cost operation, they have their own power plant recycling methane from a nearby dump site and converting it into power.  A recent comment by the CEO said that the nearest competitor spends roughly 2x more to produce 1g of cannabis.  \n\nCEO owns about 10M shares of the 75M shares outstanding.  First, 75M shares outstanding (about 65M float) is peanuts compare to the to others (maybe a little off given some <cough> ACB <cough> like to dilute every other week)\n\nAPHA - 317M\n\nCGC - 374M\n\nACB - 160M (after a 12:1 reverse split else they'd be 2B+)\n\nTLRY - 160M\n\nSo CEO owns about 13% of the company and is therefore majorly aligned with shareholders.  The management is top notch only diluting when absolutely necessary and aren't writing down 10's of millions/billions of assets like these other guys.\n\nWholesaler\n\nAs it turns out, being able to grow at low cost not only gives you the ability to dictate market prices in the retail channels (their products are generally the lowest prices around and they're still able to make a profit), but it affords them the opportunity to uniquely dominate the wholesale channel.  In fact, wholesale made up roughly 50% of their revs last Quarter!  As noted, ACB has all but given up on growing their own weed favoring buying it on the wholesale market (from VFF) b/c it's actually cheaper for them?  Huh?\n\nUS Presence\n\nLet's face it, the US market will be YUGE.  If Canada, with it's 35M inhabitants, is projected to be a 25-30B market, you can multiply that by at least a factor of 10 for the US with its 350M peeps.

{"title": "LESSON TIME: GME was short-sale restricted today. Here's what that really means.", "selftext": "Special shoutout to /u/UnempRetardaddy, who inspired me to write up this explanation. Unfortunately, WSB investors have picked up some half-truths with limited information, and are reaching a whole bunch of incorrect conclusions which they're using to justify advice to other traders. BAD MONKEYS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* Short attacks are real\n* Short ladder attacks are not\n* Any stock that falls 10% in one day (edit: compared to prior days close) is placed on a short-sale restriction for the remainder of that day and the next day\n* Short-sale restriction *doesn't* prevent short selling\n* It *does* effectively prevent short attacks\n* GME was short-sale restricted today, which is why no short attacks could take place to drive the price down. All downward price movement was caused by shareholders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's go into detail:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Are Short Attacks real, and what are they?**\n\nYes. A short attack is simply selling so many shares short that you drive the market price down due to oversupply vs demand. *This works the exact same way as if a shareholder was selling their actual shares, and not borrowed ones.*\n\nLet's imagine that a bunch of shares are all sold at market price at once. What happens?\n\nSince they are sold at market price, they automatically meet the bid price offered by the highest bidder in the marketplace, then the next highest bidder, etc. As long as more shares are being sold than there are orders at the highest bid price, then the sale will continue to the next highest bid price, which drops the market price of the stock (market price simply being the last price the stock was sold at).\n\nIf the current highest bid is $100 a share for 100 shares,and the next highest bid on the books is for $99 a share at 1000 shares...Then to drop the market price down $99, I need to sell 100 shares at market price.And if I want to drop the market price down past $99 (to whatever the next highest bid is), I need to sell 1100 shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What are the risks of launching a short attack?**\n\nWhen a hedge fund tries a short attack, they are taking a risk that there is more demand to buy shares at current market price than there is supply of shares they are willing to short sell.\n\nIf Melvin tries to short 1 million shares at $100 market price, but 10M shares worth of market price buy orders are immediately placed because people see the price dropping and want to buy the dip, then due to high demand vs supply the share price will go *above* $100, and now Melvin is in the red on their short position. For a real world example of this happening, see TSLA throughout 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What makes a short attack successful?**\n\n* Low trading volume - if there aren't a lot of buy orders on the books, there are fewer orders to meet at each price point, and fewer shares need to be sold to drive the price down.*For example: Thurs 1/28, when brokerages halted buying and artificially reduced demand*\n* Large supply of shortable shares - there are only so many shares for a company, and only so many of those that shareholders are willing to lend out for short selling. A short seller needs a large enough supply to (temporarily)  overwhelm demand.*For example: Despite shorts available for GME being at or near 0, MMs were (legally) allowed to 'naked short', creating artificial supply which allowed hedge funds to short sell at the $500 peak on Thurs (and yes, its as unfair as it sounds)*\n* Paper-handed bitches - This is the real key to success. If actual shareholders notice the price dropping and decide to sell as well, it creates a compounding effect, where supply increases even more, and price drops even more, and even more people decide to sell. This can also be caused by price drops triggering stop orders, as well as triggering margin calls by driving accounts below margin maintenance.\n* Psychological manipulation - This is a corollary to the previous point. If every shareholder had a sense that the price drop was only due to a short attack, they'd probably hold. But if they see news stories saying shorters closed their positions, that everyone is switching to buying silver, that brokers are halting buying and no one can help drive the price up... well, it makes it a lot easier to justify selling.\n\nFor the greatest example of all four of these elements at work, see GME between last Thursday and this Monday, between the brokerage restrictions (and the Market Maker margin reqs behind them), the media misinformation campaigns, the incredible abuse of naked shorting in the name of 'market liquidity', and the reality of the bull side being a lot of retail investors without deep pockets who overextended at high prices and didn't have enough collective reserves to buy the dips, so they ended up selling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Are Short** ***Ladder*** **Attacks real?**\n\nThe claim behind a short ladder attack is similar to the Short Attack described above, with the added flavoring that colluding hedge funds are just selling back and forth to each other. This is impossible.\n\nNote, per above, that *short attacks* are quite real. What makes a short ladder attack nonsense is the belief that hedge funds can direct who their sell orders go to, or that it's possible to constantly bid a price down in an open market place, where anyone can place a market 'buy' order and prevent the price from dropping till their order is met.\n\nThe closest we came to this notion was last Thursday, where the big players just straight up cheated and shut down much of the buy side of the market, so that, in effect, hedge funds may very well have just been short selling to each other. But that is more due to the environment created by those (hopefully unique) events.\n\nShoutout to /u/EmptySet2 for his further breakdown of why it's not a real thing, here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the\\_myth\\_of\\_the\\_short\\_ladder\\_attack/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is the Short Sale Rule (aka 'Alternative Uptick Rule' aka 'Rule 201' aka 'Short-Sale Restriction')?**\n\nThere's a bit of history here, with some changes to the rules over time. I'll talk about most recent version of this restriction, which was implemented in 2010:\n\n1. If any security falls more than 10% within a single trading day, it triggers the 'Alternative Uptick Rule' for the remainder of that day, and for the duration of the next trading day.\n2. While that rule is in place, short selling is only permitted if the price of the security is above the current national best bid (aka on the uptick).\n\nThis is required to be enforced by the system as a whole. For this rule to be broken, everyone would have to be in on it, from brokers to clearing entities to market makers. It would be a big fucking deal.\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-26.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-26.htm)\n\nSource for monkeys: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How does this stop a short attack?**\n\nRecall from earlier that a short attack is just selling a bunch of shares at market price, driving the price down as you meet each next highest bid.\n\nWell, quite simply, while GME is short-sale restricted, short sellers *cannot* sell their shorted shares to the current highest bidder. They have to set their own ask price above that highest bid price, and wait for a buyer to meet it.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that on a day like today, a short attack by its very nature isn't permitted to happen. *All short selling can do on a day like today is suppress the price from going up*. If the current share price is $60, a hedgie could short sell 10 million shares at an ask of $60.01, and thus the price wouldn't go past that until all 10 mil are bought out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does this mean about current stay of play of GME?**\n\nBroadly put, for the past week there have been alternating days of massive short attacks, followed by lulls or even upward price movement during the short-sale restricted days.\n\nYesterday there was a whole lot of shorting and/or shareholders exiting positions, driving the price down more than 10%. Today, we saw a relatively stable price as only shareholders could sell at market price.\n\nPut 2 and 2 together and take a wild guess what's coming Monday.\n\n(Edit: a short attack. That's what's coming. Or maybe it isn't, it's just going to be possible again. Just be aware of the possibility that wasnt there today. ) \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition: 1000 shares and 5 calls", "id": "ldk5o3", "created_utc": 1612567105.0, "score": 3447, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 363, "comments": [{"body": "Obligatory: I wish I could read. \n\n2nd: I think people confused and attached the term \"short ladder attack\" to a theory which involves a combination of funds front running retail and multiple funds shorting during low volume / broker purchase restrictions and covering immediately. In theory, if funds did collude, then in a really well done and coordinated effort they could POTENTIALLY with a little bit of luck and getting market data like 1 second earlier than retail and executing with algos rather than manually entering limits like us retards, can maybe short and cover with shares from another naked short. Now it's tinfoil hat as fuck and hard to prove even if it did happen.  People probably took this concept, saw some fractional from people ordering in euros or whatever and took it as funds selling and buying at specific prices back and forth to each other where there were no other orders on the board. I think the key point you touched on here that people need to understand is that even if everything I said above is true, you can still only short at the price the stock is current at. So funds would still need more volume in shorts than there are bids to drive the price down. \n\nAdditionally, even with the uptick rule in place, I believe brokers can still exempt shorts if they see fit with very little justification. Not sure about the mechanisms behind determine if a short can be exempt but my smooth brain might just be extra smooth today.\n\nThe most suspect thing about the whole GME situation is brokers claiming they ran out of collateral to handle the buy volumes last week.

Everyone saying GameStop has some sort of excellent business model is not reading the writing on the wall. GameStop is about to do a RadioShack style pivot to save their asses.... because nobody is going to be buying physical copies of games except for retro titles in 2030, and if they are, it'll be through online retailers like Amazon not the local GameStop (except for maybe the 1% of most nostalgic buyers). And the people that are left, are not enough to fuel an increase in stock price from 20 to 100 dollars (which would be competitive with like the high end tech companies like cisco and shit). A gaming retailer wouldn't hit that price even if it was a super popular franchise which GameStop is certainly not right now (despite all the stock hype that doesn't mean people are flooding into GameStop to buy physical games).\n\n> GameStop will never outperform Steam/GOG/etc and if you play games you know this. Microsoft and Playstation offering online downloads for games *officially* for the console and then *removing the disk drives from the console* to make it the *primary way to play* is the nail in the coffin and then *on top of that*, the \"season pass\" business model, as shitty as it is, has proven extremely profitable. \n\n> GameStop is going to do what. Shift to esports? Run tournaments in the old stores? How is that ever going to be anywhere near as lucrative as their old model of \"selling to literally every type of gamer not just esports gamers\". Online sales? Good luck getting into that market. \n\n> They're not even that strong of a company otherwise... there were tons of scandals about the way they treated employees just months ago during COVID. \n\n> This company will stagnate at low profit and then get bought within 5 years.

I think we saw that last week.\n\nI think the uptick rule fails to prevent a quickly falling price in the following example:\n\n\\- Highest bid is: $50.00 for 10 shares\n\n\\- Let's say there are also bids at $49, $48, $47 etc.\n\n\\- Short sale is entered with an ask at $50.01 for 100 shares. Technically higher than the highest bid so it's fulfilling the uptick rule.\n\n\\- The order for $50 at 10 shares is filled and then also the $49 and $48 limit orders are filled as well through the short sale.\n\n\\- This sets the highest bid price to $47.\n\nI may be exposing my lack of understanding in the fulfillment rule dynamics, but I think this is generally how short sellers can win on uptick days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>once they **have to start covering** the price will skyrocket IF there are enough people holding shares?\n\nYes, but it's a big IF that many $GME holders are clinging to. Let me zoom in on the IF for a moment. What conditions would make shorts **have to start covering**? The borrow rate that short sellers were paying about two weeks ago was reported to be as high as 80% when the $GME price was squeezed to $300/$400. Right now, my broker has set a borrow rate of 9.28%. The borrow rates for short positions are nose diving while the stock price is nose diving as well - a double whammy that seems to have delivered the bears a massive win last week. The cost of maintaining short positions has dropped. I feel that many of the short positions have been managed quite well by HFs in response to the threat of a squeeze. There seems to be less pressure for shorts to cover immediately.\n\nIf I were holding $GME in anticipation of a squeeze, I would pay special attention to the borrow rate. Share lenders typically set the borrow rate based on supply and demand. If supply of shares to lend is low, the borrow rate is high. The borrow rate is lower right now (compared to say, two weeks ago), suggesting that there are an abundance of shares available to lend out. I believe the borrow rate is a good real time indicator the current short interest. I expect SI and borrow rate should correlate directly.\n\nThis suggests to me that the \"hold the line\" effort has taken a significant blow.
