{"title": "Very Volatile & Lucrative to trade options on: $SNDL Due Diligence & Research UPDATE for 2/15. DEEP DIVE & ANALYSIS. [UPDATED: Sundial Growers] BOTH Good & Bad Since it's trending", "selftext": " Some of you may know me from my Due Diligence posts at [r/FluentInFinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/).  Posting this because it's very volatile & lucrative to trade options on. I'll share my due diligence with you all:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My strategy:**\n\nI am long on this, and I am also writing covered call options on my shares, to raise more money.\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Remember:**\n\n1. NASDAQ compliance to maintain its listing is done\n2. $600m in cash was raised, and the company has no-debt.\u00a0On Feb. 2, it closed a new registered offering worth approximately $100 million (less underwriting discounts and offering expenses). In other words, management has an influx of cash to drive new growth. That's a huge improvement compared to a year ago, and worth paying attention to: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us100-million-registered-offering-301220098.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us100-million-registered-offering-301220098.html)\n3. A long-term reason for this stock is the broader acceptance of marijuana use and expectations for further legalization or decriminalization, particularly at the federal level under President Joe Biden.\u00a0\u00a0And should the U.S. legalize marijuana in the coming years, Sundial could find itself in a position to aggressively enter this potentially massive market: \u00a0\u00a0[https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/state-and-regional/marijuana-legalization-bill-inches-closer-to-approval-in-nj-after-long-wait/article\\_dc60e314-446c-5ca3-a34c-671dcd0a1b19.html](https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/state-and-regional/marijuana-legalization-bill-inches-closer-to-approval-in-nj-after-long-wait/article_dc60e314-446c-5ca3-a34c-671dcd0a1b19.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You should know:**\n\nThe inquiries and google searches for SNDL has decreased a lot. I interpret this as less people are as interested as before:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1c7lvrc31sh61.png?width=1131&format=png&auto=webp&s=985ea12e2bfebfad699ffc6f7ad3e5907fbc91a7\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* Customers love their products, which is great for any business: [https://twitter.com/yacht\\_rock1/status/1360262963010142209](https://twitter.com/yacht_rock1/status/1360262963010142209)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f97irc81sh61.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b6bf98dc5bae415f834c207da64efa56276fe1\n\n* Check out this video on $SNDL by ZipTrader (certified on Youtube & 429,000 subscribers).

You should take a look, so that you are familiar with both sides of the story. The financials are not the best, he is right. But since I got in for 75 cents, I am ok with. Here is the thing, many companies in growth mode, do not have the best financials. For a long time, amazon, tesla and many other start ups had bad financials, but they has tons of cash and low to no debt, and were focused on growth. $SNDL has lots of cash, no debt, and is focused on growth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liiuko/exposing\\_sundial\\_growers\\_ticker\\_sndl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liiuko/exposing_sundial_growers_ticker_sndl/)\n* Another bad article on yahoo, just to show both sides of the story, but this it with a grain of salt. I don\u2019t trust the media because they partner up with the trading firms who try to take advantage of retail investors like us: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-avoid-sundial-growers-stock-221850893.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-avoid-sundial-growers-stock-221850893.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More reading:**\n\nAnother redditor, [u/bklynrob21](https://www.reddit.com/user/bklynrob21/),created this post about $SNDL which I enjoyed reading, but they didn\u2019t list any sources. The account is 18 days old, so I am always skeptical of \u201cnewer accounts\u201d : [https://www.reddit.com/r/SNDL/comments/lihnza/here\\_u\\_go\\_u\\_mushes\\_real\\_dd\\_on\\_sndl\\_reasons\\_to\\_buy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SNDL/comments/lihnza/here_u_go_u_mushes_real_dd_on_sndl_reasons_to_buy/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Education:**\n\nBelow are the 4 cycles of the stock market & its relation to SNDL:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8utkhze91sh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9bf84a18542fb2eebef5a69d859709d020b057e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Price Predictions for tomorrow:**\n\n4% chance it breaks $2.50, and less than 1% chance it falls below $1.50\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28x2m0aa1sh61.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b432fcd5945b03e519a55256d4d0b124ffc82f2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Price Predictions for Friday:**\n\n19% chance it breaks $2.50, and 15% chance it falls below $1.50. Very volatile week ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o7hsm9va1sh61.png?width=984&format=png&auto=webp&s=b635df0ed27ba252335dfdb00789df7ab456d42e\n\n**Support & Resistance:**\n\nIf it breaks the resistance of $2.33, it should keep shooting up. There is a support level of $1.81 that it shouldn't fall below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xoh0a9lb1sh61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=e219b1d9dc69002d072ffc504010fe30299c2805\n\n**Technicals Look Good:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nd587x9c1sh61.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=caa23496b03b604c9e61725de25a65c29efe3070\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5bwaqrvc1sh61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbf18ad63b545aa98f10ea184624f970eabc89e6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mn2z8ffd1sh61.png?width=174&format=png&auto=webp&s=45b12e6bebb535c685096c57081c8f64dd5e48e9\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Put/Call Ratio:**\n\nPut Call Ratio is 0.73, meaning that it's tending in the direction of more people betting against it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prediction:**\n\nNegatives & positives both weighted,\n\nI think the Pot Stocks Jump again due to built up anticipation buying.\n\nRight now $SNDL is still trending so much, that another spike and sell-off are inevitable\n\n$SNDL may explode when the stimulus checks are signed (late February) due to robinhooders & the reddit effect (and it being a penny stock)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Speculation:**\n\n$SNDL raised $600m in cash raised with no-debt. They can enter the US market ( though a merger/ acquisition) when marijuana legalizes , and they could find itself in a position to aggressively enter this potentially massive market.\n\nThey have a lot of cash raised and no debt which means tons of room for growth and expansion.\u00a0Until recently,\u00a0$SNDL\u00a0was one of the lesser-known publicly traded cannabis cultivators. Now, after attracting the attention of a swarm of Reddit and Robinhood traders, the company's stock is growing explosively. In fact, its growth was so extreme that Robinhood limited purchases of the stock on January 28 for several days, though the restrictions have since been lifted.\n\nI hope this was helpful. **For more research & due diligence from me:** [https://www.flowcode.com/page/fluentinfinance](https://www.flowcode.com/page/fluentinfinance)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer: do your own research, make your own decisions because nothing is guaranteed, and I am not a financial advisor*", "id": "lkx0tv", "created_utc": 1613453968.0, "score": 388, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "Good DD, I think I'm employing a similar strategy.

(sorry new to this whole market thing and especially options)", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "*Holy shit this got long. Hope someone finds it entertaining.*\n\nSo you understand that when someone buys a call option, they're buying the right to buy 100 shares of an underlying stock at a certain strike price, and when someone buys a put option, they're buying the right to sell 100 shares at a strike price.\n\nIn order for someone to buy those rights, someone has to be on the other side of the trade. Someone selling the call has to provide that underlying stock, and someone selling the put has to put up that price for the stock.\n\nNow why would you want to sell these contracts?\n\nLet's say you're already holding 100 shares of a stock, for example Palantir. And say you love the company, you have big hopes for it long term, and you're planning on holding until it reaches at least $50 a share. It's under $30 a share now.\n\nWell in the option market, people are offering you an extra $X per share now to reserve the right to buy your shares for $50/share by a specific point in time, let's say a month from now. The more likely $50 (the strike price) is, the higher the premium $X is.\n\nSo that's cool. If you take $X * 100 that's nice money in your pocket to essentially put your shares aside for a month. If the price stays under $50 (or $50 plus whatever $X is) the whole time, you keep that premium and have your shares back.\n\nBut if the buyer wants to exercise the contract, they are giving you $50 a share and you're handing over 100 shares, no matter how much they cost on the open market.\n\n\nIf price shot up to $80 on some really good news, that's $30/share you're losing out on. If the stock dumped to $10, you're watching those babies starve. This is called a Covered Call. You might want to do this if the company has a temporary lull, is trading sideways, or at a really steady and predictable pace. You want to protect your investment against risk.\n\nIf you sold those shares due to low prices (or never had them), but a good earnings report drove the price to $70 by that 1 month expiration, well then buddy you might even have to spend $70 a share to sell them back to someone for $50. This is called a Naked Call option.\n\nSelling a put means someone is paying you $X as protection from a significant price drop. Say, if the price drops below $20, you're going to guarantee them that $20/share for their shares.\n\nSo ultimately you're taking the risk of paying too much for some stock and having to own that stock afterward. If the company goes bankrupt, you still have to pay the $2000. This is called a Cash-Secured Put. A Naked Put is the same thing, but where you don't even have the liquid money to spend $20/share to begin with. I would take on a cash secured put for a company I like that I don't mind owning given a discount on the current price. If the price never drops, I now have extra spending money for the next trade.\n\nAs I keep selling contracts over and over again, collecting premium each time, each time I'm lowering the _effective_ amount of money I spend on those 100 shares.\n\nAs you can see, Naked Call and Naked Puts have massive, even infinite risk. You might have to come up with money you don't have, or shares of a skyrocketing stock that you don't even own. With covered calls and cash-secured puts you have risk, but it's defined at certain boundaries.", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for this. You have a great way of explaining it.

It's the same if you had spent $22 on a put.\n\nBuying a call gives you the option to buy 100 shares at a strike, and buying a put gives you the option to sell 100 shares at a strike. But you're not _required_ to do either. You _can_ just let these options expire worthless, or you can sell them back to someone to make a profit (like you did with your T option). Buying/selling those 100 stocks is optional, and honestly it almost never makes sense. 99% of the time the best thing to do with an option you bought is to sell it back before it expires.\n\nExample: If you bought a $20 Put Option for PLTR back when the stock was worth $33 and rising, and it suddenly started going the other direction to like $27, then because the likelihood of it reaching $20 has increased, people will be willing to pay more for that Put.

So as I understand options are not only about the price moves themselves as i thought previously, but also based on the aggregate expectations of the market, right? as it could be the case that even though the price movement was in your favor and you can make a profit by exercising, the option is still worth less than what you paid because further movements are not expected? In that case, if you exercise the option, how does that happen exactly? Does your broker do the buying and selling automatically? And you would need to have enough money in your account to actually buy the shares right?\n\nSorry, i haven't fully wrapped my mind around it yet lol.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Price direction, time to expiration, implied volatility, volume -- all these factors play into the price of the option. Like, speaking of volume, robinhood will show you the mid price of an option, but that could be a spread between a $0.00 bid price and a $1.00 ask price. So while robinhood shows you $0.50, you can't even immediately get out of the trade without losing your full investment or hoping some other sucker comes along eventually. That's why it's important to look at the price spread, looking for a tight one which usually indicates liquidity, meaning it's cheaper to exit the position.\n\nOn exercising, as a _general_ guide it's almost always better to sell the option rather than exercise. \n\n1. If your option is in-the-money near expiration, the premium will always factor in the intrinsic value of the option (the difference between the strike price and actual price) and will have some extra extrinsic value (some \"extra amount\" you're paying for possibility of a price move in your favor). If that wasn't the case, people would just trade in-the-money options for literally free money, like paying $0.50 for an option that is $1 in-the-money and exercising it for equity and a 100% gain. That doesn't happen. If a stock is $10 and you're buying a $9 call option from me, I'm simply not going to sell you that option for less than $1 and change. I could just sell the shares for more.\n\n2. If the option is out-of-the money near expiration, the premium only has extrinsic value. There is no intrinsic value. As the option expires, it becomes worthless, so why not at least collect that $0.01 if there's a buyer out there?\n\nBut if you do exercise your option, you can either do that manually through your broker at any time, or most brokers will do it automatically if you hold the in-the-money option through expiration _and_ you have the buying power to exercise it. I believe you can adjust these defaults by contacting your broker if for some reason you don't want that.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot.

If the stock does tank, you can buy it for cheap on the market and sell it to the poor guy on the other end of the trade for the elevated price (strike price). \n\n-EXTRA DANGER BELOW-\n\nSELLING CALLS/PUTS IS HIGH RISK IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING\n\nThink about buying and selling options like buying and selling insurance or lottery tickets. Would you sell insurance to your neighbor on their house? Do you have the money to buy them a new house if theirs catches fire?\n\nSelling puts - Giving (selling) someone the right to sell 100 shares of their stock to you at a certain price (strike). When the deal is made, you get paid a premium which is your incentive to enter the trade. At the onset of the deal, you know that the strike is, for example, $20 and the multiplier is 100. A responsible put seller sells Cash-Secured Puts (CSP), meaning they understand they are on the hook and might be obligated to buy $2000 of stock. They set that money aside in their brokerage account so the broker can make the transaction if the stock tanks. In this case, ~$2000 is the maximum loss. You did get paid a premium up front, so you could consider the max loss slightly less than $2k. \n\nSelling Calls - Giving (selling) someone the right to buy 100 shares of stock from you at a certain price (strike). When the deal is made, you get paid a premium which is your incentive to enter the trade. At the onset of the deal, you know that the strike is, for example, $40 and the multiplier is 100. A responsible call seller sells Covered Calls, meaning they ALREADY OWN 100 shares of the stock in their brokerage account. That way, the broker can make the transaction if the stock soars and the person on the other end of the trade wants to buy your shares. In this case, the maximum loss is the price you were obligated to sell your 100 stocks for (strike) minus the price you bought the 100 stocks for.  You did get paid a premium up front, so you could consider the max loss slightly less than that amount. You also missed out on the gains that you ordinarily could have profited from. Remember, you had the stock in your account and it skyrocketed. You had to sell it for cheap relative to the market price. \n\nSome people that really know what they are doing, or have no idea what they are doing, sell extremely risky NAKED CALLS. This means they don\u2019t own the shares in the covered call example. Their losses are theoretically unlimited. \n\nAs always, I\u2019m a moron on the internet. Don\u2019t listen to me.

Obviously I disagree, I think his expertise and genuinely passionate drive (as well as his very consistent goals for Tesla/SpaceX) make him something much more than a salesman, and the shallowness implicit therein.\n\n> The hyperloop is a literal pipe dream that will NEVER work\n\nHaven't heard much about hyperloop in recent years, I don't know what his current stance is but I do know he's not directly involved with developing anything related to hyperloop. People are allowed to be wrong about things, and if he is, I don't think it takes away from his other achievements personally. \n\n> Space X and the reusable rocket has not cut the cost of getting payloads into orbit by 20x as he promised.

If you looked at air travel when it was in its infancy and made the same argument you're making now, you would conclude that air travel would never be profitable or cost effective. \n\n> He has not revolutionized battery technology. He\u2019s merely helped move along incremental improvements.\n\nPerhaps, but A) I don't recall him ever saying that his goal was to \"revolutionize battery technology\" (his goal with Tesla is and has always been to encourage the development of EV's as a whole), and B) if it was, revolution does need to begin somewhere, and if it follows the curve of *any* type of technology, it's exponential; progress starts extremely slowly and then rapidly accelerates. \n\n> Commercial air travel via rocket will NEVER be a reality. EVER\n\nAgain I'm curious to see what your stance would be on commercial air travel if you were in, say, the 1910's or so. That being said, you're strangely focusing on what is very much a side prospect for SpaceX (intraplanetary travel). They've made some loose claims/statements about it, but everyone knows SpaceX is focused on orbital and interplanetary flight. Curious why you didn't mention what is effectively their main goal.\n\n> Currently rockets have a 1% failure rate\n\nAgain forming long-term conjecture based on current technology.

It's orders of magnitude less in the latter, and the rate development predictably reflects that. \n\n> He has certainly been a pioneer in POPULARIZING, EV transport.

I never said anything about PTP rocket travel being more economical or efficient than air travel. You keep going down this path despite in my last reply I made it clear I'm not comparing them directly. \n\n> It is fallacious to think that increases in the frequency of rocket launches will inevitably lead to exponential advances in rocket technology. It\u2019s the physics of the problems that led to jet travel being the most popular form of rapid transport over rocketry,\n\nWell that answers my question lol. **I never said anything about rockets being better for rapid transport.** Might happen, certainly with horizontally/air launched rockets like what SPCE is doing, but that's an entirely different discussion. Increases in the frequency of rocket launches *absolutely will* lead to advances in rocket technology and a lower failure rate - **relative to rocket technology, NOT air travel**. I honestly think you would be delusional to think otherwise.

Other than hyperloop? \n\nAnd hyperloop concepts are still being seriously developed; you might need to give a completely brand new technology more than a few years to work out the kinks. But my counter-question is, does having failed visions mean the ones you had that did come to fruition are somehow lesser?

Hear me out first folks. I\u2019m not a Moderna hater (so Moderna investor\u2019s please control yourselves), but let\u2019s do some very simple comparisons of things we know. Moderna #\u2019s -Shares outstanding 395.71M -Public float 326.21M -Short interest 24.8M -Market cap 68.52B -SP $174.20 -EPS -$1.62 -Institutional & Mutual Fund share % as per Yahoo 52.06% Sorrento\u2019s #\u2019s -Shares outstanding 262.94M -Public float 226.99M -Short interest 70.47M -Market cap 3.33B -SP $12.83 -EPS -$1.4B -Institutional & Mutual Fund share % as per Yahoo 27.97% A couple of things stand out right away, but let\u2019s proceed further. Moderna currently has no FDA approved drugs, and 1 EUA approval for its coronavirus vaccine worth up to 8B if the U.S. government takes up all its options. Sorrento currently has no FDA or EUA drugs approved, BUT 2 BLOCKBUSTER drugs that will receive approval sometime this year or 1sr quarter next year. Abivertinib with its multiple indications (Covid, NSCLC, and several others with various trial stages) 10B and SP102 with estimated 6B yearly revenue. Except for assuming Abivertinib covid will receive EUA, I have not even included RTX, GeneMab, shares in various other companies, etc. into my calculations. So WHY is there are a big difference between the two companies SP\u2019s? Easily explained. Short interest. The Hedge Funds and Shorts bet big early last year that Sorrento wouldn\u2019t get to this point in time where Sorrento is on the cusp of having 2 FDA approvals and several possible EUA\u2019s. The Hedge Funds are in to deeply. They bet heavily, and threw everything, but the kitchen sink to halt progress and good PR. From paid hit pieces, to bots, and paid lackeys on the message boards. There was a constant stream which was designed to get you to sell your shares. Plus their algorithm\u2019s that that would continually push the SP down from were it should be. They made Billions off this strategy. GUESS who was steadily upping their shares throughout? The institutions and mutual funds. They benefited from the hedge fund strategy, and were able to increase their shares at much lower prices. THEY INCREASED their shares through the tumult. GUESS what happens to the Hedge Funds, Shorts, and SP when the EUA\u2019s, Approvals, government contracts, etc. start rolling in? BOOM!! Oh one last thing as per shareholders, NIH, AstraZeneca, and Merck all currently or have had major shares in Moderna. Ji stirred Sorrento to this point in time without giving away the ship. The best time to bargain is when you have the upper hand.

{"title": "17 Investment Principles from Warren Buffett and the late Benjamin Graham", "selftext": "While many may argue that value investing doesn't make sense anymore, a lot of the rules and investment principles from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham stand the test of time, especially when you apply current nuance to their original investment rules (which are now close to a century-old)...\n\n**Disclaimer:** The views below represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. These investment principles do not constitute investment advice, but rather are general principles one might employ in reaching his or her overall financial goals. *All* investing bears risk, including possible loss of capital.\n\n**#1 Create a healthy balance in your portfolio between risky and less risky investments**\n\n*\u201cFurthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.\u201d \u2013 quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\nA conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).\n\nBenjamin Graham\u2019s formula for calculating the percentage of assets that should be in risky vs. less-risky investments is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in risky investments (like stocks), with the rest in relatively safer assets like cash and gold. For instance, if you are 35 years old, you might invest 65% of your investible assets (not including savings) into risky assets like stocks and 35% of your investible assets in less volatile assets like cash (USD/euro or another stable currency) and gold. A 70-year-old, on the other hand, would only invest 30% (rather than 65%) of his or her assets in risky investments (like stocks) and the balance in more stable assets like cash (again, assuming the cash is in US dollar, euros or another relatively stable \u201clow\u201d inflation currency.)\n\nBenjamin Graham formula for proper investment portfolio balance:\n\n100 \u2013 your age = risky assets (such as stocks), with the balance in less risky assets\n\nOf note, most of us might categorize real estate investments as safe investments (which may be the case relative to stocks). That said, as Benjamin Graham reminded us over half a century before the 2007-2008 Great Recession, *\u201cUnfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.\u201d* With most financial assets being highly correlated these days due to the high interconnectivity of markets and economies, there are few truly uncorrelated and riskless assets. Real estate prices are as high as ever in 2021 thanks to over a decade of easy monetary policy, along with a dwindling inventory of available homes for sale in the US.\n\n**#2 Have an emergency fund**\n\n*\u201cThe unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\nWe never know when emergencies may strike. We might be fired. Our division at work might be cut. Our spouse or child may experience a significant setback. The 2020 Year from Hell and Covid-19 should remind the world and each of us that disaster can strike at a moment\u2019s notice. We must be prepared for these uncertainties. While volunteering at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), a patient once inadvertently taught the author of this piece, Henry Gindt, to \u201calways expect the unexpected.\u201d This particular patient happened to be in the hospital following a heart attack\u2026in his mid-40s\u2026as a marathon runner. (As a side-note, some of the best life lessons and principles can be learned through volunteering. If 2020 taught us anything, it might be that there are plenty of our fellow men and women out there who could use a helping hand. Find a great volunteer opportunity near me.) \u201cEmergencies\u201d happen all the time in life. Oftentimes these emergencies spill over into the financial side of the house. Vanguard Investments suggests as a rule of thumb to maintain at least 3-6 months of income in such an emergency fund in order to cover things like food, mortgage payments/rent, credit card bills, and ongoing health insurance or COBRA in the event of a lost job. This emergency fund should not be invested except in low-risk securities like US Treasuries.\n\n**#3 Choose ETFs over individual stocks**\n\n*\u201cThere are two ways to be an intelligent investor: by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds; or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\nBroad market ETFs can curb our emotional impulses to buy and sell to some degree as these broad market index funds are less volatile than most any single individual security. The framework around how we might build an optimal portfolio might be to create balance in your portfolio by 1) conducting ongoing and rigorous homework analyzing stocks (\u201cactive investor\u201d) or by selecting a few ETFs and dollar-cost-averaging your investments into these funds over time (see points below). In the Intelligent Investor\u2019s prologue, Warren Buffett reminds us that \u201cWhat\u2019s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.\u201d\n\nStep 1 might be to determine a fixed split between risky and less risky assets as part of your investment portfolio (perhaps using Graham\u2019s formula above based on your age).\n\nStep 2 might then be to select a few US and world market ETFs.\n\nThis approach might be thought of as setting your portfolio on autopilot as Graham suggests. Some example ETFs offering broad market exposure to US markets include ETFs under the tickers SPY (S&P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) and DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global markets and global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX). These ETFs can be purchased through whichever financial app you use: You Invest (JPMorgan), Fidelity, E\\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, or any other.\n\nThis simple framework may likely do the trick in meeting your financial goals (as well as outperforming any active portfolio management you might pursue). See also how the KISS principle might relate to other areas of your life.\n\n**#4 If you insist on owning individual stocks (active investor) vs. ETFs (passive investor), create a well-balanced and diversified portfolio**\n\n*\u201cGraham\u2019s guideline of owning between 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors who want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you are not overexposed to one industry.\u201d Quote from Jason Zweig*\n\nIf you insist on picking your own stocks vs. using a basket of stocks through ETFs, try to have between 10-30 stocks to get the benefit of good diversification and do not choose all of these stocks from the same industry. A well-balanced portfolio means selecting at least 10 stocks from at least 3 or 4 different industries, according to Graham. For instance, you might balance some investments in high-growth technology sectors with conservative non-cyclical companies that likely pay dividends and have stable growth such as the best healthcare and insurance companies (what some think of as \u201cboring\u201d companies). Experts disagree on how many stocks you must own to have a well-diversified portfolio, but the benefits of diversification tend to experience diminishing marginal benefit as you go over 30 stocks. Additionally, your life becomes increasingly complicated if you are actively managing 30+ stocks. Hedge fund professionals spend 100% of their work time focused on tracking their investments. Do you have time to dedicate 40-60 hours+/ week on researching and monitoring your portfolio? If so, and for advanced investors, including hedge fund traders, you might read Benjamin Graham\u2019s textbook Security Analysis. It is quite amazing how few professional investors on Wall Street and elsewhere have ever read Security Analysis. Graham reminds us that:\n\n*There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor\u2019s favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss\u2014not that loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business.*\n\n**#5 Don\u2019t overpay for stocks (or real-estate investments, cryptocurrency or any other investment)**\n\n*\u201cThe investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month period.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\nDon\u2019t overpay for stocks just because momentum is good for the moment. In fact, Graham suggested paying an average P/E multiple of 12-13 across an intelligent investor\u2019s portfolio with a maximum P/E of 15 for any individual security. While these P/E ratios are likely overly conservative and represent outdated valuation rules of thumb in the era of pre-rapid technology innovation/adoption and hyper-globalization, one shouldn\u2019t simply ignore a company\u2019s current and future earnings prospects in assigning a value. Benjamin Graham reminds us that \u201cthe time everyone decides that a given industry is \u2018obviously\u2019 the best one to invest in, the prices of its stocks \\[or other assets\\] have been bid up so high that its future returns have nowhere to go but down.\u201d (See points below on analyzing company fundamentals including both value and growth). If you are investing in some of the latest technology stocks or household name companies like Tesla, Uber, AirBNB, Poshmark, etc., you might notice that the P/E multiple is either non-existent or extremely high. This is because the company is not yet earning much (or any) profit. Instead, the market is valuing the company based on its growth profile which, over time, assuming all goes according to plan, will turn into healthy earnings and profit. However, the second the growth assumptions are tweaked by equity research analysts on Wall St. (or a string of bad news hits the company, its industry or the market overall), the initial rosy valuation assumptions of these high-growth/loss-making companies will swiftly be revised downwards, leading to an almost immediate or rapid decline in value. The collapse in value of your securities and investments will be at least twice as painful as the pleasure from the ride up, according to world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Importantly, never forget that the rosy growth assumptions under which are investing today may experience a sharp reversal when you have ceased actively monitoring these investments months or years later. Even if you choose to become an active investor (rather than a passive investor primarily invested in ETFs), by the time the bad news hits, the damage will already be done due to the rapid price movements following breaking news.\n\nGraham and many other notable investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, billionaire and founder of the investment firm Baupost Group, often speak of creating \u201cmargin of safety\u201d when making investments by buying significantly below a company\u2019s intrinsic value. This built-in \u201cpricing buffer\u201d creates some wiggle room and margin for when things don\u2019t work out as planned, as they inevitably do in both financial markets and life more generally. Graham tells us that \u201cIf the purchases are made at the average level of the market over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more than average risk of diminished earning power.\u201d In other words, Graham himself speaks to the value of dollar-cost-averaging, where the intelligent investor is consistently buying over time, during good times, as well as during bad times.\n\nThe Acorns investment app is an interesting app that can help smooth the average \u201cbuy-in price\u201d to avoid concentrating investments when markets are hot and selling when markets are depressed by trickling in investments consistently every day/week/month without any active engagement\u2026over decades. This \u201cdollar-cost-averaging\u201d approach is likely a much better approach for most all of us in the long run, particularly those of us with a few decades to go until retirement. Consider using investment apps like Acorns or talk to your investment advisor about dollar-cost averaging your investments each week or month.  **This is NOT a plug for Acorns specifically - only for the importance of dollar-cost-averaging. If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**\n\n**#6 Focus on the \u201cfundamentals\u201d (earnings and growth) assuming you choose to be an active investor as opposed to a passive investor**\n\n*\u201cExperience has shown that in most cases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the assets lose most of their reputed value.\u201d Benjamin Graham*\n\nCompanies like Amazon, Google and Apple are now worth over $1 trillion each as their earnings power is so solid and market dominance so secure (for now). In the case of Google, for example, the company prints billions of dollars annually from Google Ads alone. When selecting individual stocks, focus on the earnings power and repeatability of those earnings in a normal year (\u201cnormalized earnings\u201d). Also, pay close attention to the company\u2019s growth prospects. Growth is a much more important factor in the 2020s due to the current pace of globalization compared with Benjamin Graham\u2019s era where markets weren\u2019t as interconnected and the United States market offered nearly all the great investment opportunities in his day.\n\nGraham\u2019s formula for selecting growth-oriented companies (as opposed to value-oriented companies below) is Value = Current (Normal) Earnings \u00d7 (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate), where the annual growth rate can reasonably be expected from the company for at least 7 to 10 years. This formula might be revised to reflect current growth and technology assumptions. However, having some sort of investment formula (which perhaps you develop) as a guide might come in handy as much today as it did in 1949. If you can hold yourself to this investment formula, you might avoid serious mistakes. You might also stress test each of your stock investment ideas (or investment formula) with 2-3 trusted advisers to gain an \u201coutside view.\u201d\n\nFor more value-oriented investments, Graham lists 7 key requirements:\n\n1. Adequate size\n2. Sufficiently strong financial condition\n3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years\n4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years\n5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings\n6. Price of stock no more than 1\u00bd times net asset value\n7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.\n8. In developing your own formula for investing in today\u2019s markets, you might take some example key requirements above and revise them to fit your investment strategy.\n\n**#7 Have patience. (This is hard. Very hard. Extremely hard.)**\n\n*\u201cA defensive investor runs\u2014and wins\u2014the race by sitting still. Patience is the fund investor\u2019s single most powerful ally.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham.*\n\nWhen markets are panicking and you don\u2019t know what to do, do nothing. Panicking only makes matters worse as you try to sell or make other rash decisions. The Intelligent Investor is patient and knows that the best investment holding period is forever, followed by a lifetime, followed by 30 years, followed by 10 years, followed by 3-5 years, followed by at least 1 year in order to reap the capital gains tax benefits (see point below on optimizing taxes). Benjamin Graham reminds us that *\u201cIn the financial markets, the worse the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be.\u201d*\n\n**#8 Set rules for when to sell**\n\n*\u201cReversals \\[of fortune\\] will have more meaning for the active than for the passive investor. But they suggest that even defensive portfolios should be changed from time to time, especially if the securities purchased have an apparently excessive advance and can be replaced by issues much more reasonably priced.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\n*It may be assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or 30% profit will work out best as applied to many holdings.\u201d Quotes from Benjamin Graham*\n\nSet rules for when to sell such as after a certain time period has elapsed (say 2-5 years) or profit goal or loss limit has been reached. Instituting rules such as selling all securities at a 30%/50%/100%/3x etc. profit (or at a 10%/30% loss to cap losses) can take some of the emotion out of investing. Make sure whatever specific goal you set when making the investment in a stock(s) or other security aligns with your long-term financial goals. Setting rules on the front-end that align well with your overall long-term financial goals should include setting rules for both downside scenarios and upside scenarios. The best financial and investment apps are pretty good about making it easy to set \u201cstop losses\u201d or sell at a predetermined profit level. We might also be reminded by Benjamin Graham\u2019s most famous student, Warren Buffett, about the two key rules of avoiding loss of principal so that you can stay in the game: #1 Don\u2019t lose money and #2 See rule #1.\n\nSome of the best online trading apps and investment apps include Fidelity, E\\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, You Invest (JPMorgan), Charles Schwab and Ally Invest. If you don\u2019t have time to do the arduous and consistent research required on the 10-30 stocks in your balanced investment portfolio, a better approach is to use the Acorns app which automates your investments into the most well-known and diversified ETFs from Vanguard.  **If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**\n\n**#9 Don\u2019t chase the latest shining star**\n\n*\u201cWhat you don\u2019t do is as important to your success as what you do. The lesson is clear: Don\u2019t just do something, stand there. It\u2019s time for everyone to acknowledge that the term \u2018long-term investor\u2019 is redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is. Someone who can\u2019t hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a time is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\nDon\u2019t jump on the latest stock or other \u201chot\u201d investment bandwagon. If the stock is front-page news all over the world and is skyrocketing, it is 9 times out of 10 too late to get onboard for profit. Momentum plays a big role in stock prices in the short term, but over the long run, a company is valued on its earnings and growth trajectory. Oftentimes, technology companies receive such a lofty valuation based on future growth expectations, such as Tesla\u2019s historic rise in 2020. If growth does not end up meeting these expectations, you can expect a company\u2019s publicly traded valuation to decline as quickly as it rose. \n\n**#10 Ignore \u201cthe charts\u201d**\n\n*\u201cIf you look at a large quantity of data long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge\u2014if only by chance.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\nThe only metrics you should be focused on are the fundamentals of the company (earning and growth). Many investors these days are fixated on \u201cthe charts\u201d such as various moving averages. These are all non-sense. These charts are simply reflections of the latest emotion of an entire market consisting of billions of people reacting to the latest positive or negative news. Ignore these human emotions masquerading as indicators and charts. They will not serve you well in the end. Benjamin Graham refers frequently to the stock market as the emotional and moody \u201cMr. Market,\u201d which is subject to the daily whims and emotions of\u2026the people trading the stocks on the market. Are there market dislocations and can some investors make money by spotting those temporary market anomalies and market dislocations? Sure. Can they do so repeatedly and consistently over time such that they beat the overall stock market? Many experts think not. In fact, Barrons\u2019 research showed that hedge funds only beat the market by an average of 1.5% annually over the past 20 years. After subtracting the 2% annual fees these investment managers charge the pensions and endowments which are their own investors, they lose money. Think you can beat the average hedge fund manager? Statistically, it\u2019s possible. For a while. Until you don\u2019t. See later points on automating portions (or a substantial amount) of your investments. As humans, we all like crunching data and seeking out patterns. It\u2019s usually not wise in the realm of public markets investing.\n\n**#11 Look for large undervalued companies**\n\n*\"The market is fond of making mountains out of molehills. If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will undervalue\u2014relatively, at least\u2014companies that are out of favor because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.\" - Quote from Benjamin Graham.*\n\nHunt for true bargains. Graham defines a true bargain as a company that is currently trading at a 50% or more discount from its inherent/intrinsic value. For instance, Facebook was a good example of an interesting investment opportunity for growth at a reasonable price (GARP) during the major market crash in 2020 and when the company made global headlines for it\u2019s privacy issues. See the referenced two major dips on Google Finance here. The global food giant Wal-Mart provides another good example of a value-oriented investment with a healthy long-term dividend. Wal-Mart was trading in the low $80s/ share in 2018 when Amazon was soaring. Check Wal-Mart today. As conventional wisdom goes, markets tend to overcorrect during negative news cycles and overbuy/overpay when the sky is blue, the sun is out and wind behind the sails is plentiful.\n\n**#12 Expect market volatility (and have nerves of steel during this time)**\n\n*\u201cIn any case the investor may as well resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more from their high point at various periods in the next five years.*\n\n*In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.\u201d Quotes from Benjamin Graham*\n\nManage your emotions. If you can\u2019t (like most all of us), read the following two points on micromanaging investments and market volatility. Re-read them. Then, re-read them again. Jason Zweig points to the work of world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, whose studies have shown that we experience negative emotions and pain from loss twice as intensely as we experience joy and pleasure from gain. This \u201closs aversion\u201d principle applies not only to financial markets but to many aspects of life. You might check out Daniel Kahneman\u2019s bestseller Thinking Fast and Slow to dig deeper into these psychological forces that influence how we react and behave every day. Markets will inevitably decline, sometimes by as much as 50% or more. Remain focused on the long-run by having nerves of steel. Remember the 2007-2008 Great Recession and the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic and analyze those stock market dips in the context of current market prices. Graham reminds us that:\n\n*For indeed, the investor\u2019s chief problem\u2014and even his worst enemy\u2014is likely to be himself. (\u201cThe fault, dear \\[investor/Brutus\\], is not in our stars\u2014\\[and not in our stocks\\]\u2014but in ourselves\u2026.\u201d \u2013 William Shakespeare). We have seen much more money made and kept by \u201cordinary people\u201d who were temperamentally well suited for the investment process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-market lore.*\n\n**#13 Do not micromanage your investments**\n\n*\u201cIt is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds (less risky) to stocks (more risky) in the investor\u2019s portfolio.\u201d- Quote from Benjamin Graham.*\n\nAvoiding micromanaging of investments ties into the point above on keeping emotions in check. You might focus on rebalancing your portfolio between risky and less risky assets 1-2 times/ year rather than choosing new stocks endlessly throughout the year. Graham proposes a rule of thumb for maintaining a split in your portfolio of 100 \u2013 your age in risky assets (like stocks) and the balance in less risky assets like treasuries, cash and gold. Spending your time balancing and rebalancing your investment portfolio 1-2 times a year, for instance, is likely far better than readjusting your portfolio daily or weekly, which is a common investment mistake made by the best of us and is largely based on human emotion and current market news and headlines rather than based on sound financial analysis.\n\nDon\u2019t overreact to the headlines. Everyone sees the headline and sells or buys depending on whether the headline was positive or negative. Challenge yourself to take a strong mental note (or better yet keep a log of your notes) and consider the particular headline in light of all the other news and headlines the next time you rebalance your portfolio (at most 1-2x/ year). Ben Graham reminds us that *\u201cmost businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies\u2019 performance like a hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time. Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal.\u201d* In other words, you might take a contrarian approach when looking for interesting market dislocations.\n\n**#14 Automate. Automate. Automate.**\n\n*\u201cIt is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor\u2019s portfolio.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\n*\u201cIf your investment horizon is long\u2014at least 25 or 30 years\u2014there is only one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and whenever else you can spare some money.\u201d Quote from Jason Zweig.*\n\nChoose a financial investment app like Acorns to mechanize and automate the process of investing. If you are starting out investing in your 20s or 30s, you will have plenty of decades for the markets to work for you. You might trickle in however much you can afford in order to make these investments consistently. The beauty of Acorns is you can set up a recurring investment (of say $100 per week) without having to actively remember to invest daily/weekly/monthly. A unique feature of Acorns is that you can link your credit cards so that for every purchase you make, the \u201cpurchase amount\u201d is rounded up to the next dollar and instantaneously invested in a broad set of index funds. Further, you can decide whether the funds are invested in broad index funds falling into a conservative, moderate, or aggressive approach, depending on your age and financial goals. Benjamin Graham explains the concept of \u201cdollar-cost-averaging\u201d (the approach used by the financial investment app Acorns), in the following way\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\n*\u201cThe third is the device of \u201cdollar-cost averaging,\u201d which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings.\u201d*\n\n*You might also consider using a personal financial app like Mint from Intuit or Plaid to manage your overall financial goals, which offer tools and features like a personal budget planner, credit monitoring, and \u201ctrack my spending.\u201d*\n\n**#15 Never forget the reason for investing in the first place**\n\n*\u201cAfter all, the whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to meet your own needs.\u201d Quote from Jason Zweig.*\n\nMany investors focus on either getting rich or making more money than their peers or simply beating the stock market averages. These investors tend to lose sight of the overall purpose of investing. Focus on your unique goals for investing as it relates to your unique financial situation. Are you trying to meet your and your family\u2019s financial needs for this month or this year? Are you on the verge of retirement? Are you in the prime of your career? Each person\u2019s financial situation is unique because the timing of our financial needs depends on our situation. However, all of us might benefit from reminding ourselves why we invest in the first place. Separate from investing, it\u2019s also worth considering how much of our time we\u2019re willing to trade in order to earn money, oftentimes to buy things we don\u2019t need to impress people we don\u2019t care about impressing in the first place. Time is the most valuable asset for anyone. Invest as much as you can in yourself through ongoing education, learning, and spending time with friends and family. In terms of your financial goals, specifically, see the point above on finding and using one of the best personal finance apps like Mint or Plaid.\n\n**#16 Understand the definition of the phrase \u201clong-term\u201d investments (as well as long-term financial goals)**\n\n*\u201cPsychologists have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the long run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes.\u201d Quote from Benjamin Graham*\n\nTry to think about the \u201clong-run\u201d in blocks of 10/20/30/50 years from now, depending on your age. The two most glaring examples of \u201cshort-term\u201d market disruptions in the context of true \u201clong-term\u201d investments or \u201clong-term\u201d personal or financial goals might be the 2007-2008 Great Recession or the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic (see also WHO). While both crises were undoubtedly severe during the time, markets typically recover within a decade or less. Why is this? If you consider that \u201cthe stock market\u201d is simply a marketplace for buying and selling ownership interests in companies and that you can own a small sliver of the US or world economy through broad market ETFs, it might not be surprising that over time there will be growth. The aggregate of companies nearly always grows over time because the global population of people is growing and collectively building and creating new cities, companies, patents, inventions, ideas, etc. Companies routinely collapse and fall out of the various stock market indices while other companies soar. Some recent examples include Tesla being incorporated into the S&P 500 in 2020 on the one hand while GE was delisted from the S&P 500 in 2018 as the last of the original members of the exchange and replaced by Walgreens on the other hand. Walgreens itself may ultimately fall (or be diminished) due to competition from Amazon, which is rolling out a healthcare platform of its own with online pharmacy delivery following the acquisition of PillPack.) You might track how some of the best consumer startups from 2021 or social media 3.0 startups are doing in the year 2030. Some of these companies may appear on the Nasdaq and be household names. Others might be totally forgotten. These concrete examples of market forces represent the most authoritative definition of American capitalism or American innovation. One of Henry Gindt\u2019s colleagues characterized the United States as the largest business incubator the world has ever known.\n\nYou can gain exposure to this collective economic growth in the United States through broad market ETFs like SPY (S&P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) or DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX) which all track the collective global stock market and have close to zero fees. Benjamin Graham tells us that \u201cthe intelligent investor has no interest in being temporarily right.\u201d\n\n**#17 Tax optimize by holding investments for at least one year to reap benefits of the lower capital gains tax rate**\n\n\"*Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\" \u2013 Quote from Benjamin Franklin in 1789*\n\nThe long-term capital gains tax rate for 2020-2021 is 15% for most single tax filers, but is 0% if annual income is below $80,000 and 20% if annual income is over $441,450. See the IRS page on capital gains for more detail. Aside from incurring high transaction costs from daily (or otherwise frequent) stock trading, when you sell an investment prior to holding that investment for at least one year, your profit will be subject to your typical income tax rate rather than the lower capital gains tax rates above.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The views above represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham.

That's important to understand now with social media and phone apps. We are in a revolutionary time for investing. Value principles are extremely important, perhaps more than ever, but cannot be utilized to full advantage if we ignore the mindset of millions of new retailers like me. Many of us have spent time and effort learning as much from books and sources prior to the pandemic, and then jumped in when the gettin' was good. Most people are trying to make a quick buck. And me too. I've had an easy time. Too easy. Masses of people are giving in to emotion and speculation. I know better, but I abandoned my margin of safety to buy a stock on Friday that's up almost 100%. Had I bought a week earlier I'd be up 200%. My portfolio is high risk because I require growth (see: poor). The plan is to funnel worth while winnings into long term value. We can dabble in different schools of thought and change from one investing environment to another where there is an advantage. The power of value investing and compound interest is enduring, but it hasn't been as profitable since 08. The question now is: Are there enough retailers joining the market to sustain incoming cash flow even when the tide goes out? Will optimism and fear make up for the economic reality. Will  an eventual rise in interest rates depress growth, or will people pile in anyways? I think we've just begun democratizing markets, and millions of people will join the market every year for years to come. Behavioral economics has trampled value. It always comes to this. We spend 2/3 of our time in bull markets. Human nature, need, and hope will push more people into stocks more consistently than before.

No, it's not like making bread and just multiply by the amount of the available money. I always assume the Tesla executives are much smarter than us - the poor apes and I think this is a reasonable approach since they've proved to be much more capable in business than some random small investors like us here.\n2. Even during the earnings call the Tesla executives explained that the raise of the capital will be ALSO used as a 'war chest',  in case something goes wrong, in case there is new crisis in 2021, in case the markets crash etc.\n3.

Some people are turned away but many others (crypto fans) are attracted, so it's not clear what the balance of the forces is\n5. First, Tesla is a Company, then it's a tech or whatever company. As a company they have many things except the core business that they need to take into account, for example - their balance sheets. Meet Kevin had one very good video speculating that having Bitcoin could be a huge boost in improvement of their balance sheets because of the different way it's accounted and taxed. They could literally save hundreds of millions of dollars of taxes because of this move.\n6. Crypto is now too widely adopted to be just thrown away. Once there is too much money in something (critical mass) it can't just go away because some people are not getting it and because it cannot be controlled by governments as easy as printing paper money. Tesla is not alone, it's just the biggest public company in Bitcoin and it's the biggest just because of its massive run up in the last months.\n\nSo, this is what I can summarize, but I don't see a single effort in defending the opposite thesis.

Finally, when out of valid arguments, those YouTube priests claim bitcoin is too big to fail.\n\nCan you find the pattern? It's a scam. The largest speculative scam of all time. A tool which only useful purpose is illegal activities. \n\nWant to put a value on bitcoin? Simple, just value it as the best tool to fuck up the world by allowing easier illegal transactions, for arms and drugs, ransomware, pedophilia, money laundering, etc. Hey, considering how much money goes through that, perhaps bitcoin value is justified!

{"title": "The Commodity Super-cycle trade: A macro DD with special focus on industrial metals", "selftext": "\u201cCommodities? What the hell is that?\u201d asks the GME Ape, used to blockbusters stocks and phone companies from the 90s. We are talking oil, natural gas, industrial and precious metals, corn, GOURDS, etc. Got it? You don\u2019t want to mess with commodity futures? No problem, there are more than enough stocks and ETFs proxies through which you can place your bets. But before tackling tickers, let\u2019s talk fundamentals and let me lay out the bullish case for commodities, specifically industrial metals (steel\ud83d\ude32, copper, aluminum, rare earth metals).\n\n# Commodity Super-cycle?\n\nCommodities go through cycles of booms and bust, following economic cycles of activity, and inflation. Growth and inflation make commodities go uppies, and recessions or periods of slower economic growth, coupled with deflationary pressures, make commodities go tits up. Specifically, commodities tend to rise rapidly when the economy goes into \u201coverdrive\u201d mode, so towards the second half of economic expansions. This is because as the economy accelerates, the supply for raw materials can\u2019t keep up with the demand, leading to price escalations up to a point where demand has to correct abruptly, causing a recession. Then, commodity prices free fall as the economy goes through deflation, and investment typically shifts towards innovation and disruptive tech, preparing for the new cycle. Then, the economy eventually recovers and starts to slowly pick up speed, and the new cycle is in. You can see that post-2000 (coinciding more or less with the pop of the .com bubble), was the start of a rally in commodities (**Chart 1).**\n\n**Chart 1: US commodity price index 1795 to present** (as of August 2020)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmz5xuox7ph61.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a262060bed4870cf4bc0834a46f71d5ccd5fa21\n\nWhy was that? We were coming out of a pretty long period of economic deflationary stability and then accelerated going into the 2000s. As inflation started to pick up, investment flew out of tech and into commodities, given the demand for them was massive. There was massive GDP growth coming from the BRICS, the .com tech creating more jobs and more income/household, and massive lending growth backed by the US housing market (the economy was leveraged to the tits); all this strong, *tangible* (this is crucial, more on that later) economic activity generated a lot of demand for raw materials as houses and factories were built, cars were manufactured, cities rose all around the world (particularly in Asia), and so commodity prices went uppies. Of course, the economy was overleveraged, and like most FDs you hold for too long, it went tits up real quick at the expiration date. The recession post-GFC sent commodities down, and when there was economic recovery, commodities stayed pretty low. Why was that? Deflationary pressures coming from a risk-averse banking system and an increasingly efficient, high tech-driven economy could be a place to start. But from a cycle perspective, this was still the first half of the economic expansion following the recession, and there was still too much deflation for commodities to pick up real momentum. Of course, when March 2020 hit and everything went tits up, what little momentum commodities had was instantly lost as the entire world economy went through a massive deflationary bust. Suddenly, nothing moved, and nothing was built, and so there was barely any demand for commodities. But now that we begin to recover from the pandemic, are things any different than they were prior to it? If before the dreadful 2020 commodities were cheap, why would they begin to rally in 2021?\n\nI\u2019ll begin by analyzing what is going on right now with commodities from a technical perspective, and then I\u2019ll give you what I think is the *why* behind it? Sounds good? Let\u2019s dive into it then.\n\n# What\u2019s the technical outlook?\n\nBeing guilty of serious crayon-eating to the point of literally shitting colors every weekend, I never build a thesis without some technical ANALysis, so let\u2019s look at a few charts to see where we are in the cycle technically, and then I\u2019ll make the fundamental argument for the industrial metals reversal. **Chart 1** showed that we are at exceptionally low price levels, and it also shows that commodities don\u2019t tend to stay at those prices very long. However, is a reversal going on right now? For this, no need to go back to Napoleonic Wars, let\u2019s just look at the last decade or so. There is in fact a technical reversal in commodities going on, and it would be confirmed if we get above 90-100 on the BCOM (**Chart 2**). The *Coom*berg Commodity Index tracks commodity prices.\n\n**Chart 2:** ***Coom*****berg Commodity Index (BCOM)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjfw2vma8ph61.jpg?width=1826&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ad8c833da4702d11cbb358c90ed909ac5c8c63d\n\nLet\u2019s have a look now at some specifics, namely industrial metals. Commodities tend to move in unison, so it is expected from steel (and, in the case of an index, companies working along the steel supply chain) to have a similar price action to the BCOM. Indeed, you can see on **Chart 3** that it\u2019s the same breakout of the multi-year trend.\n\n**Chart 3:** **ARCA Steel Index (STTL)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ub7trgae8ph61.jpg?width=1833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0ff90918a5ba4ee9235b843a8f814bf96fee621\n\nWhat about copper? Yeah, the same thing, but more extended than its industrial metal peers (**Chart 4**), due to the fact there has been quite a few strikes going on causing a supply shock, but I also believe people understood the vital role of copper in the EV industry and in de-carbonization (more on that later) a few months before they realized most industrial metals were going to go along the same path.\n\n**Chart 4:** **US Copper Index Fund (CPER)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2bwl1t5i8ph61.jpg?width=1820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=899bc4e45465edda59e86dd73a987a4a364a93d9\n\nAs you would expect, other industrial metals, such as aluminum, follow similar patterns. While WSB was screeching GME (except Steel Bros, you guys nailed it), industrial metals were rallying, and are now at their inflection point, or past it (in the case of copper for example). So why is any of this happening? While we\u2019re still on a crayon-eating binge, let\u2019s have a look at the 5-yr forward inflation expectations chart (**Chart 5**). Ok, so consumers and businesses are expecting prices to increase at a higher rate 5 years from now, and believe inflation will be over 2% in 2025. Do you see a similarity with the BCOM? That\u2019s because commodities and inflation go hand in hand, as I explained previously. While inflation is not sitting over 2% right now, it is expected to be in the future and commodity traders and hedge funds are already placing their bets, so the market is adjusting ahead of time, as it should.\n\n**Chart 5:** **5-yr Forward Inflation Expectation Rate**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pp39er5m8ph61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=543768ae6d5f09e89eb809ba7c4985707db69ab1\n\nBut isn\u2019t inflation good for all equities? If we were to rely solely on inflation expectations, why would commodities be a better move than say, tech? My belief is that the huge rally that has been going on with Big Tech for years was fueled by deflation, not inflation. Our economy has only become more and more efficient given all of the technological innovation that has been going on (think of automation), leaving people out of work with less income and driving prices down. This is good for tech, but it is rather deflationary, so when I hear inflation expectations are up significantly, it makes me rather neutral to bearish on tech, and much more bullish on commodities. For now, let\u2019s have a look at **Chart 6**, a ratio between the S&P500 and the PPI (the log of that actually). The way to interpret this is the following: when the ratio is going up, stocks, in general, are beating commodities, and when it is going down, commodities are beating stocks. Obviously, this excludes stocks which revenues rely on commodities since those stocks would typically be up when commodities are up (ex: metal processing stocks, mining stocks, etc.). Periods of inflation are better for commodities than for stocks, and vice-versa for deflationary phases. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean stocks will go down when inflation runs higher, but commodities will tend to outperform the market. One extreme case of this was the .com bubble pop, which immediately made commodities more attractive than stocks, and coincided with the start of an inflationary period that lasted until around the GFC.\n\n**Chart 6:** **S&P 500/PPI (log)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me3zn6sq8ph61.jpg?width=1372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f73bf6327287e80202491966eb1d8da994337d40\n\nSo by looking at this chart, seeing that we have been in a prolonged period of relative deflation, recognizing that equities are pretty overextended as of right now compared to commodities, and noting that inflation expectations are up (meaning a new wave of inflation might be forming ahead), I would argue that solely based on this there exists an arbitrage opportunity: short tech, long commodities. But shorting tech is rather wild, and if you are a conflicted bull that knows the tech rally must be approaching its end but you won\u2019t go full u/Variation-Separate, you might as well just long commodities while reducing your tech exposure, or at least add some of that sweet sweet *coom*modity to your folio as a hedge.\n\nThis concludes our technical analysis for now. Congrats if you\u2019ve made it this far and managed to keep your rectum intact, you\u2019ve survived. Now, why is this taking place now? In other words, why are inflation expectations up now, as opposed to a year or two from now? Why is the BCOM breaking out of its multi-year downtrend right now, while we\u2019re still mostly on lockdown when it\u2019s been falling for years under a \u201cnormal\u201d economy? Calling a bottom is as hard as calling a top, but while sometimes bubbles pop out of sheer exhaustion, it is rarer for prices to rebound after years of downtrend without any catalyst. So what\u2019s the catalyst then? Is it just Grandpa Buyden and his big, long, and beautiful stimulus, or is there something else?\n\n# What\u2019s the fundamental outlook?\n\nNow comes the juicy part. This is the sauce, this is what you came looking for and this is what will hopefully give you the confirmation bias you need and deserve. The question we must ask ourselves is the following: are the conditions for a commodity rally, more precisely in industrial metals, met or be met in the near future?\n\nIn other words, is there right now or will there be in the near future a supply and demand imbalance in industrial metals? If we look at the charts, it appears there is one, given the rally we\u2019ve had in the past weeks, but this could just be speculation, right? Or maybe there was one, but now it\u2019s all priced in? I\u2019ll try to give you reasons for the current imbalance, as well as reasons for further imbalances in the future that will likely end up causing a multi-year rally similar to ones before (think 1970s, 2000s). The reasons are the following: Buyden\u2019s Stimulus Plan, \u201cGoing Green\u201d, China\u2019s Infrastructure Spending, China\u2019s Accumulation of Metals, India increasing CapEx spending, Wealth Redistribution Policies and Years of Low CapEx in the Commodity Complex. I\u2019ll split these into 2 groups, the demand side, and the supply side.\n\n# Demand\n\n**-Buyden\u2019s Stimulus Plan and \u201cGoing Green\u201d**\n\nNow, I know bears will say this is blasphemy. They will say fiscal policy won\u2019t spur inflation; no matter how much spending, the government has never had any success creating inflation and it won\u2019t this time either. I hear you and I agree, untargeted and irresponsible spending has never had any success in generating any kind of sustainable inflation. But are we going to ignore the fact that this is 1.9 trillion + another 2 trillion for infrastructure? Are we going to ignore the fact that Yellen believes this can achieve FULL EMPLOYMENT by 2022? Full employment people, in one year. This would be an economy on fucking steroids, and the price of going into full employment in such a short period of time is inflation. I just can\u2019t see supply being able to adjust to such an increase in household income in such a short period of time, that is if full employment is really to be achieved. Now, full employment could be a pipe dream, it could be yet again another game Yellen is playing to get inflation expectations moving and banks lending, but the sheer possibility of it is enough for the economy to move in that direction. Full employment would be the \u201coverdrive\u201d mode I talked about previously, and that would set the stage for a big rally in commodities. Let me also add that some republicans who opposed Buyden\u2019s plan did so on grounds that it would cause runaway inflation and that such a risk outweighed all of its benefits. It\u2019s all politics, so it doesn\u2019t mean anything on its own, but it can give some idea of the magnitude of how much spending is going on.\n\nRegarding industrial metals like steel, copper, aluminum, and even silver, Buyden\u2019s infrastructure spending is of course bullish. 52% of all steel produced ends up being used for infrastructure projects, so the infrastructure plan aiming at \u201cre-building\u201d a \u201cgreener\u201d US is very bullish for steel. New infrastructure, new housing, new buildings and facilities of all kinds is obviously very good for industrial metals. The fact it is meant to be a \u201cgreen\u201d plan is particularly bullish for copper (think of batteries, wiring, etc.), which has already strongly reacted to this. This in itself is good, but I think it has the potential to have much more growth because it might initiate a bigger modernization wave across all industries, as they strive to \u201cgo green\u201d. Just like the US, I can see governments around the world taking the same path; not only because it is good politically as more and more people care about the planet, but because it is a matter of remaining competitive in the future world economy. The automobile industry is going through this change, and ALREADY there is a supply problem. Everybody speaks about the semiconductor shortage, but I think this is just a symptom of a much larger supply issue that is looming ahead. Think about all the factories semiconductor producers will have to build from the ground up to meet demand in the coming years. Some won\u2019t be ready before 2025. What about the famous Elon\u2019s battery gigafactories? Approximately 100 of them will be necessary to supply the entire world with clean energy according to his autist brain (love you Papa), and I assume it is only to meet the current world\u2019s energy demand (wait until India, and eventually Latin America, finalize their industrialization). How many other ambitious projects similar to these will come in the future given all the investment that has been pouring into tech for nearly a decade? What I\u2019m getting at here is that \u201cgoing green\u201d will cause a \u201cstructural change in demand\u201d (quoting Goldman; I typically inverse them, but not this time lol) for industrial metals as there will be A LOT of changes in manufacturing infrastructure, and a good part of it will have to be built from scratch.\n\nThis isn\u2019t related to going green, but what about all the innovation going on with 3D printing? Eventually, there will be large 3D printers that will print-out houses and buildings, but they will necessitate gigantic factories to build them so they can build other buildings. You find that funny don\u2019t you? It\u2019s going to fucking happen dude, someday. No, but seriously, all of the crazy innovation that has been going on during the last deflationary years, all of the ARK shit, all of that will eventually have to be built using unconventional and new manufacturing, meaning, you guessed it, more manufacturing infrastructure will have to be built from scratch, causing inflation in industrial metals since the demand will largely outpace the supply like it happens every fucking time. And that\u2019s the super-cycle. It\u2019s the supply of material resources of one economic phase not being able to keep up with the innovation-driven demand from the previous phase, causing prices to escalate during the growth phase. It happened in the 1970s, it happened in the 2000s, and it\u2019ll happen again, sooner rather than later imo.\n\n\\-**Gyna: Doubling down on infrastructure spending and accumulating industrial metals**\n\nSay what you will about the china men, but they know what\u2019s up. They understood before anyone that transitioning into a sustainable, greener economy was not nearly as much a moral duty as it was the premise for economic competitiveness. Only now is the US beginning to catch up to what China has been doing for years: invest in infrastructure to enable the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy. When the rest of the world was caught up in the GFC mess, instead of having to prop up its financial system, China invested even more in infrastructure and construction jobs. Regarding metals\u2019 accumulation, it is perfectly understandable. They must think they will need them in the future and that they will be much more valuable a few years from now, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be accumulating and producing them like crazy. In the case of crude steel production, China\u2019s production accounted for 53.3% of the world\u2019s production in 2019 versus 46.6% in 2009. They have been ramping up production (probably in anticipation of a surge in demand), and I don\u2019t want to bet against them because, so far, they seem to know what they\u2019re doing.\n\n**-India to increase CapEx spending**\n\nDid you forget about India, the second-largest country by population size? New roads, new power grids, new rails, new pipelines, new housing, and new healthcare infrastructure are part of the Indian government\u2019s plan to augment the country\u2019s infrastructure as part of the Union Budget for 2021-22. Most of the country is still rural, and therefore lacks infrastructure, a problem the government is attempting to fix by increasing capital expenditure spending. Do you see what is going on? World leaders are killing 2 birds with one stone here. They are using infrastructure spending as a springboard to achieve post-pandemic economic recovery, thereby not only putting their economies back on their feet, but also addressing an issue that had to be dealt with anyway: a lack of new, modern, and greener infrastructure. This is wildly bullish on industrial metals if you ask me because other countries are likely to follow the same path.\n\n**-Wealth Redistribution Policies**\n\nGive a wealthy man a mil and he\u2019ll invest it boomer dividend stocks like the rest of his 10 million dollars, since he already has a dream house, a dream car, and, unluckily for him, he can\u2019t buy a dream wife on the open market, so in the meantime, he\u2019ll strive to get richer. Give a wagie a mil and he\u2019ll spend it faster than it takes a WSB degen to YOLO his paycheck on some 0dte FDs. The marginal propensity to consume of lower-income households is much higher than that of higher-income households, so because wealth redistribution effectively shifts income from investment to consumption, it is typically inflationary. Wealth redistribution has been part of the Democrats\u2019 agenda for a long time and is also a component of the Covid Relief bill. Furthermore, with the likes of AOC gaining more and more traction among younger generations (AOC simps in particular), I can see these types of policies gain much more momentum in the future, given the current wealth gap is pretty abysmal and has the potential to cause social unrest if it is undealt with. And what about rising wages? I don\u2019t think the $15 national minimum wage is going to materialize itself anytime soon, but there is nevertheless a push for wage raises undergoing (again, courtesy of the dems). This is, again, mainly beneficial to lower-income families and leads to a much more commodity-intensive economy, as a larger part of the population is able to afford housing, home appliances, automobiles, etc. than previously. This is obviously inflationary as well.\n\n# Supply\n\n\\-**Low Capital Expenditure in the \u201cCommodity Complex\u201d**\n\nThis is a key component of the super-cycle thesis. What causes the rally in industrial metals is not only the sudden increase in demand but also the fact supply is unprepared. We know the industry that has been suffering from underinvestment for years and will unlikely be able to adjust to demand quickly enough. Since commodity prices started falling after the GFC, there\u2019s been a dramatic decrease in capital expenditure for metal processing companies, miners, and industrials, as you would expect during a recession (add to that the manufacturing crisis). Furthermore, CapEx growth never came back to 2008 highs and has just been further dipping during the last decade, and even went negative following the pandemic adverse demand shock (in the case of steel for example). Producers had to outright cut back on investment just to keep their operating activities afloat. Although global capacity in industrial metals is still big enough to meet the demand today, given the state of the industry after the pandemic blow, I don\u2019t think there will be overcapacity again like there was prior to 2019/2020, since the industry was momentarily weakened in the past months. This is precisely when prices tend to bottom, and then only does investment starts returning back into the industry, anticipating higher prices, and eventually margins improve when prices and the industry do recover, but with fewer players in it (**Chart 7** shows this cycle). I believe we are currently at the \u201cPrices bottom\u201d phase, and already we are seeing mining and metal processing stocks up. Investors are already expecting higher metal prices and profit margins, and investment is starting to flow back into the industry.\n\n**Chart 7:** **Metals\u2019 investment cycle**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evjnfh7p9ph61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a43a4d8f65249601808992c4268d8899f2a2fa6\n\n# Bottom Line\n\n\"Listen, here's the deal\", we are about to have a manufacturing boom. There, I said it. Come at me bears! (except tech bears though). The US, China, and India are betting on huge infrastructure projects, and we're talking huge bets. Trillions. I believe the private sector is not gonna stand idle; they will follow and will also make massive manufacturing investments to turn around their businesses so they can be competitive in this new, high-tech, environmentally sustainable economy. This is big. As the demand for these types of massive investments goes up, interest rates will start increasing (this is not happening overnight, we're talking in a while), and then banks will be more than happy to lend at the right price (right now they just won't do it, they're not getting their risk's worth). Lending growth \u2714\ufe0f. As manufacturing starts rolling again, there will be more jobs and GDP growth \u2714\ufe0f. Full employment could very well happen, but realistically it will take more than a year; might still happen though. \"Overdrive mode\"\u2714\ufe0f. More employment means more income and with redistribution policies in place, more of that income will be spent back into the economy, driving prices up. Inflation\u2714\ufe0f Meanwhile, you have a metals' industry that is lagging the economy, as it did not receive the kinds of capital flows tech has enjoyed for a decade. Lack of raw materials supply \u2714\ufe0f. This generates a continued, multi-year, upward pressure on industrial metals prices. That's the super-cycle trade, investing where there is underinvestment in anticipation of the demand that's coming ahead. And look at it as an asymmetric bet, since you don't stand that much to lose with commodity prices this low. How much lower can they really get? And you know they'll rebound eventually, so you can double down if they dip again, and that's what makes the trade so interesting. Ask yourself, when the tech bubble pops, where is that money going to go? We've gone over this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Hmm that's cool and all... but where are my tickers??\n\nOk, this is a Macro DD, it's in the title. I have not had the chance to take a deep dive into specific companies in order to find the hidden gems that will benefit the most from this (pls, if someone has done it, comment it in the thread that would be awesome). But if you want some tickers, I'll give you some. They can be broken down into categories. There's the steel sector (Steel Gang I got you fam), there's the Copper sector, and there's Silver (hey, there's industrial applications, and apparently there's already a fkg shortage so yeah, I'm adding it). I won't go into the specifics of the company, I'll just give you a quick overview of financials + valuation, so you'll have to put up *some* work yourself.\n\nPS-I know there are other industrial metals such as Palladium, Platinum, Nickel, etc., but this DD is getting long af so I'll limit myself to just a few, but the super-cycle thesis is bullish on all industrial metals, so feel free to shoot other industrial metals tickers you are bullish on.\n\n# Steel Sector\n\nAs I said before, 52% of all steel demand comes from infrastructure projects, so the fact governments around the world are investing like crazy in infrastructure is a think a good start for a steel rally. Steel gang knows all about it, and there's been DD on it, so go check it out, macro-wise, they're probably right.\n\n**X**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/np1cfyy3lph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2271eee78f8fe217f4db722ab709ec741b795193\n\nBasically for the degens. Small-cap with low float, much weaker balance sheet than its peers, but with more room for growth. Trading currently 20% below \"fair value\" should you use a DCF model. I would say it's one of the most speculative plays in the steel sector, win big or lose big type of play.\n\n**STLD**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eq7p6cngmph61.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=302c250198eff734be70ce80684eb738713d715a\n\nNow, this is more reasonable. Rock-solid balance sheet, that pays a fkg dividend (Imagine caring about a dividend of 2.5% though lol) and is trading at an impressive 46% below \"fair value\", again using a simple DCF model (if anybody wants to add another way of valuing this shit please do, I suck at coming up with price targets, I'm just copying [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) estimates here). Won't probably move as fast as X though \ud83d\ude10.\n\n**MT**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8udchr6oqph61.jpg?width=370&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=831dd6798b54cb436aedb8bede5b74ccb4a799ed\n\nSteel Gang knows this one well, and there's already DD on it, so go check it out.\n\n**VALE**\n\nWell, I stand with the Knights of Vale, and that is all I have to say. There's enough DD out there to confirm all of your biases, so I'll just say it's a good long-term play. Go read the DD.\n\n**SLX**\n\nVanEck Vectors ETF Trust Steel ETF. Honestly, I have never used it, it doesn't look very option liquid, so I wouldn't dip in it, but if you absolutely love ETFs there is one.\n\n# Silver Sector\n\nLet's not overlook silver's worth just because there's a ton of shilling going on. There are the people that believe the dollar will be worthless and the financial system will collapse, and then there are the people that legit think silver is a good commodity play. I think it's not only a good commodity play but also a good industrial play. As opposed to Gold, which is purely an inflation hedge at best, silver has actual industrial applications. Anyway, you know the tickers for silver, there's been more than enough shilling on them.\n\n# Copper Sector\n\nCopper, being an excellent electrical conductor, will likely have the most intense rally amongst metals in the coming years. The EV industry especially, but all other industries that will strive to go fully electrical and clean will demand huge quantities of it. Think of all the electrical wiring, revolutionary battery tech (like the one Elon showed on battery day \\*PTSD sets in\\*), as well as other industrial applications. For what it's worth, Goldman Sachs is most bullish on copper. Fun fact: Copper surfaces kill most viruses, including the Rona, faster than other surfaces like plastic. Do with that info what you will.\n\n**TRQ**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84oic7e67qh61.jpg?width=393&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1653ff426005f81656c9c245508ffaf0b441a3a6\n\nNow, this one makes me rock hard. Earnings are forecasted to grow 30% per year. On top of the huge growth prospects, it's currently undervalued at around 67%. 67%! And that's using the boomer valuation model that is DCF. Big value right here imo.\n\n**LUN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfc1mziahqh61.jpg?width=403&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51489bc98a16de12bfa231559f5df45e0ff0c945\n\nThis one is a sexy beast. Excellent balance sheet, very good growth prospect, proven track record, and at a 55% discount using DCF model. But, of course, there's a but: it's only on the TSX, and while it has options, they don't look liquid at all. I'm a canuck so I can trade it, but yeah it's only on the Toronto Exchange...\n\n**COPX**\n\nIt's the Copper ETF, and it has no options. Meh\n\nOk, so that's it for the tickers. To be honest, there are probably better ones, but I spent most of my time working on the overall macro thesis and wasn't planning to add any tickers initially and then changed my mind. Again, if you have suggestions please comment. These tickers are just the most popular and highest momentum names, they are not the hidden gems.\n\nEDIT: Ok so I just had this idea by stumbling on somebody's comment just now. Somehow people think Biden is a warmonger. Well, the US hasn't had a good war in some time now. The Afghanistan war is still going on, not really going anywhere, and not being expensive enough to have any meaningful economic consequences. Meanwhile, tensions with Russia and China keep escalating. A war would be just about the last piece of the puzzle for the commodity super-cycle thesis. It would certainly cause massive inflation as demand for industrial metals and other commodities skyrockets, given the war effort resource reallocations. Historically, this is one of the conditions, so I think it's something to keep in mind going forward.\n\nEDIT 2: wtf is going on with silver? All metals are up today 16/02/2021, silver and gold down. Gold I get it, silver I don't fkg get it. It has industrial applications, there is a current SHORTAGE??? Are people just not paying attention, is this just algos smacking the price down? I get the manipulation for silver futures, it's not new, but what about miners? AG and others... this is whack af. I'm doubling down on silver, it will come back to its senses eventually, it has too.\n\nPositions:\n\nX 35c 21/1/2022\n\nSTLD 55c 21/1/2022\n\nVALE 27c 20/1/2023\n\nTRQ 25c 21/1/2022\n\nLUN shares lel\n\nAG 35c 21/12022\n\n**TL;DR** **Basically we've been innovating shit for a decade, we have now amazing tech to make our economy go green af.

The bottom was in Nov, but now is also a good time.\n\nI haven't written a DD but there are plenty out there. I encourage you to do some research. My biggest plays are Suncor and Exon Mobil.\n\nThe bull thesis goes something like this. We've had low prices for 5 years due to US shale (Remember drill baby drill, and how everyone laughed in 2008, well it worked) The US has been a net exporter of oil. We did it, we achieved energy independence, created millions of good jobs, and flooded the world with cheap oil. America, fuck yeah! Unfortunately, cheap oil means oil companies were all hurting.\n\nThen covid hit, global demand dropped from 100 million bbl a day to 92 and oil is so inelastic it destroyed prices. Oil companies were hit hard and posted a year of losses, many cut dividends, shares fell as much as 70%. This also happened under a backdrop of increasing political pressure to move away from oil and a speculative fervor in EVs and green energy.\n\nProduction was wiped out. Oil majors such as RDS and BP are no longer exploring for new finds. Shale? Shale needs 45-55 bbl oil and is unlikely to come back soon. The sentiment is that oil is a dying industry. Oil consumption will never return to precovid levels. We will all drive EVs and use solar and wind.\n\nExcept.. we need oil. We need lots of it. We can't live without it. We will be using oil for another 30 years. Demand is expected to return. Suddenly oil is back to $60 bbl and recovery hasn't started. China and India are growing faster than we can move away from oil.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Below is a link to the E.I.A. report released in Feb detailing our projected energy mix. Keep in mind this was produced by a bipartisan group high on green energy hopium. Also is a projection for crude from JP Morgan over the next year. I through in some DD floating around on reddit. Do a search for oil or XOM or SU on WSB. There is a DD on oil every other day. It just gets lost in a sea of junk stocks.\n\nWhere is all this oil going to come from, if demand will increase beyond 2019 levels and remain above past 2030? That's a great question. And remember that part about demand being inelastic...\n\nThis is what people mean by a new super cycle in commodities. Here we are. Prices are set to soar.\n\nPick an oil company. Look at where they were when oil was at $68 a bbl on average for the year. Look at the price they are at now, and invest. You can't go wrong.\n\nPersonally my biggest play is SU.\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/\n\nhttps://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/research/2021-global-market-outlook\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/lhwmhu/the_bull_bear_case_for_oil/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/ljt7m3/berkshire_has_a_234_million_investment_in_suncor/", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019re missing a big factor at play here, OPEC has essentially been controlling supply.

Media coverage on these topics has been overwhelmingly misinformed so far (resulting in low prices), but this will likely easily and rapidly change (allowing strong gains). \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80** \n\nAnalyst price target: $16 (+100% upside) **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80** \n\nPersonal price target: $21 (+170% upside) **\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80** \n\n# INTRO\n\nI am a soon-to-be resident physician wrapping up my studies at an American allopathic medical school. **My goal is to explain in simple language why I feel the market is wrong about Vaxart\u2014as it repeatedly demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of medicine and vaccine science\u2014so that you can better understand and, in turn, make more informed investment decisions.** I am not trying to give you investment advice; I am trying to give you greater understanding. I am not trying to make Vaxart the next Gamestop; I am trying to bring light to misunderstanding. With that said, I will disclose upfront that I actively trade not only VXRT but also PFE, MRNA, NVAX, ALT, SRNE, and TGTX. **Do your own research, come to your own conclusions, and make your own decisions. Your decision to invest in Vaxart makes no difference to me.**\n\nQuestions are welcome. Assholes are tedious and almost always misinformed. **Actually check the sources before telling me I did not provide it.** This is all very generalized and greatly simplified and there are no absolutes in medicine. **Simplicity of language and accessibility of information is the goal here.** Everything below is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and supported by the current state of science as we know it.\n\n# VERY BRIEF HISTORY\n\nVaxart is making an oral COVID-19 vaccine. A few weeks ago, the stock price of Vaxart rapidly went up before sharply falling following the release of \u201cpositive\u201d preliminary phase 1 clinical trial data. Why? Because their release stated that no \u201cserum neutralizing antibodies\u201d were produced, which the market apparently\u2014and quite incorrectly\u2014took as an indication of failure. Fortunately for me, the market does not understand immunology. I have owned shares of Vaxart for a few months now. I was watching (and holding) as the stock price rapidly increased a few weeks ago. As the stock price rapidly dropped, I bought more. When it dropped even further, I bought even more. Why? Because (1) Serum neutralizing antibodies were never Vaxart\u2019s selling point for me, and (2) Vaxart has what Moderna and Pfizer will literally *never* have: The key needed to achieve herd immunity. (Hold that thought.)\n\n# IMMUNOLOGY BASICS\n\n\u201cImmunoglobulins\u201d (abbreviate \u201cIg\u201d) are the \u201cantibody\u201d molecules our immune system makes to keep bugs at bay. There are 4 primary immunoglobulins: IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE. When a bug is swimming around in your blood, your immune system quickly makes IgM. If that bug won\u2019t leave you alone, your immune system will \u201clevel up\u201d and transition to making IgG instead. This transition from IgM to IgG usually takes at least a few weeks. If that bug leaves but then bothers you later in life, your body will remember where it left off and quickly make an even stronger IgG for you. IgA is quite different because it hangs out in all the \u201csticky\u201d places of your body referred to as the \u201cmucosa\u201d\u2014your nose, mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, anus, penis, vagina, and even the milk ducts of your nipples. When a baby is born, mom can give the baby IgG through the womb and IgA through her milk. This keeps babies alive while their tiny immune systems are growing up and becoming independent. (We can ignore IgE for this discussion.) These immunoglobulins/antibodies have a few weapons in their arsenal to use against bugs: The bugs can be labeled as an enemy for our allies to then attack, the bugs can be stabbed to death, or the bugs can be quarantined in a little box so that they can\u2019t hurt you. In fact, \u201cneutralizing antibodies\u201d essentially quarantine bugs so that they can\u2019t do any harm. When we say \u201cserum neutralizing antibodies\u201d we usually mean IgG swimming around in the blood. However, IgA is also very much a \u201cneutralizing antibody\u201d though remember it is found mostly in the \u201csticky\u201d places of our body. This will be important later.\n\n# VACCINE BASICS\n\nMost vaccines work by essentially pulling a fakie on our immune system by using pieces of bugs (or even just dead bugs) so that we begin making our little soldier immunoglobulins/antibodies before the bug actually arrives. Unfortunately, vaccines never trigger a truly full immune response. Most (but not all) vaccines primarily produce serum IgG (\u201cneutralizing antibody\u201d). Remember from above that IgM transitions to IgG and that this usually takes at least few weeks? This is why most vaccines require at least one booster shot. You know our stomach is used to digest food? This is why most vaccines are given to us with a needle (because our stomach would destroy the vaccine).\n\nVaccines can be thought of as existing in two groups: (1) Vaccines that stop you from dying, and (2) Vaccines that stop you from giving your bug to others. While both of these categories are immensely useful, **only this second category can result in herd immunity**. More on that in a moment. While it would be ideal for all vaccines to fall perfectly into both categories at the same time, the vaccines that manage to achieve that are usually live vaccines (which we try to avoid using). Polio is a great example as there were both live and killed polio vaccines. The killed polio vaccine prevented disease and death, but it did not prevent people from carrying and giving polio to the rest of the world. On the other hand, the live polio vaccine prevented disease and death as well as prevented people from carrying and giving polio to the rest of the world. (Live vaccines are otherwise beyond this discussion.)\n\n# HERD IMMUNITY\n\nHerd immunity is when a population as a whole becomes effectively immune to a bug simply because that bug lost its ability to travel between people. (A spider cannot bite you if it cannot get to you!) There are two primary ways to achieve herd immunity: (1) Mass natural infection, and (2) Mass vaccination. Mass natural infection is by far the most effective option (because it triggers a full immune response), but it is also by far the most lethal. Voluntarily attempting to achieve herd immunity through mass natural infection would incredibly devastating and a clearly unethical option for a bug like COVID-19.\n\nRemember from above that vaccines never trigger a truly full immune response? This is partly why the flu vaccine only gives us a partial herd immunity. (Influenza also mutates a lot.) This is also why the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will almost certainly never come close to providing us with herd immunity. These vaccines are missing the key to herd immunity.\n\nWhat piece of the immune system makes herd immunity possible? It does not matter if herd immunity is achieved through mass infection or through mass vaccination, the primary and required key is\u2014by far\u2014IgA. Remember from above that IgA primarily lives in the \u201csticky\u201d parts of our bodies, but also remember from above that most vaccines primarily produce IgG? We need IgA in the \u201csticky\u201d places because that\u2019s where most bugs enter our bodies. We need IgG once those bugs have found their way inside of us.\n\n# ANALOGY\n\nAs an analogy, imagine an arsonist catching a house on fire. The IgG would be the firefighters and police coming to put out the fire and arrest the arsonist. IgG is doing great work! But this doesn\u2019t fix the damage that\u2019s been done, it does not guarantee that the burglar won\u2019t burn down another home once released from jail, and it does not protect your home from being burned down again a year from now. On the other hand, IgA would be the gated fence surrounding the home, motion sensor security lights, security cameras, and alarm system that ultimately results in the arsonist moving along from your home to target a much easier home with fewer front-line defenses. In this analogy, vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer are the police and firefighters (because they produce mostly IgG) whereas vaccines like Vaxart and Altimmune are the fences, lights, and alarms (because they produce mostly IgA). While no home is ever truly safe from being burned down, having the most security features exponentially decreases the odds of houses being burned down. Indeed, it is exceedingly difficult to find a house that has been burned down by an arsonist in a community that has equipped all of these security features on every home.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\n**Pfizer, Moderna, and even Novavax will likely continue protect us from dying of COVID, but we will still harbor and transmit COVID** within our mucosa (while likely being mostly asymptomatic). Most concerningly, this will be how we will inevitably breed innumerable new variants of COVID throughout the world. Hopefully these will be no more severe than the current dominant strain, but we must keep in mind that SARS and MERS (though less transmissible) are both coronaviruses and that all it would take is for just the right mutation(s) to take place for COVID-19 to become far deadlier. **While the current authorized vaccines are wonderful and are absolutely necessary in fighting the pandemic, they have\u2014and will always have\u2014devastating shortcomings for which we will ultimately pay if we do not bridge this gap in susceptibility quickly. Vaxart and Altimmune seem to be the two most promising candidates to help us bridge this gap through their mucosal IgA protection.** There is so much ground to cover with a lot more room for additional vaccines to round out our defenses. **At minimum, we must achieve both an IgG response (to prevent disease and death)** ***and*** **an IgA response (to prevent transmission). Without the prevention of transmission, it is not \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d we ultimately breed a devastatingly fatal breed of coronavirus.** We have wonderful IgG vaccines. Let us support and work hard to ensure we get some IgA vaccines as soon as possible so that we can all be safe and return to normal life.\n\nThe only analyst that seems to have unwavering optimism for Vaxart is Mayank Mamtani (top 100 on TipRanks) with a price target of $16 (+100% upside), but even his reasoning is, while not incorrect, totally different from my own reasoning and ultimately fails to see a bigger picture.\n\n# SELECTED SOURCES\n\n* [Vaxart Announces Positive Pre-Clinical Data for its Oral COVID-19 Vaccine Program](https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-announces-positive-pre-clinical-data-its-oral-covid-19) \\*\\*\\*\n* [Vaxart Investor Presentation January 2021](https://investors.vaxart.com/static-files/76ded565-e448-4d98-910c-f1ae3629789c) \\*\\*\\*\n* [Vaxart's Oral Vaccine Candidate for Prevention of Covid-19](https://investors.vaxart.com/static-files/6529d1b3-f86e-480b-bd9e-98eb74b10f9c) \\*\\*\\*\n* [Safety and immunogenicity of an oral tablet norovirus vaccine, a phase randomized, placebo-controlled trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124525/pdf/jciinsight-3-121077.pdf)\n* [Secretory IgA: Arresting Microbial Pathogens at Epithelial Borders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774547/pdf/nihms435387.pdf)\n* [Oral Modeling of an Adenovirus-Based Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine in Ferrets and Mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4929087/pdf/40121_2016_Article_108.pdf)\n* [Systemic and Mucosal Immune Responses Following Oral Adenoviral Delivery of Influenza Vaccine to the Human Intestine by Radio Controlled Capsule](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121599/pdf/srep37295.pdf)\n* [Impaired Antibody-mediated Protection and Defective IgA B-Cell Memory in Experimental Infection of Adults with Respiratory Syncytial Virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4435460/pdf/rccm.201412-2256OC.pdf)\n* [The Role of Nasal IgA in Children Vaccinated with Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1201328X)\n* [PFIZER: Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577) \\*\\*\\*\n* [MODERNA: Efficacy and Safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389) \\*\\*\\*\n* Cellular and Molecular Immunology (Abbas, 9e)\n* Medical Microbiology and Immunology (Lange, 14e)\n\n# EDITS\n\n* WSB rules explain *how* one is required to post a position, but it does not appear that there is a rule that one *must* post a position.

{"title": "I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.", "selftext": "I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.\n\nUnder the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.\n\nThat is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.\n\nEdit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.\n\nI first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.\n\nMy new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.", "id": "lkzviy", "created_utc": 1613465649.0, "score": 41951, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 1933, "comments": [{"body": "Dude, you're gonna pay interest rate on the short that already bakes in the market expectation that the SA currency is shit.

Corruption is rampant. Inefficiencies are rampant. Violence and crime are both rampant. I wouldn't debate any of that.   \n    \n97% of the crime that happens in this country, happens in the poorer communities. Because of the enormous divide between classes, these crimes do little to affect the market-related economy here. As long as the corporations have young, black able-bodied men to throw down a mine, the economy chugs along.    \n    \nThe claim that asylum applications are more likely to be accepted is utter horseshit.    \n    \nQuantitative easing was implemented in SA for the **first time** last year, as a result of the pandemic.    \n    \nThere are no \"roving bands of pirates\".   \nThere are gangs in the poorer communities that are built around drug distribution networks, etc.    \n    \nOP's claims about the water are absolute rubbish. \nThere are issues with water supply in the informal settlements, as the poor try to build small shanties wherever is feasible. And they are regularly broken down by a government team called the Red Ants, if they build somewhere undesirable.    \n    \nThe claim of ethnic cleansing in the OP is utter horseshit.    \n    \nThe South African Rand is one of the most widely traded currencies on the planet. As a businessman and importer of numerous products from around the world, I have watched the Rand closely for 16 years. Its devaluation hasn't been solely linked to poor government performance. In actual fact, a lot of the currency's losses are directly to it having been manipulated over the years by larger international traders and banks, looking to make a profit.   \n\nZimbabwe's circumstances were different. Under Robert Mugabe, the system was wholly disassembled for his personal gain. We almost found ourselves in the same situation, until our previous president Jacob Zuma was replaced with Cyril Ramaphosa, who is a billionaire, and was previously a trade unionist. Cyril also owned the rights to MacDonalds for SA.    \n    \nTLDR; OP is a cunt.

Firstly, to make money, you have to beat the forwards, not the spot rate; I hope you understand this. Secondly, inflation can be one macro driver of returns, but has no mathematical relationship with your returns.\n\nYou portray this as a positive carry bet, when in fact it's a negative carry bet. Short rates are about 3.5% in South Africa, and almost zero in the US. So, if you take a short position and nothing happens, you lose 3.5% a year on an unleveraged basis (I assume your broker isn't giving you interbank rates, and hence for this example, I use a spread of 3.5% for indicative purposes.)

Basically, the conspiracy theory is that white farmers in South Africa are being specifically selected on a large scale as targets of violent crime by the government as a way for black farmers to reclaim land that was taken from them.\n\nWhile it is true that white farmers hold a massively disproportionate amount of agricultural land in South Africa, and that the government has been trying to redistribute it to black farmers, the notion that this is being done via targeted killings is nothing more than a conspiracy theory. This is simply a result of the land reform program in the post-apartheid era.\n\nDonald Trump [pushed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/world/africa/trump-south-africa-white-farmers.html) this [conspiracy](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45282088) theory really [hard](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/aug/24/donald-trump/trump-tweets-incorrect-south-african-land-seizures/), but there is literally no data to confirm it, and most available data indicates the exact opposite: that white farmers, and farmers in general, are exactly as likely as anyone else to be the target of violent crime in South Africa, which certainly does have a crime problem. In fact, except for a spike in 2016-2017, South African farm attacks have been steadily decreasing for over a decade.\n\nThere were 21,325 murder victims in South Africa in 2019, of which only 49 were white farmers. About 9% of South Africa is white, so we assume that murders were evenly distributed, that number would be in line with 2.25% of South African whites being farmers, [which is less than half of the percentage of South Africans employed in agriculture](https://www.statista.com/statistics/578944/employment-by-economic-sector-in-south-africa/). Those numbers alone kind of refute the conspiracy.\n\n[Here's a paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284596974_Race_class_and_violent_crime_in_South_Africa_Dispelling_the_'Huntley_thesis) whose research shows that while data are still incomplete, all available evidence shows that, unsurprisingly, poor black South Africans are disproportionately targeted by serious crime.\n\nI encourage you to do some more research, because this is, unsurprisingly, a highly complex issue, and the fact that this kind of reductionist bullshit is immediately rapidly upvoted and awarded reveals a lot about the types of people on WSB.", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "Well said, helps for people to do credible research.

As for our tap water - I'm drinking some right now and it's actually perfect.\n\nOP - Don't trust your research - it's a heap of shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Seeing that you retards seem to think otherwise about what I am saying, let me breakdown MY experience of South Africa to indicate where I am coming from and why I think OP's comments on the country are a bit skewed.\n\nI am a person of colour. This doesn't sound like it should be said or even matter but in SA it does. I was born into and experienced the tail end of Apartheid and of course I have seen the transition from the abolishing of  the prior regime till today.\n\nI come from very humble beginnings call it the upper line of the lower class with an abusive and alcoholic dad and a mom that's a teacher (teachers in SA are underpaid and overworked). I grew up in a highly underdeveloped part of the country that suffered with poor funding and rampant corruption long before the current regime (ANC era of rule) set in. I was still in primary school when we had our first home invasion where my dad shot and killed an intruder (he didn't go to jail for this contrary to what other people will tell you about our justice system).\n\nCrime and violence is a problem we have here (I am the survivor of multiple home invasions, robbery at gunpoint, attempted hijacking too). We also live with very rampant corruption which is often times the private sector colluding with the government to milk state coffers dry. Two points to take back from this is that the security sector is pumping here and large private entities especially in IT, Finance, Manufacturing and Mining make a killing here due to their 'collaborations' with the government and the dirty officials. SA is also very rich in mineral wealth with some of the richest coal, diamond, gold and platinum deposits in the world (guess what happens when the world moves to commodity backed currencies again).\n\nI am an engineer, my brother is a medical doctor and with government initiatives to educate the youth from disadvantaged and poor backgrounds (NFSAS Funding), we were able to lift ourselves from staying in the poverty line forever to actually having a future. We also aren't looking to leave the country due to the mass amount of opportunity that is here. This is the part that most people commenting on Reddit about South Africa will not highlight - the fact that the tax paying workforce is increasing due to initiatives like above where we are able to get a great education that was previously reserved for >10% of the population.  It is true that we do have high unemployment (30.8% as of the end of 2020) but that's also during a time where COVID-19 hit the country hard. Provided that you are studying something in a sector where your skills are required, you will not be short of work that pays well.\n\nFarm Murders also feature a lot when talking about SA (I've lost family members in farm attacks) and they are very brutal, however this is driven more by the rural and isolated settings that these attacks happen in and makes the victims 'easy targets'. Likewise some people will tell you that it is racially motivated but the stark reality is that due to the land ownership inequality here, not a lot of farm land is owned by people of colour and remember I mentioned losing family members to farm attacks as a POC.\n\nIt is true that I am commenting on this while sitting in a gated community in the richest square mile in Africa but make no mistake - I wasn't born into this at all. I worked very hard and tirelessly to get here. A large portion of people I know have the same story. This means that there are chunks of the population continually lifting themselves out of poverty and moving into higher income brackets systematically.\n\nSA is a young democracy at 26 years old but from my own experiences here, it isn't all doom and gloom since with getting key factors under control, the country can soar.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Surely that just points to massive wealth inequality?

{"title": "Miners and the Global Commodity Supercycle ft. VALE, FCX, MT", "selftext": "**Preface** \n\n* For whatever its worth, I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/).\n\n**I. Introduction**\n\n* The commodities boom of the 2000s saw prices [balloon to incredible heights](https://i.imgur.com/gLQfQzn.png). Over a ten-year period, the price of iron ore rose from [~$12/ton to nearly $190/ton](https://i.imgur.com/ZYTveMH.png) as surging demand across the world drove unprecedented need for raw materials. The fun was cut short in 2008 due to the Financial Crisis, however government intervention saw to a [swift rebound](https://i.imgur.com/wle4DdR.png) in industrial activity. *(Chart data from World Steel)*\n\n* If you\u2019ve been watching the markets recently, you would have noticed a major rally among all the industrial metals. [Copper](https://i.imgur.com/U2QsNSr.png). [Iron Ore](https://i.imgur.com/nSzdE4p.png). [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png). [Tin](https://i.imgur.com/lBr7RiM.png). This has been largely attributed to China\u2019s quick recovery in 2020 as well as COVID related mining disruptions driving a mismatch between supply and demand. Heading into 2021, industrial metals have continued to rise as the rest of the world begins to come online after implementing policies designed to rejuvenate the economy. Other notable factors include: a strong US response leading to a weaker dollar and growing inflation concerns, a downturn in the services sector pushing consumers towards commodity intensive goods, and higher than ever global demand for large scale renewable infrastructure. All against a static, underinvested mining capacity owing to the [bearish environment](https://i.imgur.com/4dmwQmG.png) over the last ten years. \n\n* I believe the current environment has primed metals and other commodities to see prolonged, elevated demand not seen since the previous commodity supercycle as a strong resurgence in manufacturing precedes a long-term, worldwide push towards renewable energy infrastructure.\n\n**II. Coronavirus & Government Intervention**\n\n* The impact from the pandemic was far worse than the 2008 recession. A large-scale shutdown threw unemployment to the [stratosphere](https://i.imgur.com/3S0Gt56.png) and devastated the [markets](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamentals-of-the-2020-market-crash-4799950). The conditions were so poor it forced [governments around the world](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19) to rapidly pass a series of heavy handed social and monetary policies \u2013 **note the US [absolutely jacked up the money supply](https://i.imgur.com/1vTd0GI.png) and [lowered rates to near zero](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-zero-part-wide-ranging-emergency-intervention/)** \u2013 to revitalize the economy and prevent further deterioration. \n\n* The impact wasn\u2019t just limited to consumers, businesses also felt the pressure as many manufacturers \u2013 expecting lower demand \u2013 [cut back on production and capacity]( https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/coronavirus-impacts-industrial-manufacturing.html#content-free-1-6e9a) as the commercial sector saw activity grind to a sharp stop. Miners, anticipating a period of economic weakness, not only sharply cut back production but also saw [severe disruptions](https://www.mining.com/worldwide-mining-disruptions/) across mining sites as COVID breakouts forced projects into suspension. \n\n* Note that the sheer amount of financial support in 2020 far outstripped the [government response in 2008](https://i.imgur.com/TMs02Ot.png). The [$2T legislation in March](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-package-details-coronavirus/index.html) was followed with [$900B in December](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/20/politics/second-covid-stimulus-package-details/index.html) and President Biden has promised [another $1.9T proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/) and [$2T infrastructure proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/02/11/biden-senators-infrastructure/).\n\n**III. Industrial Demand**\n\n* Due to their rigid response to the pandemic, China led the world recovery, with the rest of the world not far off, driving an early surge in commodity demand and sending metals prices soaring. With the services market almost entirely shut down, buyers had turned to more [commodity intensive goods](https://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-bounce-back-as-consumers-snap-up-goods-11604315271) and [overwhelmed the markets](https://theloadstar.com/its-a-juggling-act-say-handlers-as-cargo-congestion-swamps-europes-airports/). Unexpected consumer demand drained inventories and manufacturers found themselves with record setting backlogs. This shift was further supported by the government\u2019s stimulus programs, actively adding spending power to the consumer class.\n\n* For some time now, there has been growing focus around renewable energy infrastructure and green policies. Current trends have pushed back against [new investment into coal](https://i.imgur.com/xDiza5H.png) and [Oil & Gas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/joe-biden-keystone-pipeline-climate-crisis) and [numerous](https://i.imgur.com/VweHRwA.png) [countries](https://i.imgur.com/vZRsX4o.png) [have](https://i.imgur.com/16DSmh2.png) announced environmental targets.

[Higher iron ore imports](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/iron-ore-imports-outside-china-show-signs-of-recovery-russell).\n\n* Furthermore, EVs will require significant resources for new factories, batteries, and cars. This demand is already noticeable on [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png) and analysts have increasingly raised their [projections](https://www.mining.com/nickel-demand-for-evs-expected-to-shoot-up-in-the-next-20-years/) on the metal. Ford even admits [here](https://www.mining.com/web/ford-joins-global-initiative-to-promote-responsible-mining/) they will be more reliant on mined material going forward.

[Btw](https://i.imgur.com/6oK8as7.png) \n\n**IV. Financial Demand**\n\n* The government\u2019s expansionary monetary policies were successful in staving off further deterioration, however this resulted in extremely low interest rates across the world as well as a sharp increase in the money supply. [The DXY has weakened](https://i.imgur.com/JC9Yylb.png) starting in March 2020 and [current consensus](https://currency.com/usd-forecast-2021#:~:text=US%20dollar%20news%3A%20more%20pain%20ahead&text=Setting%20out%20its%20USD%20forecast,against%20most%20major%20fiat%20currencies.) is that it will further devalue as the Biden administration implements the $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure proposals. The massive printing [heightened inflation concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-13/inflation-is-coming-to-the-u-s-and-the-fed-could-be-in-a-bind) and the demand for hedges such as metals. Furthermore, a [low dollar](https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294) raises the buying power of foreign currency and [low rates](https://www.thebalance.com/commodity-prices-when-interest-rates-rise-4084273) ease capital for companies; both are economically linked to higher commodity prices.\n\n* Alongside the economic machinations at play, major financial institutions such as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM) and [JPMorgan](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fifth-commodity-supercycle-has-started-says-highly-regarded-jpmorgan-strategist-11613044794) have announced they see the beginnings of a commodity supercycle with some forecasts seeing iron ore as high as [$165/t for three years]( https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-price-jumps-as-vale-reports-low-output/) as others upgrade their projections on [steel](https://i.imgur.com/FuUtHLj.png). Not all metal demand is strictly industrial and trader demand for these metals for speculation and inflation hedging purposes are likely to further increase.\n\n* PS. [This was JPMorgan just a little while ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/jpmorgan-defends-its-call-on-metal-trades-after-investor-backlash.html) \n\n**V. Commodities, Metals, and Mines** \n\n* The March contraction reversed at breakneck pace to a bullish narrative as all indicators pivoted towards prolonged, stronger economic activity. Government policies have bolstered the consumer class with direct payments, weakening the US dollar and driving inflation concerns, as the world powers race towards renewable infrastructure to jump start their economies. With service businesses suppressed with social restrictions, consumer demand has shifted towards commodity heavier goods resulting in manufacturers with low inventory, high backlogs, and rising raw material costs. Renewable infrastructure will remain a long term driver for capital expenditure as the US and China gear up for economic superiority while other major nations look to meet their own environmental pledges. \n\n* All these demand drivers are expected to be significantly accretive to metals and metals producers. Metals prices are soaring and are expected to remain elevated for some time both on continued market demand as well as the devaluation of the US dollar under the government\u2019s upcoming spending agenda. The markets \u2013 on near zero interest rates \u2013 are still unwinding the last two major stimulus bills from March and December and the Biden administration has an additional $1.9T and $2.0T planned with potentially more support even after that. **Miners, aware of the impending inflection point, have already pledged to intensify cash distribution to shareholders.** $MT announced [$650M +$570M buyback](https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/media/press-releases/arcelormittal-announces-share-buyback-program-3) and issued $0.30 dividends. $FCX announced a [performance based buyback policy alongside a cash dividend of $0.30/share](https://investors.fcx.com/investors/news-releases/news-release-details/2021/Freeport-McMoRan-Announces-Reinstatement-of-Common-Stock-Dividend-and-Adoption-of-Performance-Based-Payout-Policy/default.aspx).\n\n* Mines have traditionally been heavily slow businesses with lead times for construction to full production as long as [8 years](https://www.extractiveshub.org/topic/view/id/21/chapterId/268). While the jump from 2008-2010 came off a strong bull cycle with many mines already well into capacity expansion and new projects, 2020 has come off one of mining\u2019s worst downcycles with weak capacity investments as miners opted to scale down from preexisting operations. In fact, 2020 saw production of [iron ore](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-iron-ore.pdf), [copper](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-copper.pdf), and [nickel](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-nickel.pdf) all flat to lower versus last year. Current miners can tap deeper into current capacity to produce at higher output, however there will be no major development in new capacity at least for the near term until metals prices rise high enough to attract significant new investments into the sector. Given high enough demand, a supply bottleneck is a very real possibility.\n\n**VI. Conclusion**\n\n* The pandemic induced recession was far worse than any previous downturn and it required a heavy handed government response to stabilize the economy. The economic recovery is gaining momentum each day and the commodity landscape is primed for further growth as nations increasingly invest in infrastructure and the US dollar continues to weaken. Both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs stated they see the beginnings of the next commodity supercycle and the US has yet to deploy nearly $4T in stimulus and infrastructure. Renewable infrastructure has shown strong rate of returns and IRENA stated countries must double their annual infrastructure investment to remain on track to meet pledged targets. Additionally, the US-China standoff has transitioned into an economic competition over EVs and renewable infrastructure.\n\n* Metals prices and miners are set to benefit immensely as major demand drivers act on constrained underinvested capacity due to a decade of bearish market activity. These companies have pledged to funnel large portions of their newfound profits to shareholders through increased dividends and sizable buyback programs. The most recent $900B stimulus in December has yet to fully unwind, we have yet to see the impact of Biden\u2019s $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure policy, and concerns around inflation have never been higher. All factors point towards heightened economic activity and heightened financial demand. Inflation, market demand, and short supply all combined; I see considerable upside for commodities, metals, and miners well into the future.\n\n* $FCX 1/21c @32, $MT 1/21c @25, $VALE 1/21c @20, [SS](https://i.imgur.com/acqZf6k.png)\n\n**Tl;dr:** [Fed print; metals go brrr](https://i.redd.it/bxn2mf4bzoj41.jpg)\n\n**P.S.** [Mining Stocks](https://i.imgur.com/bsXSJvP.png)\n\n**P.P.S.** [Metals Prices](https://i.imgur.com/qP8aCJ3.jpg)", "id": "ll3wl2", "created_utc": 1613482533.0, "score": 263, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "VALE gang getting back together?", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "Never really disbanded, WSB banned Vito so he made his own sub", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "He accidentally posted a ticker w a market cap under 1B I think", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "lold", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1581018567085266}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1810135692358017}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21497340500354767}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41113540530204773}, {"body": "I've owned VALE since 2008.

It\u2019s filled with copious amounts of misinformation from someone who claims to be a historian who \u201cstudied the country for a long time\u201d. It also goes against what this sub is about\n\nThe market is a casino and we\u2019re all here to play. Politics has no place here. Despite the OP saying his post isn\u2019t political. It is. He calls one political party a band of pirates (which there is no proof for) and claims another party is responsible for having inflation rates above 9% twice in 20 years (3 times in 27) because of quantitative easing, which is a crappy idea has only been brought in recently due to the pandemic. The times where this inflation spike happened were in 2008, a tough year for the whole world economically, In 2002 which was also only 8 years after becoming a democracy and years before Zuma began his corruption scandal when he took control, and in 1993, when said party wasn\u2019t even in power! So much for being a historian. Look, South Africa isn\u2019t a paradise with rainbows, butterflies and crayons dipped in glue, it\u2019s got some of the problems most 3rd world countries do, but it\u2019s absolutely NOTHING like the mostly racist hellhole with sanctioned corruption that the OP described.\n\nI could make an entire post arguing against the crap he said but my wife\u2019s boyfriend is typing this for me and he\u2019s upset that I\u2019m wasting time that he could be spending plowing his girl. And also because that would be hypocritical because I\u2019m against making this sub political. We\u2019re not here to play heroes.\n\nTL;DR: Someone said we should short South Africa and gave blatantly politically motivated and downright false information to persuade people to join him.

Maybe in the end they'll make some money but nothing that would justify a 2.5B marketcap. Then there's another problem; Qorvo might not even own the rights to the machines they're selling. It turns out another company, Herza Corp, claims that they developed the machine and that Qorvo has misappropriated their trade secrets. Per the lawsuit filed Nov 22, 2019 in North Carolina, Herza says they had the idea to build a portable diagnostic machine that would use cellphone tech and could be used in a vet's office. They contracted another company, 'Rapid Diagnostek', to design and build a machine to their specifications. After five years of development and $500,000 invested, Rapid Diagnostek suddenly went belly-upfolded without notice. Comes Qorvo and they buy Rapid Diagnostic's assets in bankruptcy including it seems a nearly complete design for a diagnostic machine which coincidentally looks almost exactly like the one Herza designed and for which they retained, and still retain, exclusive rights to their patents.

Qorvo buys Rapid Diagnostek and Heska sues Rapid Diagnostek for breach of contract.\n\nWho knows maybe this takes off but this doesn't seem like a slam dunk.

{"title": "I made a bunch in Weed in 2017 and went bald from the stress, now I'm gonna pay for my hairline with SU. DD inside", "selftext": "Your favourite Canadian autist is back. I\u2019ve been in hiding since I 5x my money on weedstocks in 2017. Not because I got locally famous or anything but because I\u2019ve started to bald and am in hiding until borders open up and I can either go to Turkey or Mexico for a hairline transplant. Geopolitical situation willing, I will have a Norwood type 1 hairline again. Only problem? You\u2019ve gotta pay for the quality hairline you want. SO, your boy decided to go big again. \n\n\nAnother Canadian play. Another solid gold play. One to hold and enjoy the divvies but also feeling safe that you\u2019re in at price levels that existed before we wasted our time in the Middle East.\n\n\n That play? Suncor. TSE: SU, NYSE: SU\n\n\nYou may be thinking, wow this is some slow ass dino-stock that I can\u2019t meme on. However, fatty gains are pretty much guaranteed.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n1.\tEveryone (see: moron analysts) thinks that oil is dead. These fuckers sit around in their downtown condos, wearing Patagonia sweater vests and thinking that just because they don\u2019t drive their compact german executive car as often to mom\u2019s house, that no one is driving at all. Take a look at the suburbs you hedgie-tard, take a look at ASEAN, Asia, Africa etc. People are going to driving their cars (we\u2019ve sold 60 mil+ a year for years, almost all of those are gasoline powered). No one in these meme times can afford a Tesla or a BYD shit box unless you made money on gamestop. Yea I made 100% flipping gamestop in a day, hold my bags. China lays 8000km of highway a year, you\u2019re not going to power that kind of growth with a fucking battery pack Elon.\n\n\n2.\tThe Russian vaccine cannot be underestimated. It\u2019s 91% effective for normal cases and 100% effective against severe and moderate cases according to a study from the Lancet. Russia now has this vaccine produced in South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Pakistan etc. Only rich western countries can afford extended lockdowns, Russia has just liberated the developing worlds economies with a 10$ vaccine that can be stored in a fridge. For all intents and purposes, this pandemic is done. Russia has forced the hand of western supply chains if they want to make money. \n\n\n3.\tSuncor has entered into agreements with Canadian government bodies to retrofit stations with EV charging ports. Suncor has >1800 stations in Canada. If they have to , they can easily pivot their stations into EV charging locations and with consumer presence of mind, everyone knows where their local petro Canada station is. Highly pivotable operations. Why would they let some eco-nerds start an EV charging chain on their soil? \n\n\n4.\tThere's nothing proprietary or mind blowing about EV charging companies, once the big boy gas companies step in, they're just going to install it in the stations that are already there.\n\n\n5.\tGood balance sheet, Warren buffet has been invested for a long time. But he bought the dip and recently sold his the shares he bought in 2020. He still has >13m shares, FMR bought about $500 million worth of Suncor in the last quarter. Strong free cash flow through gas stations (one place you can still go during the entire pandemic without masks, gloves or any requirements, been open for business this whole time).\n\n\n6.\tThey can maintain dividends at WTI $35 according to their report, if WTI stays >55 this is a no brainer. Currently the market is pricing in about $55 wti so once the market prices in $60, on a DCF that makes the company worth $45.8B Canadian. \n\n\n7.\tGeopolitics. Biden isn\u2019t cancelling new drilling permits just because \u201cDUDE SAVE THE PLANET MAN\u201d. America not wasting its hydrocarbon stores is smart in case of a protracted conflict in the Pacific with China. Why ship oil in from the Saudis and Venezuela when you have a shit ton of shale safe in Texas. America is rich enough to have countries deplete their own reserves for America\u2019s consumption and Canada is happy to help. The Keystone pipeline oil will just get shipped down on trains owned by Berkshire and Bill Gates (yea gates owns like 14% of CN rail and is the largest shareholder of that rail company, the more you know lol). The TMX pipeline is full steam ahead and will be completed by dec 2022. This completition will help shrink the gap between WCS and WTI and allow Canada to sell its oil all around the world. Suncor has committed to fill these pipes with its juice too.\n\n\n8.\tOur X-Factor. [This guy](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FF2LGW7EAU5O5FUGMDLZKTFU4E.jpg) did a giant tour around India and ASEAN promoting Canadian business. What is Canadian business? Mostly natural resources and finance lol. We\u2019re going to sell our Oil Sands through the port of BC to developing Asian nations around the world and help them gain energy independence from China. Canada standing by ready to help keep the free-world, free. You think this guy went around the pacific just for fun? \n\n\n9.\tThe last quarter showed great cost management and shows that Suncor is looking after shareholder interests. Shareholder interest in this sector are no  longer about growing production capacity but about delivering value to shareholder through dividends and buybacks. Management has already started buying back shares and its just a matter of time before they reinstate the dividend to .42 cents a share\u2026.every quarter LOL\n\n\n10.\tHedge against inflation. We\u2019ve printed a shit ton of dollars and now people want to tell me that a barrel of oil (148L of oil, equal to 20-30 gallons of gasoline and 10-20 gallons of diesel) should only cost $60 usd? $60 usd? I shit on $60. $60 wont even get a Saudi prince the paint on his tomahawk missles. Fuck off with this fake scam money, commodities serve a specified purpose and their value is derived from that. \n\n\n11.\tMarko Kolanovic, a quant at JPM who LITERALLY called the bottom of the corona market dump says were entering a new oil \u201csupercycle\u201d. If someone that smart and connect says it, then you don\u2019t even need to listen to me anymore. Suncor was trading at 40$ cad before this pandemic came around, and it will again.\n\n\nFor all you cr*pto-morons, here: SU-coin is a limited quantity e-coin that returns you .21 to .42 cents  a quarter and each day grows its proportional share of Canada\u2019s second largest oil producer through management buying coins and destroying them. Wow so cool. \n\n\nPositions: 5000 SU at 17.22\n\nThanks  \n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf15", "id": "llfxof", "created_utc": 1613516123.0, "score": 443, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "Great job, Saitama!", "score": 55, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07415158301591873}, {"body": "I\u2019m not taking any advice from a baldy", "score": 264, "replies": [{"body": "Jeff Bezos would like to know your location", "score": 106, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.028621595352888107}, {"body": "Smart man", "score": 50, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20105040073394775}, {"body": "Technically elon is balding", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3525511920452118}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1767522692680359}, {"body": "> Your favorite Canadian autist is back.\n\nIs fscomeau standing behind you or something?", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Now that is a name I have not heard in a long time", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "That you,  shaft?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22846867144107819}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3205677568912506}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25517407059669495}, {"body": "Congrats baldy, so lotta reading thxs for info., So you bought in November? & .... and waiting to let us know today cmon man...", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "He wants us to meme it for him", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15492133796215057}, {"body": "Secrets out oil is going up and forecast is calling for warm weather next weeks sell your Canada Goose Jackets eh", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23038190603256226}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11531286686658859}, {"body": "Dude just save your money.
