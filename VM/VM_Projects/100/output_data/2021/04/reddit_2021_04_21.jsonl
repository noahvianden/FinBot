When I started investing years ago, I learned some rule of thumb that a P/E over 15 is where a stock starts to get expensive - I know it depends on the type of stock, as growth stocks always have higher P/Es. But I want to point out where the 15 came from: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn times with normal interest rates (e.g. year 2000) you got 5-6 % interests on your bank account \u2013 risk free. So if you would have put 10.000$ on your account, after 15 years (by compound interest) you would have gained about 10.000$. So in the world of stocks your bank account would have had a P/E of **15** (!). So there was some good reason needed to invest in a company that gains less earnings than your bank account could do. \n\n  \n\nAt the moment my bank account has a P/E of 278, but we still asses P/Es the same way. In years with QE and a something like 0.25% interests this doesn\u2019t makes too much sense for me anymore. Therefore all that comparison of the P/E of the 2000 bubble doesn\u2019t sound very plausible while taking interest rates into account.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo maybe we should keep in mind that cheap or expensive has also something to do with the alternatives you have (and actually there are almost zero).", "id": "mvi51b", "created_utc": 1619018934.0, "score": 210, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "This is true however that also makes these valuations even more sensitive to interest rate rises which we know are coming.", "score": 107, "replies": [{"body": "Do we really know that high interest rates are comming the next years (more than something like 1.x %)?
