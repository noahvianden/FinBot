Play in this order.\n\n**Hat in the Wind** \\- **Themselves**\n\n**Light Work - Prof**\n\n**All that Glitters - Dead Elvis**\n\nI spent today at work in a sort of elevated and removed state.  The feeling of wanting to puke in every trashcan you walk by mixed with the just-above-ground-floating-weightlessness of an empty portfolio. It was something akin to a cactus whose skin people drink in a jungle I was once in.  Truly my spirit is no longer burdened by excessive wealth. Was it even mine though.. Zen masters believe you reincarnate through every door you walk through, Someone real sensitive said \"May we always just begin to see our selves as something else and smile\"\n\n**Some of you, well let me correct myself, many of you will know this feeling.**  The brief apparition of gold that appears in the middle of a trade which does not deter you from continuing some sort of mad ascension, pressing the gas pedal to the floor as you rocket into Valhalla as fast as you smash out. I want to be with you and join your YOLO'd ranks. I know these 5 digits are nothing compared to the magnanimous losses that sit on red thrones much larger than mine but its all relative right.  Life is too short to be a bitch and chicks dig scars.\n\n**The specific details are a blur.**  GOEV is a fast bitch.  She's got a lot to offer just not now.  What tony has in his hat will take probably months to percolate... Shorts are in control and will be now that retail has been absolutely beaten up.  They will probably bail in some shape or form one of the first chances they get.  **There will always be a core group of supporters which I am one of. I really believe in the tech.  I believe that they have the power to disrupt transportation like the Model T did.**\n\nNews will be released soon and I would say that its going to be on a scale of -10 which is Lawsuits have traction to 10 which is Apple Car.  Factory and manufacturing partner with some pre-orders is probably a 5-7 depending... You're going to need an 8+ to kick off a naughty squeeze... Or someone will have to take on the unified shorts in the sector. The big move will be convincing institutions to buy in and catch the paper hands of the bailing retail.  Canoo must have a better ground game.  This will either be Cloughvis (God damnit I cant even use your ticker you absolute piece of shit stock because your market cap is too weak for WSB)or CLOV, Canoo gets to pick.  (Watch news drop tomorrow lulz).  Most good stock value plays are pain trains until they are not.\n\n**Personally I need to learn to take gains**, be a bit less believing in my own confirmation bias bullshit.  I need to add a few months if not more to most options plays.  I also need to dark side a bit more and also run spreads. I also have to realize. Shorts are fucking violent and can bring pain.  They don't give up easy and fight on multiple fronts.\n\n**Anyways I would like to thank all of you who joined me on this descent** into a sort of infatuated madness that could only be described as the autistic form of dementia that Lewis Carrol suffered from.  The following is a list of names and by no means is exhaustive but its the ones I can find right now.  I will continue to add as I re-read all the kind messages people have sent.  It has been a strange and crazy trip friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Thank you the u/JN_KU,|Thank you my brother u/TheNightOwlf,|Thank you u/dekkars|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Thank you u/planereflection|thank you u/bagtf3|Thank you u/Weird__Fish|\n|Thank you u/misterinvicta|thank you u/pennyether|Thank you u/the_real_lustlizard|\n|thank you Papa Manpreet|thank you u/BigProfessional1168|thank you u/mmanofsteel86|\n|thank you u/Basket_Fragrant|thank you u/megahuts|thank you  u/bartlomieju|\n|thank you u/cheeseheroplopcake|thank you u/Nekozuchi|thank you Discord Bros|\n|thank you  u/Business-Elbow|thank you u/Ey_Yo_Gurl||\n||u/sessh172||\n\nI do want to leave this, let me dismount my one trick pony and talk about the past and the future.\n\n**I've spent a lot of time in the past getting into fist fights with death** (and only sometimes winning) and I realized that money doesn't mean a lot.  There's a certain level of financial stability which gets you to a point where you have everything on auto-pay and that works as long as you don't piss off your boss or still like your job. But its really just another stress in life. Enough money will buy you a seat next to the window at the SNF or all the experiences in life you can want.  But that yellow stretcher doesn't give a fuck where it finds you...  It will be there for you one day just the same. Please don't fucking waste your time its all you have. My **Hurt Circus** people will know what I'm talking about all lights, sirens boots on and beard on fire.\n\nBut fuck it, I want to be rich.\n\n**The future,** at least as it pertains to this particular writing project of mine will be a rags to riches project.  We'll see if I have what it takes.  I'm open to suggestions of tickers or if you want me to write on something particular send it over and I'll give it a look. I encourage you to upload your own GOEV loss porn in the comments. But also if you won. Maybe show that off to...\n\nBut in the meantime I'll see you there.\n\nBe well.\n\nBL\n\n# Previous $GOEV WSB Editions\n\n1. [$GOEV - The Bull CASE of Canoo INC.

WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.\n\n* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**\n* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**\n* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**\n* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**\n* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**\n* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing my writing. I\u2019m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning\n\nIt appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:\n\n1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.\n2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)\n\nOne must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)\n\nI\u2019ve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:\n\n>\"An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:\n\n1. Google is fueled by customer\u2019s need for answered information.\n2. Online video games are fueled by a customer\u2019s need for adventure.\n3. Reddit is fueled by a customer\u2019s need for community.\n4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer\u2019s need for ideas.\n5. Facebook is fueled by a customer\u2019s need to connect.\"\n\nIn this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)\n\nI typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)\n\nOnline games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.\n2. The ability to deeply engage.\n3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.\n\nSome of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.\n\nThis is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of \"learning the game\"  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.\n\n[Andragogic\\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)\n\nI could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:\n\n1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.\n2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.\n3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)\n\nSome of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.\n\nYet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)\n\nWith that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:\n\n1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)\n2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)\n3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)\n\nWhat an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.\n\nHowever, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.\n\nA young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:\n\n>\u201cWhy do I need to learn this?\u201d\n\nIt turns out, the answer is not\n\n>\u201cso you can become a scientist!\u201d\n\nbut to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality\n\n>\u201cI need to learn this, so that I can create that.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEngineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.\n\nSome of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)\n\nAnother huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.\n\nYou may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:\n\n1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.\n2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.\n3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.\n\nThis language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.\n\n>\"The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1989](https://preview.redd.it/s0pl9rby5qt61.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aba26a92988fee33e889e1bc394a3a226216978)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Roblox Vision\n\n>\"We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)\n\nUnderstanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.\n\n1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).\n2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).\n\n[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)\n\nThere are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as \"disruption\". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:\n\n1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.\n2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.\n3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)\n4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956\n\nThe reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:\n\n1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.\n2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.\n3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  \n>  \n>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer\u2019s experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user\u2019s monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440\n\nIn my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.\n\nSome uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.\n\nAnother example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12\n\nThe possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b\n\nAnother core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:\n\n>\" At Roblox, we\u2019re continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we\u2019ve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there\u2019s an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  \n>  \n>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3ekqlxbcqt61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b570d094f476c8fb211a2c68e02e0617b8f78c91\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThere was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.\n\nA significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCover: [https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730501/cover\\_nsaynw.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/eduprojectsil/image/upload/v1618730501/cover_nsaynw.jpg)", "id": "msq9jg", "created_utc": 1618664355.0, "score": 239, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "So what op is saying is that video games...nvm I honestly didn\u2019t read any of it.", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Attaboy", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06552217900753021}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.388143926858902}, {"body": "Don't forget their yearly losses, more liabilities to assets, and their market cap being twice as high as Take-Two Interactive", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "Right, that's the thing.

Feel free to criticize any of the data presented.\n\nHere are some facts that are not being widely disputed for reference:\n\n* There are 145,345,832 Class A shares outstanding -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)\n* The CEO owns 0 Class A shares -[source](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521102551/d89571d10k.htm)\n* There are 38,504,281 Shares Short as of March 31st 2021- source: FactSet can't provide link but it seems as though this figure is not being disputed.\n\nWhat is being disputed specifically is the number of shares that are part of the publicly traded float:\n\nYesterday FactSet reported that float was \\~26.3M shares down from what they were reporting 2 days ago at \\~109.8M shares. FactSet had subtracted 83.5M shares from the float making the denominator in the SI/Float equation plummet causing the short interest% to skyrocket to 140%+. FactSet incorrectly made this subtraction. **The CEO's shares were NEVER part of FactSet's calculated Float to begin with.** FactSet's float had always consisted of tradable Class A shares, yet it subtracted the CEO's Class B shares from the float. My guess is that someone challenged the data provided by FactSet and an analyst at FactSet changed the number according to the challenge but did not spend the time to properly verify the validity of the data they were changing. Now the number has been changed back to 109M shares float.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the 10k:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[10K color coded](https://preview.redd.it/asn64bf8hst61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e98280fa82eb00501fdaa8e5d10d811a678b65f0)\n\nThis 10k is very easily misinterpreted without looking at the subscripts at the bottom. There is so much overlap when it comes to shares owned. Reading the subscript #3 at the bottom we can see that **Chamath's 30M shares are overlapped with the 20M and 10M shares owned by SCH Sponser III LLC and ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC** respectively. This means that the shares owned by SCH Sponsor III LLC + the shares owned by ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC + the shares owned by Chamath's = 30,500,000.\n\nFurther, Entities affiliated with Ian Osborne also own 25,500,000 Class A shares. As we above, 20,500,000 of those shares are from SHC Sponsor III LLC **which are already included in Chamath's 30,500,000 Class A shares.** This leaves an extra 5M shares owned by Ian Osborne that are not related to entities owned by Chamath.\n\nTherefore, there are 30,500,000 + 5,000,000 = 35,500,000 Class A shares owned by Insiders and locked up. **The rest, 145,345,832 - 35,500,000 =  109,845,832, are part of the Float.**\n\nTaking the #of shares short and dividing by the Float that we calculated gives us:\n\n(38,504,281 /  109,845,832) \\* 100 = **35.05301958 % of float being shorted.**\n\nNow to clear up some more misconceptions:\n\n[Vanguard's 26,185,529 Class A shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000110465921049151/tv0001-cloverhealthinvestmen.htm) are completely tradable and not locked up whatsoever and therefore, are still part of the float.\n\n*Processing img qxzqcfeajst61...*\n\nIt is clear from a close reading of the 10k that there are many things wrong with the data here:\n\n1. Vanguard should not be considered as part of the Class A Lockup shares since they can freely trade AND lend shares. Therefore, those 26,185,529 shares **should not** be subtracted from the shares outstanding.\n2. The creator of this table failed to realize that Chamath's 30M shares are the same as SCH Sponsor III and ChaChaCha SPAC C's shares and mistakenly subtracts them from the shares outstanding twice. Further, 20M of Ian Osborne's shares are wrongly being subtracted as well since they are overlapped with SCH Sponsor III.", "id": "msy9s3", "created_utc": 1618690782.0, "score": 185, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "You guys have a potential gamma squeeze play but not a short squeeze play.
