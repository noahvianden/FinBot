{"title": "Does Anyone In This Sub Take Risks? Or is Everyone Just in SPY/Funds/Big Tech?", "selftext": "During this major \\~10 week long correction for growth stocks, I can't help but notice that the vast majority of people on this sub seem to have changed their investment strategy completely(unless most people are just new and super bearish because they lost money). Any mention of any growth company gets met with negative, pessimistic and unrealistic attitude. Everyone says to stay away from 'reddit stocks' which seems to be the new term for 'meme stocks'.\n\nEver since everything that happened with Gamestop, it now seems taboo to invest in anything that isn't MSFT or AAPL or SPY. There used to be more discussion surrounding undervalued stocks. Discussion surrounding anything other than value has diminished almost entirely and everyone asking for advice surrounding growth just gets the same mindless response from the zombies that infest this sub. \"No revenue = Shit company,\" \"Don't buy anything you see people talk about on reddit,\" \"Hype for growth stocks is dead\" so on and so forth.\n\nIgnoring the fact that 95% of all growth stocks just dropped anywhere from 30-70% in the last couple months(and some are prime for loading up), why does everyone still seem to think that everything is overvalued? Why does it seem like almost no one is talking about investing with the future in mind. Everyone is only talking about today/short term, and most people seem very bearish about literally any investment. \n\nI never really think to follow this advice, but in my opinion I haven't seen this fearful of a market in the 3 years I've been investing. I haven't been around for the longest but I do know that most of the pessimism surrounding growth right now is unreasonable and downright stupid. I've been using this opportunity to 'be greedy when others are fearful'. I have allocated a decent amount of my portfolio betting on growth stocks that get all the hype when they're going up, but everyone hates them when they're going down. \n\n'Last years picks' is a term I hear a lot lately, and I find it funny. Everyone wants a piece of the pie that no one can afford but when everyone can afford it, no one talks about it. It's really interesting to see how many people are willing to jump into a S.P.@.C. or a growth company after it shoots up 300%, and when it corrects people don't make the reasonable conclusion of 'maybe I bought the hype and now I need to ask myself if it's worth holding and if I like this company'. Instead, the overwhelming sentiment becomes 'Man, this company is shit. Why the hell did I buy it? It would be better to sell at a loss, forget about this company and put it all into SPY, the safer play.' I don't know who has noticed, but value is at all time highs and growth is at all time lows. Which has more room to grow, and which seems like the better investment right now? I think it's obvious.\n\nWhen most sectors are down on no news, it clearly has nothing to do with the company. EVs, Gene stocks, growth stocks, S.P.@.Cs, etc etc are all down rn. That doesn't mean the companies are all garbage and going bankrupt like most people are saying.

In 2020, conventional loans represented 84% of total production.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/HbIbboK](https://imgur.com/a/HbIbboK)\n\n3% margin on all loans (54billion worth for Q4 2020)\n\n>\u201cClosed loan volume\u201d and \u201cTotal gain margin\u201d are key operational metrics  that UWM management uses to evaluate the performance of the business. \u201cClosed loan volume\u201d is the aggregate principal of the  residential mortgage loans originated by UWM during a period. \u201cTotal  gain margin\u201d represents total loan production income divided by total production.\n\ngiving them 1.37b for Q4 profit - which they reported in the 8k [here](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312521027468?cik=1783398).\n\nYou can see the breakdown of that 54 billion below. 3/4 is refinance.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/zTu0RpJ](https://imgur.com/a/zTu0RpJ)\n\nOf the purchase loans they do, conventional loans are their leading area and the area they'd like to target and grow in. They are a good company and have a lot of good shit going for them, they originate fastest in the market, they're not giving out shitty loans (their average client has a 758 credit score and a 36% DTI) and the wholesale channel is growing and their chunk of that channel is also growing. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. **Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026.** Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books.\n\nNow they do note that with increasing rates their purchase volume [did go up](https://content.bamsec.com/0001564590-21-014601/gz10gtccfgdk000008.jpg) and that they are and do want to focus on origination of purchase loans, but that doesn't mean that a lot of their growth wasn't [from refinance in the last year](https://content.bamsec.com/0001193125-20-296072/g72619ex99_1p38g1.jpg).\n\n>We  seek to have a balanced loan origination business model, with relatively higher purchase over refinancing mix which we believe has demonstrated the ability to deliver strong, stable and consistent growth  in mortgage loan origination volume and profitability through both high  and low interest rate cycles.\u00a0 Our model is focused on the origination business, with a specific focus on purchase loans; this area of the  market has grown consistently over the last several years and, we  believe, is more durable with respect to interest rate fluctuations than  the refinance market. Historically, residential purchase mortgage loan  origination volume has experienced less volatility in response to  interest rate movements than the refinancing mortgage loan origination  volume. Consequently, we believe that by focusing on the purchase  business we will be better positioned to deliver consistent growth in  increasing and decreasing rate environments. In rising interest rate  environments, we believe that our demonstrated reputation for excellent  client service and short loan closing times will drive continued  purchase mortgage volume, our broad client base will allow us to  capitalize on lead generation and our cost structure will allow us to be  more competitive on margins.\n\nI've been buying a bunch sub 7.99 but I'm only somewhat bullish and turning more neutral towards them. Their margins are good compared to the competition and they do make a lot of money from origination, but the industry is cyclical, and while I'm thinking the market remains hot for at least 1 more full year, I don't know how far I see it growing beyond that. I'm happy to buy at these prices and have a slow melt upwards, but this isn't something I think reddit has the patience for.\n\n* [https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312521027468?cik=1783398](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312521027468?cik=1783398)\n* [https://www.bamsec.com/filing/156459021014601/1?cik=1783398](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/156459021014601/1?cik=1783398)\n* [https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520296072?cik=1783398](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520296072?cik=1783398)", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Good info here.
