SHA-256 is a \"hashing algorithm\u201d with certain properties that is key to how Bitcoin works in several areas. Hashing algorithms can be used in decentralized data stores to make it expensive to add data to the decentralized data store, while at the same time making very cheap to verify if a potential transaction added by someone else on the network to your clone of the datastore was added only after spending a lot of expensive electricity. One way it is used in Bitcoin is such that 1) you have to use a lot of computing power to be able to add a transaction (or techincally speaking, a block of \\~2759 transactions) to the network and 2) if some wants to verify that you used a lot of computing power (rather than you just being able to say \"I used a lot of computing power guys! Let me add the following transaction to the network (you transferring 1000 BTC to your address)\" and have everyone trust you) they can do so themselves with very little computational power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I understand correctly, currently it costs some amount less than $300k (depends on the price of your electricity / your mining rig setup) to submit a block of (about 2759  transactions to the BTC network. Simply speaking, the way BTC uses SHA-256 is it creates a virtual haystack and virtual needle and forces bitcoin nodes trying to add blocks (of transactions) to find that needle in that computational haystack. Every 2 weeks the BTC network tweaks how it uses SHA-256 to make that haystack a bit bigger or smaller, such that taking into account all the bitcoin miners in the world, some miner will on average find a needle in a new haystack every 10 minutes. Since currently the reward for finding that needle (the BTC network rewards people who spend electricity to add transactions to the network) is 6.25 BTC, miners currently must on average be able to find the needle with less than $312.5k (= 6.25 BTC \\* $50k USD/BTC) of compute costs to profitably operate themselves on the network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe \"256\" in SHA-256 means that some of the numbers being used to construct this virtual haystack, are 256 bits in length, aka there are 2\\^256 such numbers, also known as 1.16 \\* 10\\^77 numbers. As you could imagine, this enables the Bitcoin network to create very complex haystacks that take a lot of search time to find the needle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe BTC protocol is actually pretty simple and a lot of programmers learn it for fun. All this shows is that Andrej is nerd who likes learning stuff, not necessarily that TSLA is going into crypto, though if their powerwalls and megapacks end up creating excess energy w/ negative prices, attaching those to crypto mining rigs would be a no brainer IMO.

{"title": "MinMed is a bubble", "selftext": "Edit 1: Tried to warn y\u2019all\n\nAs an MD, MPH going into psychiatry residency, I\u2019ve been following this stock for a while. Never bought into it because I\u2019m not an OTC special kinda retard. What is it? Multinational Pharma research company dealing with psychedelics such as psilocybin and MDMA. It\u2019s about to be listed on the NASDAQ on April 27th under the ticket $MNMD. Friday, the stock price jumped 65%.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, these therapies are on the path for FDA approval... eventually. The research insofar has been promising for treatment-resistant depression and PTSD. But MindMed doesn\u2019t have anything past phase 2 clinical trials. THERE IS NO INDICATION THEY WILL GET ANYTHING ONTO THE MARKET IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS. According to the FDA, about 33% of drugs which make it to phase 2 actually pass onto phase 3. That being said: if you\u2019re willing to take those odds and have disposable income, have at it. But also think about the clinical practicality. On the company\u2019s website, they describe their therapy as giving patients psilocybin, blindfolding them, and giving them headphones with a special playlist so they can vibe out FOR 8 HOURS.\nHow is this practical in an outpatient doctor\u2019s office? Until there is an abortive treatment for psilocybin trips, I don\u2019t see this working out on a large scale.\nSure, the stock will likely pop off for a couple days. But it has been WAY overhyped by stock subreddits. I\u2019m planning to play this with deep OTM CCPs and buying puts for 1-2 months down the road when they become available. \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9 \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b\n\nEdit 2: If you attack my credentials and my character, it may help the stock go back up", "id": "mxw9x8", "created_utc": 1619308745.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.3, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for the insight Doc but I\u2019m buying in on Monday.", "score": 165, "replies": [{"body": "Can confirm.
