If tsla goes to 800 next week and the person exercises I still make the 23000 and also another 1800 from selling the shares at a higher price.\n\nThere has to be a way to lose money selling covered calls but I'm too retarded to figure out how.

But you should not look at this as a \u201ccan\u2019t lose\u201d proposition.\n\nHere are things to think about:\n\n1. You won\u2019t lose money on a sold call so long as you\u2019re content to either let it expire worthless or have your shares called away. But you can lose money in the underlying. That brings me to...\n\n2. TSLA moves around a LOT. Huge price swings in both directions are par for the course with this stock. I would not be surprised to see it pull back pretty sharply into the 600s by the end of the week. Nor would I be surprised to see it hit $900. That\u2019s just kind of what TSLA does.\n\n3. If you buy now at $762 and the price drops to, say, $660, think carefully about what this will mean for you. If you have enough money that you\u2019re comfortable taking risk and won\u2019t need to liquidate to pay bills etc., it might be fine. But be careful. You may think you will just keep selling calls until you\u2019re back at a break even or a profit. But a weekly call that\u2019s $100 OTM will get you very little premium. Are you going to sit and sell at a 760 strike for peanuts until the stock comes back? Sell closer to the money and risk your shares getting called away at a pretty significant loss? There are no necessarily right or wrong answers here but you do need to think about it. (I\u2019m stuck selling shitty little calls agains a stock that dropped hard after I bought it and seems like it may stay there for quite a while, and it\u2019s not a fun place to be).\n\n4. There\u2019s also the flip side of the scenario. TSLA could go the other way and hit 900 or even higher before you know it. So if your shares get called away at $780 that may be fine for you this week, but it also means you could get priced out of the play for a while. You can write a put to try to get back in but if it really breaks away and you don\u2019t have more cash to kick in, you\u2019re left selling puts for peanuts while missing all that upside. (This just happened to me with ROKU, which acts a lot like Tesla. I had a cc at $350 and my shares got called away Friday. It opened up high on Monday and the premium on writing a $350 put to get back in is so low it\u2019s barely worth it. And I don\u2019t have more money to throw at that trade so I\u2019m now having to go back to the drawing board and figure out where else I can put my money.)\n\nHope this is helpful and good luck.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "This is definitely making me second geuss myself lol.

Here is the link: [http://ir.viacomcbs.com/streamingevent](http://ir.viacomcbs.com/streamingevent)\n\nNow lets talk about the GIANT that is ViacomCBS.\n\nViacomCBS comprises four major units:\n\n* CBS Entertainment Group consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television, CBS Television Stations, and CBS Interactive. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.\\[47\\]\n* Domestic Media Networks encompasses the pay television channels owned byViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix. ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.\n* International Networks encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third\\[48\\] of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18.\\[49\\] This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.\n* Global Distribution Group focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.\n\nOther assets owned by ViacomCBS include the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, the company's flagship subscription streaming service Paramount+, over-the-top ad-supported video-on-demand platform Pluto TV, book publisher Simon & Schuster, multi-genre online video conference VidCon, mixed martial arts promoter Bellator, and media and entertainment company AwesomenessTV. As of November 2019, AwesomenessTV is overseen by its co-founder Brian Robbins, an executive for ViacomCBS Domestic. The company also has an undisclosed stake in FuboTV, acquired in 2020.\n\nSee: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS)\n\nFor a list of all assets owned by ViacomCBS: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_assets\\_owned\\_by\\_ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_ViacomCBS)\n\nViacom's audience reach is very broad, as their content is vast and appeals to all kinds of demographics. Let's talk about just Paramount Plus alone for. I know a bunch of fucktards didnt like the release of P+ but its not about just yourself, its about the potential appeal to other people who have likes and dislikes that differ from yourself.\n\nP+ not only has a ton of content but also LIVE FUCKING SPORTS!!!!! Here's a look at the more than 1,000 live games P+ is bringing to the table:\n\n* THE NFL ON CBS\n* The Masters\n* NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship\n* PGA TOUR\n* SEC ON CBS\n* The PGA Championship\n* National Women's Soccer League\n* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League --\u00a0*Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.*\n\nIn addition, Paramount+ is expanding its exclusive English-language rights in the U.S. with three more soccer properties, featuring hundreds of additional matches.\n\n* Concacaf -- offering more than 200 Concacaf matches, starting with the Concacaf Nations League Finals in June of this year, which will feature the U.S. Men's National Team. Coverage will feature all 41 national teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean across different competitions, including the qualifiers for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, which will feature the defending champion U.S. Women's National Team.\n* Liga Profesional de Futbol -- Paramount+ will stream more than 300 matches a year from Argentina's top soccer division.\n* Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A -- Paramount+ will stream more than 360 matches a year from Brazil's premier soccer league.\n\nThe service will also be the exclusive home of a long-running, original series\u00a0***Inside the NFL***. And knowing fans don't stop watching when the players stop playing, Paramount+ will feature CBS Sports HQ.\n\nThis is a no brainer. Sports brings in YUUUUUGE revenue and viewership and P+ will have many different kinds of sports that appeal to all kinds of viewers across the globe. Soccer is literally the most popular and watched sport in the world. Honestly from the sports side, all P+ is missing is Cricket. March Madness alone has broken revenue records and the month isn't even over!!!!! Even if corona were to shut it down, VIAC has already gotten more profit than they anticipated, any additional profit are just more blessings!\n\nP+ will also have a bunch of original content coming in the next coming years. Here you can find a list of content coming to P+. [https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/](https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/)\n\nThe one that caught my interest the most was Halo. I remember I bought the Xbox console SOLEY for that game alone, along with millions of other fans. I suspect this alone would bring a lot of attention when released to P+.\n\nViacomCBS also has A LOT of their content licensed out to other companies such as Amazon and Netflix. \"Coming to America 2\" was made by Paramount Studios yet is streaming on Amazon. Why? Because of the shit ton of revenue it brings them.\n\n\"When Disney began developing Disney+, it reclaimed every last piece of programming it had licensed to Netflix (though Disney films released between Jan. 2016 and Dec. 2018 may return to Netflix in 2026). In doing so, the Mouse House sacrificed hundreds of millions of dollars in lucrative licensing revenue in order to build an exclusive in-house library. Yet Paramount Pictures spent 2020 selling off most of its theatrical features to rival streamers while Paramount Network licensed cable\u2019s biggest hit (Yellowstone) exclusively to Peacock. Why? Because ViacomCBS President & CEO of Streaming Tom Ryan believes strategic licensing can be a boom for Paramount+ long-term even if it costs the streamer exclusive access.\" See: [https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/](https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/)\n\nNetflix has gotten significant attention for its massive spending on content. Over the last year, the company's spending on content topped $14.6 billion. ViacomCBS suggested it spent about $13 billion last year on content. It's no secret that spending on content seems to drive streaming revenue. However, some are speculating the company's recently announced $2.5 billion debt offering could be an act of desperation. There is little doubt that the coronavirus pandemic represents a significant challenge, yet ViacomCBS seems to be positioned better than some of its peers.\n\nFor those worried about closed movie theaters, last quarter the company's theatrical revenue equaled just under 2% of total revenue. It's true that advertising makes up the bulk of the company's revenue, yet the company's consistent high-quality content should continue to attract ad dollars. When people are stuck at home, it's likely they are going to watch more video. Whether that means Pluto TV, the traditional CBS, Showtime, or CBS All Access, the company should be able to grow its audience. As the public health crisis eventually fades, the returning ad dollars, combined with a bigger audience, should serve investors and the company well.\n\nAs proof that streaming seems to be the future of ViacomCBS, the company's subscription and video advertising business is expected to grow by 35% to 40%. ViacomCBS has multiple offerings driving its streaming business. The company's Pluto TV service increased its monthly active users in the U.S. by 75% annually. Paid streaming subscriptions increased by 50% year over year domestically. On the flip side, Netflix is witnessing a split in its membership growth. On the domestic side of the house, Netflix's paid memberships increased by a pedestrian 4.4% annually. International has become the company's growth engine, with paid memberships increasing by more than 31% year over year.\n\nThough both ViacomCBS and Netflix are reporting solid growth in subscribers, the former generates significant free cash flow. In the past 12 months, ViacomCBS generated core free cash flow (FCF) of over $3.4 billion.\n\nThe coronavirus may challenge ViacomCBS' short-term results and cause volatility. However, with a yield of nearly 6%\u00a0an almost comically low payout ratio, and a growing streaming business, this represents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nDon't forget Netflix is also cracking down on password sharing. As far as I know, P+ can be shared and streamed on multiple devices at once. I am always streaming my P+ on my computer 24/7 and can watch a soccer match from my mobile device at the same time. Also, P+ doesn't ask me if I am \"still watching\" like Netflix does after some time.\n\nViacomCBS also owns Paramount Pictures, a movie studio that has produced so much great content over the years. Last time I checked, movie theaters are PACKED and movie revenue will continue to explode as we get closer to the summer and as we get more people vaccinated.\n\nAnother interesting thing regarding ViacomCBS is that is currently trading with a P/E ratio of 24.22, much lower than Netflix(85.21), yet Netflix doesn't offer live sports or news and does not generate cable revenue. ViacomCBS is still undervalued and has a lot of room for growth. As of now, the public float of shares is around 543 million shares, while the amount of shares shorted on VIAC is about 19.36% (around 105 million shares). Along with that, there is high institutional ownership of shares (currently 93.86%, see: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional)) and is very possible that an there potential an activist investor has been buying up shares since August of last year. (see:[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge))\n\nInstitutional money has some of the BIGGEST diamond hands ever and they are seemingly continuing to buy up shares and hold, another reason you continue to see VIAC have a strong, daily uptrend. With such high institutional ownership and very low insider ownership (0.2% of total float), that leaves about 6% of shares left available (543 million shares).\n\nsee:[http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/](http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/)\n\nViacom operates a largely decentralized business model. It gets almost 80% of its revenues through a collection of network channels that include MTV, MTV2, VH1, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TV Land, CMT, BET, and Spike. The rest of its revenues come from Paramount Pictures (film) and Harmonix (video games).\n\nThose subsidiaries have their own management teams that are silo-ed off to act in their own self interest. Even when Sumner Redstone was in his physical prime and applied a micro-managing spirit to his holdings, he wasn\u2019t make individual business decisions\u2013he was firing the managers of his subsidiaries for not meeting his short-term expectations. This isn\u2019t Steve Jobs orchestrating the iPhone; Sumner Redstone did not bring you SpongeBob.\n\nWhile most Viacom shareholders are understandably paying attention to the public spat over board control, that is not the issue that would keep me up at night if I were a long-term shareholder. Considering that 80% of revenues come from network channels, my predominant focus would be: How many minutes are being delivered per month by the channels we own?\n\nWe\u2019ve had four nasty recessions in the past century. These are illustrative for helping us figure out the durability of a company\u2019s profits during times of deep distress and aid us in quantifying the harm posed by perceived risks. In the case of Viacom, it actually grew profits from $2.38 per share in 2008 to $2.56 per share in 2009. Profits went from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion even as minutes distributed through the network channels declined by 5%. Advertising rates plummeted, and minutes watched declined by a little bit, and yet the media giant still churned out more cash.\n\nViacom keeps its dividends in the low 30% payout ratio territory so that it can repurchase gobs of stock and boost earnings. It has repurchased 35% of its stock since 2010, taking the share count down from 608 million to 390 million. Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.\n\nViacom keeps its dividends in the low 30% payout ratio territory so that it can repurchase gobs of stock and boost earnings.

Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.\n\nProfits have declined $200 million from $2.2 billion to $2.0 billion over the past five years. That also coincides with a significant period of buybacks so that earnings have actually grown from $3.78 per share in 2011 to somewhere in the low $5 range right now.\n\nPut another way: Viacom the corporation has seen profits decline by 1.89% per year over the last five years, while Viacom shareholders have seen their profits climb by 6.17% per year over the past five years.\n\nEdit: good read and news, more income for VIAC - [https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs)\n\nThe Play:\n\nI believe VIAC will see $175 or higher by EOY. I already have several calls at different strikes, but I plan on getting many more far OTM calls with 2023 expirations and plan on getting more shares. I believe anything after 4/16 expiration with $90-120 strikes would be a good call to look at.\n\n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\n\\*EDIT: Although I still believe $175 EOY is possible, I think $150 is more likely and conservative. I can very much so see this stock at $200 in 2022. I have already gotten OTM LEAPS and will hold on to them like your wife holds her boyfriend at night. For shorter term calls, I would look at $52-$60 calls with at least 2-3 months to expiration, obviously more time is better. This week will be important, if the sell momentum has died down, the only other direction this stock can go is: UP!\n\n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nAlso I am anticipating YUGE sub growth in this year and next. Even if you hate their streaming service, I'm willing to be that you have watched at least 1 VIAC produced show or movie on any of the other stream services you do like and subscribe to. They are going to make money either from you directly subscribing or you watching their content on other services....\\*cough\\*coming to america 2\\*cough\\*....\n\n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nI can imagine a scenario where others who like the stock also like and support the stream with a sub, and unlike other services like Netflix that stops streaming after some time asking you \"are you still watching\", Paramount Plus doesn't. I mean hey, I LOVE VIAC and I LOVE P+ so much that I just  \n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0fwatch\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f shows 24/7. I would love to \ud83d\udc41\ufe0fwatch\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f all their content, although I do fall asleep at sometimes, but the shows and movies keep playing, so I NEVER MISS OUT. Even while at work, on my other computer I leave the shows \ud83d\udc41\ufe0fplaying\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f so I NEVER MISS ANYTHING. Could you imagine others loving the stock and company like I do, \ud83d\udc41\ufe0fwatching\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f all their content NONSTOP? I could only imagine their upcoming \ud83d\udc41\ufe0fearnings report\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f would be insane in that case, and would do wonders to my lovely stock... but again, I'm retarded so what the hell do I know right?\n\n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nIf you know, you know.... \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\nNow I also believe there may be a great opportunity here for those who has been hurt or downed in the battle of GME and AMC, and there has been MANY. Look to VIAC as the healing spell that has been cast on the market. VIAC can rejuvenate your tendies, so you can have more ammo to fight against the hedgies! Should you choose let VIAC heal you, I suggest you leave some tendies with VIAC to continue to grow and multiply, just in case if you go back and goto the GME or AMC fight and get hurt or down in battle once again. That way you can return to the VIAC tendies you had left and didnt touch, which have now created tendie clones that you can use once again in the GME and AMC battle, should you choose to do so! For the battle of GME and AMC will be long and drawn out, you must be adequately prepared!!! TENDIES MAKES MORE TENDIES!!!!\n\nVIAC is the water of life, it heals all those who are weary from battle! Use this power wisely, fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates!\n\nAGAIN, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!!! I AM VERY RETARDED, I LOVE TO EAT CRAYONS, MY FAVORITE IS THE GREEN ONE, IT TASTES LIKE $100 BILLS!!\n\nALSO........\n\nI\n\nLIKE\n\nTHE\n\nSTOCK", "id": "mq2amq", "created_utc": 1618320643.0, "score": 248, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "I'm just going to say this once.

They did have strong success with Sonic, A Quiet Place was really strong a 3 years ago, Rocketman was good too, and they have mission Impossible movies keeping them going, but you will rarely see them competing for any Oscars. Big box office hits to watch out for are snake eyes and Tomorrow something (I forgot the name), but still nothing really exciting.

Idk about global but CBS routinely has the highest ratings among network tv.  Current p/e is around 10 right now.

I think 150 is a super aggressive and highly unlikely bar some huge P+ signup shenanigans.\n\nDisney loves sequels too. We have seen that leveraging existing IP is pretty powerful. However, I agree that is their weakest arm. That being said, I don't think Oscar contention is the biggest thing as everyone seems to just buy highly rated Indie flicks to get prestige these days. With their 8B in cash on hand they can compete in this realm quickly if needed.\n\nAs I said, I agree with some of your points and think this DD is out there (like nearly every DD on this sub).  However, I think 60 for short term is a reasonable target and 80 EOY is not crazy (100 possible but that would take a massive beat an the announcement of some exciting new streaming only series, along with some good movie acquisitions).\n\nEdit: I also upvoted you because having dissenting views is good.

To be fair I don't work in the US so I didn't know, but in Europe, LATAM, Oceania, Viacom channels are tier 2/tier 3 at best (apart from kids, where it's top tier with turner and disney). To note, most tier 1 channels only operate in one country, so I wouldn't be too upset by it. Also looking at total ratings doesn't tell the whole story - ratings on Adults 18-49 are much more valuable than older ones, and channels that skew towards Men also deliver higher ad revenue.\n\n~~Current P/E is 10 if you look at Yahoo Finance, if you look at ViacomCBS and look at their actual figures, it's over 20 ($3.93 EPS). Yahoo Finance is great for an overview, but you need to do your due diligence over that by looking at the company's results that they report.~~ I'm so fucking dumb, you're right P/E is close to 10. I guess I forgot how to divide 40/3.93...\n\nYes, but Disney has a pedigree of delivering excellent films that people go to see. Looking at their finances, Box Office isn't a main revenue driver anyway so it's fair to say you can ignore it. However if they start building strong franchises, then who knows, Viacom might be a strong investment, but looking at what they have coming in this year, it won't be soon. Oscar winning films tend to be part of the $100M club, maybe not the same as the $1B club Avengers is in, but still very strong. Paramount might get 1 film a year in that bracket, could be a couple this year if you consider Mission Impossible a shoe-in to reach that, and then you hope for the best that one of their other big blockbusters is a success.\n\nRe 8B in cash, sure that's strong. 10B total if you count receivables (3B in actual cash). Still 8B in current liabilities, but I am surprised to see such a strong balance sheet vs 2019, I thought with how media was impacted this year it would be worse, but it's significantly better. Fair play.\n\n60 is a good target, but don't be surprise if it doesn't get there this year or even the next 3 years. It's a stock that is really safe and tends to trade flat as it doesn't really see any significant increase in net revenue.\n\nAs you said, I'd much rather have these discussions on this sub than the echo chamber we've seen on some other stocks.

I say that but I do own Sony, so take whatever I say with a pinch of salt). Overall I like Viacom as I used to be one of their vendors in one of their segments, but for me, it's got a long way to go before it grows substantially to be an even bigger media conglomerate.\n\nAlso would be interesting to compare the financials vs Disney, but then again In this sector it's hard as you're never comparing apples with apples, like you don't buy AT&T because it owns Warner or Sony because it owns SPE/SPT/SPHE, it's only part of it.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">Current P/E is 10 if you look at Yahoo Finance, if you look at ViacomCBS and look at their actual figures, it's over 20 ($3.93 EPS).
