{"title": "Results: Using 3,762 TSLA shares to earn more TSLA shares by selling CC's and CSP's on TSLA.", "selftext": "I have a handful of posts in this subreddit earlier this year asking for advice on using a 7 figure TSLA position to sell CC's and CSP's to get more TSLA shares. I'm writing this post to share an update in case it's helpful for others. I didn't start consistently executing this strategy until February other than maybe a handful of trades in January. There have still been some weeks where I haven't sold covered calls as well due to fear of a large upside move but here are my results.\n\n*If this is of value to others, I'll do quarterly updates and link to the old posts. If it's not valuable, just downvote.*\n\n**TSLA Thoughts:**\n\nI am a huge TSLA bull. I bought shares for years prior to the large run-up last year. I believe Tesla will be the world's largest company before 2030. Potentially something earlier like 2025 or 2027 depending on a variety of factors. Plenty disagree. That's fine.\n\nLong term, I'm trying to get as much TSLA as I can.\n\n**Current Tesla portfolio:**\n\n* 3,762 TSLA shares ($2.5M)\n* Occasionally some LEAPS that I buy when I think TSLA is weak, short-term calls in TSLA but a max of $10k in a trade like this. (small percent of account but not really thetagang material though)\n\n**My strategy:**\n\nI sell a combination of covered calls and cash-secured puts on TSLA with the help of my margin in an after tax account and covered calls in retirement but no margin in retirement. My goal is to not get shares called away. On my covered calls, I sell weekly covered calls that are pretty far out of the money. I'll try to track my delta better next quarter but it's probably always less than .1 on every trade other than the CSPs. I also wait and strategically sell covered calls based on various events I know are coming up (e.g after Ark Invest released their new price target on a Friday I sold on a Monday after it ran up a bit in the AM).\n\n* For the CSPs I sell them 30 - 45 days out and will close at around 50% - 70% profit\n* For the CC's, I sometimes roll on a Wednesday to the following Friday if it's a strong day of gains \n\n**Main failure in Q1:**\n\nTSLA's first drop down to $620 I ended up buying to close many of my CSP's at a loss. In total, I lost something like $40k. I really wasn't thinking very clearly and let emotions rule me fearing that the market was going down. Had I just held on the price of TSLA recovered that day back up to around $700. None of the CSPs were expiring soon at the time.\n\nFor me, I only learn by experience and I'm fine losing money while I learn.\n\n**Overall results:**\n\nI have other stocks that I have sold covered calls on but I'll exclude them from the results.\n\n* Retirement account: 1600 shares\n* Started early Feb: **$13,570 in gains to date**\n\n* After tax account: 2162 shares\n* Started in Feb: **$6,388 in gains to date** \n*(Caveat: I have $20k in short term TSLA options gains that have buyoed these results that aren't really thetagang material, so without those I'd still be digging out of the hole a bit).*\n\nWhen I began this strategy I was looking for something really low risk like .1% per week selling covered calls. So for example, a 4/16 815c would qualify based on Friday closing price of $677. Now I find myself being a little more aggressive in my retirement account because getting called away isn't a taxable event. I'm less aggressive with covered calls in my taxable account but I'm more aggressive with my CSPs mostly selling ATM or 10% OTM (below current strike) because a worst case scenario of being assigned shares above the current price of TSLA isn't too much of a concern to me.\n\nAdditionally, at first I was looking to just buy TSLA shares but now I'm doing a bit of both. I'll buy TSLA with premiums if I think the share price is low and other times I'll buy other stock. I have a couple hundred shares of TWTR that I bought just using covered call premiums for instance.\n\nI believe Q2 will be a better indicator of how I can do with this strategy when I do it more consistently.\n\nI'm interested in any feedback and I should mention I am not an expert at all. I am just trying to find ways to use a large account balance to make more money. If I include other stocks for my retirement account that I sold covered calls on then my results for Feb - April so far are more like $30k+ in gains.", "id": "moz0g6", "created_utc": 1618173964.0, "score": 239, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Firstly - major props for the effort and sharing.\n\nReading all of this, and doing a couple of quick calculations, I\u2019m thinking this is a lot of effort for 20 - 30 grand.\nIt makes a lot work, and if I followed correctly, you had to have lost on a least a little of the biggest upside I think I have ever seen on TSLA last year.\nAnd, you add some risk.

I'll reply with a few different points:\n\n* 1. I've had a few losses. \n\nA. One time I had 5 CSPs that I sold on TSLA (note: I'm using my margin to sell the puts) and I bought to close some of those CSPs after a really steep decline one day in TSLA rather than just holding on and seeing if the stock would come back. That was a $40k whoopsie.\nB. I had a 725p that I decided to take assignment on so I could wheel the shares out. I've sold covered calls on that set of 100 shares 3 times now and haven't had them called away yet. So not  really a loss yet because if TSLA goes above 725 sometime soon there are odds that I have a covered call sold to get the shares called away at a profit.\n\n* 2. \"Picking up pennies in front of a steamroller\"\n\nThis is where it's tough. My attitude was that my position size is large enough that it was worth the effort to see if I could make this work. Q2 should be a much better judge now that I've learned a lot more. I think I could probably do like $20k - $30k a month which I do think would be worth the effort. \n\nThere are only 5 times in the past 52 weeks that TSLA has gone up over 24% in a week. My covered calls are often less than 24% out, but in these situations where it's gone up over 24% in a week the following week historically has been a lower gain. Only one time was it like back to back massive weeks. So I figured that I could roll up and out until the stock leveled out. Worst case, I could use my margin and buy to close and re-evaluate.\n\n* 3. If you need income just sell 5% or less of your TSLA\n\nI'm still working a job and running some businesses that I own. I'd rather not sell any shares until Tesla is at a multi-trillion marketcap. Instead, I think \"Well, if I can add $200k into TSLA at these prices now that will be $1M or more later this decade\". Granted, plenty of people don't see it with Tesla.\n\n* 4. I hope you\u2019re not YOLOing it. At the levels you are at - capital growth is usually less important than capital management.\n\nI have other assets. If all of my TSLA was gone, I would still be fine. If I was retired and not earning an active income I would consider rebalancing my portfolio.\n\nOverall: I'll see what I can do in Q2 and do a new thread.\n\nI am not ruling out the possibility that this could be a waste of time and potentially cost me some money.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I think the comment \"I'm waiting for a multi-trillion dollar market cap\" is insane.\n\nTesla has 2 - 3 years *MAX* before they start getting real competition in US.

The last time they did this they took Crimea. They don't really fuck around, they don't have our kind of money to waste. For the students of history: you don't just wait until spring to move troops in Russia and not use them. Ukraine has said it [will not back down](https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/547541-ukraine-says-it-will-not-back-down-to-russian-pressure) from aggression. They aren't in NATO but have been [trying to get in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations). Worrisome situation over there.\n\n**China** is acting pretty fucking ballsy, talking a lot of shit at the [Alaska summit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/asia/us-china-alaska-blinken-intl-hnk/index.html), with the Chinese media hailing Wang Yi as a hero for his criticism of America's history of oppression and racism. They are using our arguments against us, and their people love it. The same ambassador just [warned the US](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3128371/chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-warns-asean-be-alert-external) against getting involved in Myanmar. They are throwing down in the middle east with a brand new [25-year accord with Iran](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-set-to-sign-25-year-strategic-accord-with-china-during-fms-visit/). Chinese jets are [running sorties](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-flies-warplanes-near-taiwan-in-show-of-force-prompting-u-s-warning-11611513299) past Taiwan. Kinda sketchy, yeah?\n\n**Myanmar** is in a full state of civil war, which many of you will know about because of that [fucking dance meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/myanmar-coup-dance-instructor-videos).

[Piles of bodies](https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/piles-of-bodies-seen-in-myanmar-as-violence-escalates-reports/) have been spotted. Seems sort of brazen, right?\n\nWell, this is the world on the brink. It's happened before in history. **Powder kegs happen**. The stresses to the international system by the virus sort of guaranteed this would happen. The goal of China is to become the new reserve currency, and things are going great for them in this regard. The Chinese [Belt and Road](https://fortune.com/2021/03/24/china-belt-road-initiative-soft-power/) initiative is killing it in Africa and other developing parts of the world. They are getting 99-yr leases and debt-trapping small countries, whose leaders walk away with big fat Chinese money as they sell their countries down the river. I wish they had a ETF.\n\nI am no psychic, I cannot predict how war will happen. I can't tell you how we'll get dragged in. But I can tell you that we are the biggest weapons manufacturer in the world, and war has been historically enormously rewarding for war profiteers. Again, **powder kegs happen, and you want to be invested in the explosion when you see one.** Here's how:\n\n**BA**\\- These fuckers [drop engines](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/22/dutch-investigate-boeing-747-after-engine-parts-drop-after-takeoff-netherlands) on houses in flyover country and go on a run. Insanely bullish, with vaccines and travel lining up at the same time as international tensions rise, BA is in an amazing position for the rest of 2021.\n\n**RTX**\\- Biden's cabinet is full of Raytheon guys. They are positioned to cash in on air-to-air missile contracts, air defense systems, missile interceptors, fucking everything. Tensions are the best thing for this company because they can get in there and start moving their defense equipment. They are on the cutting edge of advanced technology, not only landing defense and civil contracts, but also cybersecurity solutions. These guys are the fucking best in the world, and they have been landing contracts nonstop. The Pentagon just gave them and LMT a contract for [missile interceptors](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2021/03/next-generation-interceptor-thing-contract-announced/172870/). This is a company dabbling in money and power most of us can't fathom.\n\n**LMT**\\- This thing has been [outpacing the broader market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-outpaces-stock-215009624.html) lately, as it goes on an earnings run. Up 11% in the past month, it's the strongest in the class. Earnings are estimated at $26.32 per share, year-over-year change of +7.43%. This company is a big fat juicy hog and lined up to make a killing off increased tensions. Dumb money isn't the reason this is going up, I promise you that much.\n\nThere are multiple ETFs that cover this sector, or you can buy the individual companies.
