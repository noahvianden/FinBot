{"title": "Market crash mitigation?", "selftext": "One a scale of 1-10, how stupid is it to sell my roth IRA funds (Vanguard, $30k in VTSAX and already maxed for the year) and keep it in the settlement fund so I'm relatively safe if the market crashes from say... GME?  I'd keep it in the settlement fund for a few months, and if nothing happens then I re-invest it.  If the market does crash, then I trickle it back in for the dips.  Since I don't have a lot on the line, I feel the like the opportunity cost isn't significant (I'm only 27, so plenty of time to make up a ~1k loss of growth), but the potential gain could be worth it.  Looking at what happened in 2008, or even the beginning of COVID, a crash does have noticeable effects on VTSAX.\n\nI know that you can't time the market, so normally I wouldn't consider something like this.  But with GME doing its whacky stuff, and the possible effects it could have, I feel like this isn't a normal scenario so abnormal moves should be considered.\n\nEDIT: All in all I don't plan on making this move, appreciate the feedback.  I still think the logic is sound, but yes, never know when or if the market will crash.

The TCJA had very little impact (except that it may have impacted retail interest in the market from the individual income tax changes).\n\nThe major change brought in by the TCJA that may have had some impact was the shift to territorial tax, but as US companies that were trading abroad had, de-facto, done this themselves by having international headquarters abroad with US subsidiaries to manage the Americas taxes, the impact was limited.\n\n>no doubt many of these big companies swiftly recovered from the  coronavirus recession.\n\nMostly due to the CARES act, in my opinion. Many of these companies took money intended to be used to furlough instead of fire employees and kept it. The market was more impacted by the increased liquidity from the Fed and from the relaxation of the banks collateral rules\n\n>Yellen has been working towards a minimum  corporate income tax to put pressure on tax havens and accounting  practices that allows companies to keep more capital. Wondering how this  would play out in terms of broad market growth.\n\nCorporate tax rates are something of a red herring in my opinion. To reduce corporate tax avoidance you need 3 things (some of which were tackled by BEPS).\n\n1. Gobally agree where money is taxed. At the moment companies take advantage of differences in the territoriality of taxation. A simple example would be if Ireland does not tax income not earned in Ireland, where the US taxed income earned worldwide, and Germany taxes income based on where it is booked. So a US company sets up an Irish company and books its European earnings there, legally avoiding German and US taxes. This is a very simplified view of what's actually happening but as an example it shows that differences these rules  can make taxation easy to avoid for large multi-nationals.\n2. Legacies of empire need to be wound up. Jersey, the Bahamas, the Dutch West Indies, the Cayman Islands, and others for historical reasons have preferable conditions for transferring money from their former Imperial overlords (the UK and the Netherlands are notable for this in particular). This means that taking advantage of item 1 gets the money to London/Amsterdam cheaply, then can be moved to the offshore accounts cheaply. This flow should be disrupted so it's taxed before it leaves. Companies like can borrow at incredibly low rates because they use the capital building up offshore as collateral, then declare any interest as an expense and write it off.\n3. Do what Ireland did and remove all the exceptions, and put the headline rate to what you actually want. Ireland have a tax rate of 12.5% and take in 12.4%. France have a rate of 36% but depending on location, business, and incentives, a company could be paying 6%. The US had a rate of 35% but again depending on a multitude of factors companies are paying less than half that. Cut all tax breaks on corporations, remove location incentives, and reduce the rate to match what you expect to actually take in (around 16-18%) and the overall tax take would rise.\n\nI was reading that psychologically, people dislike subtraction if addition is possible in basically all contexts. The tax code everywhere is a shambles of overlapping rules because things just get added. Simplifying this would lead to less lawyers and accountants having jobs, probably, but would provide a boost to business by empowering medium sized business to compete more effectively although multi-nationals will always have some advantages.\n\nAnyway, a bit of a rant.\n\nThe short answer to what you actually asked is any discussion like Yellen has started will cause skittishness in the market, particularly if it looks like going anywhere, but the impact will be small and short lived unless it's actually enacted and the details of that will be very important.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent comment.

This isn't the final evolution of this system. In the same way it would be stupid to build a subway line from one airport to a hotel for the 100-500 passengers daily, currently, this is the correct implementation of the system.\n\n1. Unlike a subway, you can change the vehicle easily to improve capacity.  Model 3 to Model X. Model X to electric passenger van/bus. \n\n1. Let's look at a case study of 1,000 people, getting from A, to B, C, D, E, F. 200 people per stop, with Boring vs Subway. All numbers are made up, for the convenience of talking through this problem. \n\n##Areas of comparison\n* **Dwell Time** Let's say that for a subway, for 5 stops, each stop has 30 seconds of dwell time. (Where I'm from, It's more like a minute of dwell time). That's 2 minutes difference for people going to stop F, than people going to stop B. (Dwell time is the time that a train is in a station, to allow for boarding and disenbarking). It's also faster to empty a car than it is to empty a train. \n\n* **Speed up / Speed Down** It takes time to get up to speed after leaving each station, and to slow down for each station. Let's say this takes 30 seconds before and after each station, to get back up to speed, and the average speed during those sections is half. That's a total of 30 seconds per stop that the vehicle is effectively not moving. \n\n* **Maximum Passengers** When designing subway stations, you have to design based around the idea that a train will pull up and you will have 500+ people emerging at once and needing to walk through the station. If you only have smaller vehicles, then that reduces the total passengers you need to be able to cater for at any one single moment, ie the max pax. This also offers time savings, because it takes longer for 500 people to walk through a corridor at once than it does for 100 people.\n* **Wait time** While most busy subways operate turn up and go time tables, even these usually have a 5-10minute wait time. For less frequent or busy services, it can be as infrequent as 30min to 1hr or worse.\n\n##All together\nSo in a completely made up example, just to give more of an idea of what goes into a comparison between Boring Company vs. Mass Transit,  you could see a scenario that plays out as follows:\n\nPerson is going from stop A to stop F. \n\n1. Dwell time delay is 2 minutes longer with mass transit\n\n1. Speed delay is 2 minutes longer with mass transit\n\n1. MaxPax delay is 1 minute longer to exit station with 200 other people with mass transit\n\n1. Wait time delay is 5 minutes longer with mass transit (assuming that our passenger arrived exactly inbetween a 10min turn up and go service.\n\n## Results: \nBoring Company saves a passenger to stop F 10 minutes.\n\n## Capital intensive\nOne final note, Mass transit is extremely capital intensive. A lot of cities delay investing in mass transit because of the cost. If you can develop a basic system like BC for 1/20th the capital cost, and scale up that system as it grows for even the same cost as it would cost to build a mass transit system, then it's a lot easier for cities to start the project, then going all in to a system that will take years to build, decades to determine the success of, and decades to pay off.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This comment deserves more attention.\n\nI think your point about the less capital required is spot on.

The launch of Intel GPU's could be a great move too, however short term I don't expect them to be fantastic until they split their architecture between productivity and gaming.\n\nI remember looking back at AMD, and the hiring of Lisa Su.

The unions aren't going away. \n\nNow for my unionizing story-\n I got hired on with my former company just as my position became union. The pay when I applied was 16/hr max pay with okay benefits and very little other benefits (for example they had technicians regularly work 70 hours per week). After unionizing, a contract was negotiated for 20.54/hr max pay with defined raises from one's starting pay. Benefits became amazing $10/month ($60/ mon precontract) for a ppo w/ a $400 deductible ($1600 pre contact) and $2500 max out of pocket ($11000 pre contact). Weekly hours were capped at 54 hours. There were many weeks I told my manager to \"fuck off\" and that i wasn't coming in for my next shift because I was capped on hours. \n\nIn addition to this, I was a union steward and executive board member. I saved multiple people's jobs and got punishments reduced via the contractual grievance process.\n\nI have this person's permission in writing to talk about his grievance. In this grievance, a technician had his personal phone stolen out of his pocket while being battered by his manager. At least that's how I presented it during the grievance meeting as the manager reached into a technician's pocket (battery) to retrieve the phone (theft). After I threatened to call the cops and discussed the company's policies on battery and theft once he admitted it during a recorded conversation, he happily back paid the technician for the 5 day suspension the technician received for having the phone on his person (this is against company policies). \n\nWhereas in that particular story, no one was doing what the company's expected of them, I have dozens of stories similar to this one- many where there was no fair on behalf of the technician.\n\nThere aren't many things I am completely sure if, but I am one hundred percent sure that this same garbage happens to Amazon employees too. Some of these interactions result in firings/suspensions that would be prevented if the right steward were to handle grievances for them. \n\nUnionizing isn't only about the tangible or monetary, immediate benefits for these people, it is for the future employees and the wronged employees who otherwise have no voice and no say in working conditions and/or discipline.\n\nI didn't proofread, so sorry if there are any significant errors.

No need for extra paperwork and procedure.

He is besties with the area manager and is protected from on high as a result (the area manager was disciplined for not disciplining the first level manager after the reservist incident, but he is also still employed by the company). The technician from the battery and theft story didn't want to pursue further action (either with the police or within the company) against the manager for fear of retaliation and targeting. Shortly after the incident, the technician took a job out of state with a competitor. \n\n>I would have a vote just like every other hourly employee\n\nI'm not going to completely disagree with this, but I doubt you would get a vote or be able to join the same union as the associates. This is because you have a different job title and likely a different work group. Whereas you interact with the associates, you are probably a manager in the union's and company's eyes. My former employer also has \"safety guys\" who basically monitored technicians for safety infractions, did accident investigations, and offered policy change suggestive to improve safety on the job. They are hourly employees, but are not considered craft; therefore, they could not join the technician union. If you can discipline or suggest discipline for an associate (for a safety infractions as an example), then you should not be allowed to be on the same union as the people over whom you wield authority as this would definitely pose a significant conflict. \n\n>Again, you have the wrong guy. You're assuming that since I'm not a bottom level employee that I'm some kind of corporate drone\n\nI did make this assumption to some extent (I am sorry), but alas, aren't we all just corporate drones in the end?

The TSLA shares held by market makers are not tradeable either, and are not part of the float.\n\nThis is unusual, because TSLA's options open interest is - again, provably - 8x-10x larger than comparable peers such as AAPL, AMZN or MSFT. So the delta hedging inventory effect is **far** more significant.\n\n**Third:**\n\n- as I mentioned it in my comment, hedges related to convertible notes should not be taken as part of the regular equity short interest. This is an estimated 1-2% factor (Gary Black), which I'd subtract from the real short interest figure.\n\nSo yes, if I put 10 patient and knowledgeable enough investors who'd look into the details of this, I submit a good majority would agree that these factors should be considered and a precise calculation of the float should be reduced with all non-tradeable shares, not just Elon's.\n\nNote that these details don't really matter for other megacaps like AAPL, MSFT or AMZN, because their short interest is around 1.0% or lower. The exact percentage is so close to zero that the base 'float' denominator doesn't have any significant impact.\n\nBut for TSLA, the factors I listed are significant.\n\nI have supported or can support each and every point there with primary sources.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I disagree with your analysis (please don\u2019t ban me for it). \n\nThe short float is a correct representation and anything else is just speculation.
