With that, the VIX closed at 17.30, its lowest level in a year. \n\n**SPY** options are again pricing in about a **1.1%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $396.50 to the downside and $405.50 on the upside. \n\nThe expected move from **QQQ** options is about 1.7% for the week and **IWM** about 2.2%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In the News**\n\n**Tesla (TSLA)** reported first quarter vehicle production numbers on Friday while equity markets were closed. Options are pricing in a roughly 6% move for the upcoming week, and about a 12% move for the month of April. The company is due to report earnings the last week of April. \n\nWith the stock near $660, this week's expected move corresponds to about $620 for a bearish consensus and near $700 for bullish. That is much smaller expected moves being priced in TSLA options than what the stock has seen in recent week, both in its options and in its actual moves:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gnj0065fm6r61.gif\n\nThe Archegos story had an effect on both its holdings at the center of the liquidation as well as the financial institutions affected.

The roads are absolutely crazy. Tuk tuks literally don't obey any rules\n\nI read through the thread. Note that I \\*did\\* use the word \"eventually\". I agree that the current beta Version 8.3 would likely have severe problems there.\n\nI watched the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLUm3Q-7iZA) you linked - twice. Truly amazing. Very chaotic, but of course there are \"rules\", even if many of them are not in the law books. It's a traffic circle / roundabout, and everybody is going the correct direction around the circle. About 16 minutes of video, and no major collisions, no pedestrians run over. That would not happen unless people were following a set of \"rules\". My impression from two viewings:\n\n- At least on average, go in the correct direction.\n\n- Right of way is negotiated using \"body language\" (including the motion of the vehicles).\n\n- It's not OK to actually have a major crash or actually run over somebody. Minor nudges may be sort of OK.\n\nAnd no doubt a batch of others that I missed. The video you linked has a recommended link to another video, [\"How to Drive in India (India\u2019s Unofficial Road Rules)\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwL-QrCSgI], which reinforces my view that the driving there operates under a set of \"rules\" (or \"customs\").\n\n> I would nearly think another sensor suite of microphones would need to be added to recognize where a sound came from.\n\nMight be useful. The video I linked commented that a common use of the horn is to let others know that you are behind or beside them. Teslas don't have an array of external microphones, but they do have sonar for nearby objects, and cameras for 360 degree vision. It appears that Teslas on FSD in India will need to learn to honk to inform others of their presence.\n\nWhen Teslas were learning how to use FSD in the US, first a large amount of training data was collected by the cars and sent to the company for analysis and to put together a training set. Next, FSD was operated in \"shadow mode\", comparing what FSD would have done to what the human driver actually did. Then alpha and beta versions were tested on the road, carefully supervised by a human driver prepared to intervene if needed, and interventions were logged and reported to the company to see whether changes were needed. Over time, FSD performance got closer to what a good human driver could do.\n\nI don't see any fundamental reason that couldn't also work in India, using skilled drivers who are accustomed to driving in India throughout the training process. \n\nFor how long it might take in India, I don't know, but several factors to consider:\n\n- FSD has just recently been transitioning to the \"4D\" approach that considers the motion of objects over time, and use of full 360 degree vision. I think we will start to see the benefits of these changes in (US version) beta Version 9, and possibly get some idea of how these advances could affect training for driving in India.\n\n- The Dojo training system will hopefully become operational this year - it is expected to greatly speed the training process.\n\n- I believe the actual driving decisions (once the neural net driven vision system has figured out what is going on) are still hand coded. I believe Tesla has said that the long term plan is to have more and more of the driving systems performed by the neural net as well, which would be closer to how humans learn to drive, and which may be better adapted to the driving styles in India.\n\nMachines have learned to perform many complex tasks, including negotiating with and bluffing humans. The complex negotiations involved in driving in India appear achievable as well. I wouldn't be shocked to see seriously good versions after five years of work, possibly less.

{"title": "[$BB] The emerging tech cold war between the US and China could be another growth catalyst for Blackberry", "selftext": "With President Biden viewing China as \"[steep steep competition](https://youtu.be/7M-FIX39udk)\", the decoupling of US-China tech supply chain is inevitable. Both China and the US will start to reduce their own critical industries' reliance on components from the other side, so that they can avoid being held hostage by the other side using these supply chain choke points as geopolitical bargaining stakes (see how the ban of [Qualcomm chips](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242664/us-uk-china-smartphone-zte-security-risk-sanctions) and [Google Android OS](https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-ban) disrupted ZTE and Huawei's global smartphone businesses respectively). This is evidenced by China's \"[Made in China 2025 ](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/made-china-2025-threat-global-trade)\" plan and the US's ongoing [plan](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/efforts-to-bring-chip-manufacturing-to-us-soil-will-continue-in-2021/) to bring chip manufacturing back to US soil.\n\nDespite the growing anti-globalization trend in critical supply chains, there is still a desire for US automotive companies to penetrate the Chinese market and also a similar desire for Chinese automakers to expand beyond their domestic market into global markets. \n\nFor emerging technologies like connected and autonomous vehicles, there will still be a need for a standardized vehicle base operating system (hypervisor) and data abstraction layer for future software-defined vehicles in order for a software and app ecosystem to flourish across different vehicle makes from various automakers. A standard vehicle base os is also crucial in ensuring that these vehicles remain interoperable across different countries with different legal safety requirements, cloud services, V2X infrastructure and media apps ecosystems, without requiring changes to their physical hardware when scaling across different markets.\n\nIt is unlikely that this standard interoperability layer will come from the US or China due to their reluctance to incorporate such a critical component from the other side in their emerging tech products due to geopolitical and security concerns. Being a Canadian company, Blackberry has the best chance at global dominance with their [QNX hypervisor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf3r7c/qnx_hypervisor_will_be_in_all_future_connected/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [IVY data platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf2t5a/blackberry_qnx_ivy_might_be_the_next_android/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).\n\nIf you listen to this [discussion](https://youtu.be/nRwdDnrc7qI), you will understand all these talks are not mere hype, but actual plans to be executed. John Wall, SVP of Blackberry Technology Solutions, also mentioned that they will likely partner with a major Chinese cloud provider (Alibaba cloud, Huawei cloud, Tencent cloud, Baidu AI cloud etc.) very soon, similar to the Blackberry-AWS IVY partnership. This shows how well-positioned Blackberry is at being the interoperability layer for connected and autonomous vehicles in a world where there is increasing decoupling between the US and China tech ecosystems.\n\nEdit:\n\nI see some complaints that my viewpoint is not substantiated enough, so here's some elaboration:\n\nThe US-China decoupling will only happen for intermediate goods (components that are used in the production of final goods that will be purchased by end consumers). For example, instead of using the US's Android OS, Huawei phones are now using their own HongMeng OS. Supply chain decoupling does not imply the ban of final goods from China (Huawei phones) in the US. You can still [buy](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/despite-ban-you-can-still-buy-huawei-phones-in-the-us-heres-how/) Huawei phones in the US, just that not many people would want to buy them due to the lack of Google Mobile Services and Google Play store for these Huawei phones (cannot download apps easily). This affects Huawei's sale in the US.\n\nNow for connected and autonomous vehicles which does not yet have any dominant app ecosystems like Android or iOS yet. This time, with the Chinese having the capability to influence the growth of an emerging tech sector, do you think the Chinese will support an American OS + platform + app ecosystem and risk getting banned again and losing their global sales?\n\nOf course, China can build their own OS + platform + app ecosystem but it is unlikely to gain traction beyond their domestic market because they lack the deep technical capability/maturity (HongMeng OS turned out to be just an Android clone) or the influence to convince app developers outside China to develop apps for them. \n\nI think you might have underestimated the importance of standards and abstractions in the tech industry.\n>The world runs windows on AMD and Intel\n\nThis only works precisely because both AMD and Intel chips use the x86-64 Instruction Set Architecture, where programs are compiled to the same assembly code which is interoperable across Intel and AMD chips. There is a reason you cannot run a desktop software on an Android smartphone with a Qualcomm chip because smartphones use the ARM architecture. Again, in the smartphone world, Android can run on Qualcomm Snapdragon, Huawei's Kirin, Samsung's Exynos chips, precisely because all these chips use the ARM Instruction Set Architecture. (ARM was last valued to be $40 billion btw)\n\nNow, such interoperability layer (analogous to x86-64 for desktop CPUs and ARM for smartphone CPUs) has not existed  for the connected and autonomous vehicle yet. My main focus in this article is to put forward my view that this interoperability layer is unlikely to come from any American or Chinese companies because each of them will not accept any proposed standards from the other side. It has to come from a third party (not necessarily Canada, can be any other countries). But ruling out Chinese and American tech companies, Blackberry is the only frontrunner left capable of driving this industry standard forward.\n\nPosition: 7200 @ $11.77", "id": "mjpxtn", "created_utc": 1617514229.0, "score": 785, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "BB could post net profits of 88 billion dollars and the stock price would still go to hell.", "score": 108, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03189646452665329}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09865286946296692}, {"body": "i\u2019ve been hurt so much, i cannot be hurt again", "score": 175, "replies": [{"body": "BruiseBerry", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Black\u2019nBlueBerry.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5718754529953003}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18292835354804993}, {"body": "Hurt me once, shame on you.

{"title": "I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!", "selftext": "This post is in continuation of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) post I made 2 days back. The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c\n\nGameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.\n\n**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported\n\n* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.\n\n**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab\u2122 stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. \n\n**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.\n\n**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound \n\n**SOME FAQ\u2019s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments\n\n*Disclaimer : I am not a financial advisor!*", "id": "mjzvwy", "created_utc": 1617554863.0, "score": 1702, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "This is good shit.", "score": 229, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Can we get this to update daily?
