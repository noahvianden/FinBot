Be advised, I\u2019m biased since my wife works for GM on the business/supply chain side. But comparing the Hummer to the Tesla cybertruck is ridiculous. They are two different vehicles from two very different companies. \n\nFirst, GM is going to have 30 different electric vehicles by 2025. Every car in their lineup will be electric plus new models. It\u2019s not just the Hummer, which will be a specialty product, but all the trucks. Their main line of trucks sell like crazy. The Silverado and Colorado will likely be the competition to Cybertruck. The Silverado line alone sells more units than Tesla sells for all its vehicles. \n\nAs far as companies, GM sells like 7 million cars a year versus Tesla\u2019s 500k. GM has a supply chain that reaches globally. They have plants all over (this could be also bad since brick and mortar costs, labor, ect) which allows them to shift production. They have connections with hundreds of companies for parts and resources. It\u2019s insane how many companies my wife can contact for bids when GM needs a part for a car coming out in the distant future. \n\nAnother issue is government contracts and/or other business contracts for vehicles that GM can leverage and Tesla can not. GM, being so large, can offer cheaper products in huge numbers. So if the US government wants to completely faze out its gas fleet and go electric, who do you think will be able to produce so many to meet this need, GM or Tesla?  \n\nI guess what I hope people take away from this is that OPs accusation that \u201cGM doesn\u2019t stand a chance\u201d versus Tesla due to the high price of the Hummer is very myopic and lacks insight into the full spectrum of auto manufacturing. Even my little rant doesn\u2019t do the justice that my wife could. You need to look at the industry and how each company will fill that niche, how they are positioned to fill it, how viable they are, ect.

Also why share margins and positive influence to the brand from technological advantage. Other bottleneck for Tesla might be skilled employees for new factories as they can be found and trained only at x pace. Also there is a question, how fast can equipment for factories be made and are there enough top level managers to deliver on a few other factory level projects simultaneously. Maybe it could make some sense if there're no such bottlenecks and Tesla can sell some old manufacturing technology/capacity before new iteration and lock their competitors in outdated technology but there are many ifs. Still I have problems to see how this business opportunity could lead to addition of over 1t in valuation, I think Tesla by itself (financially and regarding demand) can scale auto production as fast as scales global battery production for at least few more years and market pretty much prices that in. Energy probably is not priced in but we will need at least few more years to see meaningful results at the scale adequate to current market cap.  FSD on the other hand is few t up in the air, everyone understands that, but market needs more proofs that Tesla AP style FSD is possible, change probability of Tesla success in this front and addition of hundreds of b or even >t in valuation models is very rational.
