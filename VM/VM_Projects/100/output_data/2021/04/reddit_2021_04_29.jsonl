A trading plan that includes backtesting can help with the toughest part of trading, knowing yourself. Visualizing maximum monthly losses, yearly losses and drawdowns (equity peak to valley loss), helps you determine your risk tolerances. Once you understand your investment objectives and limits, researching the appropriate strategies and testing becomes a more meaningful and straightforward process.\n\nFinding an options strategy that meet your investment objectives involves the following steps:\n\n1. Knowing your risk return objectives\n\n2. Identifying possible strategies and backtesting those strategies\n\n3. Applying timing triggers to your chosen backtested strategies\n\n4. Re-testing strategies out of sample, different symbols\n\n5. Paper trading coming as close to real trading as possible\n\n6. Going live small and gradually building to a size appropriate for your risk return goals.\n\nUnderstanding your risk return objectives is a critical step and will define the types of options strategy you can do. Do you prefer short-term trading or long-term, small wins or large, steady income or windfalls? Can you tolerate unlimited losses?\n\nFor example, if you are risk averse you will prefer being long options or in low risk strategies. Long calls and puts, and long vertical spreads are the most obvious low risk strategies. However, only owning options premium can be risky in its own right. Finding short vertical spreads with defined risk can fit into this risk portfolio. Short verticals can provide positive theta--profit from the passage of time. Short verticals can also be short vega and profit if the implied volatility level falls. \n\nOnce strategies and tickers have been identified that meet your objectives, it is time to backtest the strategies. Knowing risk and holding preferences help set the parameters of the strategies to test, like days to expiration, out of the money amount, spread strike width and early exits. \n\nBacktest Optimization\n\nORATS has developed an optimized backtester to help our clients find strategies. For each strategy, the range of acceptable parameters are determined. For example, if you know you would not trade any call butterfly over 90 days you would limit the days to expiration (DTE) to 90. \n\nOnce you get a range for DTE, delta, other entry criteria, exit criteria, the optimizer arranges all the possible combinations of parameters into many backtests and runs them in parallel. \n\nWhen all the tests have completed for a strategy, there is a tool in the optimizer process that gives weights to each return statistic for each backtest. This tool scores and sorts the backtests to help you analyze which strategy is best for your objectives. For example, you may value a high annual return and a low worst year return as in the weighted score above. See how the best annual return of 8.55% is scored less than the one with 6.59% because the worst year of -5.56% is better than -18.95%.\n\nTrigger Optimization\n\nNext take the 6.59% strategy and see if applying timing triggers can produce better results. ORATS has tens of thousands of indicators and the moving average of indicators. Testing these indicators can get computationally expensive, so techniques are used to simulate a backtest. After good looking simulations are found, a full backtest can be run to confirm the results.\n\nRe-testing strategies out of sample, different symbols\n\nMaking sure the good backtests you have found are not over-fit to the data is an important step in achieving trading success. \n\nPaper Trading\n\nAfter a strategy with triggers is found that works as expected in the trigger simulation and in the backtest, paper trading can be started. ORATS has an integrated paper trading system to test strategies. \n\nOnce paper trading is found to be consistent with backtests, trading small in the market can be started and finally trading a size that is consistent with risk return objectives.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Did you type that out?

DD below.", "selftext": "Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart heading into their earnings today. Been in a channel for 8 months. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. I bought calls before the split rumor so that would just icing on the cake.\n\nAnyone who thinks mega cap companies can't break out look at FB, up 7% today.\n\nI follow lots of hedge fund guys on Twitter and they're all sharing the same article of this hedge fund guy Bill Miller saying AMZN will double in Barron's and they're all just waiting for a reason to send it higher. [https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311](https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311)\n\nIf there's an earnings beat then over the next few weeks analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's which'll also send it higher. Analysts don't downgrade AMZN. They either keep their previous ratings or they upgrade. [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast)\n\nIf we get any kind of good news Thursday AMZN will have $4k+ upside in the next month. $5k upside in the next 2 months.\n\nI've done a lot of time doing DD on this and I think it's a rate 5-star situation so I wanted to bring it to the fam. \ud83e\udd8d Haven't pitched an idea here before cuz this is the first really 5 star risk/reward bet I've found.\n\nI think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15.\n\nAs for the Split rumor, if it's true it would be huge. [https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544)\n\nIf there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% tomorrow even on average earnings. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. **Last time it consolidated this long the leg up was +100% and took 2-3 months**. If they don't have numbers that get them there they will likely play the Split card. They know they need a breakout after the last 8 months and with a new CEO. Their last earnings was actually amazing but the stock didn't go because of the Bezos news. A big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.\n\nA split isn't needed at all though for a break out. **Keep in mind the split rumor isn't priced in. It popped 0.8% when the rumor broke and then settled back down later the same day.**\n\nThe last thing that needed to fall into place was yield expectations for the next month and Powell's meeting yesterday should help in that regard.\n\nI'm thinking **June 4 @ $4,000 strike** for price / expiry.\n\n**Going to war in t minus 30 minutes.** Would love to have fam beside me.

Very little downside. If it gets broken up by regulators, great it's worth more. If we get a Covid surprise, e-commerce & AWS will benefit.\n\n**For those holding call options, the question's do we sell at opening bell or do we hold**. I'll be spending the next few hours digging into the numbers before I come to a decision for myself. My calls are $4000 June 4 so my initial thought is I needed a bigger beat than we got.

Let me give you a little insight:\n\n- Diversification is a bitch: It's generally very hard to find meaningful quantitative measures for the diversification of a portfolio. Something to think about: Let's assume you made a bad investment, should you really increase the diversification of your portfolio by making another bad investemnt? Typical real world example on this matter: Let us assume that your portfolio consists of 1\u2019000 small investments of an average size of $1k in different companies. But than there's also is the 100k you invested in your wifes boyfriends craft business... if you would come to me with this portfolio, i would tell you that your wifes boyfriend is a very big cluster risk for you. How could you increase the diversification of your portfolio and reduce risk concentration? Two ways: a) Get your wife to dump her boyfriend (not going to happen bro) or b) invest another 100k in your wifes other boyfriend.\n\n- What is \u201cdiversification risk\u201d? Simple. If you invest 10k in one company there is a decent chance that you lose your full investment (if the company goes bankrupt). If you invest 10 times 1k in 10 different companies, the probability of you losing the full investment (10k) goes exponentially down (i.e. the probability of n companies defaulting at the same time gets exponentially smaller with n).\n\n- How do banks approach diversification? They start on the other side of the equation. They don\u2019t start by asking \u201chow much diversification do we want\u201d but rather by asking \u201cwhat risk are we willing to take\u201d? The risk they are willing to take (risk appetite) is usually given by a combination of their strategy and the regulatory requirements (capital requirements). Starting from this they then calculate the required diversification of their portfolio to stay within the borders of their risk appetite.\n\n-What does this all mean for you? Nothing. Don\u2019t worry about diversification (especially not at the beginning of your investment career). Ask yourself how much risk are you willing and able to take (good indicator: if you are constantly checking the movement of a stock, you probably took more risk than you should have). If you stay within your comfort zone, you don\u2019t have to worry about diversification.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "I love how you advise banks as part of your job yet your username is GamblingTard.

Once in the ecosystem, a person or household tends to stay there.  Even with an upgrade cycle of every 4 years per device, that's still a decent amount of profit per customer annually, and Apple's complementary services revenue has a decent attach rate too.  Their products are relatively  expensive vs alternatives and have a very good profit margin, but... they also actually provide a really good value considering how much utility you get from them.  I'm not saying this isn't also true for Samsung phones, for example, but if you are only buying a phone every 4 years, does it really matter if you pay an extra $100 for an Apple flagship device vs the equivalently-sized Samsung device, for example?\n\nI think in a household budget, a prioritized list of discretionary expenses probably has new phone, new headphones, new tablet, new computer near the top at least every 4-5 years per device.  Regardless of what brand, these things give you a ton of value for their price vs spending that money on restaurants, bars, movies, any other form of entertainment really which are basically one-time events with no lasting value (except for priceless memories but those probably aren't standard).  This is just to say, I think Apple's revenue is fairly resilient even in a recession, because electronics have a high value proposition and Apple has loyal customers in its ecosystem.

Maybe recessions just can't happen anymore, and every time one starts to happen the government will just print more money and send it to the bottom 80%.  \n\nSo all of the above is why I thought Apple with a priced-to-shrink PE of 10-12 was just an insane bargain and I'm surprised that opportunity existed for *years.* \n\nAt this point, with a TTM PE (after yesterday's earnings) of 29, Apple is much closer to fair value.

There's been so much community research, validation, and checking if the data is accurate. I have never seen this much information about the market and workings due to this. Why? Because now our money and the \"free market\" was messed with.\n\nI do know the majority of the people that are holding are just looking for changes in wall street to get it closer to being \"fair\" or \"transparent\". It's already happening with DTC revising existing rules.\n\nWhat I can say is TSLA and GME feels very similar as a result from news and market correlation. There was also that flash crash that happened to GME when it hit $347 in midday on 3/10 before tanking to 180 then stabilizing to $260~. That was not normal market movement.\n\nIf this was really over back in January, that incident in March wouldn't have happened.\n\nThis is my view as a TSLA holder who bought in at $380 in 2018 and it dropped to it's lowest in 2019 at around $190. Those TSLA bags were really heavy back then too.\n\nIf I didn't hold positions in GME, the past 4 months of gains in my portfolio would've been gone.\n\n\n\n**Edit**: For this who come across this post and is skeptical, there was an AMA yesterday with Susanne Trimbath PhD.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.041551291942596436}, {"body": "The company is a dead man walking.
