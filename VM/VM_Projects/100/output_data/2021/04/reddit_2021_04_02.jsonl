It is correct you are gaining leverage, but the actual amount of money outlayed and risk profile favors buying the call option whether MSFT goes up or down.  So I consider it less risky buying the call option in either scenario.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's do a little experiment.  MSFT is at 240.  We will calculate P/L for MSFT by March 2023 with two different prices: 80 points up or down (320 and 160).

Especially since MSFT is now considered a stable investment.  Very few of us consider the probability of MSFT losing 80/share over the next 2 years as highly improbable.

{"title": "PLTR is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is my bullish thesis.", "selftext": "First of all, I would like to say that in this analysys I did not want to dwell too much into the technical aspects of the PLTR's software product or the financial performance of the company.  I am well aware that those are one of the most important fundamental elements when valuing a business and I did spend a lot of time on them while doing my research, before ultimately deciding to invest in the company. However I believe that most of the redditors on this forum , especially those that are already investors, already have at least basic understanding of PLTR's financial situation and the specifications of its software. In this thesis I will try to give my perspective about why I think PLTR is a low bottom company with significant potential for growth, based on more \"abstract\" and less known factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nFirst of all, let's take a look at the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S Agency for Disease Control and Prevention, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential models that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.\n\nEven forgetting about the software and PLTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only SaasS company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PLTR's lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of National Intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril Haines is a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, it is that if  the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PLTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200. Unit 8200  is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption.\n\nIf you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold.\n\nPalantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least. He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit\u00e4t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?\n\nTo sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words: \u201cWe are going to deliver the world\u2019s best software with the world\u2019s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that\u2019s worth to them. And I think you\u2019ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.\u201d -Karp the day they went public\n\nPS: English is not my mother tongue and I wrote this piece in a rush, so please excuse me if there are any grammatical or spelling errors.", "id": "mi8p2x", "created_utc": 1617322503.0, "score": 374, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "WTF!

My short answer would be, no it's a bad idea. If you believe in the company you can invest a decent chunk in it but never put all your money in one company. You never know what happens, even the best company with the brightest future can have problems. Even if it's not their fault. That's why you need at least some diversification to bring your risk down. \n\nApart from this, a stock split won't change a thing for you. Imagine a company has 1000 stocks outstanding with a price of 10. You own 100 stocks of them. If they announce a stock split, let's say 1:5. Meaning you receive 5 stocks for every you own. \nWhat happens now? The new situation will be:\n- total outstanding: 5000\n- price of stocks: 2\n- stocks you own: 500\n\nA stock split is to make your stock cheaper, as in easier to buy, but it doesn't change the value. You will end up with the same amount of money. Investing and waiting for a stock split isn't a good strategy. Nothing will change. \n\nNow let's look at the future. My view on tesla is, they will go down more than they already did. Not because they are bad or anything, no because their stock is too overhyped. It's too expensive even if you take their future into account. At least in my opinion. \n\nA measure you can use is the price/earnings ratio. 15 is the avarage and you can calculate it like this: price per stock / earnings per share.

Contractually this means that they are signing up multi year contract to spend x number of $$$ for a period of time on the platform, typically called an EDP (enterprise discount program). These EDPs can be very custom, and can include free consulting, credits to offset their eventual bill, and other offers along with a certain negotiated discount off of any aws service monthly. Depending on the size of the contract this discount could well be into 20% or more off. I've seen credits easily mid 7 figures before. This contract essentially says - you will spend this much money and at the end of the term or at annual periods in the contract if you have not spent, you get a bill for the difference. And also depending on accounting rules - this contract could be considered Capex.\n\nMinimum eligible spend to be able to get an EDP? 500k a year (used to be $1M until recently). Think about how many companies use AWS and would hit this threshold....alot. aws reps also get paid on signing EDPs, so they love them too.\n\n2 - they are going to sell their product on the aws marketplace. The marketplace and having ISVs (which PLTR would be in this case) is relatively new, like within the last 2 years. Only recently (last few months) aws has allowed professional services - not specifically tied to a product offering on the marketplace, to also be sold. The sale process for items on the marketplace can happen several different ways: user finds it and clicks buy, ISV directs customers who come through other sales channels to buy on  AWS (I've seen some offer discounts to do so), or Marketplace specific ISV reps go and specifically sell the product to aws customers and partners (these reps make no money unless someone buys the product). Aws essentially is turning into a software and services disti (comparable distis include SHI, techdata, arrow, cdw).\n\n\nNow - based on the 5 seconds I used ducksduckgo (fuck google) before I started typing this post up, my hunch is the article is referencing PLTR going the way of my #2 meaning. They would be dumb if they were also not under an EDP too though.\n\n\nHow are #1 and #2 related?\n\nLet's say I'm a company who has an EDP, and I didn't know what I was doing when I made the initial commitment and I'm projecting to come up short at the end of my next EDP term. There are a couple ways to fill the gap without spinning up EC2 instances for fun - one of them is spending money on the marketplace (product, professional services). 50% of the value of these spends count against the commitment of an EDP. So, if you are projecting a 50k shortfall on your EDP term - you could spend 100k on the marketplace to cover it and avoid the 50k bill from aws (for nothing). \n\nThat said - companies are moving alot of their transactions to the aws marketplace because of this EDP benefit. Ideally you don't suck and take into account marketplace spend in your analysis for your EDP spend, but alot of companies dont.\n\n\nWhat does this all mean for PLTR stock?\n\nNothing yet. However there are some future indicators to look out for:\n\nJob postings for Marketplace ISV positions, specifically in the ERP space.\n\nPLTR showing up at an aws event in the future (summits or specifically reInvent)\n\nAnnouncements of large companies entering agreements to buy/use PLTR who also use AWS\n\nPLTR Announcing professional services/consulting \n\nPLTR professional services/consulting offers on the marketplace\n\n\nIf one or more of the above happen, it should increase the share value of the stock.\n\nI write this long post as someone who pretty much doesn't own stock (fidelity just puts my money places), doesn't hold any PLTR, and used to negotiate EDPs and was employed by an early adopter of the aws marketplace.\n\nBTW- contino is far from what I'd consider reputable in the sense of using it for any DD.

{"title": "Tesla Deliveries Smashed Expectations", "selftext": " \n\nTesla delivered a great bit of news Friday. The electric vehicle pioneer posted a healthy quarterly increase in deliveries, a number more than double 2020's first-quarter total.\n\nInvestors had been wary of the figures -- not because of demand or competition, but because of the global automotive chip shortage. Their worries turned out to be overblown.\n\nTesla delivered about 185,000 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 181,000 in the fourth-quarter of 2020 and about 88,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2020. Year-over-year growth is more than 100%.\n\nWall Street estimates ranged from roughly 162,000 to about 172,000. Estimates had fallen from more than 180,000 deliveries, mainly because of the chip shortage.\n\nTesla didn't mention the chip shortage in its report. It did point out, however, that the Model Y has been received in China. The company began manufacturing the Y in China a few months ago. .\n\nThe result keeps Tesla on track to deliver the Wall Street consensus of roughly 800,000 vehicles in 2021, up about 60% year over year.

{"title": "I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter to find rising stocks! This week's top stock and its DD: Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM)", "selftext": "**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.\n\n**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nHere is the stock picked by the program and my DD\n\n**Stock:**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($TSM)**\n\nWeek on Week increase in mentions: **130%**\n\nMonth on Month increase in mentions: **324%**\n\nAverage sentiment across mentions: **+29.5%**\n\n**DD**\n\n**Core Product**\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.\n\nThe company is the world\u2019s largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world\u2019s 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)\n\nAs you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (<10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world\u2019s made-to-order chip market.\n\n**Financials**\n\nTSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4\u201920 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)\n\nThey also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.\n\n**Potential and Hype Factors**\n\n**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1\n\nTSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).\n\nThis leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management\u2019s confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.\n\n**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV\u2019s tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.\n\n**Risk and Competition**\n\nThere are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.\n\nThe company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan\u2019s chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC\u2019s EPS as \\~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.\n\nA long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTSMC is currently one of the world\u2019s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC\u2019s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

What actually matters is the *transistor density*, which measures transistors/sq mm (two dimensions) instead of just one.  Intel's 10nm has slightly better transistor density than TSMC 7nm, and Intel 7nm will be slightly better than TSMC 5nm, so in reality **if both company's timelines hold** Intel is only one process node behind TSMC.\n\nAlthough Intel is definitely behind TSMC as far as fabrication is concerned it doesn't actually matter that much.  This is because typically TSMC's leading generation is sold out to Apple, which means that for third parties, the difference in choice of fabrication technology is negligible.  Of course, this part only applies once Intel starts accepting orders from external companies (currently Intel only produces its own products in its own fabs).\n\n**TLDR**: Intel being behind on process node doesn't really matter because 1) at the moment they only make their own products and 2) their only products in need of a cutting edge node are in their CPU division, which are still remaining competitive for now.  \n\nPlease note that anything written above not already released by their respective companies may change without notice, and OP's financial disclaimer still applies here too.  Overall, I do agree with OP (also, nice post!), but I wanted to point out that the difference in fabrication technology is closer than the layperson might tell.  Finally, fuck this tiny window to write text in.\n\nEdit: In case if process node is a new term to anyone, if someone is referring to Intel 10nm, that's a process node, while a process node advancement would be moving from Intel 10nm to Intel 7nm (Or TSMC 7nm to 5nm, but you get the point).", "score": 259, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot for the write-up!

Also it corrects my poor explanation of how transistor density and nm are measured!  Turns out it doesn't move from one dimension to two, but factors in the distance between transistors.\n\n>a lower nm if it's just for marketing\n\nBasically nm is a far easier metric to put on a slide instead of MTr/mm\u00c2\u00b2.  At the end of the day, the consumer will always figure out which process is best, so it's not really a case of nm is completely incorrect (because comparing 10nm and 7nm in the same company is still perfectly fine) as much as it is an issue of being incredibly confusing for those who aren't knowledgeable about the space.\n\n> Why do you think Intel fell behind TMC in manufacturing?\n\nThey put a financial guy in charge.  It didn't help that they had a technology lead at the time, which made the decision to cut research spending on new processes easier.\n\n> TSMC is also investing heavily in Capex. do you think intel can catchup? \n\nIntel can definitely catch up, it just depends on how many of the lessons learned on 10 and 7nm can be applied to 3nm.  I think I forgot to mention there are rumors Intel will just jump from 7 to 3nm...  Which to be fair, they would have to do to reach par with TSMC.  As for capex, I wouldn't read too much into it for now.
