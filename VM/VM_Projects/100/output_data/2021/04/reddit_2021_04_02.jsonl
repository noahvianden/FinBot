It is correct you are gaining leverage, but the actual amount of money outlayed and risk profile favors buying the call option whether MSFT goes up or down.  So I consider it less risky buying the call option in either scenario.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's do a little experiment.  MSFT is at 240.  We will calculate P/L for MSFT by March 2023 with two different prices: 80 points up or down (320 and 160).

Especially since MSFT is now considered a stable investment.  Very few of us consider the probability of MSFT losing 80/share over the next 2 years as highly improbable.

{"title": "PLTR is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is my bullish thesis.", "selftext": "First of all, I would like to say that in this analysys I did not want to dwell too much into the technical aspects of the PLTR's software product or the financial performance of the company.  I am well aware that those are one of the most important fundamental elements when valuing a business and I did spend a lot of time on them while doing my research, before ultimately deciding to invest in the company. However I believe that most of the redditors on this forum , especially those that are already investors, already have at least basic understanding of PLTR's financial situation and the specifications of its software. In this thesis I will try to give my perspective about why I think PLTR is a low bottom company with significant potential for growth, based on more \"abstract\" and less known factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nFirst of all, let's take a look at the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S Agency for Disease Control and Prevention, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential models that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.\n\nEven forgetting about the software and PLTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only SaasS company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PLTR's lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of National Intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril Haines is a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, it is that if  the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PLTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200. Unit 8200  is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption.\n\nIf you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold.\n\nPalantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least. He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universit\u00e4t, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?\n\nTo sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words: \u201cWe are going to deliver the world\u2019s best software with the world\u2019s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that\u2019s worth to them. And I think you\u2019ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.\u201d -Karp the day they went public\n\nPS: English is not my mother tongue and I wrote this piece in a rush, so please excuse me if there are any grammatical or spelling errors.", "id": "mi8p2x", "created_utc": 1617322503.0, "score": 374, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "WTF!

My short answer would be, no it's a bad idea. If you believe in the company you can invest a decent chunk in it but never put all your money in one company. You never know what happens, even the best company with the brightest future can have problems. Even if it's not their fault. That's why you need at least some diversification to bring your risk down. \n\nApart from this, a stock split won't change a thing for you. Imagine a company has 1000 stocks outstanding with a price of 10. You own 100 stocks of them. If they announce a stock split, let's say 1:5. Meaning you receive 5 stocks for every you own. \nWhat happens now? The new situation will be:\n- total outstanding: 5000\n- price of stocks: 2\n- stocks you own: 500\n\nA stock split is to make your stock cheaper, as in easier to buy, but it doesn't change the value. You will end up with the same amount of money. Investing and waiting for a stock split isn't a good strategy. Nothing will change. \n\nNow let's look at the future. My view on tesla is, they will go down more than they already did. Not because they are bad or anything, no because their stock is too overhyped. It's too expensive even if you take their future into account. At least in my opinion. \n\nA measure you can use is the price/earnings ratio. 15 is the avarage and you can calculate it like this: price per stock / earnings per share.

Contractually this means that they are signing up multi year contract to spend x number of $$$ for a period of time on the platform, typically called an EDP (enterprise discount program). These EDPs can be very custom, and can include free consulting, credits to offset their eventual bill, and other offers along with a certain negotiated discount off of any aws service monthly. Depending on the size of the contract this discount could well be into 20% or more off. I've seen credits easily mid 7 figures before. This contract essentially says - you will spend this much money and at the end of the term or at annual periods in the contract if you have not spent, you get a bill for the difference. And also depending on accounting rules - this contract could be considered Capex.\n\nMinimum eligible spend to be able to get an EDP? 500k a year (used to be $1M until recently). Think about how many companies use AWS and would hit this threshold....alot. aws reps also get paid on signing EDPs, so they love them too.\n\n2 - they are going to sell their product on the aws marketplace. The marketplace and having ISVs (which PLTR would be in this case) is relatively new, like within the last 2 years. Only recently (last few months) aws has allowed professional services - not specifically tied to a product offering on the marketplace, to also be sold. The sale process for items on the marketplace can happen several different ways: user finds it and clicks buy, ISV directs customers who come through other sales channels to buy on  AWS (I've seen some offer discounts to do so), or Marketplace specific ISV reps go and specifically sell the product to aws customers and partners (these reps make no money unless someone buys the product). Aws essentially is turning into a software and services disti (comparable distis include SHI, techdata, arrow, cdw).\n\n\nNow - based on the 5 seconds I used ducksduckgo (fuck google) before I started typing this post up, my hunch is the article is referencing PLTR going the way of my #2 meaning. They would be dumb if they were also not under an EDP too though.\n\n\nHow are #1 and #2 related?\n\nLet's say I'm a company who has an EDP, and I didn't know what I was doing when I made the initial commitment and I'm projecting to come up short at the end of my next EDP term. There are a couple ways to fill the gap without spinning up EC2 instances for fun - one of them is spending money on the marketplace (product, professional services). 50% of the value of these spends count against the commitment of an EDP. So, if you are projecting a 50k shortfall on your EDP term - you could spend 100k on the marketplace to cover it and avoid the 50k bill from aws (for nothing). \n\nThat said - companies are moving alot of their transactions to the aws marketplace because of this EDP benefit. Ideally you don't suck and take into account marketplace spend in your analysis for your EDP spend, but alot of companies dont.\n\n\nWhat does this all mean for PLTR stock?\n\nNothing yet. However there are some future indicators to look out for:\n\nJob postings for Marketplace ISV positions, specifically in the ERP space.\n\nPLTR showing up at an aws event in the future (summits or specifically reInvent)\n\nAnnouncements of large companies entering agreements to buy/use PLTR who also use AWS\n\nPLTR Announcing professional services/consulting \n\nPLTR professional services/consulting offers on the marketplace\n\n\nIf one or more of the above happen, it should increase the share value of the stock.\n\nI write this long post as someone who pretty much doesn't own stock (fidelity just puts my money places), doesn't hold any PLTR, and used to negotiate EDPs and was employed by an early adopter of the aws marketplace.\n\nBTW- contino is far from what I'd consider reputable in the sense of using it for any DD.
