{"title": "\"Write CCs to lower your cost basis\" is an exercise in self-deception", "selftext": "It occurred to me that the concept of writing covered calls to \"lower cost basis\" is just psychological trickery. When you write a CC, you net some premium. That premium, however, is completely fungible. Cash is cash. Cash does not carry a memory of where it came from (except for tax purposes). You could just as soon say \"I sold CCs on AAPL to lower my cost basis on my MSFT shares.\" The reason people don't say that is because of narrow framing bias, where they view individual positions or tickers as separately existing atomistic entities segregated from their portfolio as a whole.\n\nIn fact, let me be bolder. You can even say...\n\n\"I got a raise at work in order to lower my coast basis on MSFT shares\"\n\n\"I sold my Tesla to lower my cost basis on TSLA shares\"\n\n\"I won a scratch off lotto ticket to lower my cost basis on GME shares\"\n\n...and it would make just as much sense (tax implications notwithstanding). *Money is money.*\n\nWhich is to say you aren't lowering your cost basis at all. You're just generating income. If you placed a bet on a coin flip, lost once and then won twice, would you claim that you won three times? Every time you enter a play, you CHOOSE to enter that play, specifically. The choice to long stocks/LEAPS and the choice to write CCs against stocks/LEAPS are fundamentally two different choices.\n\nWhy do I bring this up? Because I think the way people relate to CCs is fundamentally dangerous. People feel that once they enter a position they are somehow obliged to at least break even before they're allowed to exit it.

One way to look at this is that paying $100,000 for a car wash, and its operations are 2 separate activities not affected by the other (this is similarly fair). Another more holistic way of looking at this is that given the $100,000 investment, the $100/month needs to go up (or the car wash needs to dramatically appreciate in value), or you might want to consider investing elsewhere. If you were to continue another month and view these independently, and say made $110 the next month, the operations of the car wash look promising alone, but looking at the whole picture *with* the invested capital (which **is** necessary for operations) gives a much better picture of the entire operation allowing you to see that a 10% increase still makes this a poor investment. In fact Id argue a better measure of how much your car wash needs to make would be a % relative to the initial investment, not the absolute monthly income. Now you *could* view the $110 as fungible cash instead of as a rate of return on your **necessary** investment.
