{"title": "TQQQ is a fantastic long term investment, even with a volatility of 50+%", "selftext": "I am making this post because this information is not out there and it seems like most of the \"real investors\" want to ignore these statistics.\n\nEvery time someone talks about TQQQ they only have negative things to say and they don't talk about it like regular long term investments. There are quite literally zero backtests that treat it as a long term investment. With a long term investment you pick a fund or a few funds, buy in and then consistently put money in no matter what the market is doing. But no one seems to acknowledge that if you chose to use the same strategy with TQQQ, even with it's exorbitantly high volatility, it will ALWAYS out perform a regular LT investment.\n\nInstead when people talk about TQQQ they talk about it the exact opposite way that you're supposed to use the stock market; they try to time the market. \"Leveraged ETF's shouldn't be held for more than a day\" they say. So let me show you what the data says when you continually invest every month no matter what the market is doing for 10 years. \n\nThis is simply analyzing TQQQ, starting with $1000 and putting in 200 every month. Obviously you probably don't want to hold 100% TQQQ and common advice is to put in 10% of your income. 200/month is 10% of your income if you make 24k a year. Whereas the average income for individuals in the us is 31k (3100 a year invested) and the average household income in the US is 68k (6800 a year invested). I will post adjusted numbers for that over 10 years at the bottom.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/RlbXBAN\n\nOver 10 years TQQQ would return 19,237% ROI despite dropping more than 50% 3 times over the course of the 10 years. QQQ, with a downside of no more than 17% returned 3,461% in the same time frame. That is the equivalent of 5.5x greater return than QQQ.\n\nAnd if you want to talk about trading psychology we can do that too. To continue to hold even in a downturn of over 50% just look at the percentage gain over the life of the investment. The investment could lose 96% of it's value (which is incredibly unlikely) and you would still have more than you initially invested. I mean in a bear market most people just distance themselves from the market and just continue to buy despite what's happening in the market anyways.\n\nDo I think this investment strategy is for everyone? No. Its clearly not. But I'm 25, I have 40 years until I need this money anyways. Its definitely not for the feint of heart and if you can't manage your thoughts and emotions in a downturn then stick with regular, low risk etfs. But I can tell you this, the NASDAQ is mostly tech and tech is not going anywhere. Also market indexes are some of the only assets that can and will quite literally grow forever. Over time wealth redistributes; as larger companies die or are split up, smaller company's come up and take their place and indexes pick up these new stocks to continue to grow. \n\nTLDR: the NASDAQ isn't going anywhere, tech will continue to grow, the backtests show that higher volatility (while significantly more stressful) is very much a good thing if the asset maintains value despite fluctuations.\n\nOther results for average incomes:\n1,000 initial investment, 259/month 32,080 total invested, 608,561 10y return\n1,000 initial investment, 568/month 68,040 total invested, 1,261,642 10y return\n\nEDIT: 2 years later after a total downturn of ~80% my tqqq investment is at all time highs today despite being ~60% off all time highs of the underlying asset. The portfolio as a whole is about 10% off of all time highs because the poor performance of treasuries given the debt ceiling issues and rising interest rates.

TQQQ has larger decay but it's something for investors to take advantage of and buy on sale.\n\nThe stock market tends to have a handful of days of large losses and a lot of days of modest gains, this behavior is ideal for levered products since they compound on the way up day after day (build a spreadsheet model and test for yourself). \n\nHave a trading plan for TQQQ, don't just buy and forget.  Buy it on dips with a stoploss.  Move your stoplosses up every few months when it rounds out a higher low.

Everything in the market would be on a perpetual death-spiral if it was just \"minus 10% plus 10% is only 99%.\"\n\nThe decay happens because the leverage is created by trading options, which have time value, which declines continuously.\n\nAs old options are sold and new ones bought, the fund gets paid for small time-values but has to buy large-time values.

It's simply math: 100% * 10% loss = 90%.  90% * 10% gain = 99% of the original price.  This is the definition of volatility decay, all stocks and ETFs experience it, no matter if they are 0.5x leverage, 1x leverage, or 3x leverage.   3x experience to a much greater degree.\n\nTQQQ does not own options.  TQQQ owns stock in each of the QQQ components, swaps with a 10+ major banks, a futures position in the NASDAQ 100.  It does not experience time decay in the sense that options do because futures don't have a strike prices.  The bank swaps insure that the futures position maintains an appropriate daily leverage.  \n\nAny change is not because of time decay in holdings of TQQQ, the bank swaps make sure of that.  I understand contango and backwardation, I trade UVXY where that's a key concept, but those aren't a factor in the price of TQQQ at all.  \n\nTQQQ decay is no joke: average annual return for the past 10 years is 47.65%, which is only 2.4x the average annual return for QQQ over the past 10 years (19.92%).   It's not 3x because of the decay I talked about, but the return of QQQ is also affected by that decay just to a lesser extent since it's only 1x leverage.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Contango was invented for futures.

{"title": "Apple-backed Chinese ride service Didi Chuxing files privately for IPO with ~$100B valuation", "selftext": "* DiDi is a Chinese vehicle for hire company headquartered in Beijing with over 550 million users and tens of millions of drivers. The company provides app-based transportation services, including taxi hailing, private car hailing, social ride-sharing and bike sharing; on-demand delivery services; and automobile services, including sales, leasing, financing, maintenance, fleet operation, electric vehicle charging and co-development of vehicles with automakers.\n\n*Owner and founder is Cheng Wei, ex Sales Manager of *BABA*, and Regional Manager of Alipay.\n\nIn 2014, Cheng hired Jean Liu (Liu Qing), a former *Goldman Sachs Asia* managing director, as the COO of the company.\n\nIn February 2015, the company merged with its rival Kuaidi Dache and was renamed Didi Kuaidi (later renamed Didi Chuxing or \u201cDiDi\u201d).\n\nIn August 2016, DiDi acquired all assets of the Chinese division of *Uber*.\n\nSince the company was founded in 2012, under the leadership of Cheng Wei and Jean Liu, DiDi has grown to become one of the world\u2019s highest valued tech start-ups.\n\nBy September 2015, Didi Kuaidi had obtained 80% market share in private car hailing services and 99% of the taxis market share. The same month, Didi Kuaidi announced the launch of a rebrand process, including a plan to rename itself \"Didi Chuxing\".\n\n*2016: Acquisition of Uber China*\n\nBy the beginning of 2016, *Uber China*, which started its Chinese operations in 2015, had become a major competitor to Didi Kuaidi. Uber's then-CEO, Travis Kalanick, claimed the company was losing over US$1 billion annually in China.\n\nIn June 2016, DiDi closed a US$4.5 billion fundraising round, with investors including Apple Inc., China Life Insurance Co., and a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. As part of the round, DiDi secured a $2.5 billion syndicated loan arranged by China Merchants Bank Co. This equity share fundraising round is one of the world's largest by any private company, surpassing the previous record set by DiDi.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, DiDi announced that it would acquire Uber China in an acquisition valuing Uber China at US$35 billion. As part of the deal, Uber acquired 5.89% of the combined Chinese company with preferred equity interest which at the time equated to a 17.7% economic interest in DiDi. The transaction also provided DiDi with a minority equity interest in Uber.\n\nIn April 2019, *Uber* released a public version of its S-1 filing ahead of its planned initial public offering. As part of the filing, Uber revealed that at the time of filing, the company owned a 15.4% stake in DiDi. Uber's stake in the company was diluted (from 17.7% in 2016 to the 2019 stake) as a result of new investments from additional investors since 2016.\n\n* 2017\u2013present: business expansion, crisis and safety system enhancement\n\nIn March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that *SoftBank Group Corporation* approached DiDi with an offer to invest $6 billion in the company to fund the ride-hailing firm's expansion in self-driving car technologies, with a significant portion of the money to come from SoftBank's then-planned $100 billion Vision Fund.\n\nOn 28 April 2017, DiDi announced it closed a new financing round of over US$5.5 billion to support its global expansion strategy and continued investments in AI-based technologies. The round valued the company at US$50 billion.\n\nIn December 2017, *Reuters* reported that DiDi had raised $4 billion for a global push into foreign markets and investments into technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.\n\nIn May 2018 the company received a wave of negative media coverage when a female passenger on the company's Hitch social carpooling service was murdered by her driver. In August of the same year, a second female passenger was raped and killed by her driver using the same Hitch service on the DiDi platform. Following these incidents, DiDi suspended its Hitch services in August 2018, and began to reform its platform with improved safety standards. In September 2018, Didi announced an investment of $20 million in customer service, The app's safety updates included an evolving set of safety precautions and in-app functions, including the formation of an in-app safety center, en-route audio recording, police assistance button and blocking function to restrict service from certain drivers and passengers. The company also invested $20 million in its customer service offerings and increased its in-house customer service team to 8,000 staff. As part of the update, DiDi created an online discussion platform to facilitate online and offline national public opinion surveys in China. Media reported that in 2018, DiDi recorded losses of up to $1.61 billion owing to heavy spend on training and recruitment of qualified and skilled drivers.\n\nIn 2018, the company launched its \"Red Flag Steering Wheel\" program in which verified Communist Party of China members would be visible as drivers. The company also pledged to hire 1,000 Communist Party members as part of its safety drive.\n\nIn 2018, the company launched a bike and e-bike sharing platform and expanded vertically into auto service sector with the spinoff of Xiaoju Automobile Solutions, a platform providing auto sales, leasing, financing, car maintenance, refueling and recharging services to driver partners on the platform and independent vehicle owners.\n\n* Since 2015, DiDi has invested in Grab, Lyft, Ola, Uber, 99, Bolt (Taxify) and Careem, and expanded into Latin America, Australia and Japan. In January 2018, DiDi acquired 99, a Brazilian ride hailing app.\n\n* Services: \n\nDiDi serves 550 million users across over 400 cities with products including Taxi, Express, Premier, Luxe, Bus, Designated Driving, Enterprise Solutions, Bike Sharing, E-bike Sharing, Car Rental and sharing, and food delivery. A total of 7.43 billion rides were completed on DiDi's platform in 2017. \n\nSome of DiDi's services include: \n-DiDi Taxi\n-DiDi Express\n-DiDi Premier\n-DiDi Designated Driving \n-DiDi Enterprise Solution \n-DiDi Bus\n-DiDi Luxe\n-DiDi Bike Sharing \n-Xiaoju Automobile Solutions\n-DiDi Financial Services\n-DiDi Food\n-DiDi English (In May 2017, DiDi released an English-language service in the Chinese mainland. The service offers English language user interface and a real-time, in-app, instant text message translation to facilitate rider-driver communication)\n\n*Technology: \n\n-Artificial Intelligence (AI) : The DiDi Research Institute is focused on AI technologies including machine learning and computer vision to optimize the platform's dispatch system and route planning services. A few hundred scientists work on deep-learning technologies at the institute. To expand on this research, DiDi launched AI Labs in Beijing and in 2018 the company opened DiDi Labs in Mountain View, California. This facility mainly focuses on AI-based security and intelligent driving technologies.\n\n-Big Data Operation : Big data operation: DiDi is building a cloud platform to integrate anonymized data from sensors on vehicles, static information and real-time events from roads with anonymized platform data including pick-up and drop-off, trips and carrying capacity information. This data allows platform supply and demand to be balanced efficiently, and enables mitigation tactics for traffic congestion.\n\n-DiDi Smart Transportation Brain is powered by AI and cloud technology\n\n* Globalization :\n\nAugust to September 2015: invested in Grab, Lyft, and Ola.\n\nAugust 2016: acquired Uber China and obtained an equity interest in Uber.\n\nJanuary 2017: made a strategic investment in 99, Brazil's largest local shared mobility provider.
