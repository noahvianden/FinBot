{"title": "An alternative to profit from Bitcoin's bull market using MARA options (with the potential of achieving bigger profits)", "selftext": "Here's an alternative to profit from the current bitcoin bull market. The good thing about this alternative is that it doesn\u2019t involve buying or selling crypto (so you don\u2019t need to get your hands dirty with that). Instead it uses a traditional finance instrument such as options contracts. \n\nThere are a bunch of publicly traded companies that have bought bitcoin with part of the cash they had sitting in their treasury. The most notable ones that we know of are:\n\n\\- Microstrategy (MSTR)\n\n\\- Marathon Patent Group (MARA)\n\n\\- Riot Blockchain (RIOT)\n\n\\- Square (SQ)\n\n\\- Tesla (TSLA)\n\nOf these, Square and Tesla have a very large market capitalization that is linked to the main activities of these companies (payment processing and car manufacturing respectively). This means that whilst their price might go up or down with BTC some times, the level of correlation with BTC price movements is not as big.\n\nIf we look at the other 3 (MSTR, MARA, RIOT) they have a smaller market cap to start with AND a higher percentage of bitcoin holdings relative to their market cap. In practice what that means is that the correlation between their stock price and BTC price is much higher. So these are stocks that can be used as an alternative to owning BTC (they act in practice as a Bitcoin ETF). \n\nI picked MARA purely because their current stock price ($49) makes it a lot easier to enter the market with a smaller investment, especially when compared to MSTR which trades at over $700 per share.\n\nSome observations about MARA:\n\n\\- Their main business activity is already related to Bitcoin. They buy bitcoin mining equipment and set up mining rigs. \n\n\\- They bought a significant amount of bitcoin (around 4,800 valued at $150M at the time when it was purchased.) This was equivalent to 10% of their market cap when it was bought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat\u2019s the relationship between MARA\u2019s price and bitcoin? \n\n\\- since July 2020 MARA stock has risen about 5x more than BTC price\n\n\\- since November 2020 MARA stock has risen about 4x more than BTC price\n\n\\- since January 2021 MARA stock has risen about 1.5x more than BTC price\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk-return relative to bitcoin:\n\n\\- MARA\u2019s Sharpe Ratio since March 2020 is 3.39\n\n\\- Bitcoin\u2019s Sharpe Ratio since March 2020 is 3.05\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the price of MARA is correlated to BTC but MARA has higher average returns and a higher Sharpe ratio than BTC.\n\nHere\u2019s my options play from the latest bitcoin dip (this can be replicated at any Bitcoin dip)\n\n\\- Buy MARA at-the-money or slightly in-the-money long-term Call options that expire on the 21/1/2022 (to capture the bitcoin bull cycle in full). \n\n\\- I bought mine with a strike price of $22 towards the end of February with MARA trading at $26 at the time. The cost was $1,850 per contract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s the potential returns of this play with different bitcoin scenarios at different times:\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $70k by the 1st of June 2021:\n\n* Mara stock price would range between 42.9 and 82.3\n* January 22 call options would be between 65% and 261% in profit\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $100k by the 1st of October 2021\n\n* MARA stock price would range between $66.88 and $162.26\n* January 22 C options would range between 160% and 661% profit\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $200k by the 1st of December 2021\n\n* MARA stock price would range between $146.76 and $428.52\n* January 22 C options would range in between 574% and 2095% profit\n\nAnd here\u2019s how they compare to buying bitcoin at the same dip:\n\n\\- If you had invested $1,850 at the end of February you\u2019d have $8,100 if bitcoin reaches $200k.\n\n\\- If you had bought $1,850 dollars worth of MARA shares at the end of February you\u2019d have in between 10,440 and 30,490 dollars if bitcoin reaches 200k\n\n\\- If you had bought a MARA January 22 22 dollar call option you\u2019d have in between $12,450 and $40,600 USD.\n\nIf it's of interest I can provide updates on the performance periodically. So far the play is sitting at around 70% profit.\n\n(note the text is summarised in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKAM0lD82k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKAM0lD82k))", "id": "mpasid", "created_utc": 1618222172.0, "score": 304, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "I'm up over 900% on Mara shares. been selling CC for months as well. \n\nFull disclosure: I have no idea what they do.", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I dipped out, couldn\u2019t take the ride I guess", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "I got assigned and got scared", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26946738362312317}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1080271378159523}, {"body": "> I have no idea what they do\n\nThis is the way", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25898608565330505}, {"body": "LOL this is the way", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13916271924972534}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3767349123954773}, {"body": "MARA and RIOT are proof boomers literally don\u2019t know how crypto works", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "I'm going to be honest and agree.

As part of logging transactions and collecting transactions fees, they may also 'find' a token (BTC) by being the first to solve a particular cryptographic calculation. So miners profit from both effort and luck.\n\nConsensus refers to the fact that the 50%+ of miners must calculate and log and verify the transaction onto the ledger for the transaction to be confirmed. This takes 1-10 mins typically. Theoretically, you could install enough miners to take over 50% of hashrate output and then control the blockchain ledger. Practically, this is not possible.\n\nExchanges are middlemen, but not for blockchain transactions per se. They allow you to exchange currencies.\n\nThink of Exchanges as currency exchange houses, and miners as little invisible fairies watching over your shoulder and logging each transaction you make as you spend/collect tokens so you can't cheat and spend it twice (via a skill-testing-crytographic-question). 50% of their fairy friends will confirm that you aren't cheating by answering the skill-testing-question the same way. Some lucky fairies will collect BTC tokens along the way.\n\nTo answer your question earlier - blockchain tokens are a nice way to store value because they are units that cannot be counterfeited.\n\nTransferring this value to someone else is also easy, fast, and cheap - think about how much it costs to wire money ($25-80) to someone and how long it takes (1-3 days) before you can confirm everything went well.\n\nAs someone mentioned previously, the total number of BTC tokens is capped at 21 million BTC. So the value must increase over time as all the tokens are found and also some tokens will be lost (people dying without passing on their wallets, etc.). No entity can execute QE quantative easing and 'print' more BTC, the way federal governments do with fiat currencies, so that method of devaluing BTC cannot occur.\n\nAll this taken together, it means that there may be upheaval on how Banks, Federal Reserves, and FinTech payment companies will work in the future. Gold has historically been the 'store of value' asset that people used in the past during times of upheaval - but it was always a pain to buy/sell gold. Some believe that BTC is starting to become that 'store of value' now, but on top of this, it is very liquid and you can easily buy/sell BTC.\n\nSide note: day-trading BTC is tricky as the markets are unregulated and there are lots of whales out there pushing their weight around with market manipulation techniques that are typically illegal in equities markets.

However, dev stayed and fixed the issue which lasted over 2 hours. The community rallied afterward and we have been on a massive upwards trajectory since then.\n\nThey had over 6 hours to rug us with the unlocked dev wallet after trading resumed, but the dev wallets are now locked.\n\nCommunity polls before Dapp is built is already being done to select which community the group is interested in donating to!\n\nTLDR:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Chartias purpose is the Charity Fund.

Fed officials have been clear that they will continue to support the economy until it is closer to their goals of maximum employment and stable inflation \u2014 and that while the situation is improving, it is not there yet.  \n>  \n>Mr. Powell reiterated that approach on Sunday, saying that the central bank would \u201cconsider raising rates when the labor market recovery is essentially complete, and we\u2019re back to maximum employment, and inflation is back to our 2 percent goal and is on track to move above 2 percent for some time.\u201d\n\n [Fed Chief Says U.S. Economy Is at an \u2018Inflection Point\u2019 as Risks Remain (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/fed-chief-says-u-s-economy-is-at-an-inflection-point-as-risks-remain/ar-BB1fxJue?ocid=msedgdhp)", "id": "mp6d77", "created_utc": 1618199937.0, "score": 239, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "This I like", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15427546203136444}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.019532449543476105}, {"body": "He needs to STFU and get back to the printer!", "score": 242, "replies": [{"body": "He\u2019s literally saying 99% the same thing every interview.

Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease (p = 0.02) in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1\u201320 days after implementation and decreases of 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 percentage points 21\u201340, 41\u201360, 61\u201380, and 81\u2013100 days, respectively, after implementation (p<0.01 for all) (Table 1) (Figure).

We ruined the lives of millions of Americans, sent the suicide rate to the moon in 2020 (more than .5%...), destroyed the education of our children, and crashed our economy over a virus that presents only mild symptoms in 99.6% of confirmed cases to POSSIBLY prevent <1.6% (at VERY best over a 20 day period in warm weather or .5% on average) of growth of that virus??? The margin of error conveniently omitted from this report (typically 3%) would allow the possibility that we caused all of this destruction for a 0% success rate against a virus that has a 3% death rate overall IF you include seniors over 70 and those with comorbidities who should certainly take precautions. We should be talking about a decrease of  50-75-95% to say that wearing masks had a significant impact. Destroy families for 1-2% possibility of a decreased chance of getting a virus?
