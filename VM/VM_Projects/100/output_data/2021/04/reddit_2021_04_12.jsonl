{"title": "An alternative to profit from Bitcoin's bull market using MARA options (with the potential of achieving bigger profits)", "selftext": "Here's an alternative to profit from the current bitcoin bull market. The good thing about this alternative is that it doesn\u2019t involve buying or selling crypto (so you don\u2019t need to get your hands dirty with that). Instead it uses a traditional finance instrument such as options contracts. \n\nThere are a bunch of publicly traded companies that have bought bitcoin with part of the cash they had sitting in their treasury. The most notable ones that we know of are:\n\n\\- Microstrategy (MSTR)\n\n\\- Marathon Patent Group (MARA)\n\n\\- Riot Blockchain (RIOT)\n\n\\- Square (SQ)\n\n\\- Tesla (TSLA)\n\nOf these, Square and Tesla have a very large market capitalization that is linked to the main activities of these companies (payment processing and car manufacturing respectively). This means that whilst their price might go up or down with BTC some times, the level of correlation with BTC price movements is not as big.\n\nIf we look at the other 3 (MSTR, MARA, RIOT) they have a smaller market cap to start with AND a higher percentage of bitcoin holdings relative to their market cap. In practice what that means is that the correlation between their stock price and BTC price is much higher. So these are stocks that can be used as an alternative to owning BTC (they act in practice as a Bitcoin ETF). \n\nI picked MARA purely because their current stock price ($49) makes it a lot easier to enter the market with a smaller investment, especially when compared to MSTR which trades at over $700 per share.\n\nSome observations about MARA:\n\n\\- Their main business activity is already related to Bitcoin. They buy bitcoin mining equipment and set up mining rigs. \n\n\\- They bought a significant amount of bitcoin (around 4,800 valued at $150M at the time when it was purchased.) This was equivalent to 10% of their market cap when it was bought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat\u2019s the relationship between MARA\u2019s price and bitcoin? \n\n\\- since July 2020 MARA stock has risen about 5x more than BTC price\n\n\\- since November 2020 MARA stock has risen about 4x more than BTC price\n\n\\- since January 2021 MARA stock has risen about 1.5x more than BTC price\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk-return relative to bitcoin:\n\n\\- MARA\u2019s Sharpe Ratio since March 2020 is 3.39\n\n\\- Bitcoin\u2019s Sharpe Ratio since March 2020 is 3.05\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the price of MARA is correlated to BTC but MARA has higher average returns and a higher Sharpe ratio than BTC.\n\nHere\u2019s my options play from the latest bitcoin dip (this can be replicated at any Bitcoin dip)\n\n\\- Buy MARA at-the-money or slightly in-the-money long-term Call options that expire on the 21/1/2022 (to capture the bitcoin bull cycle in full). \n\n\\- I bought mine with a strike price of $22 towards the end of February with MARA trading at $26 at the time. The cost was $1,850 per contract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s the potential returns of this play with different bitcoin scenarios at different times:\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $70k by the 1st of June 2021:\n\n* Mara stock price would range between 42.9 and 82.3\n* January 22 call options would be between 65% and 261% in profit\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $100k by the 1st of October 2021\n\n* MARA stock price would range between $66.88 and $162.26\n* January 22 C options would range between 160% and 661% profit\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $200k by the 1st of December 2021\n\n* MARA stock price would range between $146.76 and $428.52\n* January 22 C options would range in between 574% and 2095% profit\n\nAnd here\u2019s how they compare to buying bitcoin at the same dip:\n\n\\- If you had invested $1,850 at the end of February you\u2019d have $8,100 if bitcoin reaches $200k.\n\n\\- If you had bought $1,850 dollars worth of MARA shares at the end of February you\u2019d have in between 10,440 and 30,490 dollars if bitcoin reaches 200k\n\n\\- If you had bought a MARA January 22 22 dollar call option you\u2019d have in between $12,450 and $40,600 USD.\n\nIf it's of interest I can provide updates on the performance periodically. So far the play is sitting at around 70% profit.\n\n(note the text is summarised in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKAM0lD82k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKAM0lD82k))", "id": "mpasid", "created_utc": 1618222172.0, "score": 304, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "I'm up over 900% on Mara shares. been selling CC for months as well. \n\nFull disclosure: I have no idea what they do.", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I dipped out, couldn\u2019t take the ride I guess", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "I got assigned and got scared", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26946738362312317}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1080271378159523}, {"body": "> I have no idea what they do\n\nThis is the way", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25898608565330505}, {"body": "LOL this is the way", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13916271924972534}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3767349123954773}, {"body": "MARA and RIOT are proof boomers literally don\u2019t know how crypto works", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "I'm going to be honest and agree.

As part of logging transactions and collecting transactions fees, they may also 'find' a token (BTC) by being the first to solve a particular cryptographic calculation. So miners profit from both effort and luck.\n\nConsensus refers to the fact that the 50%+ of miners must calculate and log and verify the transaction onto the ledger for the transaction to be confirmed. This takes 1-10 mins typically. Theoretically, you could install enough miners to take over 50% of hashrate output and then control the blockchain ledger. Practically, this is not possible.\n\nExchanges are middlemen, but not for blockchain transactions per se. They allow you to exchange currencies.\n\nThink of Exchanges as currency exchange houses, and miners as little invisible fairies watching over your shoulder and logging each transaction you make as you spend/collect tokens so you can't cheat and spend it twice (via a skill-testing-crytographic-question). 50% of their fairy friends will confirm that you aren't cheating by answering the skill-testing-question the same way. Some lucky fairies will collect BTC tokens along the way.\n\nTo answer your question earlier - blockchain tokens are a nice way to store value because they are units that cannot be counterfeited.\n\nTransferring this value to someone else is also easy, fast, and cheap - think about how much it costs to wire money ($25-80) to someone and how long it takes (1-3 days) before you can confirm everything went well.\n\nAs someone mentioned previously, the total number of BTC tokens is capped at 21 million BTC. So the value must increase over time as all the tokens are found and also some tokens will be lost (people dying without passing on their wallets, etc.). No entity can execute QE quantative easing and 'print' more BTC, the way federal governments do with fiat currencies, so that method of devaluing BTC cannot occur.\n\nAll this taken together, it means that there may be upheaval on how Banks, Federal Reserves, and FinTech payment companies will work in the future. Gold has historically been the 'store of value' asset that people used in the past during times of upheaval - but it was always a pain to buy/sell gold. Some believe that BTC is starting to become that 'store of value' now, but on top of this, it is very liquid and you can easily buy/sell BTC.\n\nSide note: day-trading BTC is tricky as the markets are unregulated and there are lots of whales out there pushing their weight around with market manipulation techniques that are typically illegal in equities markets.

However, dev stayed and fixed the issue which lasted over 2 hours. The community rallied afterward and we have been on a massive upwards trajectory since then.\n\nThey had over 6 hours to rug us with the unlocked dev wallet after trading resumed, but the dev wallets are now locked.\n\nCommunity polls before Dapp is built is already being done to select which community the group is interested in donating to!\n\nTLDR:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Chartias purpose is the Charity Fund.

Fed officials have been clear that they will continue to support the economy until it is closer to their goals of maximum employment and stable inflation \u2014 and that while the situation is improving, it is not there yet.  \n>  \n>Mr. Powell reiterated that approach on Sunday, saying that the central bank would \u201cconsider raising rates when the labor market recovery is essentially complete, and we\u2019re back to maximum employment, and inflation is back to our 2 percent goal and is on track to move above 2 percent for some time.\u201d\n\n [Fed Chief Says U.S. Economy Is at an \u2018Inflection Point\u2019 as Risks Remain (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/fed-chief-says-u-s-economy-is-at-an-inflection-point-as-risks-remain/ar-BB1fxJue?ocid=msedgdhp)", "id": "mp6d77", "created_utc": 1618199937.0, "score": 239, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "This I like", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15427546203136444}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.019532449543476105}, {"body": "He needs to STFU and get back to the printer!", "score": 242, "replies": [{"body": "He\u2019s literally saying 99% the same thing every interview.

Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease (p = 0.02) in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1\u201320 days after implementation and decreases of 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 percentage points 21\u201340, 41\u201360, 61\u201380, and 81\u2013100 days, respectively, after implementation (p<0.01 for all) (Table 1) (Figure).

We ruined the lives of millions of Americans, sent the suicide rate to the moon in 2020 (more than .5%...), destroyed the education of our children, and crashed our economy over a virus that presents only mild symptoms in 99.6% of confirmed cases to POSSIBLY prevent <1.6% (at VERY best over a 20 day period in warm weather or .5% on average) of growth of that virus??? The margin of error conveniently omitted from this report (typically 3%) would allow the possibility that we caused all of this destruction for a 0% success rate against a virus that has a 3% death rate overall IF you include seniors over 70 and those with comorbidities who should certainly take precautions. We should be talking about a decrease of  50-75-95% to say that wearing masks had a significant impact. Destroy families for 1-2% possibility of a decreased chance of getting a virus?

(!)\n\nSo MMs aren't \"shorting\" per se, and their 'shorting' doesn't show up in the TSLA short interest: instead they are increasing/decreasing their very large TSLA inventory as needed - in a broad range of 80m-200m shares, depending on current price action.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4312027394771576}], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I appreciate you doing the work, but that layout is very messed up on my mobile. so it's kinda annoying to scroll over your long post.

Even if it was a issue in Q2, how big would it necessarily be? Bears like to pretend that it's the end of the world. Worse case scenario is that the demand cannot be met and is delivered in Q3 and Q4. \nPersonally for me, Tesla, NIO, Arkk, and other popularly traded stocks have all moved very similarly on the 1/3/6 month chart.

Tesla also beat Q1 expectations. \nBoth companies beat Q4 2020 which is a big deal. I use these 2 companies because they're both in different regions but targeting a somewhat similar consumer base. \n\nAlso, because Tesla moves similarly to NIO, ARKK, PLUG, Palantir, SPCE, and other popularly traded stocks. Perhaps stock movements aren't based primarily on individual movements but rather a general consensus amongst these particular group of categorized stocks. \nThis is why maybe tech after great earnings still sold off mid February.

But that's okay, I understand.\n\nSorry I missed this. The answer is zero. No one manufactures chips in house. Not Tesla, not Ford, not even Apple. There's a limited number of foundries globally that make all complex chips for global consumption and it's definitely a bottleneck in some supply chains. It's just that I don't see any signs of Tesla being affected this time around, probably because they simply stockpiled the chips they need for the coming few quarters ahead of time.\n\nTesla, unlike legacy auto or smaller start-ups like Nio, are both *Rapidly growing* and *have positive cashflow*. These two combined mean that they both *need to* and *can afford to* stockpile crucial components for future production. \n\nImagine if you're Ford. You always buy 100,000 of this one chip cause that's what you put in your pick up truck. If the supplier suddenly only can deliver half that, that will affect your bottom line cause your margins are so low you can't afford to buy extra stockpile. \n\nImagine if you're Nio. You grow, so you buy more chips every month. But you can't afford to place moee than one month's order at a time. Supplier says this month you only get half => affects your bottom line. \n\nNow, imagine a company like Tesla that can afford to keep 3 months of *growing capacity* of chips on its shelves. If supplier says this month is only half production, that won't affect Tesla until 3 months down the line, so they can plan for it. Maybe the next couple months they place larger orders to compensate. 3 months later, when the \"low deliveries\" would affect Tesla, the crisis is over. \n\n\nSorry for the long rant, I kind of wanted to write this down myself :)\n\nTL;DR a temporary component shortage doesn't affect Tesla as much as they are rapidly growing AND cash rich", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "NIO can afford chips and are not struggling financially. They raised capital along with Li,Xpeng, and Tesla.\n\nYou said earlier that Tesla was able to manufacture chips in house which is why I asked where you got these numbers from. Now you're claiming they stock piled necessary chips. Can you source your info for this? other companies produce chips for Tesla.\nI do see Tesla being more prepared though and agree. But this does not mean Tesla will not be affected by a reduction in supplies. This is a problem globally, which is fine. Most investor relations have estimated it will be resolved by Q3, this includes William Bin Li of NIO. Musk also went out and tweeted some reassurance. I also see particular companies like Tesla having good relationships with chip suppliers. \nI agree with you that for certain companies ship shortages should have been priced in the stocks price weeks ago. Which is why we see companies like NIO and TSLA slowly climb up from 2021 lows. I would also look at companies like ARKK, PLUG, PALANTIR, FUBO, and a few other highly traded stocks on a 6/3/1 month chart because they have been moving very similarly. So perhaps the chip shortages as you've said aren't actually that big of an issue. I would be surprised if analysts and investors aren't considering the fact that these short term problems become irrelevant by Q3-4.\n\nI wanted to know your breakdown of Tesla supply chain. That's fine, you don't have too. I do want to say also that a lot of companies do have extra cash on hand. Perhaps during the November round of share dilution. Companies like Li,NIO,Xpeng, and Tesla who all raised cash knew they would possibly have to start bidding for chip shortages.  NIO raised cash unexpectedly 7-10 days after Tesla did while telling investors they had no plans to because they already had 4 billion on hand at the time. The chip shortages have been a problem for a while.\n\nYour TL;DR for Tesla could be easily applied to NIO where you've said they are \"rapidly growing and cash rich\". I own both these companies so I follow them closely. Which is why I had to point out where your comparison of companies conflicted. By the way, is that really how Ford works? because Ford has over $30b cash on hand. This means they could actually outbid supply of chips from companies like  Tesla. \nSo  you say that Tesla isn't as heavily affected but I am in disbelief of that. Which wasn't really my point regarding the current share price.\n\nTL;DR I agree with you for the most part. What I want to know is if ALL AUTOMAKERS are being affected by chip shortages. If that multiple companies globally are being affected. Then why on the 6 month why did NIO and Tesla trend down while FORD went up? Because I am starting to think that perhaps the EV market is cyclical. We had big run ups in 2020 and with a mixture of sector rotations the stock sort of cooled down. The bear case doesn't work for chip shortages if it's only applied in one company but not others. So I really wanted your take on this.
