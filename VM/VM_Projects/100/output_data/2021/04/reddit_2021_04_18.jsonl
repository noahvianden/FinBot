{"title": "600k portfolio, Should I be more diversified?", "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nBefore I begin, I would like to thank each and every member of this sub for their contributions. I began my investing journey in February 2020 as a 39 yr old, newly divorced man. I guess the timing couldn\u2019t have been better, as I\u2019ve watched my net worth grow from 120k-600k in 14 months. My son was just born 6 weeks ago and I\u2019ve noticed my portfolio shrink by 15% even as the market has reached ATH. Highly speculative stocks brought me incredible returns, but now that I have a son, I think I should tone down the risk a bit. Since r/stocks and other investing subs have been so instrumental in my early stock market education, I thought I would solicit ideas to help diversify my portfolio. \n\nHere is what I own, after selling a bunch of spacs and a few other speculative assets. \n\n\u2022Pins -13% \n\u2022Net- 12%\n\u2022Sq- 10%\n\u2022Nike-7%\n\u2022SCHD-7%\n\u2022ENPh-5%\n\u2022Etsy-5%\n\u2022Se-5%\n\u2022Stmp-5%\n\u2022Jmia-4%\n\u2022Nvda-4%\n\u2022Crsr-3%\n\u2022Gan-3%\n\u2022Paysafe-3%\n\u2022Boeing -3%\n\u2022CNI- 3%\n\nCash- $25k \n\nI was thinking of adding Disney and JPM, but I would very much appreciate any other suggestions. Thanks again!\n\nEdit: I probably should have told ya\u2019ll, I added most of these positions in February when I sold my 2000 shares of GME for a life changing amount of money. I had small positions in all these stocks in 2020, but was able to add significantly to all of them once I exited GME between $200-300. My portfolio went from $186k to $600k in a matter of weeks, and I don\u2019t play with options either. \n\nAnd most of this is in various IRA\u2019s and an HSA. Only have $200k in a taxable brokerage account with positions I plan on holding until Powell raises rates next year or the year after. \n\nThese are excellent suggestions regarding index funds. I will research a few and trim a lot of these or sell outright and start in index funds.", "id": "mt4bet", "created_utc": 1618712704.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "A plea for the dividend", "selftext": "Many investors nail down \"dividend investing\" to a % number. In my opinion the current dividend yield isn't even half the story of what dividend investing is about. And also I believe dividend investing is a very bad term. You're not investing in a dividend, you're investing in a company that happens to distribute some of it's profits to shareholders in cash which is called a dividend. Depending on the circumstances these realized gains are taxed, but by having realized the gains you've taken out some risk from the investment without having to reduce your stake in the company. Even if a company goes bankrupt you can have a positive ROI if you've collected enough dividends along the way.\n\nPersonally, I don't invest in companies which don't pay a dividend. This is because companies that pay a dividend know their damn purpose. If a company is committed to paying a dividend and has been doing so over a long period of time that has an effect on the management. Guess which company will use profits in a more responsible fashion for investing in the company, the one thats just throwing any profits they get into potential growth or the ones that only have 50% of profits available for investment? The dividend has a discilipining effect on the company. Some companies have hard commitments to increase their dividend every year. Often they already have a pretty high payout ratio. This commitment forces them to look for new growth opportunities and to be as efficient as possible with their expenses. Some companies don't manage to increase their profits for years yet their keep their dividend sustainable by finding ways to cut costs.\n\nSome dividend yields are distracting, on both ends of the spectrum. MSFT for example has been an incredible dividend grower. A dividend yield of currently 0.86% may seem low now but they've been growing the dividend at such a rapid pace that the yield will increase significantly over time if they continue to do so. When I bought MSFT in 2016 the dividend yield was slightly above 2%. Now my dividend yield based on what I paid for MSFT is 3.73%. The reason the MSFT dividend yield is so low now is because the market has priced in more future growth. This goes both directions. The reason some dividend yields are so high is because the market has priced in future decline. Which is bad news for the sustainability of a dividend. XOM and T may be examples of yields that aren't sustainable like GE and KHC turned out not to be sustainable. If these companies will have to cut their 6 to 7% dividend that I don't know, but the risk of that happening is certainly higher than with a company like MSFT that is only distributing a fraction of it's profits as a dividend. Even if a company pays just a small dividend I'd take that over nothing or too much because they can grow that dividend over time and if you hold long enough the yield based on what you paid can get into ridiculous areas.\n\n**The dividend is what keeps things real** and I don't only see it as a way of realizing profits but also as a filter to filter out bullshit companies. Sure that way some opportunities are missed but yet my dividend paying only company portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 5 years by quite a bit and some companies have increased their dividend significantly since I bought them (MSFT, BLK, PG, SAP, UL, JNJ heck even O managed reasonable dividend growth despite covid and an already high dividend yield). \n\nBy holding these high quality dividend companies I have an ever increasing cashflow into my portfolio without having to sell shares and I can use that cashflow to enter new investments which then again start contributing to my dividend cashflow. I don't have to put a single thought to selling as long as I believe these companies are paying their dividend in sustainable fashion. This means I also don't have to care about market valuation as long as decreasing valuation isn't because of reasons seriously threatening the business of my companies. \n\nI believe this way of investing is not only more mentally endurable but also more successful in the long run compared to trading around hyper growth stocks. I realize many don't have that much money to invest and the dividends they initially get may seem laughable, but I guarantee 99+% of people that enter the stock market with a get rich quick mentally will sooner or later get beaten down badly.", "id": "mtb35f", "created_utc": 1618745362.0, "score": 251, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "Dividends are misleading because share buybacks do the same thing while being more tax-efficient.

Regulation will not kill FSD, if it works it will win out eventually. There is legit argument whether that takes 1 year or 5-10, but if it's safer that human drivers the use case is so compelling that voters will demand it. The real risk is that FSD just plain doesnt work, and the likelihood of that seems to be shrinking weekly with every new beta release.\n\n\n3. This is a risk that most tesla bulls don't give enough credit to. Obviously nobody is close to making an EV nearly as good, but the current market cap assumes massive dominance and a risk-weighted portion of rediculous profits from FSD. Like tesla is valued at 4x Toyota when Toyota makes 8m cars a year and tesla has a goal of 20m (i.e. 2.5x) in 2030. Obviously there is room for superchargers and energy to add value but they have to come through big to justify growth from current valuation without FSD. If a competitor (eg. Huawei, Mobileye, apple) comes out with a legit FSD competitor in the same time frame as tesla that could seriously dent the profits tesla can realize from it and in turn the valuation. I'm obviously still holding (and buying) but this is the top risk I'm watching.\n\n\n4. The other major risk I'm watching is simple execution risk - i.e. whether tesla can grow auto factories, production, and margins fast enough to meet expectations, and growth of non-auto businesses. So far I'd say they are overperforming on the former, and underperforming on the latter (supercharger is doing well, energy ok, solar is sucking hard).

So, in order for competitors to come out with FSD variant in the same time frame two conditions should met:\n\n1. Tesla to make critical mistake which would lead to a big push back\n2. Competitor to get in place data gathering solution, scale it up to relevant size, and train his AI to the point of being production-ready\n\nFor instance, Tesla did a big mistake in FSD development by not starting out from 360 degree 4d video (maybe it was a necessary step, but even if it was really a mistake, it still not big enough to give enough room for anyone to catch up), but I'd say all big mistakes were already done, and there is none big enough for anyone to catch up left.\n\nTelsa's lead (in both data and competence) is just too massive.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think the risk is small, hence why I'm buying and holding Tesla, but I wouldn't categorize it as \"impossible\". As soon as Tesla demonstrates real FSD there will be *billions* of venture capital available to competitors trying to build an equivalent system.

{"title": "PSFE DD", "selftext": "Paysafe is a new entrant to the fintech field. They went public via spac titled ' **Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp** '. And just like every other SPAC in the last 6 months, the stock price has run up then gotten crushed. I personally hate spacs, however if the underlying company is valuable once the merger is complete they can be a good investment.\n\n The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag. \n\nPaysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets. \n\nTaking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee. \n\nOther notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others. \n\nAdvantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinances.\n\nPSFE has a market cap of $9.7 Billion. Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice. \n\nThe market cap/gross profit ratio is 9.7bil/891mil=10.8. At this ratio the company is pretty attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 10.8 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms.\n\nPLTR-68\n\nCOST-6.3\n\nAAPL-19.1\n\nMCD- 17.1\n\nINTC-6.03\n\nSPOT-27\n\nSQ-42.6\n\nPYPL-31.6\n\nVISA-28.8\n\nRelatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is a bit low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ. \n\nTaking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peers (SQ,PYPL), the company would 3x in valuation. \n\nI started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest.\n\nEdit: another notable risk I just at thought of for these guys is currency valuations, they do a lot of transferring between currencies as they have a very large international presence.
