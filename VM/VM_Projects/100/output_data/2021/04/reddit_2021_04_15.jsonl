It could be about the most random person/thing id have a feeling in my chest and stomach that's is too overpowering to ignore its almost like a warning system long before not saying im \"special\"  but STOCKS ... Middle low class here my dad growing up saves every dime and is private about it 900 sq ft 3bd home the usual nothing fancy there have been three stocks that I have always had this pressing feeling about 3 stocks so far and the feeling is always immediate but needs to be followed up by research I'll read the name of a stock in certain sector and just off the sector an the name I get an instinctive feeling that is very strong so ill really dive into some research and history.. And EVERY SINGLE stock ive picked has had massive returns (not bragging or saying I have an advantage or hey listen to me by any means only explaining my experiences and how they feel) as a sophomore in high school I had all the tech stocks it was 08 that was obvious Amazon Google I had 3M I'm in my portfolio but the first stock I had this feeling with was a company called Seattle genetics(SGEN) it was a extremely small company 8 to $9 a share most thought they seemed like real nobodies invested in 08 my dad invested at the company at the time of me telling him this and still to this day will not tell me how much he's made off of it shares sit at 156.58 as of writing...  I got involved in a different type of insulin from pig fat...imo at SGEN still a buy but most are probably going to rate hold\n\nBut the big 1 and more recent one here is VXRT... when coronavirus hit Millions out of work I took to the stock markets with what little promotional money was available w. Sign up and what little funds I had left after feeding housing and putting clothes on my five children I had stayed away from the stock market for a long time as my life was so busy with kids and other things I just hadn't been actively investing only analyzing with coronavirus keeping everyone in the house on lockdown I stumbled upon Vaxart a company specializing leading the industry in vaccines in tablet form... and I thought they won't be the first but they might be the best... They are in a stage 3 trial, and recently had a press release shut down any negative fake narratives about efficacy in May last year i bought a few shares. NOT NEAR enough..kicking myself now it rose from 2.25- now just below $9 ...headed to 14 I think is generally agreeable without an approved covid tablet bexause they are the closest ones to an effective norovirua vax... That makes it a safe investment for the long OR short haul if they hit the covid tablet, it'll soar like you wouldnt beleieve I FEEEL as if its an almost guarantee double im kicking myself I didnt use my savings to invest in May as its up 170% and when the market opens Monday I'm spending all my capital...check it out do your own research and invest in things you believe in.

The short of it is that small satellite constellations are going to take over the old earth centric space market and lower the cost of entry. This will expand the market for who buys the data and feed into more launches. For example, you can find gas leaks in pipe lines, get roofing dimensions without sending someone on top of your house, find greenhouse emission hot spots, monitor global supply chains, gather data on traffic patterns and shopping behavior, etc all  on demand with small satellite constellations. \n\nRocket Lab stands out here because that is who they cater to. Their main payload isn\u2019t a large satellite, it is a small satellite. While it is more expensive than rideshare, getting the right orbit and the right schedule is important for many constellations that want to cover the whole earth with a high pass rate. They are currently the only service doing this and getting to space. They also are setting themselves out to be a one stop shop for satellites by providing high margin items like reaction wheels and star trackers that they can easily validate in any excess space on their own rockets. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they start selling kits customers can use to fly their payloads with.\n\nTheir next rocket is aiming to accommodate more satellites at a time, just like what SpaceX is doing with Starlink. However, Rocket Lab has been leveraging the connections they built to gauge what the market needs. They aren\u2019t shooting for Mars as their end goal, which allows them to cut inefficient excess that SpaceX has to build for. This brings the cost down and makes them more competitive. \n\nIt\u2019s a challenging space to do business in, but their track record is pretty insane.
