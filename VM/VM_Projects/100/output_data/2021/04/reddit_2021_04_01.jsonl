{"title": "Not a bull, not a bear. How I see things right now.", "selftext": "*\\[This was a response to another commenter that I felt like could generate some good discussion. As I will mention a couple of times below, I'm new to investing, so consider this me working through my ideas and please do not take it as financial advice or the absolute truth of things.\\]*\n\nSo - I don't really love the bull case \"Omg new paradigm, low interest rates, never bet against the USA!\", nor the bear case (predicted 20 of the last 5 recessions). TBH to me it just seems like nobody can ever truly know... imperfect information and what not.\n\nI'm totally new to investing, but I did get my degree in economics. The market is definitely running hot right now, but then again, we can kind of afford it at the moment with all the easy money - the Fed is printing money precisely so that markets are more liquid. This is expected. We're also not totally detached from the fundamentals like we were with the dot com bubble. I mean, MSFT at 32 P/E ratio makes sense taking into account future earnings. You could say it makes sense for most of the S+P.\n\nThe problem is that it has to stop at some point. I mean, future earnings could account for the kind of P/Es we have now, but when we start reaching into 40,50, 60... then you're really getting detached from any sort of fundamentals. The other thing to look at is how much leverage is being used. [Right now, it's a lot.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/03/17/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-another-1-9-in-february-continues-record-trend)\n\nBut again, that's to be expected because borrowing is so cheap right now. This is what the Fed wants. The Fed wants people to borrow, spend, invest, etc. Keep the wheels of the economy spinning.\n\nBut everything has limits. At some point the Fed has to pump the brakes on this. They say that's what they will do. But as unemployment is still high and inflation is still below target, they're not there yet.\n\nThat raises a couple of questions for me:\n\n1. Will they actually pump the brakes when its time? Or will they continue to keep interest rates low in order to monetize US debt? Low interest rates means it's easier for the US government to pay back its debt. In theory, the Fed is independent of the US government. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist so I do believe the Fed will act independently to raise rates when the time is right. But it's still something we won't know for sure until they actually do it. And there's also a question of *when*. I'm worried that things get too far ahead of fundamentals... ie, the easy money becomes too easy and the Fed loses control of the ship before it is able to act.\n2. When they do start pumping the brakes, how will the markets react? It was actually the Bank of Japan trying to slowly put out the speculation fire (by raising rates) that caused the Japan asset bubble to crash, leading to the Lost Decade. There's a real concern, IMO, that the markets cannot sustain these valuations without the Fed's support. As soon as the Fed steps in, people might fear the party is over, panic sets in, and we crash.\n\nSo, what am I doing given all this uncertainty? I'm going for a middle-ground solution. I've got about half of my portfolio in a target retirement fund (various index funds) that I've been adding to for a few years, and I've got the other half in individual stocks that are either good, reliable businesses or very defensive stocks. Some are mining stocks in the event of inflation. I'm also holding some dry powder as well as some inflation protected bonds as another place to dump money that isn't cash.\n\nBasically I'm playing the middle ground. If things go well, I will be able to ride the momentum. Not as well as everybody who is 100% in VOO, or 100% in winning tech stocks if they do rally and continue to do so. But I'll still do decently.\n\nIf things go poorly, I'll lose more than someone who was 100% defensive or purely in cash, obviously. But I'll also do a whole lot better than anyone who was 100% VOO or 100% tech.\n\nI'm new to investing so take all of this with a grain of salt. Do your own research. But I think my econ degree, plus all of the research I've been doing the past 2 months or so, has given me some level of understanding of how things tend to work. I think my plan is appropriate given the uncertainty right now as well as my risk tolerance (which is not too high).", "id": "mi8017", "created_utc": 1617320227.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Opinions are like assholes, everyone\u2019s got one", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": ">Opinions are like assholes\n\nI try to break apart as many as possible.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Username checks out", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12178663909435272}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.77339106798172}, {"body": "lmao, tbh there so many people trying to predict or explain how the market works that it makes me stay off reddit sometimes\ud83d\ude02", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Well since we're all trying to put our hard-earned money somewhere, I think it makes sense to have a general notion of what you're doing and why, no?\n\nAs I said, I was just sharing the way I see things.

They are projected to earn about $7.50 this year and over $8 next year which at the current price of $75 in insanely cheap in a market seeing the overall market trading at ~25x earnings.\n\nWhy is so cheap you may ask? Well I\u2019d argue it\u2019s for two reasons 1) Constant fear around Amazon 2) Concern they paid too much for Aetna a few years back. People always fear the unknown and it\u2019s usually from a place of misunderstanding. Let\u2019s take Amazon first. Amazon awhile back said they were going to get into Healthcare and formed a venture with Berkshire and JPM called Haven. I think CVS stock and others dropped 15% on the news when first announced. Now these are big companies and if anyone is going to upend the model it would be them. Well flash forward a few years and they disbanded the operation citing it was too challenging or something like that. This past year Amazon also made news by launching Amazon Pharmacy and more recently Amazon Telehealth for employers. I get what you\u2019re thinking oh no here they come it\u2019s over. This is absolutely hilarious if you actually understood how CVS makes money. Let me tell you how:\n\nCVS has a few primary businesses: CVS Caremark, CVS Aetna, and CVS retail.\n\nCVS Caremark is the largest drug dealer in the US. They are what is referred to as a PBM or prescription benefit manager. As an employer whether it be a public government agency or private employer like Amazon you go through a PBM to acquire your drug benefit coverage for your employees. CVS has thousands of employers ironically including Berkshire, JPM, and Amazon as clients. There are really only three main players in the space (Optum, Express Scripts, and Caremark) which are owned by United Health, Cigna, and CVS which also happen to be health insurers which we\u2019ll get to later. This is where scale really matters. As an employer you want to give your employees the cheapest drugs. As a PBM you use your purchasing power across your customers to buy drugs from manufacturers at the lowest cost. This is why these 3 companies have an impenetrable moat in this industry. Caremark probably buys almost 1/3 of the drugs dispensed in this country. This is why I laugh when I think about the Amazon fears. There is no way they could ever reach the scale of buying power to price drugs low enough to entice employers and government agencies to switch. Unless they\u2019re throwing in a free Prime membership for everyone I think it\u2019s basically impossible for them to break in unless they buy one of the big 3. So what is Amazon Pharmacy you ask? Amazon Pharmacy is just a re-branding of Amazon Pillpack their mail order pharmacy they acquired a few years back. Is it not a threat? Not in the least and that goes back to the pricing model many people don\u2019t understand. Let me explain. If you\u2019re covered by Caremark as an employee of say Wells Fargo you can go anywhere to fill your prescription...CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Costco, or even Amazon. However if you go onto GoodRx and enter your insurance info you\u2019ll see that there are a variety of prices for the same drug. It will always be cheapest at CVS as Caremark will give CVS the best rates. What\u2019s better is all those other places actually pay CVS to be included in their network and have access to their PBM network. So if you fill at Walgreens they make money and if you fill at CVS they make more money. So when people say Walgreens is just a drug store but CVS is more than a drugstore this is part of it. Walgreens and other places you fill drugs don\u2019t have PBMs that represent a huge % of America\u2019s insured.\n\nNow let\u2019s get to the real undervalued gem in their business Aetna. Aetna is the health insurance side of the business and fastest growing. This is the other part of the equation for employee benefits and again same major players in United Healthcare and Cigna. This business encompasses health and dental insurance. Aetna was acquired a few years back in one of the largest acquisitions and largely funded by debt. As you can imagine Wall St hated the deal except for the bankers that did it of course. What\u2019s crazy is CVS was surprised and ecstatic that the deal even closed as it was heavily scrutinized by the Justice department at the time. What I would say about a deal that large is no Board would sign off on that if there wasn\u2019t huge upside to the deal. I mean talk about YOLO let\u2019s borrow a ton of money ($60B) and buy a company. If you are doing that there better be 3x or more the upside, right? So what was Wall St missing? Well first you have to understand the health insurance business which is the same premise as any insurance business which is to insure against risks. Geico insures you against a major car accident while Aetna insures you against a major medical surgery or cancer treatment. What many people don\u2019t understand is the #1 cause of a major medical expense is usually preventive maintenance. Yes exercise but more so taking your medication. I like to say this is akin to Geico being able to tap your breaks if you start to speed in your car. CVS has your health data and if you\u2019re an Aetna member they\u2019re insuring you. So CVS can use that data to intervene early to prevent a major medical event they\u2019d have to pay out on down the road. This is a win/win for all involved and is how CVS is going to change healthcare. I mean this is a health flywheel that will just allow them to win more business.\n\nWhere I\u2019m most excited for them is for their Health Hub strategy. If you are unfamiliar think of it as urgent care within CVS stores. Why I\u2019m most excited is because of what it allows them to do that their competitors can\u2019t. I\u2019m a parent and my wife and I have had many ear infections that we\u2019ve had to run to the Little Clinic which is a similar concept you may have seen in Fry\u2019s grocery stores. Today with our insurance an ear infection and a Little Clinic visit is about $75. Well Aetna is rolling out $0 co-pay plans for these acute care needs at Health Hub stores. $0 is pretty nice! So next time we have an ear infection we can roll up to a CVS Health Hub and get the kiddos checked out, pick up the script for meds, and pick up a bottle of wine for us on the way out. This has huge implications for the industry that nobody is quite grasping yet. It also has huge implications for the retail part of their business that will drive a ton more foot traffic and profits. Just today they said by 2030 they are looking to do 75 billion health interactions. For reference Teladoc did 15M last year in a pandemic year. \n\nSo hopefully I\u2019ve cleared up a lot of misconceptions about CVS and the true business they are in along with who their true competitors are. They are really in an oligopoly with 3 players who have paid the price of admission which is having a PBM and Health Insurance business combination. If Amazon truly wanted to play in this space my belief is that they\u2019d have to acquire one of the 3 as they would have to buy business to compete with the scale/spend on drugs. I honestly think they realized with Haven that this is a tough nut to crack. So oligopoly businesses are usually good to invest in but the one you want to own is CVS because they have a monopoly in stores. There is a CVS within a few miles of everyone in the US which allows them to unlock a lot of value that people have written off as useless before.\n\nValuation:\nCurrently trading at $75 which is ~10 earnings in a market that is over 25x. So it\u2019s way too cheap here but this isn\u2019t a stock to YOLO weekly calls on this is stock to own for a long time. A couple years back they put out an investor presentation showing 10% EPS growth annually past 2022. The best part is it was based on 28% tax rates so tax increases baked in. If you actually model this out this decade you\u2019re talking $19+ dollars EPS in 2030. Throw a 15-20 multiple on that and you\u2019re at $300+. Now I know stocks were going up like that in a month (ahem GME) but for the most part investors shouldn\u2019t ever expect those returns overnight. SP500 annual avg. return is 10% and with where valuations and interest rates are at I suspect we\u2019ll be lucky this decade to average that. So going back to CVS at current price of $75 with $300+ at end of this decade in the cards that works out to a pretty nice avg annualized return of close to 20% assuming you reinvest the dividends. And people might scoff at the thought of them doing double digit EPS growth but if you look up pre Aetna they did just that. Even if they fall short you might see 15% avg annualized which as an investor you can\u2019t expect much better.\n\nWould love to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts!", "id": "mhn92l", "created_utc": 1617250123.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Should wait for the dip. Looking at the past four months the stock goes up, and then down.\n\nNov 23rd 66.78 - Dec 4 74.50\nDec 28 68.08 - Jan 11 73.99\nMar 2nd 68.13 - March 16 75.07\n\nNext time it goes on sale load up on calls.\nDo at 70 sell at 75.\n\nRn the price of the stock is 75 and atm 75.50c April 23rd cost 1.75.   1.75/75=2.3% of the price of stock. So atm three weeks out cost about 2.3% but let's say 2.5% to have some room for error.\n\nAt 70 the calls should cost 70*.025=1.75(cause we bumped it .2% to have room for error.)\n\nWhen it goes back to 75 the profit will be 75-1.75-70=$3.25 per call\n\nSo let's say we buy 50 lots that is 5,000 calls it would cost altogether 8,750 your return would be 5,000*5=25,000 for a net profit of 25,000-8,750=16,250\n\nEasy low risk two bagger. Thanks for this. Could probably make this a four or five bagger by upping the risk and going 2  or 3 dollars otm.\n\nLow risk for wsb. I'm going do math for further otm will update post\n\nSo using the 77c 4/23 as a proxy it cost .91 so when the stock is below 70 three weeks out & $2 otm should cost less then .91 for the 72c while at 70.\n\n110 lots of 100 is going cost 10,010\nReturn at 75 would be 75-72=3*110*100=33,000\nNet profit=33,000-10,010=22,990\n\nSo atm would be a little less then doubling your money while doing $2otm would double it plus a little extra. I don't think that is really worth the added risk, especially if it doesn't get to 75 and only goes to 74 or if you wanted to be safe and close at 74 it would take off a huge part of the return.\n\nDon't forget extrinsic value.

{"title": "Crash alert. Infra plan is a disappointing trojan horse for taxes", "selftext": "The details of the Biden infrastructure plan are now out and let's just say that it is a huge disappointment. We were hoping for unbridled spending instead we get one time, highly precise spending items and a reversal of the Trump tax plan and then some more...\n\nThe reconciliation was meant to allow the dems to spend without any concession of tax increases but it seems that progressive dems want to raise taxes...for the purpose of raising taxes. The sellside is only starting to catch up to this reality.\n\nFirst here is a summary of the tax initiatives by GS:\n\n**A 28% corporate rate**: President Biden proposed this during the presidential campaign. Each percentage point of corporate tax rate increase raises a little over $100bn over ten years in tax revenue, so this proposal would raise between $700-800bn/10 years. *We think Congress can raise the rate to 24-25%, but might start to run into resistance among centrist Democrats between 26% and 28%.\\**\n\n**Tightening GILTI**: Similar to the Biden campaign proposal, the White House proposes to raise the effective tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) to 21% from an effective rate of 10.5% today, move the system to a country-by-country basis that would keep companies from using tax credits from high tax jurisdictions to offset GILTI earnings in low tax jurisdictions, and rescind the policy that applies the tax to income only above a 10% return on physical capital. This would mean that the GILTI regime would apply to most companies with foreign income rather than just to IP-intensive industries like healthcare and technology, and would likely also raise taxes for companies that currently have little to no GILTI exposure. The Tax Policy Center estimated the campaign proposal would raise $442bn over ten years.\n\n**Other international tax changes** The White House release appears to contemplate replacing the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), saying that it would replace \u201can ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States.\u201d It also proposes to eliminate Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), which encouraged US-based companies to hold their IP in the US by setting an effective tax rate on that income similar to the effective tax rate on IP held abroad and taxed through the GILTI regime.\n\n**A minimum tax on book income** The proposal would also establish a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income reported to investors, which would serve as a check against companies that report large profits to shareholders but no profits to the IRS. The campaign proposal would have applied this globally on a country-by-country basis, but the White House release indicates only that it would apply this only to \u201cthe very largest corporations.\u201d\n\n**New restrictions on inversion**s The White House does not define what this would be, but inversions are likely to play a larger role in tax policy if the rest of the proposal were to pass, as the US would then have a high tax on the foreign earnings of multinationals compared with most other developed countries that rely on mainly\n\nterritorial tax systems.\n\n==============================================\n\nGS Estimates a 9% hit on EPS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7ow3gjfujq61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f975ac24b51f5a267719f2b32163fc49168bf4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5ag5dhgujq61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb110ba1a3f932b9260ad331939d5cd590bab722\n\nBAML Estimates a 7% hit to EPS 2022 (currently consensus at 200$\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4whch0hujq61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=a088bffcffb6a4595c138380aa8fd82482f96783\n\n**Ed Yardeni**, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, wrote this week that Biden's proposed 28% corporate tax rate, if implemented, \"would reduce S&P 500 earnings per share by $15, to $200 in 2022.\"\n\nThat 7% haircut is likely more than Wall Street has been pricing in. **UBS** equity strategist Keith Parker wrote on March 9 that he anticipates a 3.6% hit to EPS from Biden's tax plan.\n\nParker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.\n\n==============================================\n\nThe only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*\n\n>While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do \"everything we possibly can\" to pay for it. He said there should be \"tax adjustments\" to former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949)\n\n## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.\n\nMoving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :\n\nthe phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth. Without writting a whole article about the situation at the FED, the market is currently pricing a full hike in 2022 DEC. That is the most insane thing this market has ever done since GME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING.\n\n## BUY ED DEC 2022\n\nand the pricing out of these hikes that are not happening will help with NQ's valuation and compensate for a point or half a point of P/E hence the 5% figure.\n\nTLDR\n\n**SHORT USDJPY, USDCHF, USDGBP**\n\n**LONG GLD, QQQ vs DIA, TLT**\n\n**BUY SPX OTM PUTS**", "id": "mhthzn", "created_utc": 1617277428.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Is it me or does $100B over 10 years of a tax increase to make those companies \"pay their fair share\" somehow not come close to wanting to spend $2T.\n\nMaybe it's just my smooth ape brain.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "You forget legalizing and taxing marijuana.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Pipe dream of you to think Marijuana will get legalized at the federal level.

It's not a \"both sides are the same thing\". There's lots of people in every Tesla sub and forum who are critical of Tesla. Tesla misses deadlines or someone has bad customer service or gets a car with uneven panel gaps or they're just critical of the performance of FSD or something.

Like they were just making statements as if their crazy view of the world was normal and accepted by everyone. And I thought I was still in this sub and thought everyone had lost their mind.

Hope that 1% is worth all of the gains you missed out on by selling CSPs instead of holding shares in 2004, 2005, 2006, and early 2007 (it isn't!).\n\nThe second way is to lower your covered call strike price as the market drops. So you actually get a percent every 45 days or so, so you are doing better by like 10% by the time you hit the bottom. Hurray! And then the stock seriously bounces from the bottom in March 2009. Your shares get called away, and you lock in -40% losses. On the entire way up in late 2009, you sell CSPs, getting like 1% every 45 days while the market zooms up. You end 2008-2009 down a lot more than the buy and holders.\n\nThetagang would be extinct if 2008 was a regular occurence.

{"title": "\ud83c\udf0b \ud83d\udc33 W2W REPORT: BLACKROCK-AGEDDON (ICLN/INRG OVERHAUL)", "selftext": "\ud83d\udc30 \ud83d\udc30 check your email inbox if you did the thing. Happy Easter \ud83d\udc30 \ud83d\udc30 \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **UPDATE: 9 AM PST 4/2** \ud83d\udea8 \n\n**Just got off the phone with SPDJI, you have to be a LICENSED subscribe**r (key word licensed I certainly am fucking not) to get the file delivery of the pro-forma results today \n\n**LETS DO THIS TOGETHER:** take a look at the weighting documents and **PLEASE pm or chat me thoughts on inclusion**. We can do this. \n\n****\n\n**BLACKROCKAGEDDON**\n\nUp too late last week, I found this odd-sounding article titled [Clean Energy ETF May See Big](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-etf-may-see-030000958.html) Overhaul What it meant was so amazing I could not believe it:\n\n>In the latest consultation, SPDJI is now planning to increase [their holdings] minimum to 100, more than tripling the current number of companies featured in the index. This will have a major impact on the exposure of the world\u2019s largest clean energy ETFs, the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) and the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).    \n\nYou\u2019re probably thinking \u201c...oh...um...okay. Whatever?\u201d  Well, let me break this Greek down.  **These BlackRock ETFs (INRG and ICLN) track the S&P Clean Energy Index, and because the index hasn\u2019t been updated in 14 years, it only has 30 holdings.  The new rule proposal means that ICLN/INRG (the BlackRock ETFs) will be required to expand from 30 tickers...to 100...right now.**\n\nSo, BlackRock currently owns WAY too disproportionate a weight in a small basket of stocks that got pumped during the Biden boom post-election (see: PLUG).  **The BlackRock ETFs currently have a stake of 8% or more of EACH of almost a quarter of the stocks in the Index.**  This rebalance means that on a massive scale and in a specified time frame, *ICLN and INRG are compelled to sell and buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stake in EACH of the companies already in the index it follows, AND they would PURCHASE initiating stakes in up to 67 other companies.*\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NwenIEq.jpg\n-ICLN TOP TEN HOLDINGS. SO. MUCH. PLUG.\n\n[I found a document from SPDJI called a \u201cconsultation\u201d that lays out the process.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210324-1345159/1345159_spglobalcleanenergyconsultationexpscorecountweightingresults3-24-2021.pdf). The next morning I e-mailed SPDJI representatives to confirm, and they replied with key information. \n\n[My email chat with SPDJI confirming dates and processes](https://i.imgur.com/xMrOMxR.jpg)\n\nSo, there it is.  **On the 19th of April, according to the criteria listed, 67 new companies are being added to the S&P Clean Energy Index**\u2014the underlyings of which are to be purchased in large quantities by the BlackRock ETFs.  **As 42 Dugg once rapped...IT GET DEEPER.**\n\n****\n\n**Investment Firm Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale released a memo to their clients breaking down the financial implications for current ICLN and INRG holdings\u2014what BlackRock\u2019s gotta buy, and what they gotta sell.** As of this writing they have not answered my calls--apparently the SpotRambo name does not carry much international clout--but [this FT Article had some info on winners and losers currently in the ETF:](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)\n\n>This would mean the iShares ETFs (BlackRock) would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy.\n\n>This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand\u2019s Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover.\n\n>For the US-listed American depositary receipts of Brazil\u2019s Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, the implied selling of $248m of stock would represent 57.7 per cent of the free-float market capitalisation, SocGen said.\n\nWhoa!  This is a lot of critical information. **Recap:**\n\n**What we know**: On **4/19**, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks.  BlackRock ETFS ICLN and INRG track this index, and will therefore participate in a frenzy of buying and selling on/before/around that date. **On 4/2 the pro-formas are released indicating the weighting and therefore candidates**. \n\n**What else we know**: New purchases and redistributions--LITERAL pumps and dumps--are a requirement for the BlackRock ETFs.  **According to SocGen, this includes among others: $400m pump for NEE, and extreme dumps for CEG and others.**  Pumps and dumps so large that they represent 40-50 days of the stocks natural trading cycle.\n\n**What we\u2019re pretty damn sure of**: My mans G has been helping me out with some digging.  We are pretty damn sure **PLUG** will go down HARD  once BlackRock divests to spread the wealth.  NEE is a guaranteed add (BLNK not applicable thanks /u/sirajgb) We are also looking at **VST** as an addition to the index based on call flow and fundamentals. \n\n**What we\u2019ll do**: Next week we\u2019ll give some winners and losers.  I **will keep calling SocGen (sometimes with fake accents to be more convincing), trying to get the report.**  For now, we are looking for clean-energy infrastructure excitement to provide a run on these stocks this week, making it even more juicy to grab some quick shorties. \n\n****\n\n**ELI5**/**TLDR**: **BlackRock ETFs ICLN and INRG have to buy and sell a bunch of stocks** due to the indexes those ETFs track undergoing a massive overhaul.  It will cause major volatility, produce some big winners, and some even bigger losers. Next week I\u2019ll have more picks.\n\n*Quick note: I actually put this in my newsletter sunday and wasn\u2019t going to put it here, but GM is eating away at my conscience.
