{"title": "Is it really better to sell options during high IV? (Quick study)", "selftext": "\\---\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all your generous comments and feedback. It's been a fun and educational exercise and I look forward to continue learning from y'all. \n\n\\---\n\nIs it really better to sell options during high VIX from a purely volatility premium standpoint?\n\nI decided to do a quick study by comparing historical VIX and realised volatility of S&P500 since 1990. Results indicate that while high VIX (say greater than 20) is correlated with higher volatility premium (VIX - RV), it is also correlated with greater volatility drawdown (VIX < RV). In other words, there's a greater chance of IV underestimating actual volatility during periods of high volatility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hf6ns6wbptv61.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa3999ac859df9fca398c76f3a5f1754c4acf7b1\n\nIt seems that the optimal volatility risk/reward to sell options is between 12.5 - 15 VIX.\n\nSee spreadsheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fro7cXN9\\_YQIz4ilqZZXEapsEemezclJAcWnUuaRHGM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fro7cXN9_YQIz4ilqZZXEapsEemezclJAcWnUuaRHGM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI welcome any feedback/comments.

TA tells you who won the past few battles and based on who won, you can get a pretty good guess as to how the war's going...**\n\nNot sure what kind of TA you do? There are 4 classes of TA indicators namely 1) Cumulative 2) Index 3)Oscillator and 4) Overlay. These 4 classes contains over 60 indicators to identify the Trend, Volatility, volume/momentum and resistance/support. The whole point of the TA is to predict future stock price!\n\nhead and shoulders, double/triple tops and bottoms? These are bullshit at best. Do you see a head and shoulder pattern on a chart? What is the time frame? What is the frequency? If you see a head and shoulder on a daily chart with 15 minutes frequency then you will not see that pattern with 30 minutes frequency or hourly frequency or 1 minute frequency. Now if you extend the timeframe to 5 days or 10 days or a month, the chart is completely different! How do you determine the timeframe and frequency? For simplicity, just consider a monthly, a biweekly, 10 days, a weekly, 5 days, 3 days,  2 days and a daily timeframe now consider 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and hourly frequency. How many choices do you have? Now tell me how are you going to select these two parameters to do your analysis? Because for the same stock there will be 48 completely different charts and some of them will show you head and shoulder on one combination but not in other. Some will show you a shape of monkey, some will show you a shape of Tesla logo!\n\n**4. Put it another way, you're telling me buyer and seller sentiment is NOT at all influenced by the current price of the stock and what it's done in the past? Really?**\n\nDo not blame me on something that I never claimed! All I said was that TA does not work. Also, it's not only that the buyers/sellers sentiment is influenced by current stock price the inverse is also true.\n\n*TlDr: TA is astrology and Astrology is horse shit!*", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "1.

By their very nature, they are TRAILING indicators. Past performance is not a good indicator of future returns. But what the past performance and behavior indicates is patterns of thinking about a particular stock. \n\nThe reason I picked triple tops out of the bag, for example, is because they are indicating something very specific - a run on a stock price that gets to a sell wall, again and again until the buying pressure is exhausted.

I would further venture that it's not about playing the prediction game, it's about playing a \"complete the pattern\" puzzle.\n\nHuman beings have a unique ability to classify patterns accurately, and there's scientific studies (supernova hunts, exoplanet hunts) where humans are far better at it than machines *given that you don't have a massive amount of time/resources to train a machine*. But as all other such complex systems, spotting the pattern and classifying it correctly are two different knacks, and the successful pattern traders are the ones that have both knacks. It's like that Australian guy that has spotted more supernovas than any other person or machine or algo in history and most of them have been naked-eye observations (or small telescope, I think). \"There's a pattern to when and when you should look\", he said in an interview.

However, even with the pandemic last year, their \u201cstable\u201d states had a direct loss ratio of 78%. The industry average is 40-60%.

Shouldn\u2019t they be noticing something happening and making a calculated guess where the price is going?\n\nHere's the problem: Public information is already priced into the stock. If there's an earnings report tomorrow, and publicly available information already points to it being strong, then people who are buying and selling the stock are already going to be setting a price that reflects those expectations. By the time you read the article on their website, the movement has already happened.\n\nAbsent insider knowledge, the only way they can make accurate guesses as to the future price of the stock is by having better knowledge insight than anybody else- but anyone who has that kind of advantage is going to be in the game, buying and selling, not writing articles. It's not that they aren't experts, so to say, it's just that they are competing against other experts.\n\nThis leaves them in the position of being, at best, able to explain why something happened after the fact. If the earnings report was unexpectedly low, then the stock price will drop before they can tell you that it's about to drop. They just can't win that race.\n\nOf course, lots of times, they do just make things up. As a rule of thumb, the Dow Jones goes up and down 1% with no news at all- it's just the standard amount of noise in the system. Anybody telling you that a 200 point drop tomorrow is because of X reason is full of shit. If Biden literally shits himself on the podium and the Dow drops 10% in the next hour, then it's fair to call that as the reason.

(VIAC, Buy): The most underappreciated streaming stock", "selftext": "TL;DR - GS PT $75, Citi PT $56, Current Price $41, 70-80% Discount to NFLX and DIS.\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n[VIAC valued at a 70-80&#37; discount to NFLX and DIS](https://preview.redd.it/51icosx6szv61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf942e8850729a640579a767119e98fd826553a7)\n\n \n\n**We see several potential catalysts over the coming weeks and months for VIAC:**\n\n*Paramount+ launch:* After a robust marketing campaign with advertisements on the Super Bowl, The Grammy Awards and NCAA March Madness, we expect Paramount+ to have meaningfully broadened consumer awareness. As a result, we expect strong SVOD subscriber net adds in 1Q21. On a total reported basis (i.e., including Showtime OTT and other DTC services), we estimate VIAC will add 4mn+ global SVOD subscribers in 1Q21 vs. an implied average of 2-3mn per quarter during 2020.\n\n*June pricing change:* In early June, VIAC will debut a $4.99 pricing tier for Paramount+, which will also remove the linear station feeds from the service. At this point, management has indicated they will be able to explore further bundling and distribution agreements, which we view as a potential catalyst to 2021 subscriber growth.\n\n*Improving original content slate:* As production returns across VIAC's studios, we expect the original content slate for both film and television to improve for the company's DTC services, namely Paramount+, and the company's linear networks.\n\n*Improving advertising trends:* As the economy reopens, we believe demand for advertising will continue to recover. With the expanded reach from Pluto TV and Paramount+, we believe VIAC presents advertisers a more holistic offering and the ability to reach all age demos.\n\n**We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $75 for VIAC.**\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nNote also that Paramount+ only launched in the quarter on March 3, and has the below % share of new subscribers. Note how they beat Disney+, Hulu and Netflix! Who cares about $DISC here if it is only 60% of what Paramount+ has.\n\n[Source: Kantar \\(https:\\/\\/www.kantar.com\\/north-america\\/inspiration\\/technology\\/us-closes-in-on-quarter-of-a-billion-video-subscriptions\\)](https://preview.redd.it/d24r9gmqtzv61.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=71929ed733534de46a010026c97d6005a4335f85)\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nAlso, another awesome DD done by  [u/AuricularLuminous](https://www.reddit.com/user/AuricularLuminous/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mvn91c/viac\\_bull\\_thesis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mvn91c/viac_bull_thesis/) where one picture says more than 1,000 words.\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOT A FINANCIAL ADVISER.

This can go both ways of course. If you think Tesla is a fraud or just overvalued, it\u2019s natural to see the credits as unsustainable. If you see Tesla as a legit long term hyper growth investment, it\u2019s easy to handwave away the fact that they have never turned a quarterly GAAP profit without credits.\n\nMy take: while I would really *like* to see a quarter of profitability w/o credits to shut up whiners, it makes no sense for Tesla to throw those credits in the bank instead of use them to grow. \n\nFurthermore, it is completely _inaccurate_ to say that Tesla did not make money on their cars. In black and white, the cars are profitable. There is a >25% margin on each car they sell. The credits represent approximately 5.8% of the vehicle revenue and approximately 21.6% of vehicle margin. \n\nThe energy sector lost $101M, equal exactly to the gain in BTC, so that cancels out, leaving only $80M in difference between regulatory credits and GAAP profit. \n\nTesla reported $666M spent on R&D. How much of that is exclusive to energy rather than their cars? If they spent even $81M (12.16% of their R&D budget) on items other than cars, then they turned a profit on their cars without the credits.\n\nBut what if they didn\u2019t spend 81M on other projects\u2019 R&D?\n\nWell remember they are a growth company, right now flooring the accelerator to grow as fast as possible. How silly would it be for them to hold back growth by not including the credits the *know* they sold in their capital expenditure + R&D planning? It would be absurd. \n\nSo here we have a case where people are lazily confirming their own bias using a top line number comparison instead of doing a  deep dive to understand what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.\n\nShould you, the TSLA investor worry?

An option means you have the right but no obligation to buy 100 shares of whatever stock. Btw a call means your bullish on the stock.

If you contract has more value than what you bout it for then you can sell it back to the market for a profit. If you choose to exercise your contract that means you have to have enough money to buy 100 shares of whatever stock. Most people sell the contract because buying 100 of any shares requires you to be a baller. So options are a good way to making money as well. Warning do not sell calls or puts as that puts you on a short position and if you don't have the 100 stocks you're fucked. If you're a beginner buys calls or puts.

{"title": "AMD: This is why it's down after earnings but will eventually rocket", "selftext": "See my previous AMD DDs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd\\_increasing\\_production\\_by\\_20\\_in\\_q2\\_buy\\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkljmv/amd_increasing_production_by_20_in_q2_buy_before/)  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the\\_amd\\_boom\\_is\\_still\\_coming\\_heres\\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdwvby/the_amd_boom_is_still_coming_heres_why/)\n\nEverything there came true, except the stock is down today. Why? Well take a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means they need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases.\n\nI know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  \n\"This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.\"\n\nOne could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% YoY which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales YoY saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.\n\nOne could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.\n\nOne could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.\n\nAll of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.\n\nWith AMD, there's no need for individual investors to try to turn it around on the short sells, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.\n\nAMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022.\n\nUPDATE: BoA upgraded AMD price target from $100 to $110 and named AMD their #1 pick in all of computing.

I posted the chart in the r/AMD_Stock channel.\n\nSimplistically, AMD has\n\n1. 85% of the shares held by institutions\n2. Short portion as of 04/15 is approx 83M shares 6-7% of the float.\n3. OPTIONS on the other hand, had approx 14+M shard above 82. Which meant, market makers and hedge funds would have lost a pretty coin if the shares went up.\n\nWe saw that in Q4 Blow out earning, call options vastly exceeded put, and the shares tanked. April 30th after Q1 blow out earnings, the big cutoff was 82$, so short sellers, predominately the hedge funds selling those contracts, drove the price down.\n\nThis week is no different, with one minor exception, XLINIX is reporting on May 4th.\n\nThe ONLY 2 ways we can change this, 1 is in our control, the other waiting for the Chinese gov to approve the merger transaction (that would be big news).\n\nHere is what I suggest we should do:\n\n1- If you have shares, put a LIMIT SELL order at $1000/share. That will make you shares unavailable for naked shorting. The less shares available the more it costs short seller to borrow and short sell. KEEP in mind, the short seller position AMD has is not that big. BUT and this is a BIG ONE, the combination of the short seller position and the CALL CONTRACTS in the next 4 months is MASSIVE. THUS the pressure and potential squeeze.\n\n2- BUY and hold shares, and repeat number step number 1\n\n3- buy call options (NOT WITH SHORT TERM EXPIRY).\n\nTHIS IS NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVICE, merely observation on what I have been seeing and continue to see with one my favourite companies.

Here's the kicker, I live in Toronto, Canada.

But here's where my superpower kicks in: im cripplingly retarded, im so retarded that i should be sterilized so i never re-produce. I took the roughly 50k that I had saved up from living at home with my parents until I was 27 like some dirty man-child goblin feeding off of Cheez-Its crumbs and Frozen Pizzas, and, I took another ~30k from my Line of Credit to YOLO $MNMD, an at the time an OTC Schedule 1 drug company. This was all the DD I did:\n\n* googled shroom stock companies, $MNMD was one of the biggest with by far the most pipelines for FDA approval,** lizard brain activated** more chances for success i guess or some shit\n* I've done every drug below the Injectable tier, MDMA, Shrooms, LSD etc\nLogo and website cool **ape brain engaged**\n* i wish i was kidding but thats it, there is no more bullet points, it took about 35 minutes of googling to YOLO $80k, every penny i had to my name.\nI bought in last December and on multiple occasions I've had the ability to sell and finally buy my own place and start building equity, but then i'll just be house poor for 25 years.
