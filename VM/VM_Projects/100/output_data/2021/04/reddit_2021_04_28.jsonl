{"title": "Is it really better to sell options during high IV? (Quick study)", "selftext": "\\---\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all your generous comments and feedback. It's been a fun and educational exercise and I look forward to continue learning from y'all. \n\n\\---\n\nIs it really better to sell options during high VIX from a purely volatility premium standpoint?\n\nI decided to do a quick study by comparing historical VIX and realised volatility of S&P500 since 1990. Results indicate that while high VIX (say greater than 20) is correlated with higher volatility premium (VIX - RV), it is also correlated with greater volatility drawdown (VIX < RV). In other words, there's a greater chance of IV underestimating actual volatility during periods of high volatility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hf6ns6wbptv61.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa3999ac859df9fca398c76f3a5f1754c4acf7b1\n\nIt seems that the optimal volatility risk/reward to sell options is between 12.5 - 15 VIX.\n\nSee spreadsheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fro7cXN9\\_YQIz4ilqZZXEapsEemezclJAcWnUuaRHGM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fro7cXN9_YQIz4ilqZZXEapsEemezclJAcWnUuaRHGM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI welcome any feedback/comments.

TA tells you who won the past few battles and based on who won, you can get a pretty good guess as to how the war's going...**\n\nNot sure what kind of TA you do? There are 4 classes of TA indicators namely 1) Cumulative 2) Index 3)Oscillator and 4) Overlay. These 4 classes contains over 60 indicators to identify the Trend, Volatility, volume/momentum and resistance/support. The whole point of the TA is to predict future stock price!\n\nhead and shoulders, double/triple tops and bottoms? These are bullshit at best. Do you see a head and shoulder pattern on a chart? What is the time frame? What is the frequency? If you see a head and shoulder on a daily chart with 15 minutes frequency then you will not see that pattern with 30 minutes frequency or hourly frequency or 1 minute frequency. Now if you extend the timeframe to 5 days or 10 days or a month, the chart is completely different! How do you determine the timeframe and frequency? For simplicity, just consider a monthly, a biweekly, 10 days, a weekly, 5 days, 3 days,  2 days and a daily timeframe now consider 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and hourly frequency. How many choices do you have? Now tell me how are you going to select these two parameters to do your analysis? Because for the same stock there will be 48 completely different charts and some of them will show you head and shoulder on one combination but not in other. Some will show you a shape of monkey, some will show you a shape of Tesla logo!\n\n**4. Put it another way, you're telling me buyer and seller sentiment is NOT at all influenced by the current price of the stock and what it's done in the past? Really?**\n\nDo not blame me on something that I never claimed! All I said was that TA does not work. Also, it's not only that the buyers/sellers sentiment is influenced by current stock price the inverse is also true.\n\n*TlDr: TA is astrology and Astrology is horse shit!*", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "1.

By their very nature, they are TRAILING indicators. Past performance is not a good indicator of future returns. But what the past performance and behavior indicates is patterns of thinking about a particular stock. \n\nThe reason I picked triple tops out of the bag, for example, is because they are indicating something very specific - a run on a stock price that gets to a sell wall, again and again until the buying pressure is exhausted.

I would further venture that it's not about playing the prediction game, it's about playing a \"complete the pattern\" puzzle.\n\nHuman beings have a unique ability to classify patterns accurately, and there's scientific studies (supernova hunts, exoplanet hunts) where humans are far better at it than machines *given that you don't have a massive amount of time/resources to train a machine*. But as all other such complex systems, spotting the pattern and classifying it correctly are two different knacks, and the successful pattern traders are the ones that have both knacks. It's like that Australian guy that has spotted more supernovas than any other person or machine or algo in history and most of them have been naked-eye observations (or small telescope, I think). \"There's a pattern to when and when you should look\", he said in an interview.

However, even with the pandemic last year, their \u201cstable\u201d states had a direct loss ratio of 78%. The industry average is 40-60%.

Shouldn\u2019t they be noticing something happening and making a calculated guess where the price is going?\n\nHere's the problem: Public information is already priced into the stock. If there's an earnings report tomorrow, and publicly available information already points to it being strong, then people who are buying and selling the stock are already going to be setting a price that reflects those expectations. By the time you read the article on their website, the movement has already happened.\n\nAbsent insider knowledge, the only way they can make accurate guesses as to the future price of the stock is by having better knowledge insight than anybody else- but anyone who has that kind of advantage is going to be in the game, buying and selling, not writing articles. It's not that they aren't experts, so to say, it's just that they are competing against other experts.\n\nThis leaves them in the position of being, at best, able to explain why something happened after the fact. If the earnings report was unexpectedly low, then the stock price will drop before they can tell you that it's about to drop. They just can't win that race.\n\nOf course, lots of times, they do just make things up. As a rule of thumb, the Dow Jones goes up and down 1% with no news at all- it's just the standard amount of noise in the system. Anybody telling you that a 200 point drop tomorrow is because of X reason is full of shit. If Biden literally shits himself on the podium and the Dow drops 10% in the next hour, then it's fair to call that as the reason.

(VIAC, Buy): The most underappreciated streaming stock", "selftext": "TL;DR - GS PT $75, Citi PT $56, Current Price $41, 70-80% Discount to NFLX and DIS.\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n[VIAC valued at a 70-80&#37; discount to NFLX and DIS](https://preview.redd.it/51icosx6szv61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf942e8850729a640579a767119e98fd826553a7)\n\n \n\n**We see several potential catalysts over the coming weeks and months for VIAC:**\n\n*Paramount+ launch:* After a robust marketing campaign with advertisements on the Super Bowl, The Grammy Awards and NCAA March Madness, we expect Paramount+ to have meaningfully broadened consumer awareness. As a result, we expect strong SVOD subscriber net adds in 1Q21. On a total reported basis (i.e., including Showtime OTT and other DTC services), we estimate VIAC will add 4mn+ global SVOD subscribers in 1Q21 vs. an implied average of 2-3mn per quarter during 2020.\n\n*June pricing change:* In early June, VIAC will debut a $4.99 pricing tier for Paramount+, which will also remove the linear station feeds from the service. At this point, management has indicated they will be able to explore further bundling and distribution agreements, which we view as a potential catalyst to 2021 subscriber growth.\n\n*Improving original content slate:* As production returns across VIAC's studios, we expect the original content slate for both film and television to improve for the company's DTC services, namely Paramount+, and the company's linear networks.\n\n*Improving advertising trends:* As the economy reopens, we believe demand for advertising will continue to recover. With the expanded reach from Pluto TV and Paramount+, we believe VIAC presents advertisers a more holistic offering and the ability to reach all age demos.\n\n**We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $75 for VIAC.**\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nNote also that Paramount+ only launched in the quarter on March 3, and has the below % share of new subscribers. Note how they beat Disney+, Hulu and Netflix! Who cares about $DISC here if it is only 60% of what Paramount+ has.\n\n[Source: Kantar \\(https:\\/\\/www.kantar.com\\/north-america\\/inspiration\\/technology\\/us-closes-in-on-quarter-of-a-billion-video-subscriptions\\)](https://preview.redd.it/d24r9gmqtzv61.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=71929ed733534de46a010026c97d6005a4335f85)\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** \n\nAlso, another awesome DD done by  [u/AuricularLuminous](https://www.reddit.com/user/AuricularLuminous/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mvn91c/viac\\_bull\\_thesis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mvn91c/viac_bull_thesis/) where one picture says more than 1,000 words.\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80** **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOT A FINANCIAL ADVISER.
