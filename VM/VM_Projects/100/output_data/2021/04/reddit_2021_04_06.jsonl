You can use it to see who\u2019s a fellow member of WSB and who\u2019s actually making money.", "selftext": "[Here\u2019s](https://www.reddit.com/r/investmentdata/comments/kj69oo/track_trading_by_us_senators/) the dashboard tracking trading by U.S. Senators.\n\n[Senate Stock trading vs. S&P 500](https://preview.redd.it/4tqxbg3gxkr61.png?width=1960&format=png&auto=webp&s=da597db3d306e5abf848080cec1726e6bce09730)\n\nA while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I\u2019ll copy that below:\n\n**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**\n\nComstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.\n\nShe bought \\~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.\n\n**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***\n\nLowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.\n\n**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***\n\nThe Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.\n\n**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***\n\nPat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.\n\nInsider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.\n\nWSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.\n\n**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***\n\nMarshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.\n\nWhat Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.\n\n**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***\n\nThe story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.\n\nAlthough he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.\n\nSadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.\n\nAfter holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.", "id": "mlfhvd", "created_utc": 1617726231.0, "score": 2959, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "Me before reading this: \"representatives should not be allowed to own individual stocks as a measure to protect their constituents from potential corruption.\"\n\nMe after reading Sheldon Whitehouses' track record: \"representatives should not be allowed to own individual stocks for their own safety.\"", "score": 939, "replies": [{"body": "He liked the stock.

I'm laughing irl because today was the FIRST day I started playing both sides of TSLA with calls and puts AND I hit the vape. \n\nThe entire trading day was literally slo mo for me because I was faded as fuck.\n\nTo give insight: I honestly can't tell IF I am truly retarded or that I'm used to how TSLA moves because of an entire year of rollercoaster trading it...\n\nI did have a hiatus/trading break for a few months because I got the covid and other responsibilities kept me from actively trading/observing the market.\n\nI came back March 5th after TSLA dropped bigly. After seeing March 8th dip to $560~ and buying in, I saw the resistance levels at $690, $700, $710 (Tradingview charts will show it but it's quite obvious even by observation) \n\nEverytime TSLA made a move for $690/700/710, it would immediately get crushed down to lower support levels $680, $660, even $600 before bouncing back up. These were observations throughout March.\n\nEVERY trading day is different and the overall market conditions / news also needs to be taken into account.\n\nBut to keep it short/simple- I.. believe it or not browse wsb/stocktwits like a true autist to gauge other retard's sentiments. \n\nNews: They smashed deliveries/productions numbers and it was \"unexpected\" for everyone, bulls and bears, retards and analysts. Regardless, this is a little catalyst to get this little retard train chugging ALONG with SPY highs, QQQs rallying, April bullish month, run up to ERs. \n\nAll of these factors are BULLISH for TSLA. Fuck what people say about PEs and valuations and all that nonsense. Literally doesn't matter here- the argument of comparing TSLA with other car companies is invalid. If you're a TSLA trader you have to understand TSLA GOES UP, but it also goes down just as fast. It's heavily shorted, a fuck ton of degens play TSLA options which attributes to the volatility, short squeezes and gamma squeezes.\n\n\nMax pain: This stock is HEAVILY controlled by MMs to make as much money burning weeklies calls/puts. I've seen TSLA close BELOW $700, 2 weeks in a row just to fuck over all the call volumes.\n\nGoogle says:\nThe Maximum Pain theory states that an option's price will gravitate towards a max pain price, in some cases equal to the strike price for an option, that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless.\n\nMax pain theory: http://maximum-pain.com/options/TSLA\n\nFor example today:\n\nI would buy $690 puts whenever TSLA is around $695-700. I accumulated puts for the lowest price possible in 5-10 contract increments. I anticipated TSLA is gonna flush/sell off towards end of day along with SPY/QQQs. At that point I would close my puts and pick up cheap $700 weeklies to anticipate a gap up the next day.\n\nBut throughout the day, on every dip to support $680, 685, I load up on $700 calls- and unload when it gets close to $695-700, aiming for 10-15%. I'm not holding in hopes of a big runner. If it runs, and I miss out, oh well. If I do chase, I chase small. Either way I just commit to it- by the time I hesitate, the trades over and I'm bagholding or FOMOing\n\nHope that helps- been a long day so my thoughts are scattered a bit lol", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "You are TSLA options day trader.\nCongrats, and fuck you.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Do you set stop losses, how much do you allow yourself to lose?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No stop losses.

{"title": "MYOV: Deep Value and Possible Buy Out", "selftext": "Okay smooth brains, gonna come at you with some DD on a true value play (for those of you that can read). With a great entry as of writing.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n1 great drug, 3 potential use cases.\nThe basics of any biotech pharma company are the drugs and what they do. Simply put, relugolix (orgovyx) was approved by the FDA in December for the treatment of Prostate Cancer. The drug was so much better than its competition, they were granted priority review by the FDA. How much better were they? Well the competition was a once a month shot that had a high mortality rate due to cardiovascular issues. Since this approval, they have signed a 4.3b deal with pfizer for half the drug, and are now commercializing this together at a rapid pace.\n\nThe other use cases are endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids have a pdufa (fda approval deadline) of June 1st and after meeting and exceeding all 3 phases of clinicals, are highly likely to pass (these are big positive catalysts).\n\nThis is also accompanied by 2 additional publications in the New England medical journal. One of the most renowned journals in the world.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the basics in Lehman\u2019s terms, let\u2019s move on to the strategic outlay.\n\n\nIn january of 2021, Pfizer and Myovant announced a strategic partnership for men\u2019s prostate cancer worth up to 4.3b for myovant. It also resulted in heavy upfront cash payments, and royalties in the double digits to myovant moving forward. After this announcement, the stock shot up to $31 a share.\n\nBefore this, another pharma giant, sumitomo, decided it was going to expand its pharmaceuticals pipeline. To do so it started an American subsidiary named sumitovant and purchased Roivants share of 5 different companies. To date, 4/5 of the companies are now private with urovant recently getting bought out by sumitovant at 100% premium. \n\nMyovant is the crown jewel of the vants. If you go to sumitovants website, they claim ownership over myovant already (53.5% makes them a majority holder).\n\nIt\u2019s my theory that myovant is not far behind and will likely be purchased before June 1st PDUFA. At this time, the stock has been seeing a pretty large short interest increase and is trading below the PPS it had in November before approval for relugolix and before the Pfizer deal. \n\nWithout a buyout, this is a steal of a value play.\n\nMyovant has roughly 40% of their market cap in cash. Pfizer valued just the prostate cancer application at 8.4b. Their current market cap is ~1.8b and they are trading at $18.93 a share.\n\nI plan to ride this rocket to Valhalla \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nTLDR:\nCompany has successful drug applications that are new standards of care, a massive deal with Pfizer, wildly undervalued, and a potential buyout candidate. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 Positions: ~20k shares, 326 calls dated from 4/16 all the way to 1/22\n\nQuick about me: I\u2019ve been on WSB (mostly lurking) since mid 2020 and trading for years. My past plays include riding Tesla from $100 presplit, sunrun from $6, and of course GME from $10 all the way up to $400. \n\n\nNone of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

Lynn was phenomenal and personally I think she was ousted because sumitomo was upset about the Pfizer deal, or because the deal involved pfizer getting half the rights and sumi getting to buy the company. This works because Pfizer had a right of first refusal to purchase as part of their seed funding agreement with myovant.\nUltimately my main concern is that 3 of the board members are sumitovant plants, and that they might try to buy the company for less than its worth.\nFurthering concerns, the stock is heavily manipulated due to its low volume. It\u2019s very easy to walk the price down using algos. \nIt also has a high short interest, which will cause a squeeze in the case of a buyout and could possibly send the PPS over the buyout offer. \n\nAt the end of the day, I appreciate the advice, but I\u2019m probably not going to change.

Volumes were around a third of what Deliveroo\u2019s advisers had anticipated.\n\n\nShares in Deliveroo tumbled as much as 31 per cent after banks priced the shares at 390p each in the \u00a31.5bn IPO, which has been dubbed the worst in the history of the London market.\n\n\nThe \u00a375m worth of purchases by Goldman Sachs, when used in combination with the \u201coverallotment\u201d reserved for stabilising the IPO, mean the bank should have booked a profit from Deliveroo\u2019s declining share price.\n\n\nThis is because brokers sell more stock than their allotments at the issue price and then cover their orders either by exercising the overallotment option or, if the shares fall, by buying in the market at below the flotation price. The difference between the 390p issue price and whatever Goldman Sachs paid in the market equates to the profit booked on the trade.\n\n\nBut these profits will be surrendered to Deliveroo, as part of an agreement between the two companies which was not disclosed in the company\u2019s IPO prospectus, people with direct knowledge of the matter added.\n\n\nGoldman Sachs and Deliveroo declined to comment.\n\n\nSo far, Goldman Sachs has used roughly half of the overallotment designated to stabilise the price of Deliveroo\u2019s shares in the event they fell after listing, said one person with knowledge of the deal.\n\n\nDeliveroo shares closed at 280p on Tuesday, giving the company a market value of \u00a35.1bn, down from the \u00a37.6bn valuation its IPO was priced at.\"", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Lol so GS books a profit on the declining price and shares that profit with Deliveroo.
