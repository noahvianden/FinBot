You can use it to see who\u2019s a fellow member of WSB and who\u2019s actually making money.", "selftext": "[Here\u2019s](https://www.reddit.com/r/investmentdata/comments/kj69oo/track_trading_by_us_senators/) the dashboard tracking trading by U.S. Senators.\n\n[Senate Stock trading vs. S&P 500](https://preview.redd.it/4tqxbg3gxkr61.png?width=1960&format=png&auto=webp&s=da597db3d306e5abf848080cec1726e6bce09730)\n\nA while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I\u2019ll copy that below:\n\n**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**\n\nComstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.\n\nShe bought \\~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.\n\n**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***\n\nLowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.\n\n**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***\n\nThe Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.\n\n**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***\n\nPat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.\n\nInsider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.\n\nWSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.\n\n**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***\n\nMarshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.\n\nWhat Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.\n\n**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***\n\nThe story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.\n\nAlthough he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.\n\nSadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.\n\nAfter holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.", "id": "mlfhvd", "created_utc": 1617726231.0, "score": 2959, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "Me before reading this: \"representatives should not be allowed to own individual stocks as a measure to protect their constituents from potential corruption.\"\n\nMe after reading Sheldon Whitehouses' track record: \"representatives should not be allowed to own individual stocks for their own safety.\"", "score": 939, "replies": [{"body": "He liked the stock.

I'm laughing irl because today was the FIRST day I started playing both sides of TSLA with calls and puts AND I hit the vape. \n\nThe entire trading day was literally slo mo for me because I was faded as fuck.\n\nTo give insight: I honestly can't tell IF I am truly retarded or that I'm used to how TSLA moves because of an entire year of rollercoaster trading it...\n\nI did have a hiatus/trading break for a few months because I got the covid and other responsibilities kept me from actively trading/observing the market.\n\nI came back March 5th after TSLA dropped bigly. After seeing March 8th dip to $560~ and buying in, I saw the resistance levels at $690, $700, $710 (Tradingview charts will show it but it's quite obvious even by observation) \n\nEverytime TSLA made a move for $690/700/710, it would immediately get crushed down to lower support levels $680, $660, even $600 before bouncing back up. These were observations throughout March.\n\nEVERY trading day is different and the overall market conditions / news also needs to be taken into account.\n\nBut to keep it short/simple- I.. believe it or not browse wsb/stocktwits like a true autist to gauge other retard's sentiments. \n\nNews: They smashed deliveries/productions numbers and it was \"unexpected\" for everyone, bulls and bears, retards and analysts. Regardless, this is a little catalyst to get this little retard train chugging ALONG with SPY highs, QQQs rallying, April bullish month, run up to ERs. \n\nAll of these factors are BULLISH for TSLA. Fuck what people say about PEs and valuations and all that nonsense. Literally doesn't matter here- the argument of comparing TSLA with other car companies is invalid. If you're a TSLA trader you have to understand TSLA GOES UP, but it also goes down just as fast. It's heavily shorted, a fuck ton of degens play TSLA options which attributes to the volatility, short squeezes and gamma squeezes.\n\n\nMax pain: This stock is HEAVILY controlled by MMs to make as much money burning weeklies calls/puts. I've seen TSLA close BELOW $700, 2 weeks in a row just to fuck over all the call volumes.\n\nGoogle says:\nThe Maximum Pain theory states that an option's price will gravitate towards a max pain price, in some cases equal to the strike price for an option, that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless.\n\nMax pain theory: http://maximum-pain.com/options/TSLA\n\nFor example today:\n\nI would buy $690 puts whenever TSLA is around $695-700. I accumulated puts for the lowest price possible in 5-10 contract increments. I anticipated TSLA is gonna flush/sell off towards end of day along with SPY/QQQs. At that point I would close my puts and pick up cheap $700 weeklies to anticipate a gap up the next day.\n\nBut throughout the day, on every dip to support $680, 685, I load up on $700 calls- and unload when it gets close to $695-700, aiming for 10-15%. I'm not holding in hopes of a big runner. If it runs, and I miss out, oh well. If I do chase, I chase small. Either way I just commit to it- by the time I hesitate, the trades over and I'm bagholding or FOMOing\n\nHope that helps- been a long day so my thoughts are scattered a bit lol", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "You are TSLA options day trader.\nCongrats, and fuck you.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Do you set stop losses, how much do you allow yourself to lose?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No stop losses.

{"title": "MYOV: Deep Value and Possible Buy Out", "selftext": "Okay smooth brains, gonna come at you with some DD on a true value play (for those of you that can read). With a great entry as of writing.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n1 great drug, 3 potential use cases.\nThe basics of any biotech pharma company are the drugs and what they do. Simply put, relugolix (orgovyx) was approved by the FDA in December for the treatment of Prostate Cancer. The drug was so much better than its competition, they were granted priority review by the FDA. How much better were they? Well the competition was a once a month shot that had a high mortality rate due to cardiovascular issues. Since this approval, they have signed a 4.3b deal with pfizer for half the drug, and are now commercializing this together at a rapid pace.\n\nThe other use cases are endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids have a pdufa (fda approval deadline) of June 1st and after meeting and exceeding all 3 phases of clinicals, are highly likely to pass (these are big positive catalysts).\n\nThis is also accompanied by 2 additional publications in the New England medical journal. One of the most renowned journals in the world.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the basics in Lehman\u2019s terms, let\u2019s move on to the strategic outlay.\n\n\nIn january of 2021, Pfizer and Myovant announced a strategic partnership for men\u2019s prostate cancer worth up to 4.3b for myovant. It also resulted in heavy upfront cash payments, and royalties in the double digits to myovant moving forward. After this announcement, the stock shot up to $31 a share.\n\nBefore this, another pharma giant, sumitomo, decided it was going to expand its pharmaceuticals pipeline. To do so it started an American subsidiary named sumitovant and purchased Roivants share of 5 different companies. To date, 4/5 of the companies are now private with urovant recently getting bought out by sumitovant at 100% premium. \n\nMyovant is the crown jewel of the vants. If you go to sumitovants website, they claim ownership over myovant already (53.5% makes them a majority holder).\n\nIt\u2019s my theory that myovant is not far behind and will likely be purchased before June 1st PDUFA. At this time, the stock has been seeing a pretty large short interest increase and is trading below the PPS it had in November before approval for relugolix and before the Pfizer deal. \n\nWithout a buyout, this is a steal of a value play.\n\nMyovant has roughly 40% of their market cap in cash. Pfizer valued just the prostate cancer application at 8.4b. Their current market cap is ~1.8b and they are trading at $18.93 a share.\n\nI plan to ride this rocket to Valhalla \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \n\nTLDR:\nCompany has successful drug applications that are new standards of care, a massive deal with Pfizer, wildly undervalued, and a potential buyout candidate. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 Positions: ~20k shares, 326 calls dated from 4/16 all the way to 1/22\n\nQuick about me: I\u2019ve been on WSB (mostly lurking) since mid 2020 and trading for years. My past plays include riding Tesla from $100 presplit, sunrun from $6, and of course GME from $10 all the way up to $400. \n\n\nNone of this is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

Lynn was phenomenal and personally I think she was ousted because sumitomo was upset about the Pfizer deal, or because the deal involved pfizer getting half the rights and sumi getting to buy the company. This works because Pfizer had a right of first refusal to purchase as part of their seed funding agreement with myovant.\nUltimately my main concern is that 3 of the board members are sumitovant plants, and that they might try to buy the company for less than its worth.\nFurthering concerns, the stock is heavily manipulated due to its low volume. It\u2019s very easy to walk the price down using algos. \nIt also has a high short interest, which will cause a squeeze in the case of a buyout and could possibly send the PPS over the buyout offer. \n\nAt the end of the day, I appreciate the advice, but I\u2019m probably not going to change.

Volumes were around a third of what Deliveroo\u2019s advisers had anticipated.\n\n\nShares in Deliveroo tumbled as much as 31 per cent after banks priced the shares at 390p each in the \u00a31.5bn IPO, which has been dubbed the worst in the history of the London market.\n\n\nThe \u00a375m worth of purchases by Goldman Sachs, when used in combination with the \u201coverallotment\u201d reserved for stabilising the IPO, mean the bank should have booked a profit from Deliveroo\u2019s declining share price.\n\n\nThis is because brokers sell more stock than their allotments at the issue price and then cover their orders either by exercising the overallotment option or, if the shares fall, by buying in the market at below the flotation price. The difference between the 390p issue price and whatever Goldman Sachs paid in the market equates to the profit booked on the trade.\n\n\nBut these profits will be surrendered to Deliveroo, as part of an agreement between the two companies which was not disclosed in the company\u2019s IPO prospectus, people with direct knowledge of the matter added.\n\n\nGoldman Sachs and Deliveroo declined to comment.\n\n\nSo far, Goldman Sachs has used roughly half of the overallotment designated to stabilise the price of Deliveroo\u2019s shares in the event they fell after listing, said one person with knowledge of the deal.\n\n\nDeliveroo shares closed at 280p on Tuesday, giving the company a market value of \u00a35.1bn, down from the \u00a37.6bn valuation its IPO was priced at.\"", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Lol so GS books a profit on the declining price and shares that profit with Deliveroo.

So, you be buying under $10, and if we have aQQQ drop of 40% more you could 10X's your money. At beginning of COVID with 23% drop in QQQ, it went from 87 to 157 90%+ in a month.

The decay happens because it inversely tracks TQQQ's daily return. So if the overall market goes even slightly up for awhile, SQQQ will fall during that time. If the market suddenly drops 3% it would cause SQQQ to go up 9%. But let's say you bought at 10 thinking a crash was imminent, but the market went up for awhile after, bringing SQQQ down to 9. When you finally get that 9% pop, it only brings you up to 9.81, still below where you started. You might be able to imagine how this might play out the longer you have to hold SQQQ waiting for a crash. You can even look at a long term chart of SQQQ and see how a lot of the big peaks are still below where the price was just a few months before that.\n\nIf you can accurately time a crash, then I'd argue that UVXY calls would be the most profitable, but then you also have to know when to get out of the trade too.

This also explains the capping at $700 (options writers), and the walk-down to $690 at the end of the day - a 30k increase in put options is unusual too, but the 60k call contracts added - at substantial expense.\n\nOther notes:\n\n- Most of the increase in open interest is in the $700-$800 range - should $700 break on a bullish move, the delta hedging effect could be substantial.\n- Likewise, on the bearish side, most of the new puts purchased were in the $600-$700 range - close to the money - increasing expense & the delta hedging effects as well.\n- There's a 2:1 bullish bias in newly added contracts, and overall bias is now bullish by 50k more call contracts than put contracts.\n- Key clusters are around $700, $750 and $800 - these should define options flow related lines of resistance in the spot price.\n- Looking out one more week, there's a huge cluster of ~100,000 put contracts expiring on 04/16 (next week) in the $600-$800 range, which were all in the money recently, when TSLA dipped below $600.\n- This cluster's average strike is $710, so just a little more than a week ago it had a value of ~$100 intrinsic and ~$30 extrinsic - representing a **~1.3 billion dollars short position**. During the dip to $550 this short position likely had a value of around ~3 billion dollars.\n- A possibly large entity consciously built that short position and decided to keep it open over the Q1 deliveries report - expecting it to be a miss or a 'meh' report - not a \"hit it out of the ballpark\" home-run.\n- There's a chance that the recent concentration of FUD and yesterday's capping and fight about $700 was by large hedge funds trying to salvage the value of this enormous short position. Should $700 break decisively, the value of the short position drops below $100m - a staggering trading loss.\n- Even more curiously, yesterday the owners of the in-the-money $700+ portion of these put clusters **increased** their short bet, from 51.2k contracts to 52.6k contracts. I.e. they didn't take profits, even increased exposure - in a hope to recover the value of those puts.\n\nI.e. I think, should current price levels hold, the 4/16 put position might be the single biggest TSLA shorting loss via options I've seen in a single event. It's enormous - and entirely hidden from the short interest report due to a temporary artifact in delta-hedging behavior of large options market makers.\n\nI.e. this could be a huge shorting loss not present in the shorting losses estimates of S3 Partners, frequently cited by the business media.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "BTW., I think most of the 04/16 puts are probably hopeless, unless they can score some genuinely negative Tesla news.\n\nThe Q1 earnings report is going to be remarkable, and I'd expect a rise into it from bullish investors, and from a de-risking from sane shorts who don't want to hold a short position across a Tesla financial report that might break several records.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Remindme! 10 days", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 10 days on [**2021-04-16 13:18:04 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-04-16%2013:18:04%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/ml40wg/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_06_2021/gtke8h3/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fteslainvestorsclub%2Fcomments%2Fml40wg%2Ftsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_06_2021%2Fgtke8h3%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-04-16%2013%3A18%3A04%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20ml40wg)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0759839415550232}], "tickers": ["de", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "> The increase in options positions during yesterday's trading is remarkable:\n\nI sold ten of those Puts.

{"title": "Tried to post ASO DD this weekend but it got autofiltered. So, here it is if you are still interested!", "selftext": "By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&nbsp;\n\n\n>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator (to me). \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain.\n \n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: Guess I'll update this since this post was written on Saturday. Looks like initial predictions were right. The stock has gone up. Calls are printing. Still think that the steady gains could attract enough volume that it could trigger a spike. Gamma or short squeeze, take your pick. We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps \"gapping up\", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4/6. Maybe a way to depress the price further. Looks like this stock is another battleground between shorts and bulls with massive balls with kangaroos just dancing around enjoying their bouncing.\n\n \n&nbsp;\n\nEdit #2: What a dip! Guess the large volume of puts purchased this morning had the intended effect. Why else would you buy so many already ITM puts? Volume doesn't explain the dip, so I'm guessing that it was the puts.

So its very convenient to go to a store instead of ordering online, and it seems alot of people like to touch and feel the outdoors stuff before buying it", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that being able to touch and feel the products is important, but I think an omni-channel approach is something that complements that.  If all you have is the brick and mortar store, then when you go in, what you see is what you've got.  But with online and physical catalogs that let you browse their full range of offerings, you can find products they offer that might not have been in stock for you to see if you had just dropped in randomly.  And an online storefront lets you know what is in stock in what stores, so if there's something in particular you are interested in seeing in person, you don't waste a trip down to one of their stores to get a feel for the product only to find out it's not in stock.  And after you've visited and done your groping of their product lineup, you don't have to make a decision right then and there, you can go home, think it over, make comparisons with other products, and order something for pickup the next day.\n\nThis isn't the sort of thing you can create overnight-- it takes web development, robust inventory management, and a level of marketing knowhow that takes time to build.  But I think the companies that pull it off will be gaining market share as time goes on-- they'll be able to support leaner supply chains, target and retain customers better, collect data and use it to predict trends better.\n\nWith that said, if ASO's lackluster omni-channel effort were the only thing I was worried about, I'd still be fine with the stock.  Because the companies that are taking that approach are more expensive.  Dick's (DKS) is a good example, it's doing well with this stuff.  But it's got a forward-PE ratio of 15.  ASO has a forward-PE ratio of 10.  If I bought Dicks, I'd be paying 50% more per dollar of earnings.  Dick's would *have* to gain market share to justify that price.\n\nBut it's not just their weakness online, it's the debt and the downside risk of a trade war.  Dick's has a debt-equity ratio of 0.18.  ASO has a ratio of 1.45.  Not only do I think Dick's product line is better insulated against tariffs (though how much is debatable), it's balance sheet is good enough that it would survive a trade war.  I don't think ASO would survive a trade war, not as leveraged as they are.\n\nAnd if I didn't care about omni-channel, I still wouldn't go with ASO.

The ommnichannel strategy is literally one of the biggest focuses for management right now and it has been a key driver to their success during COVID.\n\nAll things considered, idk wtf you\u2019re talking about.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Also, re: their debt, have you read through their Q4 report?\n\nFirst off, they didn't pay off 50% of their debt-- not even remotely close.  Out of their $4b in liabilities they paid off 660m.  Basically none of it was paying down debt-- most of it was just them paying off suppliers who had floated them goods for the upcoming holiday season.  And almost all of that came straight out of their cash reserves.  They had 870m cash in hand now they've got 150m.\n\nSecond, have you read the 2020 term loan facility?  It's not a full on variable rate loan like the 2015 facility was, but it's very close-- they have the choice of paying either LIBOR+5 (with a minimum of 0.75 for the LIBOR) OR the *highest* of 1) Fed Funds Rate + 0.5, Credit Suisse's \"prime rate,\" or the one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus a margin of 4%.  So they're only guaranteed a fixed minimum rate if LIBOR stays under 0.75.\n\nThird-- and this is the real kick in the pants-- they're reducing their hedge against a rise in the interest rate.  Per their Q4 report:\n\n> We use interest rate swap agreements to hedge market risk relating to possible adverse changes in interest rates.\nAll interest rate swaps had been designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments on borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Facility. On October 28, 2020, we determined that a portion of the underlying cash flows related to $100.0 million of swap notional principal amount was no longer probable of occurring over the remaining term of the interest rate swaps as a result of the Company's planned refinancing transactions (see Note 15). As a result, we reclassified approximately $1.3 million of losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCI\") to other (income) expense, net in our statements of income for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2020 related to the portion of the forecasted transaction no longer considered probable of occurring. We also de-designated a portion of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges, leaving $250 million notional principal amount designated and $650 million undesignated. The remaining $4.0 million loss in AOCI as of October 31, 2020 related to the de-designated hedges will be amortized as an increase to interest expense over the original maturity of the de-designated swaps. The de-designated $650 million notional principal amount of fixed interest rate swaps will receive mark-to-market treatment prospectively, with changes in fair value recorded immediately to other (income) expense, net on the statements of income.\n\nYou see what they're saying?  \"We had a hedge against rate increases with a notional value of $1b, but we decided we didn't need it any more.  We're keeping $250m of that as a hedge, but we've freed up the other $750m, and this quarter we sold $100m of that $750m.  Any money we make or lose with these undesignated swaps we're going to call income.\"\n\nBut the 2020 loan facility offers an alternative fixed minimum rate only if LIBOR stays below 0.75.  If it goes above 0.75 then the rates become just as variable as the 2015 loan facility.  It's like if they had 100 lifeboats on their ship and they've just sold 10 of them and put another 65 up for sale.  But as soon as LIBOR goes above 0.75, the seas will become just as choppy as when they had 100 lifeboats.\n\nA LIBOR over 0.75 isn't a crazy thought, you roll the clock back just 1 year and LIBOR was over 0.75.  This is a risky strategy for a company that's reporting $4.3b of assets against $3.3b of liabilities, especially when $862m of their assets is goodwill and another $1.72b is other intangibles.\n\nEDIT:  Fixed some grammar.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Wow you clearly have no idea what you\u2019re talking about nor do you know how to interpret financial statements.\n\nPer their Q4 earnings release, they had total liabilities of $3.2B at the end of the most recent fiscal year.

{"title": "BlackBerry: How the Patent Sale could transform BB", "selftext": "On March 30, BlackBerry has reported Q4 and FY21 results/call AH. At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.\n\nThis is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \n\n^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)\n\n**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**\n\nQuick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.\n\nThe points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?\n\n***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that \"big number\" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).\n\nAssuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.\n\nWith a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).\n\n***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*\n\nThe main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.\n\n***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). \n\nSpeculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren\u2019t disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.\n\nThat said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.\n\n***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.\n\n**The Transformation**\n\nBy now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).\n\nIf and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.\n\nIn terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*\n\nHe later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*\n\n***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.\n\n*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*\n\nThe goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.\n\nSimilarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).\n\nOne quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\nIf the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.\n\n*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security.

John Wall spoke at CITI and JPM Conferences in January and on April 1st on a conference call entitled *'How U.S. and Chineses corporations collaborate in growing autonomous vehicles*'. Here are some choice quotes (or paraphrases) he made during these:\n\n* *'The response from automanufacturers has been \"overwhelming\"'.*\n* *'These are sitting on a \"goldmine of data\" '.*\n* *\"We are seeing that the use cases are unending\".*\n* *\"Your imagination is the limit\".*\n\nJohn Wall is not a spinmaster and seems low key. He also underlined there's been lots of dialogue / exchanges with these (so he's not dreaming). \n\nOn **Valuation** \\- Yes there are quite a few known names that are used as comparables and many are valued at 10x BB even though they have similar or less revenue. The most often cited is solid but not ten times as solid and longer term not nearly as interesting, nor with potential of BB. Here is one interesting metric we can thank Bill Gates for. Almost to the day 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. The average FB user, it seems, spends about 35 minutes per day on FB. For a 1.6% stake Bill Gates's MS invested $240 million into FB valuing FB at $15 billion (3 times the value of BB today). This also valued FB at $300 per user. QNX has a user base of over 175 million and growing at about 25 million per year. The average driver is in their car 90 mintes per day. If we ignored all of BB's current business or their potential, and looked only at IVY, BB is valued at close to $25 per user. John Wall previously calrified that IVY will work on the existing installed base of QNX. So much potential yet one does not pay for it at these levels.

BB has stated that revenue from QNX is in range of '*high single digits to low double*' (pressumably $8-$12 range). And it's a one time. To focus on that is missing the point. It is ALL about the installed base.\n\nThe insatlled base is 175 million plus (considering it's been growing at approximately 25 million annually and we have not had an updated number in about a year, it is likely safe to assume the installed base is in the vicinity of 200 million).\n\nNote the language in the press release and this excerpt -\n\n\"*Volvo Group wanted to take a new approach to software. It wanted to find a single supplier for the operating system (OS) and hypervisor to meet the needs of the \u2018whole truck\u2019, capable of supporting safety certification to the highest levels.*\n\n*Following an in-depth proof of concept, Volvo Group decided to build its \u2018Volvo Dynamic Software Platform\u2019 (VDSP) on the* [*QNX\u00ae OS for Safety*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-os-for-safety) *and the* [*QNX\u00ae Hypervisor for Safety*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-os-for-safety)*, both* [*certified to ISO 26262:2018 ASIL D*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications)*.*\n\n*The engagement includes a new flexible use of the QNX OS and Hypervisor for the whole vehicle, which gives developers and architects the freedom to design the best possible system as the company looks at the requirements of the next 15 years, including the future support of autonomous driving and electrification.\"*\n\nThis is very much the language Blackberry uses when discussing IVY and its appeal to OEMs and automanufacturers.\n\nIt is unlikely that a less than serious conversation has already taken place with Scania and Volvo and many others about IVY, it's appeal, and use benifits (keep in mind John Wall stated the \"*use cases are unending*\" and the response has been \"*overwhelming*\").\n\nOnce one gets their heads around an installed base and recurring fees from that base, only then can one appreciate the kind of upside that awaits. Too many are just not seeing it. As you state \"IVY is not priced in at all\". In fact you get all this and a whole other package of business at a massive discount to other known names.\n\nHere is another metric that applies to installed bases.\n\n**NFLX** has an installed base of 200 million users worlwide (sort of the same as BB). Of course the business is different but the revenue model maybe not so different to IVY. The average NFLX user coughs over $150 US per annum. Could IVY extract $150 US per annum from its installed base ? How about $100 US or even $5O US ? I would suggest any of these numbers is more than realistic, in particular if we consider what consumers pay for cell phone service, or ISP, or cable TV, etc. The point is there will be some number and any number will be significant to IVY.\n\nAnyone can disagree but this is precisely what BB and AWS have in mind (even ultra conservative Chen mentioned '*recurring revenue*s').\n\nNFLX has a market cap of $250 billion or 50X BB's $5 billion. And this ignores anything else BB is doing.\n\nPaying 10% of what the comps trade at for this kind of upside is crazy rare but I guess many just don't see it yet (including most analysts who continue to miss the boat with their cautious sitting on the fence outlooks).\n\nIs it  possible that Watsa (with $1 billion on the line and an average share price cost of about $14 USD), or Chen (who is already very wealthy and came out of retirement and allocated so far 7 years of his life to this), or the people at AWS (who have already been involved with IVY for two years) don't have this in mind and haven't been executing in that direction ?\n\nExponential upside is putting it mildly.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "With his strong ties to business in China he was the guy to do this job.
