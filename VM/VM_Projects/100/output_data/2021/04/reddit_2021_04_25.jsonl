OP says:  \n\n\n>Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.\n\nWhich already sounds confusing. How can you have stock exchange without stocks? Since OP didn't add sources, what he means by this is speculation. In the early 14th century, Bruges was a center of trade in Europe. People would trade in the city square and stuff. In 1285 the *Ter Beurse Inn* was established. An inn run by the prominent Van der Beurse family that housed foreign merchants. The square where the inn was located was where a lot of trading was done. This is where the word beurs (bourse) comes from. The inn, square, trading together make an argument for being the first exchange, with the inn later becoming a place where solely trading was done. [More on all this here.](https://thetchblog.com/2020/09/07/the-original-bourse-at-bruges/) \n\n[Trade then shifted to Antwerp, where in 1531 the first purpose-built commodities exchange building was established.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourse_of_Antwerp) So that's a Belgian contender, I suppose. \n\nThe first place where *stocks* were exchanged is [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronext_Amsterdam). In 1602. By [the Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company). You know, the company that was established in 1602 and is mentioned by OP in his second point:  \n\n\n>The East India Company is widely recognized as the world\u2019s first publicly traded company  \n\nAnd then there's many more interesting contenders for world first exchanges. Ultimately it doesn't really matter which was first. It's all fascinating history worth a read. Oh, also:\n\nThe top 10 list from OP doesn't make sense to me. I was surprised the LSE had a bigger market cap than the Euronext, but even more so bigger than the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. Looking around I can't find any data supporting the list. I also notice OP listed a whole bunch of exchanges, and uses the [Stock Exchange Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange_Group) for the London one, which is more than just the LSE. [Most top 10's I can find look like this](https://www.tradinghours.com/markets) or similar. Different order than OP's for sure.\n\nI appreciate the idea of this post. And I realise it's fluff and saturday entertainment. But for a sub that should value research like no other, it's a bit disappointing.

Long awaited and slightly delayed  2 DD on AMD\n\nThis possibly a long read for anybody with an attention span lower than 50 seconds and needless to say it will contain words that you were not taught in 5th grade. You read the following summary if you happen to be a drooling neanderthal  \n \n\nSummary\n\nGreat business, getting better, smashing Intel in coming years, price is low ,gonna surge, buy fucking ape\n\n**Performance and demand**\n\nWe are now on going through a cycle of extreme demand for products that facilitate digitalization, EV\u2019s, pc, datacenters expanding. This has all been accelerated due to the covid cause all you dumb fucks have been watching 4k Pornhub filth from you mums basement, while pausing the newly acquired PS5. Those of you with a job perhaps thought working from home would require a new laptop and what have you.   \n AMD delivers the chips for all this. AMD doesn\u2019t make the shit slow useless chips but the high-end stuff which the market just can\u2019t get enough of. Take look here from last year:  \n\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/r00ra8z42ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=202c74284d233302021728aa85fb4ba74b3f424a)\n\nNotice the gross margin rising a bit whilst revenue is up 45% Y/Y.

Can\u2019t blame them. AMD will in coming quarters buy XLINX and expand their business to other segments in the semi conductor industry so there is plenty of room for further growth on the outlook.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  **Supply and competition**\n\nTSMC is the main foundry supplier for AMD. They have kept prices intact but there are so far rumors that they might hike them soon enough. Last year many of the sites were shut down and capacity hasn\u2019t met the surge we have seen late quarters. The problem is not exclusive for AMD but it\u2019s the same for most of its competitors. They have stated though that they expect to be back on track for 2022. Intel got hammered last week in earnings with losing market share in datacenter segment and margins absolutely murdered. AMD has been trading inverse to Intel basically as the market expects AMD to be one of the main causes to Intel's howler.\n\nHowever let the bears beware of the CEO\u2019s lady Su\u2019s own words live:  \n \"we have enormous demand, demand is very, very strong\" continuing their seeing record growth in multiple areas including PC, gaming and datacenter. Lisa added: \"to answer your question, it's good -- it's very good\"  \n [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/78289/amd-on-the-cpu-and-gpu-chip-shortage-its-very-good/amp.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/78289/amd-on-the-cpu-and-gpu-chip-shortage-its-very-good/amp.html)  \n Now ask yourself if that\u2019s something a smart insanely well performing CEO would say 6 weeks before an earnings report if the shortage was really smashing the business. My cents are on her being right and even a bit conservative on it.\n\n  \n\n**Analysts**\n\nMarket analysts are quite divided on the target ranging between 70 and 135. The best rated one here Hans Mosesmann has a price target of 120. Look at his bull following  here:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sff74g1h2ev61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc0a633c6ae0959148e8859d4b968f54499e4df7\n\n  \n\nAs for my positions I hold a few calls but mostly shares.
