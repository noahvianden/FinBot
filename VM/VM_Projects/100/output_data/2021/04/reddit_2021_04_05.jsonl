I don\u2019t believe customer preferences will change that rapidly. And even when government requires EVs in 2030+ then competition and battery tech will be a level plying field. Also this date is too far ahead to justify the risks and you\u2019re better off in S&P or other companies.\n- FSD software is great but a) take rate is already low ie China (largest market) is low single digits. Will take rate improve as tech improves? Sure but price will also go up so it\u2019ll ner the same. Robotaxis are great (if it becomes a reality) but do you really expect companies to invest $25k car + $20k or more software + infrastructure challenges all to get some small revenue margins on incremental taxi rides? Sure we could all be not owning cars in 2030 but the risks again are too high today\n\nI have my own counter points but these are really interesting bear points to explore.
