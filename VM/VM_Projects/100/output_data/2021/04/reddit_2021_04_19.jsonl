Still, you'll be on a fortune run until then.\n\nBut put it this way - if you invested in dogecoin 5 years ago, you'll have made 200,000% returns. It doesn't take a genius to invest in dogecoin. You don't even need to have most of your portfolio in dogecoin to get 80% a year returns off of dogecoin carrying you. You could've just been a dumb ape who threw $100 into it for fun. And now it's $200,000.\n\nThe \"unknown wizards\" of Wall Street aren't necessarily better or smarter or doing anything different than everyone else. They could just have been more consistently lucky and the way probability works, there's always that one guy in a million who is *consistently* lucky, and that's especially the case now that a single buy and hold investment can have 200,000% returns, so the amount of decisions - and thus the amount of skill required - is much, much less than when you needed to make a thousand separate trades to hit that sort of return.\n\nThe only question is, are you that guy?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "It's one thing to get lucky on one gamble (eg, dogecoin).

Show me a hedge fund that's turned every $10k invested into $1B over the past 20 years (because, that's what 5% per month is).\n\nThese are really basic options strategies that this guy is following, by his own admission.
