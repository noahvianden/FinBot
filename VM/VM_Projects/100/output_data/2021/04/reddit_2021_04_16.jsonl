{"title": "The New Normal - 25% of the S&P 100 companies are >70 RSI signaling \"overbought\"", "selftext": "I typically watch the top 100 companies daily. I find it entertaining more than anything. I have the RSI indicator on my watchlist and 25 of these companies are currently glowing red. Home Depot and Lowes top the list at an RSI over 82.\n\nThe RSI indicator is my favorite tool and I usually rely on it for entering new positions. It isn't perfect but it will give you better odds of timing your entry/exit points correctly when applicable. If you are unfamiliar a RSI value over 70 is usually a sign that a stock is overbought (let it cool for a few days) and a RSI value under 30 is oversold (it probably won't stay here for much longer). Of course companies like TSLA and other momentum stocks break this indicator all the time. When it comes to the big companies though the RSI level is usually more accurate.\n\nIf you listen to or read any stock market advice prior to 2020 you would learn entering a position in a stock at these levels is usually not the best strategy. Yet many people are and new highs continue to get made. Home Depot crossed the RSI 70 mark around the $290/share price 3 weeks ago and sits at $328 today.\n\nWe see new high after new high and savings accounts are bloated across the US with cash. The new entry point is yesterday. As others have noted, anything a trader has learned over the years has been completely changed the last 12 months.\n\nI continue to be cautious and constantly regret not putting more cash into the market a day earlier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For clarity. I am not saying these companies won't go another 20 percent higher before a pullback! Or to an RSI 99! I am just stating it is something I have not seen in a long time. These are not speculative plays they are the largest stocks per market cap that our stock exchange has to offer. It is a very bullish sign obviously. I also see the index funds running at the same level. I am not a bear or a bull I am just trying to not get caught with my pants down! RSI works really well for swing trading but doesn't really matter if you are planning a long term hold. Good luck out there!\n\nEDIT: If you want to know which companies here is the list. These aren't cherry picked they just happen to be in the S&P 100 (largest 100 companies) index $OEX. These are RSI 69.3 and up. The values move throughout the day. It was 25 of them over 70 at the time of the original post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTICKER --- NAME --- SHARE PRICE --- RSI Value\n\nACN\tAccenture Plc          F\t286.63\t69.31095528\n\nAMT\tAmern Tower Corp\t248.56\t69.37330112\n\nBLK\tBlackrock Inc\t810.35\t69.6989941\n\nUPS\tUnited Parcel Srvc Cl B\t179.51\t69.90349866\n\nMSFT\tMicrosoft Corp\t260.48\t69.97840519\n\nGOOGL\tAlphabet Inc Class A\t2279.265\t70.16983523\n\nNVDA\tNvidia Corp\t639.7401\t70.3677927\n\nMDT\tMedtronic Plc          F\t125.44\t70.59726396\n\nALL\tAllstate Corp\t122.04\t70.47226611\n\nWFC\tWells Fargo & Co\t43.535\t70.6544173\n\nNEE\tNextera Energy Inc\t81.21\t70.71177907\n\nGOOG\tAlphabet Inc Class C\t2294\t71.17607361\n\nUNH\tUnitedhealth Grp Inc\t388.82\t71.55161476\n\nCOST\tCostco Wholesale Co\t372.42\t71.63217977\n\nTGT\tTarget Corp\t208.54\t72.83200563\n\nSBUX\tStarbucks Corp\t117.615\t73.02642901\n\nADBE\tAdobe Inc\t522.73\t73.29936593\n\nBRK/B\tBerkshire Hathaway\t271.97\t73.78546388\n\nSO\tSouthern Co\t64.88\t74.75283354\n\nHON\tHoneywell Intl Inc\t230.57\t75.63350296\n\nEXC\tExelon Corp\t46.03\t77.6415172\n\nPFE\tPfizer Inc\t38.585\t78.0424713\n\nDUK\tDuke Energy Corp\t100.72\t78.63564751\n\nORCL\tOracle Corp\t78.77\t79.62182981\n\nLMT\tLockheed Martin Corp\t391.41\t79.8498989\n\nLOW\tLowes Cos Inc\t207.15\t81.33604962\n\nHD\tHome Depot Inc\t326.16\t81.59148035", "id": "ms4niw", "created_utc": 1618584286.0, "score": 257, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": ">and constantly regret not putting more cash into the market a day earlier. \n\nHmmm really makes you thonk", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Yes this is true but a solid 10 percent pullback erases a month or more of gains and gives a great entry point.

So big hedge funds like Melvin Capital can hope to multiply their wealth by shorting a dying firm into the ground, yeah?  But the people who are just trying to make ends meet working at a company like Gamestop or similar from 9-5 have no hope of ever participating in that kind of play.  And in fact they often see their very livelihood threatened by these hedge funds and other financial entities.\n\nTake the case of 2008 for example.  Wall Street banks can profit off of unethical practices, normal people can't.  And when the music stops, not only do the Wall Street firms get bailed out, they also take down the whole Main Street economy with them.  \n\nPeople are tired of Wall Street and the wealthy always having the upper hand.  They almost always win, and most of the time they win big.  When they don't win, they can't lose, because the government's there to bail them out.\n\nMy degree is in economics.  I know the bailout was necessary to save the economy.  But it doesn't change the fact that the common people are fed up with this dynamic.

Robinhood cut off the trading.  But still, it was a major breakthrough.  Average Joes showed that via social media the odds have been evened a bit.  Now it's not just hedge funds and mega financial entities that can win at these big plays... retailers have a shot, too.\n\nSome people look at it is \"bringing the Hedgies down\", \"death to the 1%\", etc.  I'm not necessarily part of that crowd.  But no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, if you're a retail investor, just an Average Joe, you can be proud of what happened with GME.  It was a victory for us.  It meant a leveling of the playing field, if only ever so slightly.\n\nI for one am happy that I profited on the long end of things.  I really believed in what I was doing, thus why I bought in on the way up the first time, and continued holding.  I had never invested in stocks before.  But I soon realized that the moment had passed, and that losing money wasn't much of a way to make a statement.  So on the way up the second time I cashed out and made small profits.\n\nIf you wanna short it, that's fine.  Like I said, you're not making much of a statement by losing money.  I for one wouldn't want to short it.  I really believed in that movement, no matter how small or insignificant my contribution was.  It may not have mattered in the grand scheme of things, but it mattered to *me*.\n\nBut still.  You wanna short it?  That's fine.  But the part about it \"making you sick\".

Let's see if we can't get you some of that money back, and enjoy some really bad CGI in the process instead.  This week, let's examine a company which, inexplicably, came out with a robot that can perform surgery 20 years before someone figured out how to automate the cashier at McDonald's (how's that for a checkmark for simulation theory?).  This week's examination is Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What do they do?  Well, the TL:DR is they help ensure that you have to wait longer before you can collect the inheritance and life insurance on your Boomer ass parents, because it helps keep them alive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey're really more of a product than a company. (yeah, I know about the EndoWrist shit, but that's hardly a revenue generator)  They make the Da  Vinci robot surgeon that you see in hospitals so long as you live in a nicer, more gentrified part of town.  Or work for one of the Colombian drug cartels - those dudes have the best medics.  If you've never heard of it, it's basically a Swiss army knife of attachments that will cut your ass open, fix what it can (sorry, that extra chromosome has to stay), and stitch you back up, all while your surgeon deals with his raging hangover and wonders what happened after he blacked out to where his ass is really sore this morning and the security guard out in the parking lot can't stop smiling at him.  That's it.  That's all they do.  Blah blah blah proprietary software blah blah blah expensive maintenance contracts blah blah blah each attachment for the robot costs money so hopefully your hospital sprang for the clip applier attachment before they snipped that pulmonary vein.  Fingers crossed.\n\nAlso, it apparently makes pancakes. :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cause that's not creepy at all](https://preview.redd.it/kssh7h1mnht61.jpg?width=993&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c30426e1dd5fba779b9efdc7c524868f364120f2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich goes to show how outdated the tech has become, since everybody knows ebelskivers are superior.\n\n# Deep dive:  This won't hurt a bit, except for the parts where it's excruciatingly bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$ISRG is a 95 billion dollar company that sells about 1200 ~~Treadwell Droids~~  surgical robots a year at 2 million dollars a pop, and has come up with a great scam where some of the attachments are disposable so you have to keep buying them.  God bless America.  They make about a billion a year licensing out their software for use to mitigate the fact that your doctor can't remember which cord goes into which hole, and another 700 million or so on maintenance contracts to reboot the things when they accidentally kill somebody.   They make about 4 billion dollars annually, give or take.  For a company that lives and dies by its R&D, it surprisingly has no debt on the books.  It just makes more shares when they need money.   This also might have something to do with the fact that they haven't really improved on the thing in 20 years because nobody is forcing them to innovate.   They're trading near their ATH, at 804.72 as of the time of this writing.   The biggest fundamental thing to note about this company is that they basically have no competitors.  There is a company out there called (name redacted because of automoddy)  that made a run at the king, but fell so short that they changed their name from (name redacted because of automoddy) Surgical.  It's not that their robot - the Senhance - was bad, per se, it was just that it turned out it was only good for laparoscopics, which is fairly niche.  For the record, I like that company, but we can't talk about them here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing I've always hated about this company but have held my nose and overlooked was that it's PB ratio is way out of whack for its space.  The average company in the medical equipment industry averages about 5.1 PB.  $ISRG sits at 9.7.  Their PEG also sits at 6.5, which is fucking crazy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Cool.  So how much growth for buying in to the fucking robot army?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually....none.  They made 2.64 a share a year ago, but the whispers on the street - and by street, I mean company executives - are to expect a down quarter this time around due to a combination of less hospital revenue as a result of leaving so much open bed space for the spicy flu and lower demand for elective surgical procedures - and, of course, by lower demand, I mean people being told they can't have them because there's a risk of catching a bug that you'll probably never even know you caught.  $ISRG had been rising recently on the ASSUMPTION that hospitals were going to open back up to more high margin things like elective procedures and away from things like \"leaving half the hospital empty in case 3 people catch the 'Rona\".  However, through the 1st quarter of the year, that has not happened, which means the backlog of surgical procedures just continues to grow.  Ambulatory surgery centers throughout a good chunk of the country still haven't converted away from triage facilities yet or are closing down surgical theatres periodically to reallocate staff, and there's no real word on when that is going to get rectified.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnalysts have already been adjusting their expectations for the quarter downwards in the last month.  Expectations are now a 4% drop in earnings on flat-to-slightly-up overall revenues.  $ISRG has a habit of beating on earnings pretty much always, but they've reached such a lofty valuation that swapping out Tyson Fury for a Tyson chicken and then bragging you kicked its ass probably isn't going to be that impressive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Wait...so why should I buy it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cge9cbc1qjt61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f03e91b88baedbe72bfbee8b1e3ddc6fcc9a8ec\n\nPlot twist:  This is a SHORT DD.  My first one since the prophetic $PLTR DD that got -700'd on February 5th before I finally deleted it and let those retards lose their asses **(I'm never going to stop saying I told you so, bitches**).  Bet that was harder to see coming than knowing Will Smith was going to become best friends with a toaster an hour before it happened, eh?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nActually, that's not entirely true.  This is a hybrid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Do technical analyses have feelings?  Feelings are just electrical responses, and technical analyses are based on nothing but electrical responses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spme9ho3uht61.jpg?width=1357&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8868eef26f83c316efd6f20e99e1dc195ac328ac\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing to note is that it's tested prices in the $81x's 3 times now (let's call it 810, because that's really where liquidity always starts to dry up), and has been rejected all three times.  And it's sitting pretty damn close to that again.  Also, every time it's tested resistance and failed, it's dropped to at least the mid 700's, usually crossing into the 6's briefly, which presently serves as strong support.  It's presently trading near its ATH's not because of anything it's done, but rather because lately the trend has been to rotate into big growth companies again, forgetting that small and mid cap plays exist.  That's all well and good, but one off quarter and you're no longer contributing to the artificial inflation of the $SPY.  This has been a  reliable quiet swing trader for me, but it's now at a crucial pivot point that's going to require a strong catalyst to continue any upwards momentum.  That's bad news for a company reporting earnings in a time when even Wall Street darlings sell off even on great quarters.  At the very least, this is a rally that is quickly running out of gas, as evidenced by reduced volume.  With them reporting next week on the 20th, the pivot point of reckoning is upon us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My logic is undeniable (or, to summarize):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* For the 2nd time in a row, an S&P 500 company that operates on the fringes of traditional growth\n* Has positively ripped during this rotation from value into growth, in spite of all signals showing a down quarter and poor forward guidance as we are still in a period of Covidic uncertainty and what it means for the operating theatre\n* Has no known competitors, which has not pushed them to expand into other revenue channels besides crazy expensive machines meant to cover up for how few decent doctors are entering the workforce anymore\n* Is trading at a crucial resistance point that has been rejected forcefully 2 times in the past, with reduced volume each time\n* IV on calls is quite pricey, but puts are dirt cheap\n* If you really want dad's house, maybe make sure the ambulance sends him to Watts instead of Malibu.  Remember, if he ends up surviving the procedure, he's going to rat you out to the cops\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Price Targets:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm expecting a miss when they report earnings next week, or at the very least a very muted guidance.  As such, I would not be surprised to see this stonk slip all the way down into the 720-740 range before it regains some footing.  Barring some sort of catalyst, I'm having a hard time seeing how this is going to get over that 820 hump any time in the near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How to play it.  That, detective, is the right question:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the technical signs and oscillators are pointing to it becoming a very top heavy trade, which means it's primed for a much bigger negative breakout on the slightest weakness.    All that said, I certainly wouldn't go bear on it long-term.  $ISRG has never been one of the most violent movers, but it has a way of defying the odds, and has displayed that ability in the face of adversity for decades now.  I think if they miss next week and the stock goes into a freefall, be prepared to be nimble and cash out the put and switch back to long, even if it's not necessarily justified.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# An edit:\n\nIf you don't like the short action because of liquidity (a very valid item if you're interested in more than a handful of contracts), skip that part of it and set an alarm to go long at 725-ish.  You'll be happy with that one, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Position Disclaimers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty sure I own more than a few shares of this in my managed asset portfolios and, even though my short-term outlook is bearish, am also fairly certain my fund managers aren't going to want to create a taxable event with them.  **I am just flat-out short on the stock itself, but my appetite for potentially unlimited risk is different, and I can't say anybody else should do that.**  I'm holding 4/30 780 puts that I picked up for 10-ish bucks, as well as 5/28 $800p's.  I recently sold off my 7/16 795c's for a tidy profit.   Were I less of a pussy, I'd probably buy some 4/23 780p FD's.  Actually, I might do that for fun, anyways.  But remember, I'm gambling on a selloff on weakness.  If those further out puts print, I will cover them within a week or earnings and look for a consolidation pattern (probably a week or two later) to reverse course and buy some calls for another swing up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Word of caution:**  Buying puts on a mega tech in this environment is an inherently risky move because big money has been rotating into it for weeks now.    This is not a bet-the-house scenario.  I have about a 70% conviction this is gonna go my way, but that other 30% is pretty ugly and basically guarantees a complete loss.  And even if you do play this along with me and it prints, don't sit there and try to milk it for too long.  Some hedge fund could decide it's oversold at 735 and eat away at your tendies.  Fuck that guy.  And then go buy one of these, because fucking him is legally perilous and he might fight back - the robot will never say no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgdhjx8bzht61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65a7383f59faead4d0cfaffdd5a2118a63da15c9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll my love\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Chad Dickens", "id": "ms51jy", "created_utc": 1618585420.0, "score": 187, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for sharing. As a robot surgeon myself, maybe I can give back some love by giving my opinion on the matter.\n\nFirst of all, it is surprising how much of this info is quite accurate so you 've certainly done a good job about that, which gives you more credibility IMO. Maybe not the hangover part but still.\n\nSpeaking long term, this company is here to stay. The technology they offer is second to none.  The ease of operating, what we can achieve, it really is world changing. Robotic surgery is already well established and will continue to grow as more and more procedures are bound to be performed robot-assisted and not laparoscopically anymore.\n\nThey have an excellent business model in which instruments are disposable, big maintenance contracts, and a new model every few years (so they did improve, actually, and continue to do so); support for older models is no longer offered at some point so you have to buy the new one.\n\nThey have no competition because they simply buy up any company that is doing anything remotely similar. Some other companies I saw are trying to improve laparoscopy rather than completely reinvent  it, mostly because robotics are quite expensive. They try to take the niche for procedures that are too simple to waste robotic resources on, but still require a lot of laparoscopic skills. However, sorry to offend, but a lot of these alterations look clunky and seem unreliable and unpractical.\n\nThe only reason why not everyone is using the robot already, is exactly this, that Intuitive really takes good advantage of its monopoly position, and so it really is expensive to use it.\n\nI believe that at some point in the future, another company eventually will offer a robotic system that is up to the same quality standards. IMO this can only be a company that is big enough to support their own R&D and not be swallowed by Intuitive. For me, Medtronic is the best bet for this (or maybe some Chinese company). This then would lead to a significant drop in costs for robotic surgery (and probably a big drop in stock price for Intuitive); on the other hand, it would make robotic surgery even more mainstream and as Intuitive is already quite on top, they are likely to be able to withstand the competition and remain a top player in the field, and continue to grow from this in the long term.\n\nIt is true that corona caused a backlog even in this kind of surgery (it has a lot of oncological applications, but even some of those got postponed), also put a hold on congresses, training programs etc. and a tepmorary drop in revenue is certainly possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I share your opinion that the stock will come down from where it is now, but probably only momentarily. I will be hoping with you for a drop in Intuitive stock price, but will use it as an entry point for a long position instead (which in retrospect, I should have done already a long time ago). In the meantime, I am long Medtronic as well.

Apparently they know quite well what the issues are; the guy presenting certainly knows what he is talking about.\n\nFor me, there still appear to be some issues though; only two arms, so you still need extra incisions for auxiliary instruments, the camera looks quite fragile, and the changing of instruments / cleaning of the camera look like they could pose problems in terms of fragility / time consumption. Also VR for the surgeon instead of a classic console, hmm. VR can be quite nausea-inducing, and I say this as a gamer for over 30 years who owns 2 VR systems at home. You don't want to have this on a 3 or 4 hour procedure. But yeah sure, maybe for shorter procedures, this could be a nice in-between between classic laparoscopy and the 'overkill' of a Da Vinci. Still, as a hospital manager, you would have to choose (I don't see a lot of hospitals buying TWO different systems) so I would still prefer the gold standard of the Da Vinci. It depends on the price and budget I suppose.\n\nAlso haven't seen them in the field. I can ask around with my colleagues and while it does look promising, at this point I 'm afraid it is still only that, a promise. This seems to be a bit typcial lately with these SPACS. Personally I 'm not doing it until I hear more about them in practice, but will keep an eye out for it.\n\nEdit: I found a presentation with their timeline, it will be years from now untill it is even applicable for practical use. I don't believe they will be able to make up for the headstart that Intuitive has. So for me it is a no.
