Over-the-air software updates allow owners of select Ford vehicles to  update software from the convenience of their own garage.\n\nFord is targeting to sell more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with  BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate  projections.\n\n**Mother of All Road Trips becomes the ultimate Ford test drive**\n\nAll 10 test vehicles \u2013 one departing from Palo Alto, California, the  others from Dearborn, Michigan \u2013 spent much of last November and  December winding their way across the United States and Canada. Test  drivers searched for every conceivable road condition and highway  driving scenario, monitoring the system\u2019s performance, collecting data  and highlighting areas where improvements could be made.\n\nThe trip marked the final leg of a development process that ran up  more than a half-million miles in a series of shorter test drives, each  designed to evaluate a specific aspect of BlueCruise. As real-world  validation of those earlier tests, road trip enabled the system to scan  for variances in road signage, lane markings, exit ramps, traffic  patterns and weather.\n\n\u201cI drive long-distance quite often, whether out to Boston or down to  Florida to visit family or friends, and usually I mentally tire out on  drives that far,\u201d said Alexandra Taylor, BlueCruise feature development  engineer, who logged more than 3,000 miles in an F-150 on the trek. \u201cThe  one thing that became clear is that, when using BlueCruise, long drives  aren\u2019t nearly as mentally taxing to me.\u201d\n\nTaylor and fellow BlueCruise engineer Shruti Gotadki set out on an  eight-day journey that wound through the southeast United States,  targeting driving differences between Jacksonville, Louisville, Atlanta  and other major urban areas.\n\nBack at the Ford lab, driver-assist technology supervisor Justin  Teems monitored the progress of the entire fleet, corralling important  data that will help shape BlueCruise driving experience in the months  and years ahead.\n\n\u201cIt was like mission control,\u201d Teems said. \u201cWe really wanted to push  BlueCruise to its limits. Every state builds roads a little differently.  When you include factors like lane line degradation, weather and  construction, building a hands-free driving system becomes extremely  complex. Those complexities are why Ford has the best team of engineers  in the world working on it.\u201d\n\n**BlueCruise, the evolution of Ford Co-Pilot360 Technology**\n\nUsing both advanced camera and radar-sensing technologies and  building upon Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, Lane  Centering and Speed Sign Recognition, BlueCruise adds a new level of  convenience for drivers with vehicles equipped with Ford Co-Pilot360  Technology. The feature allows a driver to operate truly hands-free on  prequalified sections of divided highways called Hands-Free Blue Zones. A  driver-facing camera in the instrument cluster monitors eye gaze and  head position to help ensure the driver\u2019s eyes remain on the road.\n\nCurrently, more than 100,000 miles of highways across North America  are dedicated Hands-Free Blue Zones in the Ford GPS mapping system.  BlueCruise uses blue lighting on the digital instrument cluster to  indicate when the vehicle is in a hands-free zone.\n\nIn addition to the full hands-free mode, equipped vehicles will also  feature Lane Centering mode. Lane Centering works on most roads with  lane lines and can help keep the vehicle centered in its lane but  requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. In either  mode, a visual prompt on the instrument cluster notifies drivers when  they need to return their attention to the road or resume control of the  vehicle.\n\nBlueCruise is an SAE Level 2 driver-assist technology, similar to  Tesla Autopilot but with the advantage of offering a true hands-free  driving experience while in Hands-Free Mode that does not require a  driver\u2019s hands to stay in contact with the steering wheel, unless  prompted by vehicle alerts.\n\nAnd unlike other approaches \u2013 such as GM\u2019s Super Cruise, which uses  red and green lighting, or Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, which requires a driver  keep their hands on the steering wheel \u2013 BlueCruise communicates with  drivers in different ways. The instrument cluster transitions to  communicate that the feature is in Hands-Free mode through text and blue  lighting cues, effective even for those with color blindness.\n\n**More highways and features to come**\n\nBeyond the 2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E, additional Ford  vehicles will also receive BlueCruise hands-free driving technology,  while current owners continue to receive over-the-air software updates  to add new features and capabilities in the coming years.\n\nFuture enhancements are planned to include Lane Change Assist that  will let the vehicle change lanes with just a tap of the turn signal  indicator, and Predictive Speed Assist that will adjust vehicle speed  for road curves, roundabouts and more.\n\nFord also plans to offer regular mapping updates for the technology  to recognize changes plus thousands of miles of planned new road  additions.\n\n**Affordable** **hands-free highway driving technology**\n\n2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E customers will be able to purchase  BlueCruise software \u2013 including a three-year service period \u2013 for $600  in the second half of 2021, when it\u2019s ready to launch. Hardware pricing  varies by vehicle.\n\nFor F-150, BlueCruise is available as a part of the Ford Co-Pilot 360  Active 2.0 package for a total of $1,595 \u2013 $600 for the software and  $995 for the hardware. The Ford Co-Pilot 360 Active 2.0 package is  standard on F-150 Limited and available as an option on Lariat, King  Ranch and Platinum models.\n\nFor Mustang Mach-E, BlueCruise comes standard on CA Route 1, Premium  and First Edition variants. It\u2019s an available package on the Select trim  for $3,200 \u2013 $ 600 for the software and $2,600 for the rest of the  package \u2013 as part of the larger Comfort and Technology package, which  includes features such as a 360-degree camera, heated front seats and  heated steering wheel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsource: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/04/14/ford-mother-of-all-road-trips-bluecruise-hands-free-driving.html", "id": "mqpreu", "created_utc": 1618404200.0, "score": 129, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 170, "comments": [{"body": "At this point, I think basically every car manufacturer will probably get up to at least level 2 ADAS.

Outside of incentives, every Mach-E has a price tag that is non-negotiable and made clear upfront. The only thing that will affect price is packages, but even those are also price set and published clearly by Ford.

My roommate (who was an engineer) was really excited about Elon Musk.  I put $1K in when it was $30 per share (pre split).   Followed the TSLA reddit community, the youtubers, listened to the earnings call, and it helped me keep strong conviction as the stock oscillated up and down.  I started to progress in software sales, and the company I was working at (which was publicly traded) tripled in value, so my equity went from $30K to \\~$100K.  I also made some bets on Square and other stocks, and reinvested all my savings into tech stocks, and bet on margin.  I ended up with about a total life savings of $300K after about 4 years.  From there, my sales manager was a total dick and was verbally abusive, and I thought to myself, I'd rather risk all my money to never be in this position again. As they say, diversification is a rich mans game, and you concentrate on high conviction stocks to build wealth.  As I saw TSLA drop in value, I became convinced more then ever that this was it, and I bet my entire life savings on the company.  At the time it was at $300 pre split, I put $300,000 in, and when it hit $1,000, at which point I became a millionaire.  I was in utter shock and disbelief.  There's significant psychological issues that come up when your wealth increases by that much, that quickly, it was like winning the lottery.  I felt the urge to diversify, but continued to hold on.  I ended up buying call options, and also did covered calls.  The stock continued to go up, and I rolled those covered calls out.  I'm now at the point where I feel good diversifying in to real estate and a mix of index/growth funds,  but I plan to keep 20-40% in TESLA long term.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07954593002796173}], "tickers": ["tsla"]}

{"title": "What happened today with PLTR is completely normal", "selftext": " \n\nI know that some of you are very mad, cuz you bought into the wsb hype, but what happened tha last 2 days is absolutely normal and actually should be expected. Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products.\n\nHowever, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today.\n\nNow before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.\n\nThis is not a financial advice and I promise you that Peter Thiel is not funding my posts.", "id": "mr0knr", "created_utc": 1618435996.0, "score": 232, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "I think the real problem is I own it... and until I sell it... it will remain red.", "score": 165, "replies": [{"body": "Ima hit you up after my next paycheck.
