Companies like Toyota and Ford will likely come out with competitive entry level vehicles, but it\u2019s going to take a while for that to happen.

You see, while TSLA actually has good margins, manufacturing has limitations in that it can grow proportional to the capex you put in (i.e. factories that cost $billions).\n\nMost tech companies on the other hand do not need incremental costs/capex to grow their userbase/revenue and so this is where exponential growth story comes from. If you apply this to TSLA, while it has indeed grown 50-60% from last year, jumping from 500k cars to 800k cars is one thing, whereas jumping from 5m to 7.5m is another.\n\nSo therefore the problem is that TSLA is ALREADY priced as if it has dominated the world and so while demand is gonna be there, I don't think it can grow as fast in the next few years simply because economies of scale and network effects are different when producing cars.\n\nThat's why every couple of months the narrative shifts to AI, FSD, insurance, robots or whatever that may be. Remember when the stock rallied in December people thought TSLA would grow this year by 2x and produce 1m cars. Now that it's not happening, the stock will probably go even higher than where it was last December and this is where some eyebrows from skeptics should be raised.\n\nIf you give iPhone as the example, Apple did not become a trillion dollar stock UNTIL it really did dominate its segment with (almost) zero competition, AMZN did not become the behemoth it is today BEFORE cloud/prime and all of that, Facebook did not become where it is today before IG exploded and people realized its network effects and so on.\n\nSo you have to understand there is an ex-ante factor on one hand, and there is ex-post in the other.

{"title": "Understanding inflation: Part 1. The 80\u2019s, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, And 20% Interest rates.", "selftext": "This is the start of a new series meant to dive into inflation, what it looks like, what it\u2019s effects are, and it\u2019s historical comparisons. Today we will be diving into the story of Paul Volcker, the fed chairman who took inflation head on and raised interest rates 20%.\n\n# Inflation in the 80\u2019s\n\nAs energy prices, wages, and government spending rose in the 80\u2019s, inflation went to new uncharted heights. The Consumer Price Index, otherwise as the CPI (which a separate write up will be made on in the future) clocked in at 13.91% annually in January of 1980. Accelerating a trend that had begun to occur in the latter half of the 1970's.\n\n# In Comes Volcker\n\nPaul Volcker, who was Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987, was determined to put an end to inflation. Contrary to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Paul Volcker was very concerned about inflation and its effect on the economy, he felt the prime directive of the fed at the time was to rein in inflation. Volcker raised interest rates 2% in 1980, to an average 13.35%. And another 3% in 1981, with an average of 16.39%. The year high in 1981 would be 22%. This would be followed by considerate drops over the next decade, with the decade ending at an average of 9.21%\n\n# The interest rate induced recession\n\nBy raising interest rates, and making it harder to borrow money. The economy entered a recession. By 1982, unemployment hit a peak of nearly 11%. Congress had repeatedly called on Paul Volcker to back down from his position on inflation, but he never did, quoted as saying inflation, if left unchecked, would result in \u201cmore serious economic circumstances over a much longer period of time\u201d\n\n# The fed\u2019s most brilliant move to tame inflation, quit looking at it\n\n1983 marked the year the Fed did their most brilliant policy yet at fighting inflation. They quit measuring it.\n\nIn 1983, the Fed changed the largest component of the CPI, mortgage prices, with something known as \u201cowners equivalent rent\u201d Instead of tracking mortgage prices, they instead decided to ask people who bought homes years ago what they would charge themselves to live in it. Weirdly, most people simply say whatever their mortgage is, which was also locked in years ago. The fed definitely did not anticipate this and just felt it was a handy change to make and has nothing to do with making inflation look better trust us on this one\n\n# Comparisons to modern time\n\nThe 1980\u2019s were a time when the government was much less dependent on low interest rates. Never once falling below 4% in the 70\u2019s. Despite this, interest rates would have to be raised to highs of 20%, in combination with blatant lying by changing the CPI, to rein in inflation. Compared to now, we are much more dependent on low interest rates. In 2018, when interest rates were raised to only 2%, the SPY ended the year down 6% in what would be the worst year since the 08 financial crises.\n\n# What this tells us\n\nInflation is here to stay. The fed cannot raise interest rates to the levels necessary to rein in inflation. Simply talking about tapering, which isn\u2019t even raising interest rates, causes the market to crash. In order for the fed to successfully rein in inflation, it will cause, at minimum, a recession. And most likely a complete depression. The fed will remain \u201chawkish\u201d on \u201chypothetically\u201d fighting inflation, in order to not scare people into hoarding, but inflation has become a raging wildfire that the fed understands they are largely powerless to fight. At best they will be able to slow down the rate of increase a small amount.", "id": "q0jt8h", "created_utc": 1633274365.0, "score": 312, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 186, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|416|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pxz04e/how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_love_inflation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pynip3/steel_futures_continue_to_rise_amid_tight_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzct2u/if_youre_one_of_the_77_of_americans_and_growing/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pulx56/according_to_a_recent_poll_from_pew_research_93/) \n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=q0jt8h)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=q0jt8h)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "!wsbgold", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Added /u/Wall_street_retard as an approved submitter.

People forget that in the olden days, the big cycle was that workers fought for better wages, companies said okay but we\u2019re going to have to raise our prices, and the economy kept humming along with ever-present inflation due to the cycle between worker\u2019s profit cut from the company. As unions got gutted and companies moved their decent factory jobs overseas, we\u2019ve become increasingly reliant on the Fed\u2019s interest rate + bond purchases as a way to regulate the system, but don\u2019t forget how labor negotiations and companies deciding whether or not to raise the prices is also a part of all this. In the early 60s JFK called in the head of US Steel to yell at him and told him to not be a greedy pig after the steel union just won a deal for better wages, thus temporarily ending the steel inflation cycle by saying the company couldn\u2019t justify trying to maintain the same profit margin and to simply share the wealth more. \n\nlong rant but I just want to point out there\u2019s a whole other dynamic that also affects this.
