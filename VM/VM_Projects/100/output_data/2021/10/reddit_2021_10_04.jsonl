You're thinking about price the right way, as premium (time value) + parity (stock-strike). Your math is seems right, unless the options closed weird, in which case we'll have to adjust our arithmetic, but lets go with it for now. \n\nTime value is 0.06. But I'm not telling you its 0.06. The mkt is. The fact that you are surprised by that probably means there is a trade to be made (sounds to me like you think its too low). Keep in mind that the premium in the 20c is the same as the premium of the 20p at all times. We can talk about either those ITM calls or the put, it doesn't really matter since we are discussing premium only. \n\nSo the question becomes how much do you think the time value should be? Why? Is time more valuable when VXX is lower or when VXX is higher? If VXX goes down, does it go down fast or slow? What if it goes up? If time value is a proxy for \"price of protection\", do you think people are more likely to want to purchase protection when VXX is up or when it is down? Does their willingness to buy protection change the higher or lower it goes? \n\nThese are hard questions, but there are essentially how the market prices volatility curves, which is the premium in options. Also, VXX is definitely one of the harder ones to figure out given the fact that it's distribution is so special, but at the end of the day the above questions still matter.

That seems strange since the time doesn't differ between those two...just the intrinsic value. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI fully understand the arb argument you made above and see that the ITM call can't be valued the way I thought, but then that begs the question of where that difference in time value is coming from.

There are a lot of other factors that influence profit, so it's hard to say from just that scenario.\n\nWhat is generally true is that higher strikes cost less money to open.

Rather, exercise requests go into a sort of queue, and everything gets mopped up overnight.  What happened to you is how assignment works.  It's how the OCC works.  It doesn't vary by broker.\n\n>  \n>  \n>How do you guys think I can avoid this situation in the future? I'd like the long leg option to be exercised when the short leg is exercised.\n\nYou can avoid the situation by being aware of when you have a short call and there is an upcoming dividend date.  You can check to see whether you're at risk of early assignment by determining whether the dividend exceeds the extrinsic value of the call.  If so, you can avoid this situation by buying to close the short call before the ex-dividend date.  If you do get assigned, you can't have the long leg exercised when the short leg is assigned, and you usually wouldn't want to anyway, because you'd be giving up the remaining extrinsic value on the long leg. Better to sell it and buy to cover the short shares on the open market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In my case, closing the short position before the market open on 10/5, do I still need to pay the ex-dividend?\n\nI've never heard of a brokerage processing a request to exercise outside of market hours.  Are you sure that's what happened?  Even if they did, like I said, these things are processed overnight, and as of 7AM this morning it was too late for last night's processing.

It was a very tiny portion of my portfolio. Anyways, a few weeks before the de-listing happened, i bought some **HTZ calls Jan 2022, strike $20**. Despite the bankruptcy, i just kept the options. Now a year later, the company is re-emerging from the bankruptcy.\n\nThe conversion between the old Hertz shares $HTZ ($HTZGQ), and the post bankruptcy stock $HTZZ goes like the following. \n\n    100 shares of $HTZ ($HTZGQ) \n    $1.53 x 100 = $153 Cash\n    0.09044939 x 100 = 9.04 shares of HTZZ\n    0.6452782 x 100 = 64.53 shares of HTZZW (warrants, strike for $12) \n\nCurrent share price of HTZZ is $22.15. The current price of HTZZW is $9.80 on OTCMKTS. \n\nThis is my way of understanding the calculation of the 100 shares of old hertz in $ value\n\n. $153 + (9.04 x $22.15) + (64.53 \\* $9.80)  = $985.63 \n\nNow if i divide the $ value to just the shares, HTZZ = $22.15, i'm getting ($985.63/$22.15) = 44.45 HTZZ shares. **So 100 shares of old HTZ are translating to 44.45 of just HTZZ.** \n\nSo I'm wondering **how the options would go with this, would the ratio applied to the price of the options now? The old strike price is $20, with the current conversion, the new strike price would be $20 \\* (100/44.45)  = $45** \n\nWhat's strange is that, as the price moves up, the conversion ratio goes down. Theoretically, let's say HTZZ trades at $50 and HTZZW trades at $38  (est, deep ITM at $12 strike), than the strike of $20 changes to \\~$31. \n\nConversely, if the HTZZ price goes down, to let's say \\~$15 (warrants being \\~$3), the strike conversion goes to roughly \\~$70. \n\nNot sure how this will play out on, especially if the stock gets relisted again. **Maybe there will be one time fixed conversion on the old option chain strikes? Or the brokerage or clearing party would have to do the calculation on the day of option execution?** \n\n**Or Am i overthinking this, the original contract is for the ability to buy a share at $20 and that's the end of it?** \n\nIn my brokerage acct I'm seeing the same number of contracts and the same strike price but now with the updated ticker of HTZZ. There doesn't seem to be any conversion reflecting since the initial position. Since it's still just on OTCMKTS, the option prices are not very liquid, so I can't make a proper judgement on them now. \n\nWondering if any of you have any relevant thoughts/insights on how the options on this will play out.

You sell to open a put spread on ABC at the 100/105 strikes, both OTM around 30 delta. The 105 strike pays $6 in credit and the 100 strike costs you $5, for a net $1 credit on a $5 spread. You open 45 DTE.\n\nAt 30 DTE, the stock becomes very volatile and the market piles into the 105 put, demand pushing up the price to $13. The market seems less interested in the 100 strike for reasons that are not clear. It only goes up to $5.25. To buy to close, you have to pay $13 for a put you only got $6 for, netting a $7 loss, and you have to sell a put for $5.25 that you paid $5 for, gaining $.25. .25 - 7 = a -$6.25 loss.

What do you mean by \"different price\"? You mean the credit you collected, the strikes, some combination?\n\nThe IRS rule is \"substantially identical\". So if you wrote a 4400/4410p Nov 19 spread, closed for a loss, and then wrote an identical 4400/4410p Nov 19 spread, that would certainly be a wash sale.\n\nWhere things get a lot more fuzzy is if the spread is slightly different, like 4400/4410p Nov 19 AM vs. PM expirations, or 4400/4410p Nov 19 vs. Nov 26, or 4400/4415p Nov 19. I would argue that none of those are substantially identical, but the IRS will make up its own mind and won't care what I think. Likewise for brokers. Some might *report* one of those slightly different spreads as a wash sale, even if the IRS wouldn't actually agree.\n\n**BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS IF YOU DON'T STRADDLE A TAX YEAR**\n\nWash sales are not something you need to worry about. They have no impact on your taxes, as long as you keep both ends of the wash sale in the same tax year, and dispose of the loss-carrying position in the same tax year.\n\nWash sales just add the loss to the cost basis of the disqualifying trade. So instead of deducting the loss directly, you \"carry it forward\" to the new trade. The deduction becomes \"built in\" to the gain/loss of that new trade. So you get the tax deduction one way or the other.\n\nIt's only a problem if that new trade isn't disposed of in the same tax year. If you have a $1000 loss in 2021 but you don't close the carry forward trade until 2022, you don't get the benefit of the $1000 loss on your 2021 taxes, you'll get it in 2022.\n\nSo **TL-DR**, as long as you dispose/close wash sale carry forwards in the same tax year, you can ignore wash sales completely. How this works out practically is start to be careful about trades you open in late October.

I want to take advantage of IV crush immediately after the earnings call, so I'm going to close the position the next day. I want this position to be short vega to make money off of IV contraction.

The simple answer is this: there exists moves in the underlying where you lose on both sides of the trade. \n\nTo better illustrate this theoretically, you should look at the trade that turns one position into the other. To compare the 1 month iron fly to your short time fly, look at a 1 month strangle swap, which buys the monthly strangle to sell the weekly. To keep things simple, assume that the wing strikes in your position and the iron fly are the same. \n\nHow this trade WINS is exactly how your trade is worse relative to the normal iron fly.

The exercise itself is something I think you should do for yourself, and come back to this thread if you have questions.\n\nIn a less abstract way, I can try and illustrate a real life extreme case that I remember trading where the outcome of the iron fly vs your trade was VERY different. DIS earnings day (the day it was going to move off of the numbers) was Friday Nov 8 2019. They had announced Disney+ earlier that year, and basically it was going to launch over the weekend. Going into earnings, the 1 day friday move was super jacked, since there were rumors about preliminary signups, content leaks etc. At the same time, people were like \"It's DIS lmao, this shit never does anything wild, and vol is going to come in post earnings after all this new news is out of the way\", and so the 1 month and out IV wasn't anything crazy. \n\nWhat ended up happening was DIS moved more than usual, 4% I think, but nothing close to how much was being priced by the 1 day. But the real kicker was basically that they said \"We are going to give you a ton more info over the next 2 weeks, including how many first day signups, what membership types people are signing up for, and the content roll out\". IV just exploded as soon as the market opened, while the stock basically did nothing from the opening gap up (since all the fun news was going to come the next week and no one was going to try and trade it before then) and weeklies got destroyed.  You had lots of people pretty fucking short DIS vol farther back, again its fucking Disney we are talking about, so there was a ton of panic as the company profile had changed so much.\n\nThe iron fly would have saved you some money. Yea you'd be short vol, but the wings would actually *gain* vega as vol went up, so those would help. Your trade would blow the fuck out.

We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today\" - Wells Fargo analyst\n\nNvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021.\n\n# Q2 Earnings\n\nAlmost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue \u2014 all those RTX 30 series graphics cards \u2014 hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.\n\n# Crypto Market dependence\n\nWhen of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company\u2019s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.\n\nFor Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**\n\n# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment\n\nNVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates\u00a0that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. \n\n# Arm Deal\n\nNvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD\n\nAMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record\u00a050% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech](https://preview.redd.it/faswa7u5dgr71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=99fdf6382da174aa1c34fff4ffb72dab7abaa7f2)\n\n#  Q2 Earnings And Growth\n\nOn July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform \"Steam\" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded\u00a030%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.\n\n[ AMD website - q2 Financial results](https://preview.redd.it/jjeh28b8dgr71.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=1194ec52ebd44ff97c9ae9686ff69f63d4787d4b)\n\n#  Video Games Potential Growth\n\nVideo game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from\u00a0last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected\u00a0to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected\u00a0to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.\n\n**AMD** supplies\u00a0semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell\u00a025.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.\n\n# Xilinx Acquisition\n\nAMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx\u00a0is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.\n\n# Intel ~ $INTC\n\nIntel\u2019s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It\u2019s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.\n\nIntel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)\n\n#  New CEO = New Future?\n\nIntel\u2019s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations", "id": "q17xof", "created_utc": 1633362049.0, "score": 209, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "Great write up\n\nMy money is in AMD", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "I second this.

I dabbled in option trading on and off for about a year, until I stumbled upon AMC. I got into amc at $11 a share and turned $6,000 into $300,000 In about 2 weeks time. After that run up, my idiotic self continued to buy more options thinking it would run up again and again. Fast forward to today I\u2019m at an all time low, my portfolio is at $25,000. Yea I know, I\u2019m 20 years old and lost $275,000 in the last 4 months. I\u2019ve heard of theta gang throughout the last year. And always figured it was a boring strategy to make money, and you never really made much. Well I want to say that I am wrong, and I\u2019ve officially joined theta gang today, and with my first move I sold 10 $12.5c 10/16exp of ATER. I\u2019m certain it\u2019ll squeeze sometime soon, but 10/16 seems too early for the squeeze. So I hedged my bet with $7.5c, $10c for 11/19.

The bias with options is that the IV is almost always higher than the actual volatility, so this puts the odds in the favor of the seller of options in something like 90% of all trades.  If you're using a debit spread or a debit in general, you're betting on the stock going up by a certain time and you get nothing if it doesn't so it's pretty much a directional gamble.  If you're selling a spread for a credit, then you get to keep that credit no matter what happens so you're starting out with profit and all you have to do is try to hold on to it (and there are lots of ways to do that).  I think most people use options for gambling and for insurance, so think of thetagang as an insurance company and we only lose if something really bad happens that causes everyone to cash in on their insurance policy all at the same time.

If you read through the Rivian forum, there's already reports from people that saw \"production\" models with sharp edges on trim and panels,  plastics held on with velcro, unfinished bits and pieces.  And the answers from sales people were \"it'll be different by the time consumer deliveries start\", but no answer on HOW it will be different.   That tells me their run rate is super low, hand fit / deburred, lots of manual labor parts, and a new start-up that has tons of lessons to learn.  \n\nThe interiors are, expensive.  The paint options and sheet metal design, expensive.  And their low volume means extremely high man-hours per truck built.  Rivian is jumping into the model space which is the hardest to crack, since it has the most expensive battery pack, highest cost to build and most competitive selling price.  Even GM was smart and chose to list the Hummer at that astronomical price.  And GM -might- make money on the Hummer.

{"title": "Here's why Tesla won't have any Competition for Most of the Decade", "selftext": "There are 5 bullet points that need to be checked off for a company and its EV to be competitive with Tesla EVs. We'll break it down into 2 bullet points for the company, 2 bullet points for their EV, and 1 bullet point that actually makes the first 4 bullet points moot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a company to be competitive with Tesla it needs to fulfill 2 requirements:\n\n1. The ability to produce 500k+ EVs a year, or more specifically at least 80% of Tesla produces for the same calendar year. There's literally no other company that can do this at the moment, and there won't be until Tesla tops out production after the decade has passed.\n2. The ability to produce an EV at a cost of no more than $30k. Right now, there's 0 doubt in my mind that the Ford Mach-E and other crappy EVs cost at least $50k to manufacture. A Tesla SR Model 3 costs $40k to the consumer, and probably only around $30k for Tesla to manufacture it. To be even more strict, a company needs to create an EV that only costs them $30k-$35k to be competitive with Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a company's EV to be competitive with Tesla it needs to fulfill 2 requirements:\n\n3. An affordable price for the EV. Some companies have achieved this. The Ford Mach-E, VW's ID.3/4, Chevy's Bolt Fire are all affordable to the consumer. This is just one bullet point though, and bullet point 2 still looms large.\n\n4. Customer satisfaction. First and foremost, Tesla has a supercharger network. Soon to be open to everyone, but up until now this bullet point couldn't be achieved by 'competition.' Also, people love their Teslas, and in particular, the long range that other EVs can't achieve without breaking bullet point 3 and 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally..\n\n5. The EV market is growing fast enough to support Tesla selling every EV they make \\*plus other EVs from other companies\\*. At some point, probably after 2030, 90% of cars will be EVs. Tesla will not have a market share of more than 25%, and yet they will have sold every EV they've made this decade at margins likely better than the ones we saw in Q2 ER as they continue to scale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, you guys do some research and find a company and it's EV that fulfills bullet points 1-4 (you can't), and if you somehow do find a company and EV that fulfills bullet points 1 - 4 (say.. in 2026 maybe), then I'll just point to bullet point 5 to remind you to stop being a stupid bear.\n\nIf you're wondering why it will likely be 2026 or later by the time a company fulfills bullet points 1 - 4, it's because Tesla spent a decade of burning billions of dollars in R&D to figure out how to mass produce a commercially viable EV. Elon, and his autistic brilliance, was the one to experiment with making their own magnets with unique chemistries in the motors, metal alloys and casting processes to optimize factory space and cut costs and weight on their EVs.

Innovation is driven by the management team and executed by the team, yes engineers have left but this clearly is not the only piece to the puzzle or else legacy would be beating Tesla tech which they are not. Even if they did surpass Tesla tech in the new future Tesla will have continued to innovate and still be out ahead. Innovation is the best moat. \n\nTesla dosent need 100 years of supply chain experience as they don\u2019t use nearly as many, they actually build cars unlike the big guys who like to buy parts and stick them together. Another advantage to Tesla as suppliers tighten and Tesla can pivot to meet their own needs unlike legacy who is stuck holding their dicks because they can\u2019t pivot around shortages.\n\nThe point behind my original comment is that Tesla navigated the first big shortage the industry has seen since EV adoption and Tesla still came out on top (even with legacy having 100 years of experience). This won\u2019t be the last shortage and Tesla will be far more prepared than legacy for the next coming shortages.", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla does not build cars any differently.
