Companies \"raise\" money by selling a big chunk of their stocks. This process is similar to raising money by selling equity to private investors in early stages.\n\n(Making money is done by selling product or services.)\n\n>How does Apple make money because the stock price goes up\n\nAgain, Apple makes money by selling their product and services. \n\nThey can however raise additional money by selling equity, selling debt or by borrowing. \n\n-Selling equity is basically selling another chunk of stocks which could be from original pool of stocks that company had retained or from additional pool of stocks that company just created. This results in ownership dilution. \n\n- selling debt is basically issuing bonds. Where company agrees to pay you usually a set coupon rate over a period of time. Depending upon quality of the company the interest rate they have to pay would vary. (Bette company pays lower rate as low risk of default). So stock price going up higher is liekly an indication that company is performing well. \n\n- borrowing is simply borrowing. It could be short term or long term debt and usually each company borrows money (called leveraging) so they are able to reduce their taxes.  Again more options and ability to borrow at lower rate for comapnies with good stock price performance.\n\nNow a question would be why would apple executives care if stock price goes up? \n\nAnswer is that they are answerable to shareholders (technically owners) and usually performance of stock is tied to bonus and paychecks that execs get. They also hold RSU (restricted stocks reserved for internal people). In addition, Strong stock prices would also help in retaining talent as well as in executives' own ability to borrow money against their personal stocks. \n\nHope it helps.", "score": 418, "replies": [{"body": "This is the right answer.

Shares going to zero doesn't cause bankruptcy, but rather it's often a symptom of bankruptcy. \n\nTypically, bankruptcy is preceded by a liquidity crisis. No funds to pay interest/principal means default. One debt's default often leads to cross-default on all debt (think domino effect). Default on all debt is a legal & financial nightmare and pushes companies to seek court protection (i.e., automatic stay) against creditors.\n\nTwo main routes of bankruptcies for US company: Chapter 7 liquidation and Chapter 11 restructuring. \n\nLiquidation is basically what you described. The company sells everything off and creditors are paid first and whatever is leftover gets distributed to equity holders. Sometimes there's absolutely nothing left after paying creditors, so shareholders get nothing, hence a zero stock value. Sometimes there's residual value and stock value does its best to forecast that residual amount per share and trades a tad above zero.\n\nChapter 11 restructuring is basically the company wiping their capital structure clean and proposing a new one through a plan of reorganization - rather than ceasing to exist, the business will continue on a clean slate after bankruptcy. Classes of creditors & equity owners will vote on the plan, but most of the time it's the equity holders who get screwed. The plan will often cancel all outstanding shares and issue new shares to creditors (\"Old Equity\" vs. \"New Equity\"). Old Equity is what goes to zero since they're cancelled, so a liquidation is not necessarily the only way to go to zero. New Equity is what carries on after companies emerge from bankruptcy and continue operating. Sometimes the New Equity holders will keep the business private, but they can also have the company register the New Equity in an \"IPO\". \n\nLast point is that these plans of reorganizations sometimes allocate 5% of New Equity to Old Equity holders just to appease them during the voting process. Occasionally the Old Equity class will get warrants/options for New Equity. That's why you'll sometimes see Old Equity trade a tad above zero because there's still some value in that exchange.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.010998625308275223}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1791207194328308}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48088836669921875}, {"body": "How does a company decide whether to sell debt or equity?

Currently it's $200, Elon has already said FSD price will increase significantly in the future, supposedly this goes for both subscription and full purchases.\n* Estimate the FSD take rate. Currently it's around 10% in the US, where it works best. Obviously this will go up significantly if your car could fully drive itself and earn you money by serving as a robotaxi.\n* Multiply total vehicles on the road by FSD take rate and multiple that by monthly subscription price to get revenue per month.\n* Multiply that by 12 to get FSD revenue per year.\n* Estimate the expected margin percentage. This is a software service, so probably somewhere between 70 and 90%.\n* Multiply yearly FSD revenue by the margin percentage to get the operating income.\n* Multiply that by 0.8 to get a rough estimation of Net Income per year.\n* Estimate what you think Tesla's PE ratio will be by 2030. Lower than 20 is unrealistic, higher than 90 probably is too.\n* Multiply the annual net income by the PE multiple to get Tesla's market cap by 2030.\n\nFinally, put % on the chance you think Tesla has of solving full autonomy this decade, to determine how likely you think that valuation is to come true. Keep in mind this is ONLY from FSD. Car sales, supercharger revenue, energy sales, energy software revenue (autobidder), and any new products/services Tesla is yet to release all still add to their total market cap.\n\nUnless you don't believe Tesla will solve full autonomy this decade - which in my opinion is quite unlikely based on what we know today - I think you'll find that it's probably worth holding on to (most of) your Tesla shares for a few more years.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Nice DD thanks", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Anytime!

Hypothetically, once you get to a strike price of $0, it would become just like owning 100 shares. You'd profit with any upwards movement of the stock price.\n\nBut if you buy OTM leaps, the stock price needs to go above the strike price by your premium price before expiry for you to profit by exercising.\n\n---------\n\nFor example, I bought TSLA $500 Jun 2023 LEAPS for a premium of $316 (when TSLA was trading at $730). So my break even is $500 + $316 = $816. TSLA closed at $811 today, so I'm almost at break even \u2014 with nearly two years until expiry.\n\nOf course, I can sell those LEAPS any time before expiry. They traded at $380 today, so I could sell for a $64/share gain (20%) \u2014 even though they aren't above my break even yet. \n\nThe break even just means that if I exercise now, I wouldn't profit because I've essentially paid $816 per share for a stock trading at $811.\n\nNow let's look at OTM LEAPS, like TSLA $1000 at the same expiry. The premium right now would be $141.25, which is much less than the $316 premium I paid for my $500 strike calls.\n\nHowever, because the strike price is $1000, your break even would be $1000 + $141.25 = $1141.25. That's the price the stock would have to hit for you to profitably exercise those LEAPS.\n\nBut again, you could sell those LEAPS any time before expiry.

It becomes 1 at a strike of $0. The June 2023 TSLA $500 LEAPS from above have an 0.85 delta right now. The $800 LEAPS have a 0.64 delta. The $1000 LEAPS have a 0.49 delta.\n\nDelta can be viewed as the market's estimate of the probability an option will expire in the money.\n\nOnce the stock price crosses your strike + premium, you can *exercise* for a profit. But you can sell for a profit below break even as I explain below.\n\n\n-----------\n\n>Once its past your breakeven (strike + premium), you have 2 options , either sell the contract for profit or exercise the option to sell in open market ( whichever has higher ROE)\n\nNot really. \n\nYou can sell the option for a profit before it crosses your break even, if you have sufficient time value left on the contract. For example, I can profitably sell my 2023 $500 TSLA LEAPS now because they've risen from $316 to 380 \u2014 despite TSLA just trading at $811, which is below my $816 break even. That's because I bought my LEAPS when TSLA was trading at $730.\n\nThe stock price moving upwards will increase the value of your LEAPS options. \n\nYou could exercise your LEAPS once above break even, but I don't and many people don't because that ties up a lot of capital and defeats some of the purpose of buying options instead of shares (leverage). \n\nHowever, exercising LEAPS doesn't trigger capital gains taxes in some countries, so this may be a consideration. \n\nI intend to roll my LEAPS forward next year \u2014 that is, sell to close them and immediately open new LEAPS for an expiry another year forward \u2014 e.g. sell 2023 LEAPS and buy 2024 LEAPS.\n\n------\n\n>It doesnt make sense to exercise your option before it crosses breakeven as that would require higher capital and same as buying those shares.\n\nIt doesn't make sense because you'd be losing money.

ALGN (Align Technology)**\n\n$ALGN is in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nIt is amazing to see the growth of this company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgme1ae094t71.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&s=38e1a65da40402d87932df5be28bead49c928bb6\n\nThe stock price has risen 58527 % from its lowest point ($1.26) to the maximum ($737.45), and is currently at $643.56, up 51076 %.\n\nNumber of shares: 79.01 M\n\nMarket cap: 50803 M $\n\n....**(2). XRAY (Dentsplay Sinora)**\n\n$XRAY is also in the business of developing and selling dental equipment in addition to orthodontic 3D printers.\n\nThe growth rate of this company is also surprising.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xob4n5194t71.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d30b10c2d58957d678859f436b83ce5b798d70c\n\nIt reached the high of $69.54, which is 13120 % higher than the low of $0.53, and is now 10949% higher at $58.03.\n\nNumber of shares: 218.55 M\n\nMarket cap: 12682.46 M $\n\nIn addition to this, the main tickers are\n\n\\* Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC)\n\n\\* 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD)\n\netc., but I'll skip these.\n\nEven dental care/treatment around the world is expensive, so unless you are upper-middle class or higher, you have not been able to straighten your teeth well. In particular, there **were** many negative views on corrections for beauty.\n\nHowever, the explosive growth of orthodontic equipment companies,\n\nSeeing that orthodontic for beauty are now increasingly popular with the young generation in many countries,\n\nDemand for orthodontics has exploded in recent years and is expected to increase in the future.\n\n..**2). the importance of price**\n\nOrthodontic at SDC is generally much cheaper than actual visits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sy97rxb294t71.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee9eecc22555d2309e75ca6a39122f3252f29a4\n\nIn addition, due to the pandemic, masks have become commonplace and the frequency of going out has greatly decreased.\n\nAt this time when people are not showing their teeth, more and more people want to have orthodontic treatment, and SDC has a very strong advantage in this regard.\n\nFor this expensive orthodontic treatment to **become common**, it must not be too burdensome for the middle class to afford.\n\nAnd SDC is one of the most affordable solutions,\n\n**I think SmileDirectClub will lead the way among companies that make orthodontics universal for beauty in the future.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxia739394t71.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=199d252b1f65280620b3bf2f37e6eb325ceb4776\n\nGet a smile with just 3$ per day!\n\n..**3). Sales and operating profit**\n\nLet's look at the change in sales of $SDC.\n\nAnnual Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f7mte3494t71.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ba5e57a124b05cc5714e50f822fe8bef84d6e15\n\nMonthly Sales Trend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1q6orp494t71.png?width=1245&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f956a9c60c70052624836f7a434ea3d1bf391d6\n\nSDC's quarterly sales are doing pretty well. I think this has a big impact on showing good results in marketing as well.\n\nSince this orthodontic treatment is highly likely to become a trend from the young generation, reviews and promotions through SNS will spread very quickly during the transition period when orthodontic treatment becomes common. In fact, SDC can easily find promotional materials on SNS, Youtube, and TV.\n\nPoor operating profit is one of the biggest causes of recent short selling attacks, and in fact, ignorant 'self-proclaimed analysts' cite operating profit as the reason for 'the reason you should not buy SDC'.\n\nBut the reason why the operating profit is currently poor is largely due to the cost of plant expansion, new patent development, and business expansion into new countries.\n\n\\--------------------ref----------------------------\n\nItem 2. Properties\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Nashville, Tennessee. We also lease our manufacturing facilities in Antioch, Tennessee and Columbia, Tennessee, where we expect to open a second manufacturing facility. We have 114 SmileShops across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Hong Kong, U.K., Germany, and Singapore all of which are either leased or licensed from our retail partners. Lastly, we lease our facility in San Jose, Costa Rica and our facility in Cartago, Costa Rica. Management believes the terms of the leases are consistent with market standards and were arrived at through arm\u2019s-length negotiation.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 52 )\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the 10-Q filing, the number of manufacturing plants and retail shops are increasing.\n\nIt is an accurate approach to the business core elements of the current SDC.\n\n\\---------------------ref------------------------------\n\nKey Business Metrics\n\nWe review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business performance:\n\nUnique aligner order shipments\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we shipped 374,982 and 453,053 unique aligner orders, respectively. Each unique aligner order shipment represents a single contracted member. We believe that our ability to increase the number of aligner orders shipped is an indicator of our market penetration, growth of our business, consumer interest, and our member conversion.\n\nAverage aligner gross sales price\n\nWe define average gross sales price (\u201cASP\u201d) as gross revenue, before implicit price concession and other variable considerations and exclusive of sales tax, from aligner orders shipped divided by the number of unique aligner orders shipped. We believe ASP is an indicator of the value we provide to our members and our ability to maintain our pricing. Our ASP for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1,797 and $1,771, respectively. Our ASP is less than our standard $1,950 price as a result of discounts offered to select members.\n\n( Reference : File number 21907839 , 10-Q, page : 57 )\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe core business element of SDC presented in 10-Q is to secure a large number of orders, and recently sales are good and capacity is increasing, so operating profit is negative.\n\n..**4). Alabama State Dental Association is so territorial but Fair Trade Commission recognized SDC business.**\n\nSDC was planning to expand into Alabama, but the Alabama Dental Association requested SDC to stop remote/visual orthodontic diagnosis and treatment, and SDC abandoned its expansion plan to Alabama.\n\nHowever, the Fair Trade Commission said that this was an unreasonable request and violated the antitrust law and that SmileDirectClub's business was justified as a result of a 5-0 vote.\n\n[https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/alabama-board-dental-examiners-agrees-settle-ftc-charges-it)\n\nAlabama Board of Dental Examiners Agrees to Settle FTC Charges that It Unreasonably Excluded Lower Cost Online and Teledentistry Providers from Competition\n\nTo settle FTC charges that its actions violated the antitrust laws, the Board of Dental Examiners of Alabama has agreed to stop requiring on-site supervision by licensed dentists of alignment scans of prospective patients\u2019 mouths seeking to address misaligned teeth or gaps between teeth.\n\nSDC is fighting these existing dental associations' territory and regulations,\n\nI sent an inquiry email to SDC regarding these.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q01nub1694t71.png?width=1581&format=png&auto=webp&s=f132df1bdbf9f2a8d94bee213aa8cf7faa81178a\n\nIn this regard, SDC received a reply that it would deal with it in more detail when it released 3Q earnings.\n\n..**5). $SDC is the only Tele-Dentistry company listed on Nasdaq**\n\nThe link below is a list of US Tele-Dentistry companies, and SmileDirectClub is the only listed company.\n\n[https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html](https://www.beckersdental.com/teledentistry/36105-10-teledentistry-companies-to-know.html)\n\nThis means that there is no competition for $SDC in the Nasdaq market, there is sufficient liquidity to invest in marketing,\n\nIt is the best company that can monopolize a percentage of the Tele-Dentistry market.\n\n**2. Issues with SmileDirectClub**\n\n..**1). Legal issues with NBC ( CNBC ).**\n\nLast year, SDC filed a $2.85 billion lawsuit alleging that NBC deliberately distorted SDC.\n\n[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/smiledirectclub-sues-nbc-285-billion-1295347/)\n\nThe lawsuit is still ongoing. If SDC win, it is possible to secure a huge amount of funds with strong recognition.\n\n..**2). Short-Squeuze play on Reddit**\n\nBased on the content of my previous post about the possibility of short squeeze and the general information above, reports that I was trying to play a short squeeze on Reddit.\n\n[https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19](https://twitter.com/KristinaParts/status/1437884294249201669?s=19)\n\nGME, AMC, and then SDC, MEMEs started to become popular.\n\n..**3). Analyst raises target price**\n\nBelow is Analyst's upward revision of the $SDC target price (starting price of $5.25 -> target price of $11)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit\\_suisse\\_analyst\\_matt\\_miksic\\_gives/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockSDC/comments/pz36eg/credit_suisse_analyst_matt_miksic_gives/)\n\n**3. Danger**\n\nThe short-term risks of SDC are hard to find out now. So let's take a look at three long-term risks.\n\n..**1). Risks from audits after exiting emerging growth companies**\n\nSDC, as an emerging growth company, receives exceptions from audits, and if sales exceed 1.08 B, it will be eliminated from the emerging growth company, and there is a high risk of being attacked by short selling according to financial reporting.\n\nIn fact, according to the investment prospectus of SDC, it is possible to speculate that the current sales are intentionally lowered to some extent because the company intends to take full advantage of the advantages of 'emerging growth companies'. It is a story of the distant future. No need to worry right now.\n\n..**2). Possibility of dilution of Class A common stock by pre-IPO investors**\n\nThe number of issued shares is 118.87 M , the current share price is 6.5 dollars, and the current market capitalization is 773 M $ ( 972 billion won).\n\nThe total number of diluted shares including pre-IPO investor volume (common share B) is 387,61 M.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v6zqi8894t71.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=d12cad7c7cf680cef8d008bb15a5db1ed0d64f51\n\nReference : 10-Q, page 1\n\nThe lock-up release date for common stock B was released on August 16, 19, 180 days after the submission of S-1.\n\nSo far, a total of 1.2M common stock B has been diluted with common stock A.\n\nClass A change: 104,825,858 -> 118,869,656\n\nClass B change: 281,863,766 -> 269,243,501\n\n**Even after the lockup was lifted, the conversion of common stock B to common stock A was only diluted by 4.5%, a small amount for a year and a half. Moreover, considering the diluted unit price (over $10), the current share price is $6.5, so the possibility of a share price decline due to the dilution of common stock B is very low.**\n\n..**3). Redemption of convertible bonds**\n\nThe convertible bonds issued on February 9, 21st had a conversion rate of 55.3710 shares per 1000$ conversion rate, and were converted to the common share A price of $18.06 per share.\n\nAccording to the contents of convertible bonds, the bill is due on February 1, 26, and from August 1, 25, the issuer of the note can request redemption.\n\nIn addition, according to the will of the company, from February 6, 24, if the stock price at that time is higher than the stock price when the bill was issued, early redemption is possible.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that SDC's common stock A will be diluted due to convertible bonds is a very distant future, and it is not something to be concerned about much at present.\n\n\\------------------------ref---------------------------------\n\nItem 1.01.\n\nEntry into a Material Definitive Agreement.\n\nIndenture and Notes\n\nOn February 9, 2021, SmileDirectClub, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) entered into an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), pursuant to which the Company issued $650,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Company has also granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $97,500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes (\u201cOption Notes\u201d). On February 9, 2021, the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase $70,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Option Notes.\n\nThe Notes will be the Company\u2019s senior, unsecured obligations and will be (i) equal in right of payment with the Company\u2019s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company\u2019s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including our credit facility and trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\nThe Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before August 1, 2025, noteholders will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after August 1, 2025, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its Class A common stock, at the Company\u2019s election. The initial conversion rate is 55.3710 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $18.06 per share of Class A common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cMake-Whole Fundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\n\nThe Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after February 6, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company's Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\n\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, then noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\n\n(Reference:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4\\_8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001775625/000110465921016943/tm214449d4_8k.htm))\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**4. Conclusions and considerations**\n\n**$SDC This is on the movement, not a moment.**\n\nThe demand for orthodontics is explosively popular all over the world, and SDC is a company that has great advantages. It is also the largest company in the Tele-Dentistry industry and is the only listed company on Nasdaq.\n\nIn view of the move to continuously increase marketing and production capacity,\n\nSDC is a company with great potential to continue increasing its market share by leading the future Online & Tele-Dentistry, and believes that its share price will rise by at least several hundred% in the next few years.\n\nWhen 3Q earnings are announced in November, no one knows whether the short selling will be more aggressive or if the results will exceed expectations and result in an earnings surprise.\n\nThere is one more thing to remember. Long position institutions have already formed strong support at $5, and there has never been any class B dilution near this price range. Therefore, we believe that the current share price is more safe than risky.\n\nIn the short term, there is a high possibility that the stock price will rise quickly due to the pressure on short selling.\n\nIf a squeeze occurs in order to maximize profits (to hold as many shares of $SDC as possible in the long term), as explained in Chapter 3. Risk, there is a factor that will decrease in the long run, so some of them will be forced to sell. , I think it would be good to collect stocks steadily over the long term.\n\nps.

If you're making this play solely based upon a short squeeze and some quick profit, I hope ya'll clean up. HOWEVER,  I work in the dental field and have mentioned SDC to a few orthodontists and a half dozen or so dentists in the area, including a past president of the AAO. Knowing what I've picked up over 10 years in the dental field, SDC is plagued with lawsuits and does extremely shoddy work. It completely baffles me that they're allowed to send you \"DIY impression kits\" and expect good results when we often have to have refresher courses for dental hygienists/assistants/etc who've been in the field 20+ years and still occasionally screw up an alginate impression. \n\n  \nImproper impressions can wildly throw off the outcome simulator (what Invisalign, Spark, etc use to tell you how many trays you'll be given) which leads to improper tooth movement. I have personally seen someone lose 2 permanent teeth caused by excessive tooth movement which caused the roots to die. Without a proper bite registration (the way your teeth hit one another) you're much more likely to wear teeth down unevenly.   \nFurthermore, I've never seen ANY aligner company that doesn't use attachments on the teeth when the teeth are in malocclusion (over/underbite). Attachments are little things they cement to your teeth that gives the aligners something to grip on to, like using a knob to open/close a door. SDC doesn't do that because you'd have to, you know, see a fucking professional to do.\n\n  \n It is also usually near damn impossible to correctly rotate teeth ideally without doing something called interproximal reduction, or IPR, for short. Doing IPR allows you to create space between two teeth that are too close together and couldn't rotate without hitting one another. \n\n  \nTo my knowledge, they don't offer much in the proprietary sense as there's at least a half dozen companies I know of personally that use some sort a digital scanner (Itero scanners) to create a 3D model of your teeth, then use an AI to simulate stages of tooth movement. Once that's done you literally only need a 3D resin printer(2k-5k) and a Biostar/ministar machine (\\~$1k) and you can do an ever better version of what SDC does at roughly the same price.   \nHonestly fuck SDC..it's such a predatory and shit company. Anytime any ortho/dental governing bodies mention it, SDC goes Bezos and sends a team of lawyers claiming it violates free trade. LET ME BE CLEAR, there are scenarios where SDC has it's place...like if you had braces in the past, didn't wear your retainer, and experienced relapse. We see a handful of patients who want to be re-treated, but most ortho offices offer some sort of similar product (Invisalign express, Spark, Arcad, uLab...there's several of them) where you're physically seen BY A PROFESSIONAL that takes FUCKING PANORAMIC XRAYS before moving shit around all willy-nilly. \n\n  \n**TLDR** : SDC is the equivalent of making a doctor sending you DIY cast material for a broken bone without looking at a fucking xray. They haven't gone much in the way of proprietary tech that isn't already available, and they're sitting on a stack of lawsuits. It COULD BE a squeeze play, but this company deserves to be shorted to the center of the earth so far that even Brendan Fraser and The Rock couldn't get to it.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This is complete bullshit.

I'm very aware that the Chinese government looks extremely powerful and the country as a whole appears impressively unified, on paper.\n\nBut we also know that the Chinese government is extremely skilled at keeping up appearances (better than the usa, no doubt), as well as hiding and withholding information from both their own citizens as well as foreign nations. Hell, the average chinese citizen is at risk of \"disappearing\" if they try to access the internet outside of the chinese internet.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, I think it would be a mistake to assume that China is really running as smoothly as it appears to be. One of their biggest strengths are deception and propaganda, considering how little insight we are allowed to receive on their internal affairs we really will not know how bad or good things are going until they either collapse or flaunt their supremacy. It's not possible to realistically know this from our pov, today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, the Chinese government is constantly under attack by the western world, most notably the USA, in attempts to destabilise and weaken their grip on their country to make them less of a threat. No doubt the actual pillar organisations of China are aware of this and some would jump ship given the opportunity, no one truly wants to work for a government that would take away their humanity if the returns were more practical.\n\nThis alone means that they have to spend extra resources and attention to propaganda to avoid disloyalty, deal with potential spies and other agents working for foreign nations, put in place systems to make it harder for local organisations to work with foreign nations (such as a lack of communication and trade).\n\nThe list can go on, but the point is this is most likely an inner conflict in their nation which could be negligible, or it could be a big problem making straight-forward cooperation harder and/or more costly to achieve. Problems such as these are almost inevitable when dealing with countries of gigantic proportions in both land and population.\n\nBut, we would not know wether any of this is happening, because that is information that could make China appear as a failing and crippled country, they will do their absolute best to make sure such information never reaches the ears of even their own citizens so as to avoid having their power being in question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary, yes, the Chinese government may have broad and tighter control over their nation compared to the USA, being able to make decisions and steer their country with much less fuss and less struggle.\n\nBut every decision needs to be made in league with considering the potential impact on their power and influence, for one they can't implement policies that greatly boost their economy if it comes at the risk of diluting power and harming their grip on it, because once their hand slips the entire hierarchy could begin to slowly rot from the bottom up. This is extremely limiting.\n\nEven if they were quite literally running the country as a company would, having decisions come into effect the moment they are made, then it is a company walking on some uniquely brittle egg shells.\n\nJust so, I think it's far more complicated than simply \"making a few phone calls\", those 8 people might make the decision but to make everyone listen to it requires more convincing (such as the fear of opposing them) than simply requesting it, and it's the convincing part that imo is likely absorbing much more time and effort that is not going into the development of the nation but the maintenance of their power, despite **having** the near absolute power needed to make it happen today.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "no argument - I'm not saying the Chinese leadership are running \"smoothly\" .. thought you could claim they run much smoother than US Democracy.. which is 90% hot air and shoving yourself in front of the media.. without much content.. thats how Democracy works it seems\n\nmost \"average chinese citizens\" dont have any intention of \"dissapearing\" or doing anything that would put them close to that position WTF BOTHER?  - They dont want to go there any more than the average US citizen wants to do stuff  to wreck their own lives - some do, but most prefer to have a nice car a nice job, a nice flat and watch the crazies getting taken away on TV  (or just vanish).. it's 100% not their problem any more than it is to an average American family.

Soon, all of the credit in China,will dry up too. Beijing is trying to punish investors across the globe. When that happens markets there will freeze up, the realestate is 30% GDP, as Beijing dumps money into its failing business. Liquid will be used up and there will be a credit crunch there.

The Western leaders should have learned from Communist/socialist regime in Russia, which used to be USSR empire. What Stalin and Lenin did in Russia and ow they did it? They confiscate all private businesses to establish its empire called Soviet Union and distribute the confiscated private sector to finance their military projects. This is dumb to think Socialism  and Capitalism can coexist in same society. If Chinese leadership believes  Communism is only valid social norm and the future of the world is destined to be eventually a single Socialism and Communism community order and the private ownership of businesses would they ever how do you allow private sectors to stay private for ever?

These loans then are eliminating competition in the marketplace for education to be affordable and higher quality.\n\nI generally agree that saddling students with debt is bad. But the reason that's happening is they make education more expensive, encourage them to lend the money, make it impossible to get away from the loan.  \nIf education was affordable they wouldn't need the loan and they wouldn't get the degree unless it was a financially sound decision. They would also have the ability to easily pay for it and also get a better education in a field that is profitable.\n\nThe lenders would have make sound decisions on who to loan and for what. The universities would have to compete for better quality and price. The people would have to work (a reasonable amount) to pay a reasonable price.
