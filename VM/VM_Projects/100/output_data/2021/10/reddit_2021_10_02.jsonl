{"title": "Tesla delivers 241,300 cars in Q3 2021", "selftext": "Tesla has bucked the wider trend of declining sales brought on by the global chip shortage in the third quarter this year, as it sold 241,300 cars \u2014 a total of 102,000 more vehicles than the same quarter last year. It\u2019s the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company [sold 367,500 in all of 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales)).\n\nThe company managed to deliver more vehicles once again despite the fact that major automakers saw huge drops this past quarter. General Motors, the largest automaker in the US, said [Friday morning](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/10/01/gm-sales-chip-shortage-suv/5934699001/) that it only sold 446,997 vehicles in the third quarter \u2014 a 33 percent drop from the same period last year.\n\nTesla has avoided similar problems in part because it has been [sourcing different semiconductors and rewriting software on the fly](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk) to make those chips work in place of the ones not currently available. Beyond that, the company continues to see strong sales in China, where it started making and selling vehicles in early 2020. The Model Y SUV has also become a popular option in the United States, and Tesla [just started selling them in Europe, too](https://electrek.co/2021/08/23/tesla-tsla-starts-model-y-deliveries-europe/).\n\nEdit: If Tesla increases production by another 73% by Q3 2022 they will be producing 416,000 vehicles a quarter. If GM sells only 6.5% less vehicles Q3 of next year than Tesla and GM will have the same production numbers. Something to keep in mind. \n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22704830/tesla-sold-241300-cars-third-quarter](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22704830/tesla-sold-241300-cars-third-quarter)", "id": "pzzf53", "created_utc": 1633195416.0, "score": 1228, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 604, "comments": [{"body": "In other words even without any further increase in deliveries Q4 they'll have increased deliveries by almost 75% in 2021.", "score": 478, "replies": [{"body": "That's fucking wild.

They confidently control a large section of their whole iceberg. Adapting firmware to help them deal with chip supply issues is one tiny example. But more importantly, when a new technology is being developed (such as EV), being able to navigate the uncertainties is important, so vertical integration is superior.\n\nCan GM and Ford prevail? Of course, but they are structurally not set up for the task. And this is just one dimension. Don't get me started on culture differences, stranded assets, competing against Silicon Valley electronics and software talent, union and dealer constraints, supply chain inertia, and a million other things.

It will take a long time for legacy automakers to get Tesla-level OTA updates working. To be clear I'm not saying vertical integration or outsourcing is better. They both have pros and cons. But for new tech, vertical integration is better.\n\nIt's generally true that as a company becomes more established, it will acquire inertia. But this is still very early days.

As Joby has demonstrated, prototype vehicles with reasonable specs can be built and have decent range, noise profile, and passenger carrying capacity. Obviously range would be better if battery density can be improved. But where a lot of the real challenges lie is in building out the network. You need a network of landing spots in urban environments and thus there are network effects, you need to recondition society to adopt this new mode of transport into their everyday lives, you need to solve the first/last mile problems, etc. Tesla might have some advantages here soon. Perhaps supercharger locations could be landing sites. Perhaps first/last mile can be solved by autonomous Tesla\u2019s. That said, I think if Tesla gets true autonomy working then VTOL is less valuable as a business. If you can be productive in your car doing something else when it\u2019s driving you, does it matter if it takes you 2x-3x longer to get somewhere?

It's that they know how to do what they've always done, but that's not going to cut it anymore. They are really behind in the two biggest areas with EVs, batteries and software. And, they have to deal with so many things that an EV-only company doesn't, like sharing profit with dealers, cannibalizing ICE sales while trying to grow EV sales, and figuring out how to profitably convert legacy factories and legacy workers to the new technology. Also, they have to spend billions on advertising and Tesla doesn't spend a cent.\n\n>none thought about using casting machines to eliminate 1/3 of the assembly process?\n\nSandy Munroe talks extensively about why they haven't and won't follow Tesla's lead with the casting machines. One of the main reasons is that these are so expensive that they only make sense financially when you are planning to make millions of the same car model. Look at how many different car models GM has, for example. Then look at Tesla with only 4 models, and currently only one (model Y) is using the mega casting machines. \n\nAnother reason is that it's not easy to get the casting machines to work for this purpose. Tesla had to invent an entirely new material for this. Not saying nobody else can do it, but that will be a huge challenge if they try.\n\n>And now, people tell me that only Tesla know how to build cars? I just don't believe it\n\nNo, I'm not actually hearing that from anyone.

But the issue here is scale of production.  There are over 100,000 domestic pickup trucks that have been produced but waiting on components to be completed.  Your production inventory runs out a Hell of a lot faster when you're producing millions of vehicles vs a couple hundred thousand.  Tesla simply hasn't run into many major supply issues yet because they had enough inventory on hand prior to the shortages to keep them going, but only for so long.  All reports are indicating that there is about to be another major disruption in the supply chain soon.  This is far from over.  Supply chain problems rarely have an immediate effect.  The problems generally come weeks or months after the initial disruption, when on hand supply is finally exhausted.  Unfortunately in a country/economy like ours that emphasizes maximum efficiency/profit over common sense preparedness, we rely too heavily on on-demand production methods, and therefore we are very ill prepared for any kind of shortage.  Cars are a great example.  The parts don't show up at the factory until the car is already rolling down the assembly line.  So if the car gets to a station on the line, but the part isn't available, it just keeps rolling down the line and has to be completed at a later date.  Hence all the pickup trucks waiting for chips.  And don't forget the massive costs involved in storing, maintaining, then reconditioning/repairing the vehicles before sale.

We all know in order to combat climate change we have to cut down ICE emissions to almost nothing, and many countries around the world are banning ICE sales indefinitely. We all know Tesla isn't just an auto company either, and plans to have their auto revenue be only half (possibly less) of total revenue. GM is going to lose millions and millions from cutting off their ICE baggage. \n\nSo basically, Tesla is winning this race by a long shot in the long run \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Anyone not seeing this is either blind, stupid, or regrets not holding Tesla shares. \n\n\nThese are the same people who refused to buy Tesla over summer at $500.

In a conventional motor, GM has to have specific chips that can withstand the vibrations coming from an engine. Electric car chips do not need this. On top of this, every Tesla chip (most of them) were designed in house using modern technologies and change year over year, and as a result have specific fabrications for them.\n\nGM is using chips designed in 1999. Intel and other chip manufacturers are pushing back on GM and other OEM's because they want them to build new tooling lines to help meet the demand of chips that are antiquated. Intel and others are telling them they will get the chips from the existing tooling from 1999, but will not invest in building assembly lines of ancient semiconductors.\n\nInstead Intel has pointed at any one of a hundred other chips that could take their place with modern architecture techniques, GM and other OEM's are hesitant to accept these knew chips because they will be expensive to certify and guarantee function in every type of environment for the length of a reasonable warranty.\n\nSo while Tesla is still suffering from chip shortages, it's nowhere near as bad as GM because of the type of chip used. If Tesla had sold 1,000,000 cars instead of 250k, then they would have met that demand because Intel and their fabrication partners have no problem opening up a new assembly line for their modern tooling needs.\n\nSo, even though there is a chip shortage", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "intc"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Was all GM vehicles EV?

Let me put it more directly since you don't seem to have basic reading comprehension skills:\n\nA decade and a half ago, the primary (and really only) purpose of a phone was making calls and sending texts. Then the smartphone revolution computerised the shit out of them, to the point now where some people's phones are more powerful than their laptops. We now live in a world where saying \"the primary purpose of a phone is to make phone calls\" sounds like something a delusional person might say (even though, let's be clear, it's 100% true -- both they and their networks are designed with phone call reliability as their primary purpose).\n\nThe same thing is happening to cars now -- cars are, more and more, just computers on wheels rather than complex gearboxes with computers as add-ons/utility, and that's especially evident in EVs, where the car is a couple motors, a giant fucking battery, and a computer to control the whole thing.\n\n>And the issue with watching Netflix on your Tesla is that it comes from the massive screen right in the driver's screen, not some pop out like in minivans. It's more distraction for the driver than it is entertainment for the people way in the back.\n\nRight, and as we all know, designs for automobiles are static. Minivans always had pop out displays, but for the longest time they were non-functional until someone recently realised, \"hey we can use those non-functional displays we've had for 30 years to play movies and shit! What an idea!\"\n\nAnd there definitely isn't [a redesigned Model S with a screen in just the back that can operate independently of the giant one in the front](https://www.tesla.com/models). No sirree, Tesla cars will always be the same, unchanging design.\n\n>Who, by the way, will have tablets or phones or some shit.\n\nYou're a genius! Why does Tesla even bother putting Netflix and Spotify in their cars to begin with when everyone has devices that can already play them! Why does any minivan manufacturer bother to continue putting those pop out displays in? Clearly they're all useless. \n\nAnd why the fuck do people watch things on a television, on a couch, together? They all have laptops or phones to stream on! And why do they go to movie theaters when they can watch movies at home?\n\nThese last two sections were sarcasm, by the way, which I have to clarify since at this point your basic reading comprehension is in question. \n\n>And that's an terrible analogy unless you plan on never using Spotify outside your car.\n\nNo one said this will replace your Spotify subscription on your phone.

More than anything this shows how Tesla\u2019s centralized compute stack, Technology talent/prowess, and vertical integration allows for some flexibility in the supply chain that the legacy OEMs can\u2019t. GM and Ford make like 10m units each with a market cap that is about the same as Rivian and Lucid combined. I\u2019m sorry, but that doesn\u2019t make any sense. If the global auto market cap is like 1.25T roughly you have - 70% of that as Tesla (OK), 6% Toyota/VW each, GM/F 5% and 4% roughly and the other 3% everyone else. That doesn\u2019t make sense. Not all of these upstarts are going to make it. You basically can\u2019t make a mistake when a company is so capital intensive to start. The legacy makers have to pivot, which is expensive, but they do have know-how, they have profitable models to fund the transition, and I\u2019m sorry to break it to you but they also have a ton of brand equity. You ever talk to a Jeep, F150, or 4Runner owner? There are certain people that will just won\u2019t get a Tesla.

You have a 3 million unit deficit on lots supporting prices, EV/ICE product cycles driving early upgrades, more disciplined approach to inventory and build to order, structurally higher demand due to aversion to public transport and support of some of the de urbanization that occurred during COVID. All of those support both used and new prices, and digital transitions will lead to more recurring revenue over time. Ford trades at 5x forward earnings because they were massively profitable last year. Usually when a stock is that \u201ccheap\u201d it means that earnings estimates need to come down. Due to commodity and freight pressures and chip shortages, they might need to come down a bit, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that like GM, they didn\u2019t. Average ASP in August was over $50k, and then as things normalize, it going to be off to the races and the multiple needs to re rate higher to reflect a higher terminal value and permanently higher profits.

The reason is the complexity of the engine. IC's have sensors that convert their signals to a CAN network. These all require processing. This includes sensors that electric vehicles do not have such as: Engine oil pressure, transmission oil pressure, engine temp, coolant temp, transmission temp, O2, oil filter dif Pressure, crank shaft position, high/low oil and coolant sensors, fuel level, plus many more. \n\nElectric vehicles, if they are like the ones I have had experience making, have chips in each battery but for teslas case may be just one Battery Monitoring Unit(BMU) with hundreds of IO for each cell.
