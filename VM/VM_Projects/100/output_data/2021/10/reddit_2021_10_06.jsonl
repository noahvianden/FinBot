{"title": "Largest Economic Collapse in History?", "selftext": "The world economy is at the start of the largest crash in history. Inflation, energy crisis, supply chain crisis, shipping crisis, inflammatory markets, Evergrande and Fantasia financial crisis, Home and rent price spikes, Covid-19 retaliation, Afghanistan hostile takeover, US Debt ceiling, Increase in US bonds, and most importantly\u2026 China expressing interest in taking Taiwan.\n \nLet\u2019s focus on the Inevitable\n1.       Inflation will be impossible to get away from with the amount our budget has been cooked, we will also have to see at minimum a 0.6% increase to interest rates to allow enough time to find a solution to the issue and there is not a true solution.\n2.       The global energy crisis has no easy way to fix with shipping backups and fuel shortages, basically a shit show situation\u2026\n3.       Supply chain will be murdered by both #1 & #2 but with an added extra of poor wages and no way to increase the wages because of decreased margins from the company they work in. We already see this in any sector that has seen raw material price increases. Someone has to take the hit, The manufacturer, Distributor, or the retailer. Usually it is trickled down and divided amongst the 3. But In this case, I see it being mostly one sided on retailers and the 2nd largest load as production cannot maintain at a loss.\n4.       The markets are priced in for a consistent increase in production overtime, we seen a glimpse of a drop at the start of lockdowns and after Powell made his magic happen and we see a recovery, the over paying for shares in hopes of consistent growth began again. TSLA is an amazing example. NIO would be the ultimate example\n5.       Evergrande and Fantasia, either liquidate assets and cause a mini crash in whatever market the assets belong, or face a Chinese market crash that would reverberate to the US from the large investments some US companies have with them.\n6.       Property Prices are uncontrollable do to ridiculous interest rates, material shortages, and increase in consumer pressure. It is beyond unsustainable. With no market crash and a stock piles of 6 months\u2019 worth of properties, I would expect a 10% drop over the span of 6 months.\n7.       Debt Ceiling is just an indicator that things are actually moving south, and moving south rapidly\u2026\n8.       The Taliban taking Afghanistan is more important than people are realizing it is positioned between Iran and Pakistan and allows for a crucial Military positioning, Oil Transportation, And general policing of upcoming threats Ex. Taliban\u2026.\n9.       Tensions have increased between China and Taiwan, a US official went to talk to Chinese official about it, Chinese official told the US official, \u201cIt is none of your business, and if the US tries to step in there will be problems for everyone\u201d. Of course I\u2019m paraphrasing, but it is the truth. If China takes over Taiwan the entire US economy would be decimated. The main reason being Silicon, and chip production. TSMC is the #1 producer of chips in the world, China would control technology. The reason are market is so high\u2026 Tech stocks. I believe if there is anything that becomes hostile between these two countries we will see a World War, because modern countries would have no choice, as you cannot let China Monopolize Silicon. We would be looking at an actual world economic collapse. And on top of it China would become the most powerful and influential country overnight.\n \nThe Fact we have all this data in front of us and it is not reflected in the US markets is astonishing, Every US media outlet was COMPLETELY BULLISH\u2026 Every non-US media outlet was EXTREMELY BEARISH.\n \nWhy that is, I have no idea\u2026 Propping up the Market in hopes of limiting chaos and extreme fears? Maybe.\n \nI did not add news articles, because I want everyone to do their own research on the topic that they find most interesting, try to use multiple news sites and International sites as well. I hope this resonates with someone. All types of comments are welcome, tell me I am wrong, but please explain why.

Its relationship with government ensures its longevity.\n\nPLTR is just starting its foray into the private/commercial sector.\n\nIf a company is good enough to protect American lives and Uncle Sam's interest's , it projects a level of security , trustworthiness and safety  that they will be able to leverage in the private sector.\n\nLastly, considering AMD exists in the hardware ecosystem, growth will always be dependent on externalities such as supply chain issues ( currently on full display ) and commodity availability etc.\n\nPLTR doesnt require external inputs to sell their products. So exponential growth can be achieved with much less resistance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, thats my pitch. PLTR is my second biggest holding. Its also the one that lets me get the best sleep at night. I truly never worry about it. Max drawdown I figure is about 50% but with everything it has going for it, even in an economic recession, I see it as unlikely.\n\nOnce their SPAC deals and investments start bearing fruit, you're going to see institutions begin to FOMO into the company.

They're competing with NVidia, Amazon, Apple, Msft and now Intel for manufacturing resources. So they might have a better chip, but if they have production bottlenecks, how do they keep growing fast? AMD has to bid against 5 companies are that are many times larger than them to get their chips made, which should be scary to investors. People think Intel is going down because Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are making their own chips, but nobody is thinking this will affect AMD for some reason... Where exactly do people think these chips are coming from during a global shortage expected to last through 2022?\n\nAMD is far better priced than PLTR (AMD is fairly priced now), but they have strong global competitors and a fickle market that will flock back to Intel in 2 years if they offer a performance advantage. The good news for them is a couple more years of supply shortages and intense future demand for processors", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc", "amzn", "msft", "nvda", "amd", "ibm", "msft", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "VS NVDA vs ASX??

Because of that, I go well OTM where I see no chance of stock going till expiration.\n\nFor these reasons I've been going with a single sold put at a time, weeklies for the past few weeks, mostly 690-700 strike. Still very profitable for me ($500-1000 gain a week), and I can be pretty sure stock isn't gonna melt down 80-100 bucks within a week.\n\nBut because of the limit of one put at a time, and because all puts use the same amount of margin mnt. (10-14k on IBKR) regardless of expiration date, I'm now seriously considering going with just one OTM LEAP put instead, something like 700p or even 650p 2024 January... the reason for the low strike is to never be assigned - but of course huge trade off in the premium received compared to something like 1000p.\n\n1. Do you think this is too risky with this amount of margin, better stick to weeklies?\n\n2. Or should I go for higher strike because no-one is going to exercise these anyways?\n\nWhen we are after a rally I will definitely get rid of some of my margin, probably get closer to no margin at all, and then I'll have more options to sell more puts.

The market will move with interest rates on a fairly short time frame.  Following the dot com crash, we hit 5.25% in '06 before triggering the '08 crash but only made it to 2.4% in '19 before triggering a minor correction at which point the Fed reversed course.  And if anything the markets are more reliant on Fed liquidity than ever before so we know that a correction occurs before rates hit 2.4%, I'd guess closer to 1%.\n\nBut when a tightening cycle begins and reaches that point is only the first and most basic question you'd need answered.  How much tightening will we have?  How long will tightening last? **If/when the market corrects will the Fed reverse course?** And how quickly would this reversal happen?  Will they be more preemptive like in '19 when they reversed course before a crash?\n\nThis is why over the past decade or so the Fed has to be so careful about how they signal future actions.  People are trading on that immediately.  That's why the narratives shift from dovish to less dovish to \"maybe some day we'll be hawkish\" to we'll do this tiny little microscopic rate increase really really far out in the future.
