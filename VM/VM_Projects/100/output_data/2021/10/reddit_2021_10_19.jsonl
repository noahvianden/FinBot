These next-generation modulators will replace today\u2019s modulators that are made with expensive inorganic materials that no longer are able to scale up in speed and efficiency and consume massive amounts of power. LWLG polymer enabled modulators are 3x faster than today\u2019s technology and require less than half the power to operate. In fact, these modulators are so \u201clow power\u201d that they eliminate the need for a driver on a chip which is an expensive and power hungry component.\n\nModulators are the backbone of the Internet whereby they are the primary active component within transceivers that switches the 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s of data via light.\n\nWhile the stock has increased significantly during 2021, it is anticipated that another massive run will occur within 12 months as their commercialization partners are made public and the technology becomes available to purchase. For several years, LWLG has been working with numerous Tier 1 companies under NDA and have a packaging partner who has assisted in developing their product based on their customer input. Earlier this year in May at the company\u2019s annual shareholders meeting, LWLG finally revealed their commercialization plan which brought on new investor interest. \n\nLWLG\u2019s proprietary polymer modulators will be integrated into silicon photonics foundries\u2019 \u201cmenu\u201d of options for chipmakers. It will be a natural and easy choice for transceiver makers to choose the fastest and most efficient modulator available. \n\nModulators are not only found in data center interconnects and transceivers, but also they are found in any device that processes data with light such as LIDAR for cars and medical sensing devices. Without a question, the addressable market is in the billions of dollars annually. \n\nToday data centers consume likely 5% of the world\u2019s electricity. The value of drastically reducing the energy cost via LWLG enabled modulators is quite valuable in itself. \n\nThe CEO of the company, Dr. Michael Lebby, is one of the top minds and visionaries in the field of Photonics.

As you may already know, though, LWLG has not provided public revenue guidance yet but they maintain internal models. \n\nFor the transceiver modulator business here is my back of the envelope calculations. \n\nSome assumptions that I use are that at the end of 2020, there were approximately 600 hyperscale data enters in the world with almost half operated by Microsoft, Google, or Amazon. Note that there are nearly 3 million small to mid size data centers in the US alone. For the sake of easy calculations and to be \u201cconservative\u201d I will calculate revenue numbers from hyper scale data centers only. \n\nEach hyper scale data center contains upwards of 100,000 transceivers. The LWLG patents show that there are 4-8 modulators per transceiver. \n\nThat equates to 400,000 to 800,000 modulators per hyper scale data center. The industry goal over the next 5-10 years is to get to $1 per gbps in transmission costs. That\u2019s certainly not the cost now, but to be conservative let\u2019s say a 400 gig transceiver costs $400. \n\nThe big unknown that I cannot answer is cost of the modulators in each transceiver. Let\u2019s estimate in the future 15% of the cost of a transceiver is modulators. That equals $60 per transceiver. I\u2019d say this is conservative, too, since these high performance modulators should be the key value piece in future high performing transceivers. \n\nThat\u2019s $6 million worth of modulators per hyper scale data center. $3,600,000,000.00 worth of modulators to supply ONLY the hyper scale data centers.\n\nAnother question is how often these transceivers are replaced? What is the recurring revenue possibility? \n\nOf course they won\u2019t get to immediate 100% market share, but this just goes to show how big these numbers can get. FOR BOTH LWLG AND POET. \n\nAgain\u2026when chipmakers are given the choice of what modulator to use, it should be an easy and natural choice to choose the fastest and most efficient modulator available (Lightwave\u2019s).\n\nLWLG\u2019s margins should be high compared to industry due to the capital light model of contact manufacturing and technology transfer/licensing. \n\nIn any case\u2026I\u2019d bet my stake that the company will be bought out WELL before any of the above happening.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, this is the kinds of info that helps ppl compare the 2.
