If there isn't much support under the current support line I will often avoid selling CSPs on that stock as I could get burned badly if it drops below that support. If I really want a position then I will dollar average in around that support level if I believe it is going up.\n\nOtherwise I will look to play Call options around it, go just OTM and if it increases and my call option becomes ITM, then I will sell and re-buy OTM calls.\n\nWhen do I dollar-cost average in? Well this often comes down to when I am unable to CSP or that there is not a nearby strike/date applicable, for example PROG was trading at ~0.7 approximately 2 weeks ago, I wanted to get into it and I wanted in straight away, so I bought a large position, I could not have done this through puts as the next strike and date were way away from when I wanted it.\n\nSorry for the long answer, I just felt it needed a relatively detailed answer. This is just my method of entry, it is not fool-proof and it is probably not the best; hopefully someone will come along and improve it and help/educate both of us.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like you and I trade rather similarly. Your example of TELL is akin to my BKSY position. I sold a $12.50p when the merger was going through because IV was elevated well past what would be realized, so I snagged shares at a cost basis below $10 via the put assignment and sold a couple calls before the price fell back down to $10. Yesterday, I sold a $10p as I wouldn't mind assignment but don't necessarily expect it (it's an ex-SPAC with most earnings in the future so who knows), but today I closed my CC that was opened maybe a week ago? So essentially a covered strangle, but that particular position was entered via short put assignment because high IV on a ticker I liked presented an opportunity. LILM same thing, but buying the dip would've been better here (I obviously can't predict volatile price action).\n\nFor the case of a stock I wanted to own totally irrespective of the income I could generate, I bought as many shares of PLTR as I could afford back in 1H21 and then proceeded to sell CCs as it was uptrending (more like bouncing around). 1H21 was rough for PLTR, so I was buying to close pretty often. No complaints from me as IV wasn't dead until after Q1 ER, and at the time I had a LEAPS for PMCCs (now I just have more shares for the margin but might snag a 2024 contract at these levels). I had more recently bought 100 shares of AMC strictly for selling options, similar to your GME PMCCs, but I didn't even attempt to sell a put to enter that one. Just a buy-write. Today I closed my AMC position entirely and bought 120 shares of ZIM as I actually like the stock and it's come off it's highs rather convincingly (also AMC doesn't give you any margin with TDA; you can tell I embrace risk and am not rich). With those type of holdings, premium income goes back into shares or butterfly hedges/bets and more recently low-key gambling with long calls (reasonable deltas, strikes, and DTE; not FDs). I also just hold shares like in the case of UUUU and SPIR (guh) where premiums generally aren't worth the risk; pennies in front of a steamroller. RKLB has been having good premium though.\n\nI haven't traded a PMCC for a few months now, but just today I bought a long combo (synthetic long shares) on SOFI. I can now sell PMCCs from the long call within that spread with a BE near market price rather than like 5+ strikes up and low delta, and I can short puts for additional income and leverage (if I start to really like the position, I'd probably buy 100 shares first). My plan for that position is basically the same as usual for a shares position which is short a put at support and accept assignment if it moves against me (no unknown tickers), write calls at resistance, and buying to close/rolling if the short call moves decisively against me because PMCC (I usually defend my shares but not always). Once assigned on a put, I'd look to exit my long call position in favor of shares (for margin for options on said position) unless I become increasingly bullish through more DD (opportunity doesn't always wait for fundamental analysis in my portfolio, unfortunately/fortunately, but I don't keep unknown tickers in my watchlist for long) in which case I would just leave the call there and build a shares position via premium/put assignment.\n\nCCs are an ever-present thing in my portfolio as well as a butterfly hedge on PLTR (largest single position), and I also trade butterflies of all kinds, credit and sometimes debit spreads, time spreads, and ratios.
