Should I try to roll my puts or average down or should I try to catch it as it falls?\n\nTerminology. You started by asking about short positions, then talked about (presumably long) puts. A put is not a short. It's a *bearish directional play*, and so is shorting shares, but that doesn't mean a put is a short, any more than a call is a deed to some real estate, even though they both want the price of the underlying to go up.\n\nThe old phrase \"stairs up, elevator down\" is relevant here. Declines tend to be sharper and shorter in duration than rises. That means that timing is that much harder to get right on bearish plays. So you need to use strategies that spread out your risk of getting the timing wrong. Rolling puts on some schedule is one way to do that. Shorting shares is another (no expiration, so you can basically hold indefinitely, as long as you have the buying power to avoid a margin call).\n\nIf you decide to roll puts, you need to define an upper limit on either the total holding time, the total capital outlay, or both. Say you think the correction will happen within 30 days. You do a weekly put that is 2 weeks out and roll at the end of each week. So for example this Monday you might open the Nov 5 and then roll out to Nov 12 on Oct 29. But you only do that through Dec 3 or something like that. Or, alternatively, you give up after you've spent $X on puts that did not pay off.\n\nIf you are completely unsure about when the event will happen, it's best to just short shares and avoid expiration timing altogether.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.693140983581543}, {"body": "One method is a ratio spread.  \n\nSell a put at the money, buy two puts out of the money, located where the net will be a modest credit, say 0.50.   \n\nFor a 60 to 90 day period.  \n\nThis works best for low implied volatility envirionments.  \n\nExit **before** the mid-point of the term to expiration  \n (30 days, or 45 days for the two examples)   \n to avoid the pool of loss on modest down moves.  \n \nThis is for big moves down. \n\n\nExample with SPY  \nLINK:  http://opcalc.com/ClS    \n \nBuy 21 Jan 2022  $420.00 Put\t2 --\t$6.44\t  \nSell 21 Jan 2022  $452.00 Put\t1  -- $13.99\t \nNET\tCREDIT  $1.11  \n\nCollateral of  $3200 required. \n\n---  \n\nAnother method is a calendar spread.  \nYou could put out a fleet of these, expiring monthly.  \n\n\n\nHere a DIAGONAL Calendar  PUT Spread   \nIntending to reduce the cost, with the short higher than the long.   \n\n**RISK** if the stock goes rapidly down, and if it goes below the LONG PUT.\n\nExample with SPY  \nLINK:  \nhttp://opcalc.com/ClW     \n \nSPY Diagonal Calendar\nBuy 17 Dec $420.00 Put\t1\t$3.67\t \nSell 3 Dec $430.00 Put\t1\t$3.31\t \nTotal\t$0.36  Debit  \n\n$1000 collateral required.  \n\nYou could enter with two separated calendar spread to capture modest moves down. \n\nHere that might be   \nDec 17 $425 2x Long put // Dec 3  2x $430 short  put   \nDec 17 435 1xlong put // Dec 3 $440 1x short put.  \n\n\n\n---", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3630504906177521}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31286847591400146}, {"body": "I\u2019ve noticed with my broker, that when I\u2019m selling puts and I have cash, it\u2019s automatically made as a CSP.

Powerful forces did not want EVs to happen. Elon is protecting the New at VW by attending their meeting, opening up the supercharger network, and who knows what else.\n\nIt's fun to mock Toyota et al for burying their head in the sand, but I still hope Tesla's success can get them to snap out it and get on board. Toyota could make great EVs and lots of them if they would just try. Such a shame for such a great organization to die rather than pivot. \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "fo ril", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14561113715171814}, {"body": "I'm glad YOU like it \ud83d\ude06", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18125362694263458}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.054513271898031235}, {"body": "Zootopia \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20679640769958496}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|Uno27COfoYlH2)\n\nLegacy Auto: No. Just wanna cause it.

The South Korean show, about indebted people in a deadly contest for a cash prize,\u00a0generated $891.1 million in impact value, a\u00a0metric the company uses to assess the performance from individual shows. The show cost just $21.4 million to produce -- about $2.4 million an episode.
