For a century, studios have had to actually be very, very careful about what they spend and what they approve.  A studio could handle one flop, but two in a row could put them in mortal jeopardy.  For tv, they'd inch forward with a treatment, then a test, maybe a pilot, see how it goes, maybe 4 episodes, inch by inch because the actual business model needs to run carefully.\n\nAlong comes Netflix with zero idea of how to run a studio and billions of dollars of other people's money and and limitless credit card.  They just approve everything, sight unseen.  Do they do it carefully, sensibly?  Nope.  Everything approved, no oversight, and as for price, let's pay 3 times the industry, no wait, let's do 4x.  How about 5x, it's not our money!  For content creators it was winning the life lottery.  More pay in one project than they'd made their whole career.  Wheeeee!  What's the concept?  Here's a one pager.  When the deadline?  Doesn't matter!  \n\nIt's a financially sucidal way to run a studio.  And it's why Netflix has fifty years of long term debt they don't mention and that the fanboys never read about.  And it's their foolish content mega-inflation that set the crazy prices for their much, much, much richer competitors to come along and pay.  Apple has enough money to run TV+ at a loss for 200 years if they wanted.  Amazon, ditto.  And Google.  Disney/ABC is a bit tighter, but they still are the Logan to Netflix's Greg-ory.\n\nCOVID saved Netflix's bacon.  They were looking at a financial abyss.  They lose customer engagement with each body blow.  Lost Disney. Lost Marvel.  Lost Star Wars.  Lost Friends.  Lost The Office.  \n\nCertainly they have produced some hits, but not efficiently.  They're like a guy buying 2000 scratchers.  Of course he got some winners, but it's not sustainable or financially sane.  Fanboys who don't know how to read financials say a misleading headline about \"operational\" profit.  And all they saw was the word profit.  They don't know how weasel words work or how fudge factor accounting happens.  Netflix neglects to mention their debt.  Hey, if you don't pay your credit card or mortgage payments, you'd have a nice looking \"operational\" profit too.  \n\nAs mentioned, COVID may have saved their life.  It stemmed the tide of churn, helped engagement and helped socialize price hikes.  \n\nThe year before COVID, netflix had to abandon price hike plans.  They'd tested them in certain markets to see how growth might slow.  To their horror, growth didn't just slow, it went in reverse.  They were not just along, they were losing customers by the minute.  They realized they'd hit peak pricing and customers were actively cancelling. \n\nYes COVID spared them from that, and secondary issuance will let them throw another half billion on the credit card for the new replacement background noise program Seinfeld.  But the debt isn't going away.  The competitors aren't going away.  The overpriced content market they created isn't going away.  \n\nNetflix will need to do more to survive long term.  The fattest calf to look at is their studio.  They need to start running it as the laws of gravity and finance are back in force.  They need to rationalize their spending much more than they have, and quit funding five flops for every hit.  After Squid Game's success, Apple and Amazon can just buy up every foreign niche title just to keep it out of Netflix's hands.
