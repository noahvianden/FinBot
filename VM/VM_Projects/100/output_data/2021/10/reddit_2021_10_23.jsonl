Personally, I would focus on two things with Tesla: automotive and FSD.\n\n**Automotive**\n\nFor automotive, I would go the traditional route and look at revenue, earnings and a PE value. If you annualize Q3, Tesla is at a PE of 190. In 2021 and 2022 I expect them to grow around 80% in unit sales, revenue by 70%. In terms of net income, I expect 1,100% in 2021 and at least another 100% in 2022. If this indeed happens, they'd be at a trailing PE of 52 by the end of 2022, which makes them a screaming buy in my eyes.\n\nBut perhaps your numbers are different, so do your own projections and make your own thesis.\n\n**FSD**\n\nFor FSD, I would go through the following metrics to create your own projection:\n\n* How many cars will they sell roughly each year throughout this decade?\n* Add those together, add 1 million cars that are already sold, and multiple that by .9 to get total cars on the road in 2030 (roughly 5-10% of cars will be taken out of commission before then).\n* Estimate the FSD subscription cost per month in 2030. Currently it's $200, Elon has already said FSD price will increase significantly in the future, supposedly this goes for both subscription and full purchases.\n* Estimate the FSD take rate. Currently it's around 10% in the US, where it works best. Obviously this will go up significantly if your car could fully drive itself and earn you money by serving as a robotaxi.\n* Multiply total vehicles on the road by FSD take rate and multiple that by monthly subscription price to get revenue per month.\n* Multiply that by 12 to get FSD revenue per year.\n* Estimate the expected margin percentage. This is a software service, so probably somewhere between 70 and 90%.\n* Multiply yearly FSD revenue by the margin percentage to get the operating income.\n* Multiply that by 0.8 to get a rough estimation of Net Income per year.\n* Estimate what you think Tesla's PE ratio will be by 2030. Lower than 20 is unrealistic, higher than 90 probably is too.\n* Multiply the annual net income by the PE multiple to get Tesla's market cap by 2030.\n\nWhen you've done all that, put % on the chance you think Tesla has of solving full autonomy this decade, to determine how likely you think that valuation is to come true. No matter which numbers I use, I believe Tesla is a clear buy if they solve FSD this decade, but perhaps you come to a different conclusion.\n\n**The rest**\n\nFinally, there's everything else... Supercharger revenue, solar/energy sales, energy software revenue (autobidder), AI, HVAC, and any new products/services Tesla is yet to release. All of these are too difficult to project right now in my opinion, and they're just a bonus to Tesla's market cap that could range from a negligible part to a significant part of their business in 10 years' time.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cFSD\u201d\n\nYes", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14185380935668945}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "The real question is when it drops back down to $600 range do you buy then.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "No worry, next 69:1 stock split will send tsla under $50", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Yes!

In my view the concern it poses is that ARM will allow more companies to develop their own in house design plus a new  CPU competitors will enter the market. That being said Intel has an enormous amount of advantages over any possible entrant into the CPU space. Lets not forget they've been in this position for the majority of their corporate history. They fought Power PC and won. They competed in against a multitude of x86 vendors which they brutally destroyed like DEC, Cyrix [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_x86\\_manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_x86_manufacturers) the only exception is AMD which itself has almost died multiple times. Had Intel not rested on their laurels AMD would be dead now too and this is coming from someone who loves AMD to death. (I bought AMD @ $4 back in 2014). \n\nNot only does Intel have some of the best CPU designers in the industry their Roadmap is insane. They are planning on marrying together all of their IP CPU, GPU, FPGA's, Memory, Software and all the other random highly competitive stuff intel does. I think Big.Little married with chiplets and AI accelerators will be a game changer. The only other company I see approaching this scale of capability is AMD. I also don't think every single company will have their own inhouse designs, building CPU's is very expensive and complicated. The expertise is limited and you open yourself up to a whole host of complications. Yes it makes sense for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft etc. But the small to medium sized players will still need a common platform if they want to exist. \n\nThe Foundry is a risk yes but I believe Intel has the finances and talent necessary to figure out this problem. Perhaps they could even go license a new node from Samsung similar to Global foundries. Or maybe Intel and Samsung partner up to develop new nodes to take on TSMC. To me its not a crazy though that Intel and Apple might partner up on the manufacturing side either. Apple has tried to be less dependent on TSMC by leveraging Global Foundries but they just could keep up with TSMC. I don't think anyone wants to be in a situation where there is one FAB to rule them all especially with the geopolitical risks. I'm willing to bet that their massive war chest will help them solve this problem. If not they can always pull an AMD and sell the fab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion Intel's problems have been self inflicted by poor management under Brian Krzanich. They got lazy meanwhile and AMD came in and smashed them. Imagine if Intel began doing their plans 10 years ago? What would the market would look like? The missing element is aggressive management hopefully Pat and Intel's $20 Billion in annual profit will be the answer. The downside is large if the fail yes but the upside is also huge. Imagine Intel retuned as a vertically integrated AI powerhouse that brings giant leaps in performance with every new generation. Intel is the only company in the world capable of doing this. People are underestimating Intel just as they underestimated AMD its a complex situation and takes time to play out but if anyone can pull it off its Intel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee Moore's law is dead for more info on the tech\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44zQII9GV4", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Moore\u2019s Law is Dead is known for spreading fake rumors.

We've seen the results of that effort. It remains to be seen if Pat Gelsinger can do the same for Intel. But I do know that Jim Keller, the same engineer who created the team which made Zen moved to Intel and created the team which is working on Royal Core. (Although admittedly he has since left) We are at a major inflection point in regards to AI. High performance semiconductors are going to be more important than ever.

All the fed needs to do is hit some keys and suddenly everyone's money is right back where it was.  That's not at question here.\n\nThe issue is everyone who has investments has basically been pushed into Real Estate and Equities due to fed policy giving incredible gains to those two asset types.  Now, it wasn't really their goal to do this, but it was a side effect of \"saving\" the economy in 2008 and 2020.  \n\nSo that really leaves two paths forward.  One where the fed continues to support those assets - and there are many, many reasons they would want to do this.  And one where the fed does not.  \n\nThe issue is, the fed didn't really mean to support those assets that much, but they didn't see they had any other choice due to the crisis.  In 2008 systemic collapse was a real threat.  Now we're at a point where there is enormous pressure to support these assets simply because no one wants to see them crash.  And that's dangerous because all it does is kick the can down the road and potentially create a bigger problem later.    \n\n\nOn the other hand, if the fed doesn't support those assets at their current high levels, it's very possible they could drop significantly - or slowly.  Especially if rates are raised to combat inflation.  If we saw the S&P drop say 5-10% per year for \\~5ish years what would happen?  Who would hold onto stocks losing 6% a year when they could buy bonds yielding 3%?   Who would buy houses when their prices were declining and they could save money by waiting?  How much house could people even afford if companies are spending less on payroll (remember their stocks are falling so they're in cut costs mode) and rates are double where they are now?   And don't forget, housing can enter a self-reinforcing loop where prices fall, causing people to walk away, causing prices to fall further, causing more people to walk away ect.  \n\n  \nWho knows if this stuff will really happen, but we haven't really had a meaningful crash that the government hasn't stepped in and been as accommodating as possible for in quite some time.  Clearly the fed's plan is to \\*very\\* slowly back off and begin raising rates.  But last time we tried that we had a taper tantrum, so it can only be accomplished \\*very\\* slowly during periods of high growth.

Lets say pre crash a given company's share price is valued in line with analysts growth expectations in a DCF sense. The market crashes, and the share price of the company tanks. However, if you don't believe that the crash will have an overly adverse effect on the future cash flows (for example, if they sell a staple good in which you don't think demand will be greatly effected), then the company may now be undervalued. Alternatively, it may be a company who's future cash flows are adversely affected (eg, a tech stock who's high price relies on future growth that's now hampered), but if you believe the market overreacted (price fell too much), then it may still be a bargain at this new lower price. \n\nAll this is easier said than done of course, otherwise we'd all be billionaires.

I am a big tech guy and I have been following Apple for a while. Their new 5mm architecture for their chips is absolutely insane, first seen with how crazy their M1 chips did last year. Now, with apple announcing the M1 pro and M1 max, both being insanely powerful and battery efficient, I really want to start investing into apple. I believe that they will take over the laptop market in the coming couple of years.\n\nToday, with AAPL being down since their announcement of the chips, is a good idea to invest around $5,000 or $10,000 into AAPL? I am looking to buy as many shares as I can.\n\nEDIT: Wow this post blew up. Anyways, with earning reports coming later this week, anyone know if AAPL \\*historically\\* tanks or skyrockets after the earning reports are released? Would like some sources and may hold off until purchasing shares after they're released. Also considering my age, I will just dump all of the money I have rather than DCAing. Also, very stupid of me to say that Apple owns TSM. But the reason why I don't think it's smart to invest into TSM is because the chip designs are still done by Apple, meaning that Apple is still in control for how well the chips manufactured by TSM and how they perform with  ARM and MacOS software. Hardware performance is dependent on software integration -- the very reason why investing into Apple is more reliable than TSM (though yes both are viable options).", "id": "qec1o4", "created_utc": 1635018426.0, "score": 236, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 281, "comments": [{"body": "I got in on Apple when the shares dipped to like $112.

Part of it is just knowing how to read a company's finances (balance sheet, cash flow statement, income statement) and learn what to look for to see if they're growing, faltering, saving money, growing their debt, etc. I can't explain that all here, but that's what I'd suggest looking up if you want to learn more.\n\nThere are a group of stocks called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) that are considered the gold standard of tech stocks, and the reason being they're they biggest and most reliable companies in that sector. Some people include Microsoft and Tesla in that group, as well as recently nVidia. There's a bit of a \"you can't go wrong\" aura around these stocks if you just want to buy and hold, and with good reason, they've consistently gone up year over year and often outperform the market (The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial, Nasdaq). If you like tech and want safe investments, these are usually the go-tos.\n\nIf you look at any company's price chart, you can see where they are now relative to all time highs, lows, etc. I called out Facebook and Amazon because the two of them are very solid companies that are both down quite a bit from their all time highs. Since, like I said, these companies tend to consistently go up over time, you can bet on the probability that they will continue to rise, and that buying them now while they're a little beaten down would be a good deal to get in at a lower price.\n\nNone of this guarantees you 100% that an investment won't fail, this is just about picking safe choices and learning to understand your odds and what a company's trajectory is. The FAANG+MT stocks are gold medal winning companies because they are the biggest, most reliable, most profitable companies. If you're not a savvy investor and just want to get started, you are probably not going to regret picking up shares in any of these, especially when you look back a few years from now. That doesn't mean you shouldn't learn how to better understand what makes them good investments (again, the financial statements, current news, etc) but you have a better chance of getting a reliable return from these than say a speculative tech stock that may 10x in three months but also has a high probability of going belly up.\n\nHope that helps, happy to chat more if you have other questions.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "nflx", "dow", "nvda", "tsla", "msft", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3486965000629425}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Can't believe people are telling you to invest in like VTI.

With limited funds it makes more sense to bet on the market going up than an individual stock going up at a rate that consistently beats the market. \n\n2) Share Proxies:\nLEAPS allow you to buy into ITM positions that move in tandem with the underlying stock price (more or less) for less than it would cost to buy an equivalent amount of shares outright. Options also have their own inherent value (premium), independent of the underlying stock that acts as additional ballast against day to day chop in a stock price, and acts as additional momentum to a stock\u2019s upward movement over time. Positioning is key and lower volume has to be considered, but with Apple volume is not really a problem and Delta should be easy to account for. \n\n3) Individual Shares:\nIndividual shares of an individual stock of that size (market cap), in that sector, in an economic environment like the one we\u2019re moving into, is a good way to get a new-entry price that trades sideways to slightly down for a good while (so doesn\u2019t beat the market overall).  \n\n\n**TL;DR** - Of the three options, individual shares have the least number of profit drivers moving them forward.

{"title": "CNN: Tesla fans cry foul as Biden administration moves toward Autopilot regulations", "selftext": "", "id": "qe4yo4", "created_utc": 1634995732.0, "score": 254, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 142, "comments": [{"body": "Tesla fans cry foul as Biden administration moves toward Autopilot regulations \nBy Matt McFarland, CNN Business\n\nWashington, DC (CNN) The question of who will regulate cutting-edge driving technologies appears to be answered.\n\nFor years, the US government hasn't regulated driver-assist systems like Tesla's Autopilot and GM's SuperCruise. Automakers can do as they please because there are no standards for these systems.\nBut President Joe Biden's administration appears to want to change that, with the appointment of Missy Cummings, a Duke University engineering professor who studies autonomous systems and has been critical of Tesla and the federal government's handling of driver-assist systems like Autopilot. Cummings will be a senior advisor for safety at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nGovernment's laissez faire approach to these increasingly common technologies has long led to calls for better safeguards and action in the wake of headline-grabbing deaths. Cummings's appointment is the latest indication of the Biden administration's desire to step in.\nThe government said in June that all automakers must report crashes involving driver-assist systems. It launched an investigation this August into Teslas using Autopilot that rear-ended emergency vehicles. NHTSA has called for proposing a rule for automatic emergency braking, a driver-assist feature.\nCummings's new role triggered a backlash from diehard Tesla fans. A petition circulated by fans called for reviewing her appointment and received more than 21,000 signatures as of Friday morning. The attacks on Cummings have at times been vitriolic, personal and hyperbolic. Cummings has been described as \"the hired gun for the Luddites of mediocrity\" and as someone who wants to destroy Tesla. The automaker's passionate fan base has been criticized in the past as being cultish and intolerant of criticism.\nThe petition from Tesla's fanbase includes a critique of a 2019 tweet from Cummings that said that NHTSA should require Tesla to turn off Autopilot. Cummings's Twitter account shifted to private in the wake of the backlash and then was deleted.\nTesla's fanbase also criticized Cummings for her ties to the Swedish driver-assist company Veoneer. Cummings sits on the company's board of directors.\nNHTSA did not make Cummings available for an interview, but spokesperson Lucia Sanchez told CNN Business that any possible conflict of interest would be resolved before Cummings starts her work at NHTSA.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has joined in the criticism, calling Cummings's track record \"extremely biased\" against Tesla. Cummings responded and said she was \"happy to sit down and talk with you anytime.\" Musk did not detail what he considered biased, and did not respond to a request for comment. (Tesla generally does not engage with the professional news media.) U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg reportedly said Wednesday that Musk should call him if he has any concerns.\n\nFrom pioneering pilot to professor\nIn the 1990s, Cummings became one of the first women to be a fighter pilot in the Navy. She's said in interviews that she later entered academia because she saw the coming tide of autonomous technologies.\nCummings has been called before to testify on Capitol Hill on autonomous driving. She's studied how artificial intelligence will impact the future of warfare, and the challenges of boredom while people use autonomous systems.\nOutside of autonomous driving, Cummings appears to have a favorable view of Tesla. Cummings has said that she has a Tesla jacket she wears proudly, that she loves Tesla and can't stand car dealerships. (Tesla, unlike virtually all other automakers in the United States, doesn't have a traditional, franchised dealership network, but owns its own retail locations)\n\"I want to do everything I can to support Tesla's business model in those aspects,\" Cummings said in an interview earlier this year. \"However, I can no longer be quiet, not as if I ever was, about the problems with Autopilot and 'full self-driving.\"\nShe's said this year that some drivers have died unnecessarily. Cummings has said that Tesla should only let drivers use Autopilot on the roads for which it's been designed. That echoes a recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board, which has investigated multiple deaths of distracted drivers using Tesla's Autopilot system.\nCummings's criticisms of driver-assist technologies are not limited to Tesla. She's said that we should get rid of the phrase \"hands-free.\" General Motors describes its SuperCruise system as \"hands-free\"\n\"Hands free connotes mind-free,\" Cummings said this year. \"This isn't just a Tesla problem. This problem is going to be increasingly in our faces as we start to see more quote unquote hands-free driving from other cars.\"\nCummings has also criticized Tesla for the name it gives its systems. Autonomous vehicle experts and even some of Tesla's own employees have been critical of the naming as well. Cummings has said that there have been fewer egregious crashes elsewhere in the world, where regulators prohibit Tesla from labeling its technology \"Autopilot.\" A German court ruled in 2020 that Tesla was not allowed to advertise its driver-assist technology as \"Autopilot.\"\n\"If you're being told your car has a full self-driving chip and how many of us read the fine print? It's easy to see how people can develop these incorrect mental models about what their car can do,\" Cummings said in an interview this year.\nTesla released its \"full self-driving\" software to about 1,000 people this month. The company has said it plans to release it more broadly soon. Some drivers have raved about its abilities while others have criticized its shortcomings. Drivers have at times had to intervene to prevent crashes or stop the car from running red lights and nearly hitting pedestrians, according to videos published on YouTube that CNN Business reviewed.\nTesla has published crash data since 2018 that shows that there are fewer crashes per mile with Autopilot than without Autopilot, but critics have called this an apples-and-oranges comparison. Autopilot mileage is most likely to come on highways, a type of road that already has fewer crashes per mile. MIT research has shown that Tesla drivers are more likely to be distracted when using Autopilot.", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.

She could be reading training and background materials, getting up to speed.\n\n> but spokesperson Lucia Sanchez told CNN Business that any possible conflict of interest would be resolved\n\nExtremely important for several reasons. Previous discussion and referenced US Code appears to indicate that people with the special type of temporary appointment that Cummings has been selected under are bound by essentially the same ethics requirements as regular federal employees and officials. For regular employees (and apparently also for Cummings), serving as an official in a company that is important participant in the industry (and also receiving pay from them) would be incompatible with working with the agency, especially as an important official. The normal solution would be to require Cummings to resign from the board of the company and to sell her stock.\n\nIt is also certain after the public outcry that Cummings' tweets have come to the attention of the NHTSA ethics officials (and from news items, also to the attention of the Secretary of Transportation). I'm not sure of the rules regarding apparent bias, but at a minimum it will put any future actions she takes at the agency under sharp scrutiny, and could strengthen the case Tesla could make if they believe such future actions are not strictly fair to Tesla - in other words she would have to behave very differently at NHTSA than she was allowed to behave at Duke, potentially limiting her usefulness to TSLAQ. \n\n> would be resolved before Cummings starts her work at NHTSA.\n\nConfirms that Cummings is not yet working actively in her official position.\n\nIn light of the many issues that were brought up in the Change.org petition and elsewhere, I wonder what kind of vetting process was used before her selection. Normally the government would take preliminary steps to insure that the candidate has a reasonable chance of being approved (hopefully without too much controversy), before making an official announcement. Perhaps they decided to skip or minimize the vetting process and take care of it after the announcement, which wouldn't make much sense unless there was a reason to rush things (though the announcement did come out shortly before Tesla's Q3 earnings report). I believe part of the vetting process requires the candidate to fill out and sign a form declaring whether they have any financial or other conflicts of interest - hopefully Cummings would have filled out such a form accurately, though the previous failure to disclose her connections to the Lidar company in her withdrawn research paper is disturbing. Such an omission in a declaration for the vetting process could have legal implications, so again if she submitted a declaration for the vetting process, hopefully she did so accurately and completely.\n\nIf the vetting process was not completed before the announcement, then Cummings may not have been aware when she accepted that she will likely have to give up her prestigious and lucrative position on the board of the Lidar company and sell her stock - if that is the case then she will have to decide whether that's worthwhile for what is limited to a two-year appointment at NHTSA. \n\nIt's encouraging that NHTSA has recognized the need to go through the approval process. If Cummings is approved, then she will have to be far less outspoken in anti-Tesla sentiments than she was allowed to be at her university position, and will have to be careful to show that her actions do not treat Tesla unfairly. A \"tough but fair\" policy would likely not unduly harm Tesla, and would curtail the apparent overt anti-Tesla actions and statements that have been allowed under her university position.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Fuck you Missy Cummings.

You go to the venue and you send them the token and it gets marked as used in the smart contract.  \n\nThe venue can't be defrauded by fake tokens as fake tokens can't be created. You can also now resell your ticket and someone would know they've been sold a valid ticket.

This seems like it might be a politically viable way of a getting at the same basic idea? But it also seems like they're talking about it being a one time tax?? Which seems like a terrible idea because it would force a bunch of billionaires to sell a lot of stock, all at the same time.\n\nAnd doing a little quick math, they're estimating $200 billion to $250 billion in revenues, adding up the wealth of all the billionaires on Forbe's list, I'm making a rough estimate of $2 trillion in wealth for US billionaires. Assume that's mostly unrealized gains, and we're talking about a 10% one time tax on unrealized gains?\n\nThat seems very aggressive to me, and it would probably make more sense to do it as a 1% tax every year for 10 years or something like that, if that's actually the size they're going for. It could also be that this is an \"opening bid\" for negotiations on the size of the tax?\n\nEither way, structuring it more like what's been talked about as a wealth tax seems like a better idea economically, but might be a harder sell politically?

I think defense batteries will have a margin equivalent to cars, given that only Tesla (1) builds domestically and (2) has the scale/expertise to deliver. \n\nAlmost all of this is based on deduction (guesswork lmao), but due to a litany of things (below bulleted list) I believe there is about to be a large, consistent market for batteries in the defense field. I think this will start in earnest by 2025-2027. This shift will be driven by:\n\n* battery cost decreases \n   * Savings. Military budget is likely to be more constrained over the next decade. \n* higher performance (output/cycle life, structural batteries)\n   * ships (replacing or heavily augmenting gas turbines on future surface combatants). I wonder, if we designed and built the Zumwalt (google it) today, would it be using gas turbines? Or instead would it use SMR or basic marine-diesel generators to support a thick battery bank? \n   * submarines (for us--unmanned subs, Virginia SSNs use nuclear, but there will be battery demand rest of world for non-nuclear sub batteries)\n   * light vehicles\n* Cost Savings / Simplicity / Environmentalism\n   * Believe it or not, shifting to electric will have proponents due to these reasons. \n   * If you doubt this, read up on how many people got killed on fuel delivery runs in Afghanistan.  \n* Survivability\n   * Chinese/Russian, and rest of world in the near future, are going to have way better access to precision strike weapons that aren't completely reliant on a robust C4ISR ('battle space awareness') network. [This](https://www.wsp.com/en-US/projects/bagram-30-mw-airfield-power-plant) is what powered Bagram for a long time. The PLA just tested a hypersonic weapon, and bc of this among other reasons, there is a very likely a big convo going on rn about logistic/supply train survivability. \n   * Digging nuclear SMRs very deep with battery storage is the way that we are going to achieve survivability. Gas is too vulnerable and require a supply chain, and solar is too fragile and inconsistent for defense needs. Shifting vehicles, and possibly small surface combatants, to full/partial electric + a survivable energy generation system = major boner at the pentagon. \n* System Needs\n   * Directed Energy, Radar: The need to \"dump\" vast amounts of power in short timespans. It won't make sense to have it completely done by generation capacity alone. \n\nShift your mindset from 2023-2025 with the 4680 to beyond. Batteries are going to continue to specialize. You think the DoD is enjoying the massive cost of natural gas and oil rn? Ha. Advances in precision strike makes our military posture more brittle, and increases the 'first mover advantage' in a U.S.-China scenario. \n\nElon has a very good relationship with the Pentagon by virtue of SpaceX.

Sure, there are a couple weeks where you\u2019re getting used to it but even though a few things are \u201coff\u201d the menu, I now eat a much wider variety of food than I ever did before and enjoy food way more than before. \n\nThe first step is to just veganize or make plant based what you already like. Don\u2019t overthink it. Like tacos? Chances are you like the shell, cilantro, spices, salsa, guacamole, peppers, etc and not necessary the chicken. So replace that and you\u2019ll have 99% of the same flavor and taste experience. Use beans, tofu or things like chipotle\u2019s sofritas. \n\nI also highly recommend the documentary the Game Changers on Netflix. It follows plant based professional athletes and covers some of this. As does their website. \n\nAnd finally, YouTube is an incredible resource. Whatever you\u2019re craving there is a video of someone showing you how to make it plant based. Again, this is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done and just want to pass the gift forward.

So hear me out. I believe Talga is undervalued today, similarly to Tesla in 2018. I bought my TSLA shares for about $60 a piece and I sold 1/4 to buy Talga 2 weeks ago. Talga (OTC ticker TLGRF, traded in Frankfurt as TGX and on the ASX as TLG)  for who doesnt know is the potentially largest battery anode producer outside China. Its a green product, based on natural graphite and contains the entire value chain from mining to high margin anode Its as good as, if not better than, synthetic graphite due to a fluke of nature.\n\nWhen I made the trade, I thought its more likely that Talga raises 10 to 20% out of thin air than Tesla. Well, as it turns out, both did. So it wasnt a bad trade, in fact so far my timing was perfect as there was no time this year before or since I made the trade where I would have been better off. That is about to change at current trends though. But who ever gets timings perfectly right, eh?\n\nAnyway, I sold some Tesla despite my conviction in the company. I believe Tesla will be worth more than $3k in 2025, so a solid 50-bagger for me and a 3 to 4x from where we are today. By 2030 it might be a 100-bagger for me. However, I believe that Talga will go banana shaped sooner and more violently than Tesla from here on out. If it doesnt get stopped by denying mining permits, its gonna 20x by 2025 and 100x by 2030. There is obviously some risk involved, but these get smaller by the day. \n\nAnyhow, want to know how you stand with such decisions. There are people that would grill me over a fire for even considering selling our favorite stock. If you want to know more about Talga, ask me in PM, im not gonna make a sales pitch here as im not here to pump Talga. I just want to know how you handle people that have a life outside Tesla. This is my /u/Anono-mon moment. I still have more Tesla than Talga, because I dont want to lose it all if Talga goes south. I will live without fear on the TSLA gains alone. But Talga is the ticket for me and I am 95% sure its gonna print.\n\nSo what is your take on this? Selling some TSLA because you discovered an opportunity that you believe would be better than TSLA?

What are you on about? It's \\~108%.\n\nI really wish that people would have some idea of how the economy works before posting that \"THE FED THE FED THE FED\". It's getting so tiresome.\n\n1. Government bonds have fixed coupon payments (typically). This means that the interest rate on debt is set when the debt is issued, i.e. increasing interest rates will only increase borrowing rates on new debt.\n2. The 'Money Supply' is influenced by two variables; total amount of money in the economy and the velocity of money. When you get into a period of slower economic growth, the velocity of money goes down, thereby reducing the 'money supply'. The Fed counters this by injecting money into the economy, offsetting the reduction in velocity with an increase in the total supply of money. The total money supply should stay largely unchanged.\n3. The Fed's job is to control inflation. They do this to maintain full employment. The Fed will increase interest rates when they feel it is the right time. It's a difficult job, but I can assure you they have much more data than almost anyone on Reddit or Twitter.\n4. It's pretty obvious to me that the current 'inflation' is transitory and supply-side, which means it will naturally solve itself. Demand-side inflation is much worse, as humans can get stuck in a loop where they will continually attempt to increase prices, which causes hyperinflation. Where there is too much money in the economy and not enough goods, the price per good goes up. Supply-side is where a shortage of goods leads to a price increase.\n\nAll of these 'tech-twitter-retards' 'v2-goldbug-bitcoiners' who are talking about hyperinflation as if they have some insight, genuinely have zero clue about how the economy actually works. Even 80% of people with who I studied economics have no idea what they are actually learning.

{"title": "CLF huge move $100+ incoming. Crayon writing's on the wall.", "selftext": "UPDATE XMAS DAY :  \n\nHappy holidays and hope y\u2019all are enjoying Xmas lovens. \n\nCLF is like a Jack-n-da-box coiling up with a triple bottom printed since this post. \n\n[CLF triple bottom](https://imgur.com/a/WGiMNkn) \n\nMMs have really churned out those premiums to the tits and with IV getting low and decreasing OI it\u2019s about time for the next leg up > $26-33 range for early 2022 is a reasonable target. Near term catalyst is their earnings. Interested on how their scrap acquisitions earn while scrap futures are on the rise. Anyone following the other DD on CLF knows how the HRC futures are less significant to CLF as they locked in the contracts at high spot prices.  I love this company and how they\u2019re positioned. Net zero debt is around the corner and long term shareholders will be rewarded for their patience and support. My trust and conviction is more resilient than ever. \n\nI\u2019ve come to the realization that the \u201chuge $100 move incoming\u201d will likely be correlated to a macro-economic commodity super cycle event.  \n\nI\u2019ve also positioned most of my TFSA into the Sprott physical Uranium fund as the charts on spot uranium are gearing up for another super cycle.  What\u2019s the catalyst for this explosive 10-100x super cycle?     INFLATION  and EVERYTHING EV \n\nIn the meantime,  I hold CLF shares and use the margin for my degenerate short squeeze plays, CLF remains as my main long term hold (along with U-UN). \n\nAlso long AMYZF\n\nI\u2019ll update again as things develop but as of now nothings changed.  \n\n\n\n-Original post - \n\nIt's the weekend and I'm planning to roofie myself later so let's get right to it. \nAs most of you know there's a lot to like about Cleveland Cliffs (CLF). \n- Printing record revenues 20b+ annually\n- Undervalued with almost a 12b market cap\n- Lourenco Goncalves (the Tony Soprano of CEOs)\nhttps://youtu.be/79gWbSAVL7Y\n- Pounding debt to net zero aggressively and share buybacks\n- New contracts signed locking in big future gains. \n\nThe fundamentals, growth and management are solid so that's that. \n\nWhat I'm here to share with you today is the potential* of a huge move in the stock. \n\nMost of crayon eaters trading CLF have been playing this channel which was very reliable until Mid September. CLF slipped down and started to slowly comeback - Just before Friday's mini Hulk dildo that printed off positive ER. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/k1ZGzm1.png\n\n\nBut what I think has been over looked is the long term view when you zoom out at the last 13 years. \n\nI'm not sure what CLF's share structure and business was like back then but this is literally every crayon sniffer's wet dream of a set up. \n\n\nWhen CLF drilled down in mid September it wasn't just falling out of the channel. It was back-testing the upper trend line of a 13 year triangle which it had broken bullish out of. \n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qJM96Dl.png\n\nI've been scouting out these types of set ups and it seems the longer and higher range the bigger the breakout move plays out after. \n\n Here's some notable examples of this type of pattern playing out :\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZARgSLH.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9r8S6pF.png\n\nIt's hard to exactly time when or how this move will unfold but I'm watching the long term fib levels to suggest it's stops along the way. \n\nI can see this pamping very well for us. \n\nEDIT : New positions \n\nCLF 26c 04/14/22\n\n500 shares (because I\u2019m still poor)\n \nNot financial advice*", "id": "qee73j", "created_utc": 1635025276.0, "score": 262, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "So what industry are they in and do they have any big dongs for my girlfriend to suck on?", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "They got huge skin in the auto steel supply game", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "They also make coiled sheet steel, and purchased AK Steel a while back.\n\nWe're experiencing a steel shortage at my day job, and prices even on second pick and \"scrap\" coiled steel have been real high.", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4766904413700104}, {"body": "Ah steel, the one stock that never hits when you fucking need it to", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Well it\u2019s much like the manganese shortage, not producing as much and is likely to run out of the current supply by the latest mid next year.

Not even adding debt to the balance sheet. They bought back 10% of the float this quarter by buying the preferred from.\n\nNow they mine iron ore, make steel and have a scrapper.

I run steel stamping lines for a small company, and we buy literally hundreds of thousands of tons of second pick and scrap steel. \n\nSay a major company orders Hot Pickled Pre-Galvanized 5.75x0.062in coiled sheet, and it HAS to be 0.062in (16 Gauge) steel. They order 100,000 lbs at a premium yet receive 0.057in. The sales company will then refund the cost, and resell it to another manufacturer who only cares if it is between 5.70-5.80in and 0.054-0.067in. \n\nWe're backordered a year on some stuff, because we can't even find enough steel.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the insight.
