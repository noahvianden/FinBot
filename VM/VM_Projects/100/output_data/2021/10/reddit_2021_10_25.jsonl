Thanks in advance for your insights. \n\n* Scenario: 100 sh TSLA at $525.\n* Strategy: because of TSLA volatility I've sold numerous CC's at the 6mo future mark to get higher premium and closed them out for profit when TSLA dropped so my plan here was to do the same. \n* When TSLA was at 850ish recently I sold a Jun 22 700 strike Call for 225 to collect higher premium and I expected the same volatility dips at before so I could close the call for a profit. At worst I thought it wouldn't be so bad to get called away at 700 and lock in the gains from the de facto 925 sell point (700+225) vs my original basis at 525.

You'll get whatever price the market sets on that contract. Since the underlying went lower in price, that *usually* means the call will also go down in price, which means your buyback price will be lower, thus you'll net a profit. Whether your profit is $.01 or $.99 or something in between is anyone's guess, it all depends on what the market will bear.\n\nNote that it's possible that your call may *increase* in value, even if the stock fell 50%. It's not very common for that to happen, but it is possible. Here's why: [Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value)\n\n\n> but I see both potential losses in calculators and the amount that people lose on WSB that far exceeds the margin.\n\nThose losses are completely avoidable if your manage your account. Losses of that magnitude usually happen when a long is exercised or a short is assigned. And those usually happen near expiration. So as long as you close or roll your positions well before expiration, I use 12 DTE personally, there is very little risk of realizing massive losses like that.\n\n> What happens if you go -$50k and don\u2019t pay?\n\nSuch a situation is a liability for your broker. You basically defaulted on a loan, so the usual things happen after defaulting on a loan. Your broker will use every legal means to extract the money you owe. First, you'll be [margin called](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/what-happens-cannot-pay-margin-call.asp) and all your cash is taken. Next, all your assets (stocks, bonds, funds, etc.) are liquidated to cash, until the debt is paid. If after liquidating 100% of your account you still owe more money, then credit collection proceedings will start. Your case will probably be handed over to a credit collection agency that will try to garner your wages, repossess your car, and things like that. Your credit rating will also be tanked and of course your account will be closed and that broker will probably never let you open a new one.\n\nSince your broker is the one that stands to lose if you don't have the money to pay, your broker will usually intervene *before* that happens and unilaterally (without your permission) close the position at risk. So instead of -$50k loss from an assignment you might only have a -$5k loss. BTW, they'll also do this if you would have had a profit, like if you were heading for a $50k profit at expiration but they thought your position was too risky, they'll close it prematurely so you have a -$5k loss. The numbers are just examples, of course.\n\nYou shouldn't rely on them doing so, though, given the consequences. Manage your own risk and avoid situations that put you in a margin call. A great way to do that is to arrange for no one trade to have a worst case loss value of more than 5% of your total account liquidation value.

The challenge is recognizing these hyper growth stocks early when there are so many stocks to choose from and then estimating how fast and to what height they will climb so that you sell covered calls at the right time and at the optimal strike price.  Many of these investment newsletters will tout numerous portfolios (**continuous onslaught**) with at least 20 to 25 stock ideas within each portfolio.  Has anyone else noticed that these newsletters have the hottest 100X secret stock tip that they have uncovered and that their annual subscription is a steal at $5k for the year but right now they are offering  for a limited time a purchase at only $2.5k?\n\nBack on subject, I agree that it is nice when you get **put into a stock that you want to own at a lower price and can then turn around and sell out of the money call options for a strong additional profit potential.**  However, if the stock gets put to you and it continues to fall, then you may be selling call options at a loss (ie a price below where it was put to you) or you simply sit on the sidelines without selling options during this trough.  If you don't have enough dry powder, then your option activity begins to shrink.   My target is $6,000 per month from option income (does not count stock appreciation gains).  Since 1/17, my best month was $17.4k (and that was net of losing $1.2k on trading out of SHOP puts that I purchased) and my worst one time monthly loss was -$1.13k  for the month of 6/19 when I was actively **buying** calls and puts.  I admit that it is hard not to roll the dice and buy those puts and calls, but **my only options losses come from buying the options**.\n\nSome of the stocks that I own do not have options so I am counting on capital appreciation on those or I may own a stock that I am not willing to sell call options on (I wish I had never sold my call options on SHOP, MELI or AZ), but I still made money, just not nearly as much.  Skydiver, I think a good number to have in your brokerage account would be \\~$300,000 or more and I like to target about a 30% return on my option contracts.  You can certainly strategically make option investments with less but it is more challenging and the number of contracts you can sell becomes more limited which may be why some people with less powder in their keg primarily buy option contracts.  So, if you were fully invested all year long which does not happen on option contracts and you had $300,000 with a target rate of 30% then you would theoretically net \\~ $90k per year.  I do not utilize a margin account.  \n\nAs you know, the closer the strike price, the higher the rate of return.  In this market, I am selling put options further out of the money than typical because I am more leery of catching the falling knife in a big drop.  The trade off is a lower rate of return. Great questions!", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "But how are you choosing profitable growing companies? It is nearly impossible unless you are an insider.

As one example of how I pick stocks, when COVID hit, I started reading about the leading companies working on a cure (J&J, Pfizer, Moderna, etc.) and chose Moderna over Pfizer because I believed that a success at Moderna would move the needle more than it would with a large, diverse company like Pfizer or J&J.  I bought some shares directly in the $60 and & $70 range as the stock would run up and then run back down and it did this for about a year. I never knew if the run was over or not and so I had some call options expire and others that got called away (1 at $82, then the rest between $120 and $175).    I also sold PUTS and harvested cash when the put options expired worthless or in one example, I sold three 6/26/20 $62 Put contracts for $.95 a share and the stock closed at $61.55, so I ended up buying the 300 shares at $62 per share that I followed up by selling call options.  On 6/15/20, I sold 3 $40 Put contracts for $1.10 each per share, 33 days out when the price per share was at $64.08.  It expired worthless and I pocketed the $328.  As I have stated, I like buying PUT options on stocks that I want to own, purchase at a discount and get paid to buy that stock at a discount.\n\n  \nI would advise to **keep your money and do not get sucked into paying $2,000 to $2,500 for a one year financial advice newsletter**.  Almost all of them brag about when they first identified AMZN and it was trading at low double digit levels.  Once you sign up, you get bombarded with new pitches, video pitches that go on for up to an hour and a half and they are constantly coming out with the next 100X new stock idea before your credit card charge even comes in on your statement.  If you throw enough darts at the board, one of them will eventually prove to have hit the target at some point in the distant future!  They only brag about the homeruns and never show you how many strike outs they really had.\n\n  \n**Listen and look for ideas that fit your investment style, level of risk, investment holding time line and then start trying to research the ones you like the best.  Decide if you want to be an investor or simply a roll the dice gambler.**  Finding good investment ideas takes work and some luck.  Only you can decide which are the best to pursue with your limited time that you have for research.  I believed that Canabis stocks would do well as gov/t. restrictions were lifted and we would see good growth.  Because these companies are so small, it was difficult to figure out whether or when their growth ambitions would lead to meaningful profits and success.  I invested in some bombs (ACB which did a reverse split, MRRCF went up in a puff of smoke but at least \"**I did not inhale**\", CWBHF, TLRY) and some winners like GTBIF and TCNNF.  \nKeep in mind that I buy and sell stocks and options to generate monthly income as well as capital gains.  I heard about this new little company called Shopify online and started trying to learn more. I would have been MUCH, MUCH better had I just held the shares and never sold a call option.  I honestly believed that AMZN would take them out, maybe as high as $120! However, I never expected it to run up so fast and continue to run without looking back past the $120 mark.  I bought a lot of my shares when my PUT options were put to me at $30 and then got largely taken out on $60 calls.\n\n   \nAnother stock that I ran across was **SPRO** when it was mentioned that Google's investment arm had been accumulating shares.  Since then, Pfizer has also taken a sizeable position.  They are a very small research firm and COVID knocked back their drug study by at least a year, so it has been an exceptionally long year and a half hold period greatly testing my patience. **Today Spero finally announced that they submitted their new drug application to the FDA for Tebipenem HBr for the Treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract infections** including Pyelonephritis.  The advantage is that they have developed a pill that can be taken orally vs. the current last ditch effort requiring days of IV treatments in a very expensive hospital setting.  **They are also attempting to develop additional drugs to combat drug resistant bacterial infections.**  Please conduct your own research to determine your own belief in the potential for this company.  As drugs are becoming more and more resistant to current over prescribed antibiotics, we are running out of magic bullets to combat these infections!\n\nHappy hunting, I wish there were a simple and easy way to identify the future big winners.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Inhale, exhale, calm down...\n\nI have VT, and sell wheel on indexes.

Just be patient on those days and don\u2019t sell on them. And the most cliche but important rule is but low self high. It\u2019s cliche but makes sense. Tbh you\u2019ll learn as you go and there are tons of books that help explain and what not and YouTube is a good source. Not all of it but there are a few guys on there that have good points and ideas. Ignore the ones that tell you how to get rich and vice versa. That shit is stupid. But I just had to jump in and learn as I went and still don\u2019t know everything. Just be patient and take your time", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You are right.

We should think of the market as having a few percentage of stocks that are winners, and should be bought at nearly any price, at least initially.  And then there's the rest of the market that will on average will probably do as well as a risk free asset like treasuries.\n\nAnd that's why index investing works fairly well, you're guarenteed to own 100% of the winners, and the rest of the index will average out to a \"safe\" return and the combination of the two will still be pretty good. But if we're trying to pick stocks, we should have a completely different perspective.\n\nWhat that means is that nearly any stock that's worth holding for the long term will almost undoubtedly have periods where it seems \"overvalued\" as smart investors try to accumulate as many shares as possible before the rest of the market figures out what's going on. If predicting stock performance from financials was able to pick these winners, then ratios and comparable would flag them immediately. But it's basically impossible to predict long term performance from short term financial results, so we always end up with some stocks that has a period where it looks \"overvalued\" before delivering amazing returns.\n\nWhich obviously doesn't mean every stock with \"bad\" ratios is a buy, most of them are going to do terribly, in fact, the most common return for any single stock over the long term is -100% return.

When you're cell constrained / production limited, why would you want to put cells into a package that you end up selling for less than your existing products?  \n\n\nNow, how will they maintain margins at the lower price point? 1: Scale. Purchasing dozens of GWh of cell capacity at a time, and far in advance is what a company like Panasonic and CATL want to hear. 2: Manufacturing. Gigapress lets you make cars faster, cheaper, and more reliably. 3: Efficiency. Tesla is efficiency at the core. Any car that has similar range to a Tesla product has a larger battery pack. This comes down to 'The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation' but with batteries. Not only does this have an impact on the wh/mile of the vehicles but at the manufacturing level, means you can make more cars with the same battery supply and sell them for less.\n\nNow, growing the market past that 6.5M unit level. I've got 3 letters for that. TCO. People will be willing to spend an extra 5-10k on their car and live with a higher monthly car payment if it can be made up for in a lower TCO. A lower fuel / energy bill. Fewer maintenance costs. And if you plan on selling your car ever \\~5 years or so, a higher resale value. It's a real phenomenon called 'the Tesla stretch' where buyers looking for a \\~30k car end up spending \\~40k on a Tesla because their total monthly out of pocket is about the same. \n\nAnd that TCO argument not only works in that bracket, but lower as well. A 20-25k econobox shopper will be willing to look at a 25-35k Tesla. Let's take the Model Y. It's not only competing with the MachE or ID4. It competes with the Ford Edge, Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, etc. The '25k car' is going to eat the lunch of Toyota's plate of Camry and Carola. \n\nI know there's a TON of 'OMG TeSlA sO hOt rIgHt NoW' channels on Youtube.

Why drive a $25K gasoline car when you can get the model 2 that will be not far off quality wise compared to the model 3, have tremendously lower operating and maintenance costs, and be better for the environment (at a certain point, we know lithium ion batteries yadda yadda)\n\nSecond, the news about their battery progress with panasonic is insane. if their batteries can hold 5x more charge, assume that that will double the range of the current battery. so the 260 mile normal range model 3 will hold 520 miles. thats HUGE. and the fact that the batteries will cost 50% as much to make one the process is streamlined is also huge. the battery is the biggest cost of the car. so tesla either 1. increases profit dramatically by keeping the price of the car the same, or 2. reduces the cost of the car some % of the battery cost savings and then will sell more cars as a result. you also can expect them to sell more cars due to the fact that the range will be much more. imagine if the long range also has a 2x range boost from 5x more efficient energy storage. that will put the range at 720 miles for a car that is $60K. you would largely never have to use the superchargers, which will be an appeal to some that didn't want to have use those and wait, compared to a gas station. \nThese battery upgrades will boost sales when the process is finalized. You can bet on that.\n\nThird, when/if they get FSD fully operational, they will have a sizable monopoly in the robotaxi game, which is a combination of SaaS and uber. Uber's biggest expenses in its business is the labor of paying drivers. Take that out of the picture, or keep it within the company, and suddenly not only do uber rides become super cheap, but super profitable. Estimates for how much the driver on an uber app ranges from 57.5% to 75%. So if an uber trip to the bar costs $30 right now, imagine that same trip being $7.50-$12.50. People that were otherwise unwilling to take an uber, and risk driving drunk to save some money, will reconsider if the prices drop that much (and they will). \n\nFourth, the FSD package has recently become rentable by tesla owners, which is big for revenue because 1. you can now try the service which will lead to some people actualy liking it enough to purchase it in full, 2. the people trying it are still giving revenue to tesla, and 3. those that just want to use it for long roadtrips on vacations but dont own it will now be able to do so.\n\nFifth, have you been in a tesla...? they are amazing cars. very fast, very smooth, very comfortable...\n\nSixth, they dominant manufacturing processes compared to all other automakers because elon has made the efficiency of this process their #1. They have sacrificed short term profits to improve the assembly line and it has made their production speeds much, much faster then everyone else.\n\nseven...their profit margins due to some of the points listed above will go higher, not lower.

Now they are just dormant.\n\nLet's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.\n\nAnd look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!\n\nOf course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.\n\nCult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.\n\nI am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.\n\nAMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.\ud83d\ude02\nINTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.\n\nBut does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.\n\nIt\u2019s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).\n\nAlso, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely.\n\n\nNow, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?\nIf the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. \n(I am not saying you shouldn\u2019t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)\n\nAs long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.\n\nWith all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.\n\nTL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.\n\n\nEdit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti.

{"title": "Warning - Don't listen to trading gurus from tiktok, instagram and youtube", "selftext": " \n\nThe covid lockdown has cause a surge in interest for the stock market. Additionally the media coverage on AMC and GME cause a massive surge in users for WSB. This also breed a new toxic community of users that try to take advantage of investors that are still learning the ropes.\n\n**Where can you find these trading gurus?**\n\nTiktok, instagram, youtube and even reddit has a number of so called trading gurus that will try to lure to either their trading platform or discord server\n\n**What's the issue?**\n\nA number of these users will charge a ridiculous monthly or yearly fee to obtain \"signals\" for their plays. What's interesting about these signals is 90% of the time they will be too late to enter when they're posted. Additionally they will also usually never post a loss or simply ignore a stock that doesn't go up.\n\nIt should also be noted that a lot of these guys use paper accounts or photoshop investment pages to show millions in their investment account to lure the idea that they're always right.\n\nThere's servers that will sell bots that post plays and claim its their own when in reality its to have a server that has paying users.\n\n**Why is it bad to follow these guys?**\n\nYes, there can be some plays where you might hit, but it gives a falsified image and view on the market itself. You will not learn the fundamental skills needed and in fact, anyone can be these trading gurus if you understand the technical skills behind measuring a stock based on a chart. Remember everyone is a trading god in a bull market. A majority of these users will either delete everything or run away when a bear market comes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs a disclaimer, I am not a investor who is like these guys, but I've been trading enough that I was able to purchase my house, buy a new car and enjoy a better life with the gains, but this is only cause I did my DD and its a bull market.
