{"title": "DFV's Roaring Kitty Spreadsheets Recreated with Free Data!", "selftext": "I have been working on a project to recreate DFV's Roaring Kitty (RK) spreadsheets that he used to track movements and metrics on thousands of stocks. This latest version tracks top movers, insider buying, industry breakdowns, and calculates multiple value metrics. I would love feedback and recommendations.\n\nThe spreadsheets now track:\n\n* A universe of over 3,000 stocks (and can handle thousands more)\n* The biggest daily movers\n* The biggest weekly movers\n* The stocks with the most insider buying\n* All stocks based on their industry and sub-industry\n* Valuation metrics for stocks that warrant further analysis\n\nYou can [view a working demo of the version v0.6 stock tracker here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1peYe8V-PDQwueKSbgGTgQXT5zFYhQ8niZvMJo3S_YI4/edit#gid=171851922&range=A1:C1). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A view of the Weekly Movers](https://preview.redd.it/6qmdznrqoqv71.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=75fb079f8779aa5ca6373b59eb26c486dba4ac31)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Industry Tab View](https://preview.redd.it/314xiswsoqv71.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d1db0eabc359bb01b1c09418302000c310a4ce)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started by breaking down [how the RK spreadsheets work together](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKSP/comments/nz32uu/rk_spreadsheets_and_how_theyre_related_link_to/). I got most of it right, but later learned I made a few mistakes.\n\n[How the RK Spreadsheets are connected and work together](https://preview.redd.it/zf3cg8zvoqv71.png?width=2002&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a8975bd30f5d721e41a5c16f7401d3495f1abc8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I built a working [Stock Universe (v0.5)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QAKESea8lpez5uTOdDyFJh3URpRNMnodRPAdFsD143Q/edit#gid=284741622&range=A1:C1) that acts as a database tracking over 3,000 US stocks. This was followed by the [Stock Tracker (v0.5)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vxn1EcDRrHqCpCnRvkJdeVijD6lYSHZINHdvdglclBA/edit#gid=171851922&range=A1:C1) which tracks daily and weekly movers. You can download the v0.5 version sheets for yourself and put them to use. Just keep in mind they get a little slow during market hours, and sometimes crash (the new v0.6 is much better!). \n\nI highly recommend watching the [Roaring Kitty Tools Part 3 (Spreadsheets)](https://youtu.be/7wjWnMcdnlQ?t=240) video to understand how these sheets work.\n\nThe latest version (v0.6) has much more capability, is much faster, and works really well during market hours, but is still a work in progress. I will make a new post when this version is ready for public use. You can still use the v0.6 tracker at the above link, you just won't be able to edit anything.", "id": "qg51in", "created_utc": 1635250333.0, "score": 1645, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "A hidden gem right here\u2026 wow\u2026 thank you, this is absolutely insane", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.

Ultimately it all comes down to how big your conviction of each stock is. For example, I've set a minimum allocation of 50% of my portfolio to Tesla which many would call crazy, but besides being only 31 and having a decent risk tolerance, I consider it to be the safest thing I can do because I know pretty much everything there is to know about the company. I literally spend at least 30 min a day keeping up with the company, so if any significant risks were to come up I'd know. If I have to choose between putting 10% in 5 different stocks or 50% in Tesla, I know I'm going to have better returns with less risk by putting it in Tesla.\n\nSo the only thing I can say is that I'd ask myself \"How much do I really understand the business and its risks, and how big is the opportunity?\" If you base your allocations on those 3 factors, you should be good. Besides, all of the companies you listed seem likely fairly safe plays.
