Manufacturing is becoming more efficient as they scale (giga casts a big part of that). Shipping logistics became more efficient from transitioning the main export hub to Giga Shanghai. Shipping will become even less cost intensive as Giga Berlin and Giga Texas open up (no more shipping EVs on boats). If Tesla can manage $7000 gaap earnings per EV next year (I expect more) while they ramp up their new factories, and if they deliver 1.5M EVs. That's 7000\\*1.5M = $10.5B in gaap earnings for 2022.
