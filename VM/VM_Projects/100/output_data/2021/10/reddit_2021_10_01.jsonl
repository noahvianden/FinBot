SPY LEAPS are insanely expensive.\n\nRemember, the market never goes up 20% in two weeks, but it does fall that much from time to time.\n\nIf your investment money is $7000..... Im going to guess losing $3500 would probably hurt really bad.  Be smart with your money.  Unless you can take that money, go outside, set it on fire, and laugh about it the whole time, stay away from options.  Everyone has their opinions and stock picks.  If you want steady, risk avoiding investing, just put all of it on 2 wide ranging ETFs. If you want more risk, pick a few sector ETFs.  If you want more risk, the reflation trade seems to be back on as the world opens back up again.  There are a few stocks that havent yet recovered from the pandemic, one being SABR.

Their only EV right now is the... Chevy Bolt...\n\nThat GM is making millions of cars in the wrong type of factories, using the wrong legacy powertrain is not a factor when valuing their presence in the EV market.\n\n**4)**\n\nLet\u2019s re-run the numbers, on the EV market:\n\n- Tesla is currently producing around 1 million EVs a year,  annualized. Growth: 60% currently, 50% guided.\n- GM is making around 20,000 Chevy Bolts per year. Growth: 0% currently, no clear guidance on EV growth. They vaguely suggested that they want to make 3.5m EVs per year... by **2030**.\n- Let's take a standard 5-year valuation window to value both companies.\n\nTesla: with +50% per year they'll go to 7.6m/year production - still less than 10% of the entire auto market, so entirely possible.\n\nGM: with an assumed +50% per year they'd go to 200k/year. But let's assume they can get to 1m/year by 2026.\n\n- Tesla's current valuation ($765b/7.6m) is $100k per expected unit of production.\n\n- GM's valuation is ($280b/1m) $280k per unit of production - and that assumes an insanely fast growth of EV production of +110%/year, from 0.025m/year to 1m/year.

Government protection and business interference.\n\nIf it is so save Volkswagen in Germany or GM in the USA or everywhere else, Governments will do all they can to make the taxpayer subsidise the inefficiency of the legacy Dinosaurs. What Biden is doing is just the beginning. Too many trade union jobs and too much political influence is at stake.\n\n2) Late party for ICE vehicles\n\nThe car business is a business with very low net margins, 3-4% in most cases. Every car maker which manages to increase prices 4-8% with some excuse or other (chips) will double or triple its profit per car sold. This will allow them to absorb a lot of waning car sales for another 2,3, perhaps 4 years.\n\n3) Sheer numbers\n\nThe planet wants, on average, 90 million cars a year. In 5 years' time, Tesla will not produce more than 5 to 7, all others together perhaps once or twice as much. Even with waning sales, there will still be a base level of demand for company cars and the like, and he who can't get a Tesla will get either an ICE vehicle or an inferior non-Tesla electric car if he can get one. In time (say, 2035), as the big names ramp up production, you will have a market of 90 million EV, of which 20 million Tesla and 70 million inferior non-Tesla. Not enough to get really fat, but enough to survive and get a piece of the action.\n\nI think something similar to Apple phones will happen. Apple never took all of the market. Even now, they only have 20% of the sales. But they make 80% of the profits.\n\nThis is the situation I see in 2031 or a bit later: Tesla has 20% of the market and 80% of the profits, the others share the rest among themselves; the Chinese producer will dominate China but the tariffs will not allow them to crush GM, Ford, Stellantis etc. The legacy maker will get out of this with one or two limbs amputated, but alive.

That would be 6.834M cars per year by 2026.\nThis is in-line with what the company has repeatedly guided (average 50% growth in deliveries/production YoY long-term till 2030). As per their most recent conference call (and many discussions with Elon prior), as far as they can see (and from what wait times for their vehicles globally indicate as well as the pre-order list of vehicles like the cybertruck) demand for their vehicles is virtually unlimited.\n\nTesla currently has an average selling price of 49 078 (Automotive sales revenue of 11.672 billion/237823 cars sold) as of the last quarter.\n\nAllowing for a gradual decline of ASP to 44 000 per year by 2026 (44 000 is the price of the cheapest current tesla vehicle in the US- the Model 3 SR+), that would equal 2026 automotive revenue of 300.696B in automotive revenue (44000 x 6 834 000).\n\nTesla's current gross margin is an industry leading 30% with healthy operating margins of about 15% despite barely producing any of their higher margin vehicles (S & X). Let's conservatively assume these margins stagnate at their current level till 2026 for whatever reason even though Tesla's long term margin have been trending upward due to a greater portion of their production coming from their newer and more efficient factories with lower operating costs.\n\nThis leaves 45.104B operating profit.

Amazon has traded at a PE of 90 or greater for most of its life while it was in a similar phase of growth (though in fact slower than Tesla currently), but I'll assign a PE of 70 to my net income value, again, to be conservative, which gives a market cap of 2.683T (and a stock price around ~2600) for their auto manufacturing business alone.

A MM is constantly creating short/long positions for itself by buying securities it believes it can sell higher later or selling securities it believes it can buy cheaper later.

They profit by buying someone else's equivalent contract later at a lower price to cover their own contract, or they can buy/sell the shares to back the contract itself if they believe that would be more profitable. A by-product would be that come expiry date it would be in their best interest if the stock closed lower or higher than a certain strike price.

They are querying that there is a lab a hundred meters from the proposed site that almost exclusively worked on modifying coronavirus through gain-of-function research. There was also research performed to modify bats to have human spike proteins so that coronavirus that could affect humans could be tested on these bats. This is understood and accepted, the research is available in journals published by the laboratory. \n\nIt is Occam's razor to say the simplest way the outbreak could had happened is from some research samples leaking or infecting a researcher. The more out-there discussions of it being purposely spread don't really matter yet. The explanation of it coming from the wet market is unacceptable because the jump from registered coranavirus sequences would have had to go through a few animals without ever being sampled... we still have only assumptions on what passed it to a bat if this was the route it mutated through. It is too divergent to the previously registered sequences from local bat caves. The initial lancet journal was by doctors funded by China and theres a lot of US-China funding to outsource this banned gain-of-function research to China. The initial mainstream media jumps to quickly explain that it wasn't manmade should had made anyone query why we're being bombarded with that information while the lab refused inspection and the lancet journal was only making an argument for the complexity of manually splicing dna to give it these particular characteristics. \n\nIt would also explain why China were so slow to report this particular outbreak to W.H.O and why they initially silencing doctors who were seeing issues in Wuhan.", "score": 18, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6723951697349548}, {"body": "The desire to investigate the origin isn't to determine if it is artificial or natural, it's to determine if it accidentally escaped the Wuhan lab which we know was studying multiple bat coronaviruses.\n\nAnd if the NIH contributed to gain-of-function research there then it's possible that both the Chinese and U.S. governments are liable for this pandemic.\n\nIt's one thing for a mutation and jump across species happening randomly.

The last time was just before covid and it cause lots of headaches. But we adjusted and got through it.  \n\n\nRegardless, how that affects non-China mfg. Basically how that works is the vast majority of products we buy today would simply be far too expensive to have mfg in North America. It's not just the higher mfg cost, but then every tier of distribution multiplies on that higher price. So we are talking 200% on average inflation over night. That is not an exaggeration, that is what the real numbers add up too.   \nThese products would simply cease to exist, and that is a significant portion of the goods we consume. That will be one hell of a shock to the world. Not just consumers, but all the mounds of US jobs in shipping, distribution, warehousing, retail, etc. And all the indirect jobs of course. In other words, not mfg in China would make the great depression look like child's play here in the US. It's simply not possible to come back from that without either going back to the way it was, or massive increases in mfg automation in the US. Yes, robots taking US mfg jobs absolutely results in more US jobs later in the supply chain. Robots keep costs down so that products can cut in distributors and retailers.  \n\n\nmfg in other low cost nations are possible of course. And we do a lot of that now. But especially in asia, any crap the China goes through will drastically effect all other Asian countries. Maybe Africa? But really, no other country has the infrastructure for mfg like China does, so a ton will be lost in logistical efficiencies. As an example, the US isn't setup for mfg anything like what China is. It's seriously significantly easier to find manufactures and have them make stuff in China than it is in your own US state. Seriously, it is ridiculously hard to find mfg here at all to even respond. Even if we wanted to mfg in the US, and I still do try many times. We can't find anyone to make our goods.  \n\n\nLong story short.

Tilray also has operations in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Portugal, and Latin America.   \n\n\nIn December 2020, the company announced a merger with Aphria, and will operate under the Tilray name and its ticker symbol on NASDAQ\\[5\\] and the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nIn September 2018, Tilray became the first Canadian cannabis company to legally export medical cannabis to the U.S. for a clinical trial. In December 2018, the company signed a deal with Novartis subsidiary Sandoz to sell, distribute and co-brand Tilray's non-smokeable/non-combustible medical cannabis products in legal markets worldwide.  \nOn June 19, 2018, Tilray announced the launch of High Park Company   \nwhich would operate in the adult recreational cannabis market to   \nestablish unique adult-use brands in Canada upon its legalization.\n\nIn July 2018, Tilray became the first cannabis company to trade publicly on a major U.S. stock exchange, opening on the NASDAQ exchange at a price of $17 per share, which increased in September 2018 to $214 per share, and then descended to $29 per share by August 2019. The IPO raised US$153 million.\n\nIn 2018, Tilray announced it had entered into global alliance with   \nSandoz, a division of Novartis to co-brand and distribute   \nnon-combustible medical cannabis products in global markets where it is   \nlegally authorized. The Globe and Mail dubbed this partnership as \u2018big-pharma\u2019s first foray into cannabis\u2019.  \nAlso in 2018, Tilray announced a $100-million joint venture with the world's largest brewer, AbInBev to research non-alcohol tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)-infused beverages, through their respective subsidiaries, Labatt Breweries and High Park Company.  \nIn 2019, Tilray signed a $250 million revenue-sharing deal with U.S. based brand company, Authentic Brands Group, to leverage ABG brand names, such as Juicy Couture, Greg Norman, and Nine West to create cannabis products. ABG has a portfolio of over 50 brands.  \nIn February 2019, Tilray acquired Manitoba Harvest, a hemp foods   \nmanufacturer, for $317 million from Compass Diversified Holdings. The acquisition allowed Tilray to use Manitoba Harvest's retail distribution network to enter the U.S. CBD market. Manitoba Harvest's products are available in approximately 13,000 U.S. stores and 3,600 in Canada.  \nAlso in 2019, Tilray entered into an agreement with Natura   \nNaturals Holdings which owns 155,000 square feet of licensed cultivation  \n greenhouses in Leamington, Ontario. The acquisition doubled the cultivation ability of the company in Canada. In May 2020, Tilray announced closure of the High Park Gardens site (previously Natura Naturals) for cost reductions.  \nIn July 2019, Tilray acquired U.K.-based Smith & Sinclair to develop CBD-infused edibles. In August 2019, Tilray acquired Alberta cannabis retailer, Four20.\n\nOn 15 December 2020, Aphria conducted a reverse acquisition of Tilray, creating the largest multinational cannabis company by revenue. The chief executive officer  \n (CEO) of Aphria, Irwin Simon, stated that the merger strategy was to   \ncapture Tilray's business assets and public trading exposure in the   \nUnited States and its free trade abilities in Europe, enabling potential for becoming a global operation.\\[5\\] Irwin was named as CEO and chairman of the board for the merged company, and Tilray CEO, Brendan Kennedy, will be a member of the board of directors. The merged companies will keep Tilray's name and trade under the Tilray ticker symbol, TLRY, on the NASDAQ exchange.  \nBy combining assets, the new Tilray company will develop craft beer and cannabis-infused beverages in partnership with Anheuser-Busch InBev, and have branded hemp and cannabidiol products. \n\n**According to one source, the world market potential for cannabis products is $94 billion by 2025.**\n\nIn partnership with University of Sydney, NSW Government, Chris O'Brien Lifehouse, Tilray participated in a clinical trial testing the efficacy and tolerability of medical cannabis as a possible treatment for the side effects of chemotherapy. Led by The Hospital for Sick Children, in Toronto, Canada, Tilray provided a cannabidiol (CBD) oil product available in Canada to test the efficacy and   \ntolerability of medical cannabis oil as a possible treatment for   \npediatric epilepsy (Dravet syndrome). In partnership with the University of British Columbia, Tilray provided medical cannabis products used to test medical cannabis as a possible treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.  \n In partnership with the Grupo Espa\u00f1ol de Investigaci\u00f3n\u00a0en   \nNeurooncolog\u00eda GEINO, in Spain, Tilray supplied medical cannabis   \nproducts for the trial testing the efficacy and tolerability of medical   \ncannabis as a possible treatment for glioblastoma.\n\nIn 2019, Tilray signed an agreement with Cannamedical Pharma GmbH to   \nexport $3.3 million worth of medical cannabis from its Portugal facility to Germany, marking Tilray's first export from Tilray Portugal   \nUnipessoal, Lda. Tilray also has a research partnership with Coimbra University in Portugal.  \nIn August 2019, Tilray announced a partnership with New York University to study the potential ability of CBD to treat alcohol use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. In partnership with New York University, Tilray supplied CBD for a clinical trial studying its possible efficacy for treating disorders caused by breast cancer treatments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSOURCE: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilray) (3.

This is actually the smarter way since they don't have to burn cash trying to pioneer new markets with ununiformed excessive state fees and taxation on top of risking their hard assets in the States since marijuana is still illegal federally. They also already have US operations with their Sweetwater Bev and Manitoba Harvest products that are even sold at Costco.   \n\nAlso, are you aware how much money and compliance changes it takes to move from an OTC exchange to a real exchange like Nasdaq/NYSE? I can tell you that it's definitely not happening overnight when the US legalizes and none of the current top US MSOs that's traded on the OTCs right now are currently structured to be able to so its going to take time and $$$. \n\nAlso, you're forgetting that Tilray is already the largest Cannabis company in the WORLD by revenue.
