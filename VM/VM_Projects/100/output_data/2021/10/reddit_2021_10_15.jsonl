But hedgefunds are risky per se so its not like he was running a scam. My point is high risk high reward specially derivative based is literally playing the lotto, you are basically buying melting lotto tickets. There is luck involved, I think a good analogy is probability of playing the actual lotto, even if you buy 99% of the lotto tickets you can still lose.

It\u2019s cyclical: oil is low, companies issue debt or stock to buy competitors, which lowers the stock, and then oil pops so then they repay debt and buy back stock. Obviously this substantially increases the value of those holding the stock. The buybacks from Rattler Midstream (RTLR) and EnLink Midstream got me a 20% premium\n\nAnd MMP and MPLX have healthy dividends, great cash flow, and smart management.

First of all, those subsidies only apply for the first 200k cars a company sells, so the vast cars Tesla are selling these days don't get any subsidy benefits. And nowadays Tesla is a profitable company even if you don't include the government benefits they receive.\n\nSecondly, getting some subsidies is hardly unique to Tesla/EV's, tons and tons of both new and existing technologies get some kind of financial aid from governments. Hell, the goddamn fossil industry get *several hundred billions* in various kinds of subsidies *every year*. Tesla's government aid is nothing next to that.

Car makers are not going to keep two separate types of vehicles going for any longer than they can transition to EV because of how inefficient that is from a capital and resource perspective. Additionally, a big driver of this is emission requirements and regulatory changes; in many major markets the years of new vehicle ICE sales is limited. A company that believes it can just continue selling ICE vehicles is going to have a shock. Because of this shift, customers of new cars are increasingly going to avoid ICE options because they don\u2019t want to be in a situation where they\u2019re stuck with a car they won\u2019t be able to sell for a decent amount at a later date. A good case study for this is looking at the car sales from companies that have announced they\u2019re permanently closing or car sales of a given line of car once its manufacturer announces the line will be discontinued. No one is going to want to buy a car from a maker that isn\u2019t going to be around anymore nor do they want to buy a car that won\u2019t be produced anymore. Of course, these cars end up being sold eventually, however, at heavily discounted prices. The same is going to happen with ICE vehicles. As EV market share continues to increase over the next few years, legacy automakers will find it increasingly difficult to move ICE cars at the same prices they used to. This is why the situation is dire for a company like GM, and also Toyota. They are at the back of the pack in terms of making the switch to EV, and the assumption that they\u2019ll continue selling their ICE cars at current prices until they switch to EV is unrealistic.

The reason Samsung became as popular as it is, and it's able to sell phones for 30% more than the specs are worth is because they used to have a much better price/performance ratio than Apple and the techies made them popular. Now techies have moved over to other brands like OnePlus, but the mainstream people are still buying Samsungs. Same happened with Huawei.\n\nTesla is exactly that. Aside from looks (everyone will have their own opinion, Tesla's looks don't bother me but I'm not a fan either), Tesla does well in both those other categories. They have the cheapest cars in their segments and the best brand recognition in the EV space. On top of that, if you ask an 8 year old what kind of car they want, they no longer answer Ferrari but Tesla. That's very telling for the brand.\n\nThe other part you're forgetting is how Tesla has so much demand right now that they're artificially keeping their prices high. In the past they've always driven down prices as they made the cars cheaper. Now their demand is so high (some models already have close to a 1 year waiting time) that it no longer makes sense to reduce their prices even though they're still significantly brining down production costs. If there ever would be any kind of competition, they could easily reduce their prices by $10-20k per model and still be profitable, while the other brands are barely profitable or even unprofitable as it is.\n\nOn the subject of the one size fits all, you do have a good point. Obviously Tesla cannot build 20 different models while they're still scaling, so there will always be groups of people that are outside their TAM. That said, Tesla doesn't NEED to be able to address everyone on the planet. Especially as long as they're still scaling rapidly. If they can address 50% of the market, but for these people it's a no-brainer to buy a Tesla over something else as is currently the case, they can already easily get a market share that no automaker has ever had.

Beside that, they are cars and that\u2019s enough.\n\nThose who have real money will want something more bespoke and prestigious that those mass produced models. A Taycan turns heads and can be made quite unique. Yet another Tesla doesn\u2019t.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Obviously I don't agree my arguments weren't objective, but just to discredit a few of the false or debatable points in your rebuttal:\n\n> Many manufacturers will similarly reduce costs over time.\n\nThat's extremely unlikely. None of the legacy automakers have even announced plans to start using single piece casting for underbodies, which is a huge part of Tesla's production cost reductions. Likewise, none of the other automakers has even announced plans to cut battery costs as much as Tesla did on battery day. Tesla not only announced those things, they've already started implementing and in some cases using them. If any of the competitors will do this over time, it will take them at least 5-10 years to do so as everyone with knowledge of batteries [or casting will acknowledge.](https://youtu.be/A__rMm18rXI?t=505)\n\n> Having \u201cthe best brand recognition in the EV space\u201d is a narrow category. Smart has the best for European city cars. Jeep and old Land Rovers for off road. Mercededes for executive luxury. Porsche is the go-to prestige brand for who can\u2019t and doesn\u2019t want to buy a supercar with all it entails.\n\nIt's not. All of those things you mentioned combined are maybe 10-20% of the entire automotive market. That's what I meant with Tesla addressing 50% of the market with a mid-range and luxury sedan and SUV, a semi and a budget car.\n\n> Not sure which 8 year old you are asking, but I don\u2019t see posters of Tesla being affixed to kid room\u2019s walls, or SEGA remaking their cutting edge arcade Outrun with a Tesla replacing the Testarossa.\n\nThat's exactly what's happening. Kids prefer Teslas over Ferraris (and I'm lifelong Ferrari fan myself). PUBG added a Model Y to their game instead of a Ferrari or Lamborghini.\n\n> Ask a 8 year old who their favorite singer is, and let\u2019s see if in only 10 years they will still remembered like Elvis or Michael Jackson.\n\nWell, that's a weird comparison. Many people still like Elvin or Michael Jackson, but I don't see many people still driving their favourite cars from the 1980s.\n\n> Tesla is currently no more than a cool consumer brand. Most popular brands at this stage fail to gain enduring iconic status. Comparing it to Ferrari is, to put it kindly, very early.\n\nTesla doesn't need to become Ferrari, they need to become mainstream. The fact that they're trying to be mainstream and still as popular as a niche brand is telling.\n\n> Proving EVs could sell and kickstarting in the west the infrastructure needed for the switch, that\u2019s a most impressive achievement. Musk will be remembered for his wide influence on society. The car brand itself may turn out to have been just a tool for this change, and not particularly relevant long term.\n\nTrue, and that was the initial goal. But then automakers chose short term profit over long term viability and now they're in trouble.\n\n> I imagine a greater underlying reason: they are not interested so much, that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t research it. To its fans, Tesla is aspirational. To most of the world population it\u2019s not.\n\nAgain forgetting about the point I made earlier. It's the minority of early-adopters that gets the masses excited. Apple and smartphones in general were bought by techies, those people have since moved on but the masses as still buying their phones. The Sims was originally marketed towards hardcore gamers, who liked the game for a few months but lost interest, yet did tell their sisters about it who massively started playing it for years to come.\n\nLikewise, I tell people about how much cheaper EVs are to own than ICE when it comes up, and now I've got friends saying they've looked at it and they're definitely getting an EV next.\n\n> The real average person I think will glance at a Tesla and immediately conclude \u201cthat\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for\u201d, just like they could do with a Smart or a Wrangler or a MX-5.\n\nIf that was true, Tesla wouldn't have a 80% EV market share in the US while ICE sales are plummeting and more people than just the early adopters have started adopting EVs. Same in Norway where 85% of car sales are now EVs and Tesla is also the most popular brand.\n\n> Some people see cars as appliances, not toys or status symbols. The brand of their car is as much a source of their daily pride and satisfaction as their coffee machine. The money conscious will buy a perfectly competent ICE for 15~20k, less with a good used, save on insurance and not stress over range and charging time and locations.\n\nThe money conscious will absolutely not buy an ICE, because they're more expensive no matter how long or short you own them. I'm one of those money conscious ones and have recently done the math, and a second-hand Tesla or a new budget EV is much cheaper than an ICE vehicle, no matter if you keep it for 1 year, 5 or 10.\n\n> Those who have real money will want something more bespoke and prestigious that those mass produced models. A Taycan turns heads and can be made quite unique. Yet another Tesla doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe Taycan is also in the segment that makes up 0.1% of all car sales.

But if you were to ask the average person \u201cwould you wait around another 18 minutes for an extra $67?\u201d I would argue that they would say yes.\n\nEspecially on a long road trip (which is where this conversation started) if you can afford to spend a bit more time at the charger, then you can save a bunch of money. If you\u2019re taking a 1200 mile road trip and get 300mi on a charge, that trip would require stopping 4 times for an added time of 72min. Assuming you drive 65mph then that\u2019s an 18 hr drive without stopping. With stops it\u2019s probably more like 19 hrs 12min. That added time includes bathroom breaks and getting food. The saved costs is now $268.\n\nFor a non-EV, it\u2019s still the 18hr drive plus extra stoppage. Assuming you get 400mi per tank and go 65mph, then that\u2019s just 3 stops. However, those stops are (per your argument) just for gas and not bathroom or food related. If you add on a 5min pee break and 15min for food, then the added time is 2min (stop1)+ 7min (stop2) + 17min (stop3)= 25min. So you\u2019re total trip time is 18hrs 25min.\n\nThe difference in trip time is only 47 minutes over an 18 hour drive which is only 4.4%. This also assumes that you stop only once to pee and once to eat. Whereas on a long road trip, you\u2019ll probably stop more than that.\n\nAssuming it\u2019s $4/gal and $0.2/kWh, car 1 spent (300mi/75KWh * 4 stops / $0.2/kWh) = $80 on fill ups. Car 2 spent (20gal * 4 stops * $4/gal) = $320 on fill ups.\n\nIn conclusion, the added 47 minutes actually saved driver 1 $240 on their 18 hr road trip. Again, that\u2019s only 1 pee break and 1 food break. At the end of it all, it could be negligible time difference.

Government protection and business interference.\n\nIf it is so save Volkswagen in Germany or GM in the USA or everywhere else, Governments will do all they can to make the taxpayer subsidise the inefficiency of the legacy Dinosaurs. What Biden is doing is just the beginning. Too many trade union jobs and too much political influence is at stake.\n\n2) Late party for ICE vehicles\n\nThe car business is a business with very low net margins, 3-4% in most cases. Every car maker which manages to increase prices 8-12% with some excuse or other (chips) will double or triple its profit per car sold. This will allow them to absorb a lot of waning car sales for another 2,3, perhaps 4 years.\n\n3) Sheer numbers\n\nThe planet wants, on average, 90 million cars a year. In 5 years' time, Tesla will not produce more than 5 to 7, all others together perhaps once or twice as much. Even with waning sales, there will still be a base level of demand for company cars and the like, and he who can't get a Tesla will get either an ICE vehicle or an inferior non-Tesla electric car if he can get one. In time (say, 2035), as the big names ramp up production, you will have a market of 90 million EV, of which 20 million Tesla and 70 million inferior non-Tesla. Not enough to get really fat, but enough to survive and get a piece of the action.\n\nI think something similar to Apple phones will happen. Apple never took all of the market. Even now, they only have 20% of the sales. But they make 80% of the profits.\n\nThis is the situation I see in 2031 or a bit later: Tesla has 20% of the market and 80% of the profits, the others share the rest among themselves; the Chinese producer will dominate China but the tariffs will not allow them to crush GM, Ford, Stellantis etc. The legacy maker will get out of this with one or two limbs amputated, but alive.

Along with Reagan\u2019s strategy to outspend the Soviets and bankrupt them when they tried to keep up. \n\nWhich was unsustainable and caused inflation, a speculative bubble & poor application of capital. \n\nThe first sign was on October when I read in the Wall Street Journal: \"Fed Chairman Greenspan said interest rates could become `dangerously high' if inflation worries 'mushroom' in financial markets. Greenspan called such worries unwarranted but hinted the discount rate may have to rise to allay them.\" The next day, stock prices plunged a record 91.55 points for no immediately apparent reason other than Greenspan's pronouncement. On October 15, Dow Theory gave me a sell signal, and I went short thinking that the patient's heart could fail with even the slightest excitement. The heart attack occurred when Germany and Japan failed to heed James Baker's request to stimulate their economies (inflate) to protect the value of the dollar. In response, Baker announced to the world on Sunday, October 18, that he \"would let the dollar slide.\" I knew at this point that the financial markets would collapse from the dollar devaluation. When the market gapped down on October 19, I shorted the opening of the S&P 500 futures and made a substantial profit for my account in that position alone. The bittersweet part of it is that I had independent traders working for me at the time (free to make their own decisions) who were caught long, and some of my profits were offset by their losses.\n\nAs of Friday, October 13, the Japanese and the Germans had raised interest rates, making it more expensive for their companies and citizens to buy American products on credit. The Fed had reduced the money supply and credit availability (as measured by free reserves) over the previous two reporting periods, and with the CPI already at an annual rate of approximately 5.5%, they did not have much room to ease in order to stimulate business activity, which was already sluggish. Northeastern real estate and the regional banks holding the mortgages were already in recession. The bottom had already fallen out of the junk bond market. In short, the patient was once again old and sick and another stroke was imminent-not a good time to write an insurance policy at any premium rate. It was certainly no time to be long.\n\nTLDR: excess government spending, easy credit policies lead to a speculative bubble that amplified a bull run coming out of the 70s malaise.

I tried using that once -- my girlfriend had it and kept asking me how to make it work -- and I found it hella confusing. (Originally learned on etrade and now I'm transitioning to Fidelity.) But you'll likely have to apply with your broker for the privilege of trading in options.\n\nAnyway, puts and calls are both options. More often, you hear about people buying options.\n\nWhen you buy a call, you're buying the option to buy that stock at the strike price on a set date. You hope the stock will be above that price on that date, so you then get to buy it for less than what it's currently trading at. Maybe you're happy to hold the stock at that price, maybe you'll immediately turn around and sell it at market price so that you can pocket the difference in prices.\n\nWhen you buy a put, you're buying the option to sell a stock at the strike price on the set date, and you hope the stock will be below that price on that date, so you can sell it for more than it's currently trading at. If you do this for a stock you already own, it's like buying insurance against the stock price going down too far: it puts a limit on how low you need to sell it at. Even if it plummets really far, you can still sell it at the strike price you have the option for. If you do this for a stock you don't own, you're just speculating: if the stock goes below the price you set at the end date, you can quickly buy some of that stock at the current price, then sell it at your put price, and you keep the difference between those prices.\n\nThat's *buying* options, which costs you money when you buy the option. But for every option bought, there has to be an option *sold*, and you can also make money *selling* options. (I'm going to skip anything that requires margins -- anything that requires taking out loans from your broker.)\n\nWhen you sell a call on stock you own (without margin), it's called a 'covered call'. You're making a promise to sell that stock at the agreed strike price on the agreed date if it's above that price. (And for making that promise, you get an up-front payment that you get to keep no matter what.) If the stock ends up above the strike price, you sell it at the strike price. If the stock ends up below the strike price, nothing happens -- the option evaporates and you get to keep the initial money you got for it *and* you get to keep the stock. That's what you want to happen. *But* there's not much risk to selling covered calls -- the worst thing that can happen is that you keep the price of the option and you sell the stock at the strike price. It might hurt emotionally to see that you missed out on a lot of profit on a stock that unexpectedly shot up a lot higher than the strike price ... but you still haven't really lost any money as long as the initial strike price you set was a price you're happy to sell at. (Oh, and until the option expires, you won't be able to sell the stock. That's the 'covered' part. You *must* keep the stock in your portfolio so that you can sell it if the call option ends up in the money.)\n\nWhen you sell a put (without margin), it's called a 'cash-secured put'. You're making a promise to buy a certain stock at the strike price if it goes below the strike price on a certain date. When you make that promise, two things will happen: 1) You'll get some money for making the promise -- that's yours to keep no matter what. 2) Your broker will set aside enough cash to buy that stock at that price until the option expires. You won't be able to do anything else with that cash until the agreed date. (That's the 'cash secured' part.) If the price of that stock is below the strike price on that date, you buy the stock at the strike price. If the price of that stock is above the strike price on that date, nothing happens and the option just evaporates. Either way, you get to keep the initial money from selling the option. You hope the price is above the strike price so that you don't have to buy a stock for more than it's currently worth. Think of it as placing a buy limit order. The worst thing that can happen here is that the stock price absolutely plummets and you end up paying a *lot* more for it than it's currently worth. You *can* lose a substantial amount of money on unwisely selling puts.\n\nOnce you buy or sell an option, that option will show up in your portfolio. If you bought the option, it will have a positive value -- you can sell it before it expires for a positive amount of money. If you sold an option, it will have a negative value -- you have to buy back the option if you want to get out of it prematurely. Sometimes you can make money this way, too. As options become more valuable or less valuable with market fluctuations, you can actually make money by buying an option and then selling it when the option's price goes up. This allows you to multiply your gains ... but it also has a multiplying effect on your losses. And because options have an expiration date, the ones you bought tend to become less valuable over time and the ones you sold tend to become more valuable over time, so it's rarely profitable to close the option position early like that. *Unless* the stock has already passed the strike price -- then the trends in option prices reverse.\n\nOptions can be used for a variety of reasons:\n\n- To make your portfolio more volatile. Buying call options can multiply your gains ... but also multiply your losses.\n\n- To hedge against losses. Buying puts against stocks you own places a floor on how much money you can lose within that time period. It can protect you against a major crash in the stock's price ... for an up-front fee.\n\n- To profit from stocks losing money. Buying puts against stocks you don't own is basically making a bet that the stock price will go down. This lets you make money on a stock even when it's going down. Sometimes *big* money if you correctly predict that a certain stock will crash hard.\n\n- To profit from stocks that trade sideways and don't move much at all. If you think a certain stock will stay the same value it is now, you can make money from that by selling puts and/or calls on it. You make money from selling those, and if you're right, then those options will expire worthless and just let you keep all the money you made from selling them.\n\n- They can be used instead of buy limits and sell limits ... kind of like buy limits and sell limits that *pay you to use them*. That said, they do have some disadvantages, especially in that it only counts what the stock price is on one certain day. If you really want to make sure your buy/sell limit goes through, even if the stock only momentarily hits that price, you really want to use traditional buy/sell limits, not options for that.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I understand I\u2019m just having trouble finding the right combination of buttons on the mobile app. It\u2019s probably because I do the majority of my tradingBetween 3 and 6 AM", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Fidelity lets you set limit orders on options to process once the market opens.
