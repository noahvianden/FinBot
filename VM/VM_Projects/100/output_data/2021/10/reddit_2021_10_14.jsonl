ENPH (not bio) is a solar company that produced a unique product and has amazing management, making its returns over the past decade possible.

At 200 million market cap, nothing is baked into the share price.

Just a small florist that was a work of passion and didn't bring home a whole lot of cash. Her husband was an abusive drunk and squandered any money they had on \"investments\" and alcohol. One day she came home and he had sold all the furniture in the house. A while later he took out a reverse mortgage on their modest home and lost all that money too. They divorced in their 40s, the house went to the bank, and she also became disabled around this time period where she could no longer work, so she was on disability until age 65. She was able to live in a 1 bedroom apartment for approximately $650/ month which was over half her disability payments. The only way she could afford food and other expenses was because of a small death benefit ($50K?) when her dad died. She stretched that out over 20 years or so. That dried up around the time she collected social security. She was living in Illinois at the time which has much better senior benefits. She qualified for senior housing and lived there at a discounted rate and got food stamps and Medicaid. Then she developed Alzheimer's, her disability was getting worse and she couldn't walk. We brought her to move in with us so we could take care of her. Now for the last 6 year she's completely bedridden and doesn't even know who I am. She doesn't qualify for Medicaid in Indiana because her approx. $12,000 a year is too much by a few hundred bucks. So she has to stick with Medicare and a supplemental plan that runs her $240 a month, plus a prescription plan. She's definitely gotten her worth out the insurance plan and if she didn't have it she'd be in debt for hundreds of thousands of dollars given her medical history. However it's just mind blowing that someone \"making\" around $12K a year is too rich for state government help. Indiana denied taking any money to expand their Medicaid program under the Healthcare Act so there's a Medicaid gap and my grandma is a victim of that all because of politics.

In Jeff Bezos: King of Amazon, author Josepha Sherman writes, \"From the time he was a toddler, Bezos was busy trying to change his world. He felt he was too old to sleep in a 'baby' crib, so he found a screwdriver and took the crib apart. Instead of getting mad, Bezos's family encouraged him.\"\nBezos had a younger sister, Christina, and brother, Mark. When the young siblings learned to walk, they loved going into their brother's room because of all the fascinating \"toys\". To warn him that the children were coming, Jeff attached an alarm to his bedroom door that made a loud buzzing sound when someone entered.\nWhen Bezos was twelve he wanted something called an Infinity Cube. The device was a set of small motorized mirrors that reflected off one another so the images seemed to go on endlessly. It cost $20 but Bezos did not have enough money to buy it. Instead, he purchased mirrors and other parts with what money he had and constructed his own reflecting cube. He built other inventions, including amateur robots. At one point he had so much clutter in his bedroom, his parents made him move all of his half-finished devices and experiments into the garage.\nThere are many similar stories surrounding Bezos's childhood years. He spent countless hours building models and an assortment of electronics kits. He worked on science projects, often coming up with his own \"inventions.\" By the time he reached high school, he had turned the family garage into his personal science and electronics laboratory.*\n\ni spent a few months last year working at amazon to get more capital to get more shares of tsla, so i read up on him and the company. by that point tsla had hit 600 which seemed far too risky, so i missed out on buying more shares presplit. i went as far as getting a $3000 check from my bank and walked across the hall to the schwab office, but they were closed due to covid, and the split happened the next day.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17419807612895966}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3276037573814392}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2540954351425171}, {"body": "The reason why he's doing all of this is to help his lawsuit against space x presumably.\n\nHe's not happy about having to pretend he succeeded when he failed.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Well then I hope NASA sees this video and stamps every single page of the lawsuit with a red rubber DOUCHEBAG stamp and sends it back to him.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4032266139984131}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36767563223838806}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3685637414455414}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5787827372550964}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2023109644651413}, {"body": "Eek, that's super awkward.", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08699341118335724}, {"body": "That is so disrespectful.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10452820360660553}, {"body": "This is really insane.

{"title": "My retrospective on trying Calevolear's strategy which resulted in -$125k of losses", "selftext": "Cross-posting here from /r/PMTraders since it may be relevant to some of you.\n\n**The Results**\n\nI\u2019ll start with the result: I lost $60-65k each in my PM account and the IRA account, for a total of -$125-130k.\n\n[Here\u2019s my Portfolio Margin account YTD](https://i.imgur.com/pTKed3X.png)\n\n[IRA /ES losses](https://i.imgur.com/QxkH1pE.png)\n\n**The Intro**\n\nBelow is my retrospective for my roughly 2 week period trading Calevonlear\u2019s strat. Note that this will include a view of my mentality over this period as well as I believe it's relevant to the strategy execution.\n\nTo be very clear, I'm in no way trying to blame /u/calevonlear here in the slightest. I read his notes, I thought it was an interesting and promising strategy that I hadn't encountered before, I misjudged my actual risks, and I'm not very good at day trading futures which exacerbated my losses. My own actions and decisions resulted in my losses. I only reference him because he's the one I learned the strategy from.\n\nI'm sharing my experience in the interest of knowledge-sharing as a warning about what I now think is the *actual* worst case short-term scenario for this strategy.\n\nI had seen his strat around and followed the performance for a few months. I liked the most recent iteration, the /ES 7DTE ATM strat on paper, especially since it was something he mentioned being an intentional choice so that even his wife could trade it from the phone if he weren\u2019t able to. It sounded very mechanical, and I was comfortable with what I *thought* was the max drawdown of the strategy. Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t. What I thought would be a week-long test just to get a feel for trading ATM puts through some light market oscillations turned out to be a strategy that trapped me.\n\nI wrote up my notes [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/PMTraders/comments/pv341e/september_25_2021_weekend_thread_what_happened/hed8ix5/) on 9/26 after scouring all his comments.\n\n**Quick strategy summary** (read the above link if you want more)\n\n* Selling 7-9DTE ATM puts on /ES to maximize extrinsic value. \n\n* BTC at $250 per contract which can be 15-25% depending on IV, but is a 10 point move at open. \n\n* If the market rises, \u2018leapfrog\u2019 and sell another /ES at the next $5 strike. You\u2019ll have 2 strikes open and a 3rd opening when the first closes.\n\n* If it falls, sell one every 10 point fall, up to 6 strikes max, creating a \u2018cascade\u2019 of puts.\n\n* On a bigger fall, \u201cFreeze\u201d your portfolio. Once delta reaches 0.9 on all your puts, short /ES contracts to neutralize delta. Buy them back on the way back up.\n\n* Add a 7th put once there\u2019s a rebound by filling the 5 strikes above the lowest put and leap from to help with recovery. Even an 8th is technically possible.\n\n* At 0DTE roll any ITM puts out to 7-8DTE.\n\n**Sizing** - His original sizing recommendation was 1 \u2018set\u2019 of contracts per $250k NLV. I went safer here and did 1 set in a $500k account and 1 set in a $750k account. *This was still way too aggressive imo.* I think $1M is more appropriate per set.\n\n/u/Neverstoplearning2 commented something that turned out to be incredibly central to why this strategy fails, and that\u2019s the delta hedge. Unfortunately at the time I didn\u2019t fully appreciate how right he was. He said:\n\n>The real problem is juggling with ES shorts, **because right after I buy back a short it goes down again..** So forget about trying to time and like Cale stated a hedge is going to cost you but it does help to limit losses of course and that is why you really should try to maintain your delta.\n\nLet me introduce you to whipsaw with leverage.\n\n**The Action**\n\nI\u2019ll be sharing screenshots from the IRA at TW as its imo easier to see the trades, but the same exact trades were executed in the PM account. The $5k difference in eventual losses was the result of a mistake in the PM account where I ended up with 2 short puts at 4465 by accident. I thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal, unfortunately the market reversed and I got trapped with both.\n\nOn the first day, the strategy worked as expected, [with some easy profits](https://i.imgur.com/LSIWwgA.png)\n\nThen the market fell a tiny bit. [No worries, those are exactly the conditions I wanted to test this in](https://i.imgur.com/XqtUihY.png)\n\nBut then it kept falling. [A lot](https://i.imgur.com/F05fCN3.png). Which felt like a lot more due to the leverage of this strat. I had to [start hedging the very next day](https://i.imgur.com/BILCeSl.png ) as my puts hit 0.9 delta. \n\n\nAnd now we get to the real problems.\n\nThere are two things working against this strategy, one small, one huge.\n\n1. It\u2019s very easy to get trapped in a 7th put on a fake bounce back that just taps above your lowest strike.\n\n\n2. There\u2019s no good mechanical way to put on and take off the delta hedges when the market decides to jump up and down right in the zone where your puts are hitting 0.9 delta and you have to delta hedge to prevent catastrophic loss with all the leverage you now have.\n\nWhat happened over the next few days is the market would trigger me to put on my delta hedges. Then it would bounce up enough that I needed to take those hedges off to participate in a bounce back, except then it would reverse course again and re-trigger my delta-hedge zone. And the market just sat there for days, [bouncing up/down](https://i.imgur.com/qFllxMO.png). \n\nI was losing money on the way down, hedging, losing money on the hedges when the market started bouncing (which was 7 /ES contracts, which is a LOT of notional) un-hedging, and again losing money on the way down on my high delta short puts. It sucked. It was affecting my ability to do any work during the day. It was affecting my sleep.\n\n[Trades](https://i.imgur.com/DaUvUyG.png)\n\n[Continued](https://i.imgur.com/k4SB0MM.png)\n\nI went on PTO around this time and you can see on 10/01 I put on an 8 contract hedge after adding 4320 and 4340 short puts earlier that day. I was literally agonizing over whether a bounce would occur and I\u2019d participate, or I\u2019d go to sleep and wake up to a -$100k loss. I had to make the call and put the delta hedge on to be able to sleep. Turns out I did that at 4266, which 6 points off [the absolute low](https://i.imgur.com/ieGhuww.png), followed by another large bump the next day that I completely missed out on.\n\nAfter a few days of that whipsaw and my losses mounting, I lost my cool and tilted. I realized all I was really doing was day (and night) trading futures. The short puts were a complication that didn\u2019t really add much value. So I leaned into it - I was sleep deprived and not thinking super clearly at this point.\n\nObserve that all these trades were the same day, and observe the contract sizes increasing as I got frustrated with getting whipsawed and tried to more directly day trade futures while *also* hedging the puts. \n\n[Day Trades 1](https://i.imgur.com/YGMtrHY.png)\n\n[Day Trades 2](https://i.imgur.com/yOp4Tjb.png)\n\n[Day Trades 3](https://i.imgur.com/HuTGcYP.png)\n\nMy more leveraged PM account suffered a max drawdown of -18% during this 10/6 day trading spree, bouncing back to about -12.5% by EOD. In the IRA I bounced back to -8.5%.\n\nThe following day I realized I had absolutely no edge here. This month would be the first month I had ever had a loss in my PM account, due to not trading my strategy. [I pulled the plug](https://i.imgur.com/3Hhcxnh.png) because I realized my only strategy here was praying the market would bounce back before it blew up my account. That\u2019s just gambling.\n\nI measure a strategy by its performance during the worst times. It doesn\u2019t matter how much money a strategy makes if it blows up the account during a drawdown. \n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s this strategy\u2019s weakest point. It requires you to market time and day trades /ES futures contracts with massive leverage to prevent catastrophic portfolio loss. That\u2019s my weakest point as a trader. I specifically sell premium because constructing a net premium-selling portfolio is more forgiving toward market timing. So in the moment when my portfolio is most vulnerable, this strategy compounds my weaknesses instead of relying on my strengths. \n\n**What could I have done better?** Many, many things.\n\n1. There was no point trying this in both the PM and IRA. One would have more than sufficed.\n\n\n2. I could have tried this brand-new-to-me strategy on /MES instead to greatly reduce leverage and learn just as much.\n\n\n3. I misjudged the true max-drawdown. I had estimated the drawdown per strategy would be the loss on 6 puts from 0.5 delta to 0.9 delta when I put the hedges on. If the market kept dropping, no problem, my losses were \u201cfrozen\u201d in place until the market bounced back. Then I\u2019d unfreeze my account as the market recovered and \u201cleap-frog\u201d to recover faster. \n\n That is *not* the worst case scenario for this strategy. The worst case scenario is the market dropping to the zone where your puts hit 0.9 delta and then bouncing around there for days on end, whipsawing you back and forth as you try to hedge and unhedge with short /ES puts, which is just day trading and market timing. It can also trap you in an extra short put than you expected for additional leverage and extra pain when a bounce is just temporary. \n\n4. I should have pulled the plug on the strategy the moment I realized #3. This was a failure to control emotion. I *know for a fact* I can\u2019t successfully day trade futures. I\u2019ve proven that to myself many times before and paid for it. As soon as I realized the hedging aspect of this strategy was much less mechanical than I initially thought, I should have bailed. That would have been a much more manageable loss of 7-8%.\n\nI\u2019m glad I did pull the plug on the strategy when I did. Not because it was good timing - it wasn\u2019t. If I just held through the pain and dealt with the drawdowns, I would have recovered most of my losses at this point and been close to flat after today\u2019s rally. I\u2019m glad though because I realized all I was doing was gambling with massive leverage in a trade I had no control over. The market could have just as easily dropped another 5%, or whipsawed for 2 more weeks in the same range, both of which could have been disastrous depending on *timing*, and I\u2019ve already proven that\u2019s not something I\u2019m good at.\n\n**Any positives?**\n\nYes, I think so. [Here are my monthly portfolio returns in the PM account going back a year](https://i.imgur.com/RxafGAI.png). I like to take brief notes on notable things affecting my P/L. Over the last 3 months I\u2019ve had weak returns as I had a \u201cbad feeling\u201d about market structure and kept my BPu at 10% max while staying delta neutral. \n\nIronically after that I leveraged up with this strategy and the market walloped me. Oops. \n\nThe above experience of having 3-5% portfolio swings on 1% market moves has reset my risk tolerance. You can see in my original account NLV graph at the top that I was becoming more and more risk-averse, reducing volatility of returns, at the expense of reducing returns. I believe this experience snapped me out of that, and I\u2019m once again more willing to find a healthy balance of volatility of returns.\n\nSecondly, I\u2019ve been meaning to trade more futures contracts, especially in IRAs at TW, to leverage SPAN margin, but I\u2019ve dragged my feet on it. TW allows for SPAN margin in their IRAs but has about 2x the BPR on those positions as in a Reg-T or PM account. After these losses, I now have a very good understanding of how TW treats IRA SPAN margin during larger moves.\n\nSimilarly, I also generally like the simplification of underlyings and the 1256 contract tax treatment for my PM account, so I\u2019ll seek to use futures contracts more to my benefit there as well.\n\nI also might consider longer DTE ATM contracts on specific equity underlying I\u2019m very bullish at. I think there\u2019s potential value in increasing my delta when I have high conviction on an underlying.\n\nI will not be trading ATM contracts with massive leverage though, that\u2019s for sure.", "id": "q82hmp", "created_utc": 1634226693.0, "score": 454, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "Respect for posting the losses and a thorough write up of your experience.", "score": 209, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3996184766292572}, {"body": "Thanks for the detailed write up", "score": 72, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2339814156293869}, {"body": "Wish more ppl would put up posts like this.

I have applied some of the principles that u/calevonlear has posted about against the SPY. I do have a futures account but it's too small right now to try this.\n\nAnyway, I agree with you that the hedging is a particularly tricky part of the approach. The original suggestion was to wait to hedge until all open puts are at 0.9 delta or higher. The ladder is also very aggressive.\n\nI do four things differently.\n\n1. In SPY, these are American options subject to early exercise. Therefore, I put on my positions with 11-14DTE and roll them at 3-5 DTE (unless extrinsic gets very low in which case I roll early).\n\n2. I use spreads with a 0.05 delta long leg *every time*. Using a spread means I need SPY to rise an extra 20 cents in my favor (assuming VIX 20) to take it off. This caps my downside but it also means the spread delta goes to 0 the deeper ITM it goes. See #4.\n\n3. My ladder is 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc. for putting on short legs. As an example, when SPY was at 444, I had on a 444, 443, 441, and 437 ladder. If it kept dropping, I'd have had 429, 417, 401, etc on the way down. The numbers in my ladder are relative to the last strike I put on.\n\n4. I treat each open position as its own entity that needs hedging. Plus, I only watch the short leg (in the spread). When it goes above 90 delta, I short 100 SPY. I take the hedge off when that leg goes above 85 delta (to avoid a quick chop). Note that by doing it separately for each leg I avoid that massive chop you experienced.\n\nThis strategy is a lot of work when hedges are on. It's a fair amount of work even when going straight up because you have to watch the market. I can't afford to do that so I'm coding it up right now and will have this automated in a month or so (time willing).\n\nSorry you got spanked so hard when running this but it seems like you have learned some lessons.

{"title": "$ROOT DD: Breakout Confirmed and High Probability Setup to be $15/share Price Target (+200% gain)", "selftext": " To my fellow WSB investors,\n\nI would like to share with this community a high probability short squeeze set up play to $GME and $AMC based on fundamental and technical rationale. I am constantly monitoring short set up tickers on Fintwit, WSB, etc. (I keep a technical record & alert) as they've gotten popular and I have finally found a set up that is fundamentally sound- meaning high ROI, high probability, and low % of risk. These setups take time and most of the time, a long ass time. This is not a YOLO, HODL, etc. play and I never thought that $GME and $AMC were ever these types of plays. This is key as you are able to average down and hold safely for long term compounded gains.\n\nRoot Insurance ($ROOT) has finally made it to the top of my list as my highest conviction play this year. I've watched and played tickers like $MVIS, $CLOV, and now $SDC (all of these tickers are short term momo plays), but I strongly believe $ROOT is a technical/fundamental stock that emulates $GME/$AMC in the long term. I want to make sure you all understand that one of the main reasons why $GME/$AMC was so successful was because they're both high conviction \"marathon\" plays and not \"sprints\". This is what differentiates $ROOT vs. other ticker plays because it is currently a \"marathon\" play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is a marathon play that will lead to a high probability setup, high ROI, and low risk on investment? You need to have been present and study the fundamentals of $GME/$AMC vs. all other short term tickers that pumped and then dumped. The reasons why $GME/$AMC were successful and why $ROOT is setup to do the same are:\n\n1. High Conviction: The investors need to believe and be confident that they can hold these stocks until their price targets have been met. This is through stocks being fundamentally undervalued, vengeance, high risk/reward, M&A, retail business familiarity (i.e. AMC theatres, Gamestop shop), etc. You need high conviction as when scalpers or hedge funds sell and change the momentum downwards, high conviction investors do not sell but are able to hold (we believe in long term gains).\n2. High Institutional Ownership: As much as $GME/$AMC were shorted by hedge funds, they also had a high % of institutional investors. This is absolutely needed as they are able to hold a significant amount of the total outstanding float over a long period of time. Then this just leaves the shares float and the short float as a percentage of the shares float. i.e. $GME at times had ownership levels greater than 100% which confirmed naked shorting and FTD's taking place by short hedge funds.\n3. High Short Interest: Short Interest needs to be above 25% of the float at the minimum.\n4. Partnership or Benefactor: You need to have a benefactor or partner (high profile) who is willing to create support (large volume entry price) or hard carry/pull the price up if needed, especially on dips. Deepfuckingvalue is the sponsor for $GME and $AMC has Trey/CEO/Mark Cuban, etc.\n5. Fundamentals: Retail was already very familiar with AMC theatres and Gamestop stores. Fundamentals didn't matter as much because the price levels were so low due to Covid depressed demand. However, fundamentals like cash on hand, book value, Price/book value, Price/cash, revenue, net income, earnings, future earnings are all relevant. This is how you are able to determine floor prices or value for companies, future price targets, gauge risk vs. reward, compare similar industry companies to one another, etc.\n6. Technicals: $GME/$AMC were marathon plays and the squeeze didn't happen overnight (90% preparation/10% execution). What we noticed was high volatility in buying/selling, but every single dip was being bought- this created higher conviction holders day after day which reduced the amount of share float to be traded which created less of the float to be able to be shorted significantly. The short ladder attacks was also challenging to overcome, but we overcame it over time. Over a period of time, less and less shares were available to be shorted and we also noticed higher failure to delivers (FTD's) in which hedge funds were not returning borrowed shares (i.e. naked shorting). WSB caught this and made hedge funds pay. ITM/OTM call options were also being bought heavily which meant the shorts had to delta hedge or make sure they had the shares available in case the call expired ITM.\n\n[$AMC\\/$GME Squeeze Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/aa7kcvn8sft71.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=b19fb4e4cf800cdbd2d477ec5d20095452608fd8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$AMC FTD](https://preview.redd.it/zmqx4i1jsft71.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bd529f4f1ed5db964d84756a24564f4909f929f)\n\n7. Hooke's Law: \"*The force exerted on a spring is directly proportional to the distance it moves as a result of the force*.\" Just like how a highly compressed spring works, overtime the amount of compression/tension that was applied to the spring released and caused the greatest of short squeezes. The more time it takes to compress a spring, the farther it will jump.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**To my fellow WSB investors, now for the explanation on $ROOT (I'm taking this information from other sources on WSB as well).**\n\nRoot is a 6 year old car insurance tech company that uses telematics (collecting locational data and machine learning to make decisions) to decide which drivers they would like to insure/not insure. The more data they gather, the better decisions they'll be making to improve their loss ratio (profitability from charging premiums vs. paying out money which is an insurer's business model). Getting approval is difficult and it's state by state but they're approved in 32 States now. They also have an enterprise division which is the tech/telematics division of the company and is able to offer software as a service (SaaS). They are supplying their data to fleet management companies as well as other insurers which is another revenue stream.\n\nRoot had their IPO in late 2020 at $27/share and a $6.7B market cap. As of 10/8, they closed at $5/share (-81.4%) and $1.27B market cap. Per Finviz, their sales are $260M/yr, net income of $-500M/yr, book/share value of 3.06, price/book of 1.63, cash/share value of 3.76, and price/share value of 1.33. The net income is negative due to the high OpEx (operational expenditure on marketing, etc.). Fundamentally based on the amount of cash they have ($1.0B), they are undervalued based on their P/B and P/C compared to other insur-tech companies. They also have 249M total shares outstanding, 97M shares float, and a short float % of 34% although their most recent Fintel/FINRA Dark Pool Short Volume is 53%. Per Yahoo finance, Root has 75% of the float held by institutions at/above $11/share! These institutions like Silver Lake Group and Tiger Global are technology based institutions (they know what they're doing investing in tech). With Root currently being #4 in highest shorted stocks, their FTD's also confirm that they're continuously being shorted. June/July/August 2021 had the highest amount of FTD's (naked shorting) with the highest being over 3M ($20M) shares at one time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$ROOT Fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/oeq3j4vlsft71.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c6246e932cf4464d7c991765f80d374310915e9)\n\n[Fintel\\/FINRA Dark Pool Short Volume at 53&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/6pgx9tjdoft71.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=a775605c9c7bcfd06fcc94098e2f59d7215eca85)\n\n[Yahoo Finance Major Institutional Investor Breakdown](https://preview.redd.it/dupk2o4hoft71.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb446a9a105bf3c3324c3bbeb0d61c85036bf171)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Shares Failed to Deliver \\(From Fintel\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2o4eun8rsft71.png?width=1781&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc20905552f868da77299e7f9a6380c265430118)\n\nAs of 10/12/21, Carvana has confirmed investing $126M at $9/share (SEC Form 3- exercisable at any time and no expiration) for 11% equity (increased from 5%) in the business + a 5 year commercial partnership. Root has also issued 8 short/long term warrants exercisable at $10-$30/share and up to 129M shares of Class A common stock which represents 30% of Root ownership. As WSB already pointed out, this is a strong assumption that an acquisition could take place in the near future. I consider Carvana to be Root's benefactor. Their latest catalyst on 10/12/21 also included a 7% overall investment of outstanding shares by Schusterman Interests.\n\nTechnicals are self explanatory on this 1 year 1 day chart. This is a 1 year falling wedge pattern (beautiful!) with an RSI at 30-35 and an imminent breakout. You cannot get a chart as beautiful/predictable as this. Volume is also very important as of mid August, a lot of buyers have been stepping in (high conviction) on this value play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1Y1D $ROOT Falling Wedge w\\/confirmed breakout](https://preview.redd.it/38z2j0kpoft71.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4f88e8f75ca410fe338bca13f65d061cee962c)\n\nThe option chain for OCT is very bullish as there are 46K call options expiring on 10/15. There is a high uncertainty that these options will expire worthless as hedge funds pin the price to collect the premiums that are high IV. If the share price is able to go above $7.5 by 10/15, this alone would be a catalyst for a short squeeze setup. But again, uncertain probability and you need to manage risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Oct Call Option Chain](https://preview.redd.it/tlel14owsft71.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b16f6614496e497e81e3ca657b68b569f077069)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Position: I currently have 1,870 shares at an avg. price of $6.35. I will continue to add as much as I can.\n\n[My Position](https://preview.redd.it/i64pxuwxpft71.png?width=1640&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d629c27892e22d014310de067af78ea10e38146)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: $ROOT is my highest conviction play and IMHO, a high probability, high ROI, and low risk play that is setup to be a significant short squeeze resembling $AMC/$GME. The reasoning is due to high conviction long term holders, high institutional ownership (75% of float) at an average price >$11/share, high short interest at 35% and 52% on dark pool data, benefactor/partnership with Carvana where an M&A above 30% equity is possible, fundamentally undervalued based on price/book of 1.66 and price/cash of 1.33, technically on a yearly falling wedge/imminent breakout setup, and Hooke's Law where this setup is a highly compressed loaded spring. My short term price target for $ROOT is $15/share (+200%).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qd5vme47tft71.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=14e58b3af5e0e17c67b620186318655661e58193", "id": "q82n8x", "created_utc": 1634227174.0, "score": 333, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Weren\u2019t you adamantly claiming all of my fundamental numbers were wrong yesterday?

You subconsciously believe 100% runups in 15 months is fairly normal.\n\nEvergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real.\n\nAssuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood.\n\nWhy isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market. Just watch the Big Short again, there is a substantial period where swaps are not priced properly even as defaults skyrocket, as various investment banks try to get ahead of the crisis and \"head for the exit in a crowded theater.\"\n\nIMO, the people who are going to hurt the most are the thetards who have been selling naked puts and making bank for the past year and don't realize how exposed they really are. Are you fucking kidding me? Retail selling options in masse is a recipe for disaster. I hope they at least used spreads. Volatility is way undervalued given all the near-term concerns and it's entirely possible for some of the big ticker names out there to drop 50% over the next 3-12 months. Margin calls will fuel the downward spiral.

Censoring of information, stealing of company secrets, China is not the wondrous heaven of cheap production it once portrayed itself as.\n\nI\u2019m going to use the age-old adage: China is known to have inflated its GDP by building empty cities. It\u2019s very easy to spend a lot of money on domestic development that goes nowhere. Build badly-built houses and apartments. Have them sit empty for years as \u2018an investment\u2019. This is not news, *this has already been priced in*.\n\nThe biggest property developer doesn\u2019t have the money to finish its running projects because nobody\u2019s buying all that inventory, that is not news.\n\nI think it\u2019s highly likely that the housing market in China will collapse. I can\u2019t see it not collapsing. This will have a knock on effect outside of that market as people now suddenly have a lot less money to spend on other products.\n\nWe\u2019re also not seeing the social change this will bring as Xi Jinping will see his power house of a nation deal with the impact of his base seeing their savings be wiped out. That can lead to a behind-the-scenes power struggle which will keep China occupied for about a decade or so as their people adjust to the new realities of real estate becoming a lot cheaper.\n\nHow will that affect the West? I have no idea. There\u2019s going to be some effect, the most important I think is going to be China as a third party becoming less desirable as a partner. There are already semi-conductor factories built in other places than Taiwan because we need more of them and China being on hands-width away from Taiwan is not a stable environment for world development.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I'm guessing in '07 nobody thought bad loans and overbuilding of homes in the US would cause a global slowdown.

The idea that 2008 was a real estate crash is actually a bit of a misnomer... it was a divergence event. What happened was that housing prices went up so fast and without compensating wage growth that after years and years of it, and years of debt accumulation, consumers began to get locked out of the market and escalating costs caused people to start to default, which caused the a snowball affect across all zones... the housing market was only the most significant and obvious part of the divergence event.\n\nBecause the Fed wasn't doing easing of any significant level and because there was a deregulatory regime, nobody did anything to top the toxic asset climb into 2008. The ARM default in 2007 was just the canary in the coalmine, which quickly spread outside of ARM mortgages in 2008 because the debt squeeze was heading upward... but that just set the stage for the mortgage packaging problem, which was widespread across numerous retirement funds, and that impacting ING's insurance system.\n\nSo what you have there is basically a leveraged international packaging systemic issue driven by a wage/costs divergence event that had gone on for an extended period of time in the midst of an administration that did nothing about it whatsoever until it was too late. \n\nWhile we have inflation now, it's new and people are cash flush. There are debt issues, but easing is still happening and will take a long time to fully filter into the economy since M2 hasn't been fully distributed into the Main Street market. We're in a growth phase and seeing wage expansion. We're actually in a convergence phase.\n\nOne of the reasons that the packaged securities issue hit so hard was because of the insurance risk offset, that didn't work because it didn't account for a systemic risk across the board, and because we were a \\*traditionally safe real estate environment\\* which allowed those securities to spread far and wide.

One thing I am certain in is that at some point in the future the market will go down and also cease to exist. I just don't know when.\n\nThis is why I don't have all my investments in stocks. I wouldn't even care if there is a market crash that eclipses 2008 [tomorrow](https://tomorrow.In). In fact I'd even be happy to be able to buy at very low prices once I see the market starting to gain steam again.\n\nBull market, bear market. Makes no difference to me.
