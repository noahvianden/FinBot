{"title": "If you invested $1000 per month where would you put it and where should I put it?", "selftext": "Hello. Homeless here. I live in my car and I am looking to stocks to solve my problems. Ready to harass me with unkind things?\n\nBefore you do here are some facts:\n\nI make $11 an hour and work 40 hours a week.\n\nI make enough to invest over $1000 a month.\n\nI only spend $400 a month out of my $1500 - $2000 monthly pay.\n\nI plan on getting an apartment in 2022 at some point as well as a better job.\n\nI want to invest for the long term. My ideal minimum goal would be 10 percent profit every year and take out 4 percent per year when I retire.\n\nI have looked at many stocks past 5 year history and many of them are skyrocket. The ones that seem to go up up up and never really go down in the long term would be the ones I think I would invest in.\n\nI have at least a year of savings at $400 a month meaning my savings is at least $5000.\n\nHaving finally looked into stocks and looking up videos for about 100 hours and still having no real true 100 percent plan I know a few things. First: Stock market seems better than a savings account. Second: If I had invested 5 years ago I would have so much more money. Third: It seems some stocks will almost always profit over the long term. Forth: Inflation means stocks are a decent option instead of a bank.\n\nI did put a very small amount of money into stocks and so far have a 2.5 percent return. I put the money in 3 stocks and it increased. That was 24 hours ago.\n\nI have a decent savings account and I was wondering if I should put it all into stocks. The truth is if I put $5000 into stocks and lost it all I would not lose my life and could make it back but it would hurt my heart and make me want to stay in my car a bit longer.\n\nI currently am trying to better myself and I have come a long way. I won't get into that so try not to judge me to harshly. Right now I am at a point where I can invest a bit more at a low paying job, but I do intend on getting a better job when I can and then get an apartment so I can have a home and invest more money as well. But I also have no friends and no family. I am all on my own with the grace of God and perhaps your input here...\n\nBut currently $1000 is completely able to put into the stock market  every month.\n\nWhere do YOU personally put your money and where would YOU personally put your money if you were in my situation?\n\nWith inflation is it okay to start investing or is it too late now?\n\nWould it be best to stick with the stocks that seem to have a history of doing well or would they be overvalued due to the inflation lately?\n\nIn the long term what stocks do you feel will stand the test of time and keep raising even in times of trouble?\n\nPlease provide your thoughts and hope I am not too much of a loser.

If you learn a trade that adds $7 an hour to your earnings, that\u2019s $200,000 in present-day dollars over a 20-year period, assuming a 3% interest rate and 2,000 hours per year. (These numbers brought to you by that app.)\n\nIf you spend $5,000 on the cert, it\u2019s a 40x return that\u2019s immune from market sentiment.\n\nWhen I say \"trade\" don\u2019t assume it has to be blue collar or physical.

Just as with investing, glamour and actual results are not necessarily positively correlated.

{"title": "On Tesla's valuation", "selftext": "Tesla's valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like \"Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined\" or \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.\n\nThat said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla's market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla's trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.\n\n**For those who don't like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to \"The Numbers\"**\n\n----------------------------\n\n**The method**\n\nWhile trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**The trends**\n\nIn terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.\n\nIn terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.\n\nIn terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n**The future**\n\nObviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.\n\nThat said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.\n\nIn terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.\n\n----------------------------\n\n**The numbers**\n\nPutting all of the information from the previous section together, I have create a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024. In the worst case I assume there are significant unforeseen setbacks that cause them to fall short of those numbers, in the best case I expect them to meet or even slightly exceed them. This brings us to the following projection:\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|\n|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|\n|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nWhile I mentioned ASPs will likely increase, I have chosen to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 because it's too difficult to predict. This should make sure the final numbers remain conservative.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$70B|$85B|\n|**2023**|$100B|$135B|\n|**2024**|$130B|$165B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nBecause of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|14%|14%|\n|**2023**|15%|18%|\n|**2024**|16%|20%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$9,8B|$11,9B|\n|**2023**|$15,0B|$24,3B|\n|**2024**|$20,8B|$33,0B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Worst Case|Best Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|102|84|\n|**2023**|67|41|\n|**2024**|48|30|\n\n---------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nShould Tesla trade flat at around a $1T market cap and they continue on their current trajectory, they will be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Depending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock has between 1 and 3 years of growth priced in.\n\nSo to conclude, the popular sentiment that \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" is false.\n\n**Important side note**\n\nFor simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid \"FSD doesn't exist\" and \"energy is a scam\" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.\n\n**TL;DR: Based on Tesla's current trends, they have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.**", "id": "qj07jj", "created_utc": 1635595837.0, "score": 872, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 753, "comments": [{"body": "I believe 2023 will tell the tale. I mean the projected worst case is at 2 million cars sold.  My big question is: will there be enough people buying $50K cars .   Once Berlin and Texas fully ramps up: will there still be consistent appetite for $60K model Y and $45K model 3? \nThe projected worse case revenue is $100 billion.  \n1) USA: To put things in perspective: Rav-4 and CR-4 sells about 750K cars per year in the USA. They average about $30K/car.  Will Tesla be able to convert  buyers of $30K rav-4/CR-V to buy 750K model Y EVERY YEAR?? It will be daunting.  they might be able to do with model Y SR: but the revenue will be lower.  Personally: between friends, co-workers, and family: I don't know anyone that drives a >$50K ~~subcompact~~ compact suv.  They all drive rav-4, cr-v, tuscon/santa fe, rogue, forester, outback, escape, etc...I am unsure how many of those folks will buy a model y in the next 3 years....If I had to guess, maybe 1 or 2.  The rest: if they trade in: they will get one of the aformentioned vehicles.  \n2) China:  competition is fierce: the model Y already has SR version: revenue for this will be lower.  Berlin will open up: how many $50K model y/model 3 can tesla china sell?  most of model 3 sold in china is <$40K. and model Y sr in china is only $42K. \n3) Berlin:  I suppose tesla can still sell 500K model y/3 every year but competition is also fierce in Europe.  \n4) Cybertruck: this probably can only be sold in the USA/Canada: just too big for the rest of the world. there is a reason why #1 pick up truck in the world outside of north america is the Toyota Hilux.  I doubt Tesla can sell 1 million of these every year in the USA \n5) There is a reason the market cap for all automotive (ex-tesla) is only around $1.5 trillion.  Not everyone can afford $60K model y or $45K model 3.  That's why there is a lot of corolla, civic, accord, rav-4, etc. sold.  People who look to buy these cars are not going to cross shop with model y or model 3.  The argument againststhis will be: what if tesla makes model 2?? ok, they can; but revenue will be a lot lower.\n6)  Competition: Model Y and Model 3 are good cars. but they are quite expensive.  Tesla can own the upper echelon of electric cars. But luxury competition is there or will be there: ie. Lucid, Rivian, Audi/Porsche, BMW, Mercedes, etc...Yes those may not be #1 but they will get some market share. Then you add RNM, Toyota, hyundai/kia, Volkswagen group, Stellantis, Honda, and a bunch of Chinese companies then it becomes even more difficult. \n7) So I believe the only way for Tesla to achieve such high net income is through other means: this remains to be seen.  over 90% of their revenue is cars though. \n8) Capitalism doesn't allow dominance with high operative margins consistently on things that are capital intensive (ie. cars, airplanes, boats, computer hardware, etc.).  It is software that can do that.  Tesla has to prove that it can make money in software (which they might: they have been able to convince so many people to pay $10K for FSD...will they continue to be able to do so??). \n9) at $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap.

I think the demand in China is quite high and they probably can sell all of their production in China; but it will be at lower ASP and thus lower net profit.  To max profit they decided to ship many of those to Europe (well, the other reason is to maintain some market share due to introduction of their competitors ie.

Cost of ownership for EVs is well below petrol  cars, especially if gas prices stay high or go higher, and maintenance is very cheap comparatively. So the total cost of a $40k EV is more competitive than it seems.

Tesla can sell a lot more S and X than they're making now, add in cybertruck, plus a small number of high price vehicles like the new roadster and semi, and that starts to drag the ASP up.

That rollback lasted a day or two, not a big deal at all. I had 10.3 for a few hours and experienced the bugs - after sometime driving on FSD beta (which worked great) I stopped, put the car in park, and then I was no longer able to engage FSD beta. It was a minor annoyance to me, but hardly a safety issue in my experience. I got an updated version within a day or two with the bugs worked out. So to me, that was no big deal. Rollbacks happen all the time in software development.\n\nWhat makes me unqualified to test it? Why shouldn't I be able to test it? It's not like carefully driving a car is that hard. Anyways, I'm happy to test the software b/c I want it to A) exist and B) improve. Way too many people die in car accidents right now. I think FSD has potential to significantly reduce fatalities.\n\nWhy is Tesla the only company not paying professional drivers...?  Tesla has a team of thousands of internal testers, that test on all sorts of roads. It's not like this software is super risky - yes it requires an attentive driver to monitor it - I don't see a problem with them testing on public roads.\n\nIt's legal b/c it's not against the law. Driving is dangerous w/ or w/o FSD beta operating on the roads. Tesla's autonomous technologies make driving safer. Did you know there have been 0 accidents from FSD beta over the past year w/ 2,000+ drivers operating the software?\n\nThey do work w/ federal regulators to my knowledge. They repeatedly said they were happy to cooperate w/ all regulators on the Q3 earnings call. Do you have a source for your claim that they don't? I'd be happy to take a look at it if you do.\n\nWhy did they take customer deposits...?  FSD has included lots of beneficial features for many years now, so it's not like Tesla is deceiving customers here. Read what they say on their website, it's always been clear that FSD was incomplete, but that they were working on it.\n\nI don't believe Tesla said what you think they said to the California DMV. I think they were talking about the software that was currently on the cars - not software that was in development.\n\nI don't personally mind it being called full self driving - but I can see why some people don't like that and I can see how some people might arrive at the conclusion that Tesla was being misleading with that name, even if I disagree.\n\nI checked out your reddit profile, and it's clear you've got a big ax to grind w/ Tesla.

The other drivers on the road nor their municipalities agreed to this. Tesla conveniently also makes the beta customers responsible for whatever happens with their unfinished product, which also defeats the whole purpose of a self driving car.\n\nWould you accept them having customers test experimental brake pads on public roads??\n\nI put that blurb up on my bio because of dudes like you.

This takes us to what each industry is worth annually.  The auto sector is a 80 billion dollar industry. But energy is an 800 billion dollar industry in the US. Why does this matter? For that we have to look at Australia and the original big battery. An implementation kinda out of the blue on one the fly. It was put in to replace a peaker plant that had been damaged and needed replacing. From the go for approval of the project it was fully installed and connect to the renewable projects around it and to the grid to provide on demand power in under 100 days. Here is the big deal it immediately stabilized the grid which was Browning out and had sky rocketing pricing. So what did this battery cost?  10% of what a speaker plant would have cost 75 million dollars vs 750 million dollars. \n\nWhat was the major differences other than cost and time to being online? Well a peaker plant is a fossil fuel power plant that sits idle. It need to be fueled and maintained regularly. When called on kit usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes to start feeding power to the grid. This power is very expensive and also very slow. The big battery when called to feed the grid usually responds in milliseconds.  It actually responds so fast that Tesla jokingly complained that they were losing a few seconds of billing as the.power companies system could not respond fast enough to acknowledge the power coming into the system. Now unlike the peaker plant the battery pack gets it's power from late night low cost power from the grid or the wind farms around it. So even though it is distributing at peak times they are able to charge a much lower rate than the fossil fuel peaker plant. \n\nSo what is the take away? Well the plant costs were recouped by Tesla in two years and they even expanded the battery. Now it is pure profit with minimal maintenance needed and a 20 year life. Tesla has projects going in all over the world and utility licenses awarded to them. Tell me now that the energy side will not do anything to the bottom line.

Once there's enough infrastructure (charging stations), the range drop probably won't matter (other than forcing more frequent driving breaks, which is probably a good thing for road safety, even if it does make trips take longer), but it should be stored indoors or plugged in, to keep that battery from getting too cold, which may be a problem for some people.\n\nI don't really see any insurmountable barriers to Canada going 100% EV.

Being less dependent on other suppliers significantly increases their supply chain processing and leads to higher margins which at this point, I believe is the most profitable mass selling vehicle in the market. Definitely for EV's. Very few were creating supplies for EV vehicles so Tesla took it upon themselves to develop it on their own so they can properly control their production the best way possible. These other legacy manufacturers are lagging behind severely.\n\nYou have another showing numbers from Europe EV sales without realizing that Tesla has yet to even crack the European market because legitimately, EVERY vehicle Tesla produces is sold and because of huge demand in areas where they produce the vehicles, they can't get any to Europe without it being sold already intra-country.\n\nWhat OP hasn't even mentioned in detail are Tesla's other projects. If they weren't working extensively on these other projects and strictly focused on pushing out as many vehicles as possible, they would be crushing the profit. Their software is going to take some time to pay dividends but it will get to the point where you will buy a Tesla not just because of the performance but because the software is significantly ahead of their competitors.\n\nLet's also talk about the fact that new Tesla vehicles sold in America currently do not receive any federal tax credit and hasn't for many years. Yet vehicles are consistently flying off the shelves.\n\nAnother thing is Tesla's 'Model 2' which is designed to introduce an even more affordable mass-market EV in the likes that no other EV company will come close to replicating for the foreseeable future. Couple this Model 2, projected to be under $25,000 with federal and state subsidies, it will be stupid not to buy a Model 2 if you want the best performance for the best buck, dollar-for-dollar.\n\nI'm loving the direction Tesla is going. Constantly innovating while other EV manufacturers are behind. Some want to go fully EV by 2035. We all know why they won't go fully EV now... because they don't have the expertise, capacity, and capabilities to transition from ICE to EV without ruining their sales. I doubt they are making any profits on their EV's which is why GM doesn't even report EV numbers data separately as it would cause investors to pressure GM on their EV initiative.\n\nI'm not selling any of my shares for the next 5-6 years. If people think Tesla is a fad and that other companies are 'catching up', they don't understand the business. If they think Tesla is sitting idle and would just allow other companies to catch up when Musk is arguably the most innovative individual in the corporate business world we've seen in the last half-century, they are mistaken. This company constantly works on creating innovative technology and products.

I\u2019m holding about 140 shares of ARKG because I believe that genomics will be massive in ten years, so it\u2019s worth the long hold. \n\nBeyond that I\u2019m interested in fully automated vertical farms powered by solar wind and battery. Aside from it being hugely beneficial on earth, this is the kind of farming that will be needed for any life on Mars. \n\nPersonal feelings about Facebook aside, their plans for the metaverse have shown me how massive that market will be and while I\u2019m not going to invest in Facebook (Meta), I\u2019m looking for the companies that will help build the metaverse. I missed out on investing in the internet and I see the metaverse as a way to makeup for that. This is another ten year timeline before anything really even starts to get big, but once that happens it will explode. I think if we were to compare metaverse timelines to internet timelines, I\u2019d say we\u2019re somewhere in the mid \u201890s with it. So while I want to invest in a company, I think there is still a long time to make that decision, but essentially an entire virtual world needs to be created, so think about companies like wix and square space and how they could pivot from website templates to VR experience templates. Just compare the metaverse to the hertz deal. Which existing companies can pivot their existing model to take advantage of the metaverse. One HUGE example is Disney. Imagine them adding a subscription service to experience their virtual worlds. Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Frozen. There is no limit to what kind of experiences Disney can create in the virtual world. The metaverse is going to create a tremendous amount of wealth. \n\nApple has been toying around with making an EV for years, but their next \u201cone more thing\u201d is going to be a VR headset and that will dominate the market just like the iPhone. A VR headset and App Store could cause apples market cap to easily double. \n\nIf you watch the keynote at the following link you\u2019ll start to see how massive this is going to be. Put aside any feelings you have about Facebook and just look at this from the perspective of an investor. \nhttps://about.facebook.com/meta/\n\nThis company Cemtrex I think has a lot of potential and is currently at $1.38 a share, kind of a gamble but could pay off. I watched [this interview](https://youtu.be/PlDLL_tzJo4) with the CEO and he said a lot of stuff that I really liked and a lot of things that line up with everything I\u2019ve learned from investing in TSLA. Cemtrex has a few products including a security product that uses computer vision to monitor security cameras (could they utilize dojo), a smart desk (which I don\u2019t care about at all and think is kind of pointless), a few other things, but mainly I\u2019m interested in their work in VR. The one major red flag for me was when the person hosting the interview asked the CEO what his competitive advantage was, the first answer by the CEO was essentially saying that they outsource engineers from India so they are more cost competitive. Everything else was really good, but this is a somewhat concerning comment as that seems to\nImply that they have no competitive advantage, just that their stock is $1.30 so more upside than downside. \n\nTheir stock twits is pretty hyped though.

A call is where you have the right to buy, and a put is where you have the right to sell. To acquire this right, you need to pay a price. This is called the *premium*. You can also sell calls and sell puts, i.e. you have the opposite exposure to buying the same option.\n\nTherefore, you can have 4 position types:\n\n* Long Call\n* Long Put\n* Short Call\n* Short Put\n\nThe first two categories are lower risk because your losses are limited to your investment (the premium you paid). Short calls your losses are *unlimited*, similar to shorting.

Also, OPEC seems to have ended the price war that kept prices artificially low these past 5 years, but companies are still wary that they'll restart it, so they aren't drilling new wells.\n\nFood prices are tied to shipping (delays are mostly because of port closures in China and the still ongoing lag from the Suez canal closure), energy, supply chain issues (less food going to restaurants causing packaging issues), demand spike for consumer products, inability for supply increase due to long lag time (it takes a few years to increase the numbers if cows in a herd), closures of meat processing plants from covid spikes creating supply shortages, etc.\n\nInflation is real, but do you think all of these issues are permanent?
