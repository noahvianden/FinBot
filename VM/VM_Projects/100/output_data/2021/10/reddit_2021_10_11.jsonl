What if TQQQ droped below $100 per share which it could easily do. I continue to write calls at 140 strike? \n\nYou are absolutely right. Nobody said the Wheel strategy always works. What you are describing is one of the ways a Wheel can fail.\n\nI had 4 different Wheel trades that were in that state. For example, I wrote puts at some level like $80 and the stock fell to $60 and never recovered after months. It just kept trundling along between $60-$65. The $81 calls paid $.01 and I wrote those for a while.\n\nIn that case, I eventually cut my losses and wrote a call at $65 and just took the loss and moved on to new trades, never to touch that underlying again. **But it's still a loss**. No amount of collecting credit on the put or call side could make up for that $15/share loss.\n\nThis is why stock selection is critically important for Wheel success. Sometimes you'll get it wrong, but as long as most of the time you pick a stock that will go up on average, you'll never need to write a call below the cost basis of your shares.\n\n> If I'm truly doing a wheel strategy I'd like to open up a new CSP as soon as possible, so I thought a closer ATM/ITM call would call away my shares quicker so I could open up a new CS\n\nThat's an incorrect mindset for Wheeling. **Wheeling requires patience**. You should not rush the CSP phase. You have to play the game by the rules. And one of those rules is to not write calls below the cost basis of your shares, even if that means you only make pennies per call, *because you have faith your underlying will recover and grow on average*. You patiently wait for that growth to return to normal. Your CC phase may take months, but if your forecast for the stock is correct, it will eventually pay off without having to take a loss.\n\nIt's worth noting that everyone running Wheels since the pandemic started has had a rough time. Normal growth patterns are all disrupted by the pandemic. Sure bets that would have worked great in 2018 and 2019 don't work now. So don't judge the success/failure of Wheels by current market standards.

That's an essential piece of information for any discussion about a trade.\n\n> Let's imagine there is a large upward swing and the short call gets ITM before expiration and the holder decides to exercise it.\n\nHow long before? If we are talking more than a day, it's extremely unlikely, unless the holder of the call hates money. Early exercise, even for deep ITM calls, usually loses money for the exerciser. The only time this happens is if the holder will be compensated for the loss of time value, like they get stock in time to receive a huge dividend.\n\nSo let's say it is the day before expiration on the short call.\n\n> If I understand correctly, the short call would \"disappear\" and I would get shorted with 100 shares instead.\n\nNot \"instead\", but yes. A short call delivers shares and receives cash. So you will be short 100 shares AND you will receive 100 x strike price in cash.\n\nSettlement on assignment is T+2 for shares, T+1 for cash (like if the call was on SPX). So if expiration is Friday and we are imagining this early exercise happened on Thursday, you would be notified of the assignment sometime in the early hours of Friday morning, like at 3am. The call would disappear from your portfolio at open of Friday morning and the cash and/or short shares may also appear on Friday morning, but the shares wouldn't be settled until Monday morning. I believe, but am not 100% sure, that the cash will also not be settled until Monday morning. Unsettled shares and cash can \"appear\" in your positions view, but you can't trade on them until they are settled, unless you have a margin account and your broker will float you the settlement value.\n\nPut another way, you *might* be able to trade with the shares or cash on Friday, but it's more likely you'll have to wait until Monday morning.\n\n> So it would be better to sell it if I cannot cover without otherwise, isn't it?\n\nYes.

You may not get the *notification* until Saturday, but the exercise happened on the previous day.\n\nIn the old days, the official expiration time used to be on Saturday for Friday expirations, but that is no longer the case. 11:59pm on expiration day is the official last moment before expiration now.\n\n> do I need to pay interests to my broker for the shorted shares until the next trading day?\n\nMaybe, but at most it will be for 3 days if you intend to cover as soon as the shares and cash have settled. The amount of borrowing interest will also vary depending the status of the shares. Hard To Borrow shares could result in astronomically high borrowing rates.

First, as a beginner you should avoid holding anything through expiration. Expiration has maximum risk. Second, CSPs are **sold** to open, not bought. \n\nYou didn't mention how much credit you got. That is an important piece of information for making decisions. The credit remaining determines your exit strategy. A common exit strategy is: 50% of profit, 100% loss, before 12 DTE (assuming 45 DTE open). What that means is if you got $3 in credit at open, you would close or roll the CSP as soon as it was worth $1.50 (half of your initial credit), or as soon as it got close to being worth $6 (so you would lose 100% of the credit you collected), or if you are 12 calendar days from expiration with neither the profit nor loss level met.\n\nMore about trade plans and exit strategies here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan\n\nNow all that said, should you mistakenly open the CSP with too few days to expiration and are stuck on expiration day, yes, you would keep your entire credit if the stock is above your strike. If it is below your strike, however, you will be forced to buy 100 shares at the strike price.

It says that, all other things being equal, if TQQQ increases by $1 per share, the premium of this option (which is not information you have provided) will increase by .527 per share.  But all other things are never equal.  For example, it takes time for TQQQ's share price to increase.  In that time, time decay has an effect as well.  Plus, delta itself changes as the share price changes, which is why gamma exists.  Also, the strike does not enter into this.\n\n>Likewise - since it says Gamma is 2.0742, does that mean for each dollar the underlying goes up by a dollar, Delta will increase by 2.0742? Thus in this example; if the underlying wen to $136, then I would earn $54.7652 (52.6951 + 2.0742)?\n\nNo, it means that if TQQQ goes up by one dollar, with all other things being equal, delta will increase by .02.  (These greeks are, atypically, multiplied by 100, whereas greeks are more typically quoted per-share, like the option premium.)  If TQQQ were currently right at 135, then theoretically, if it went up to 136, delta (in per-share value) would become .529.  But again, all other things are not equal.  Time will pass, which not only affects the premium in its own right (a la theta,) but gamma itself changes with the passage of time and movement of the underlying!\n\n>Lastly - since Delta is -10.9375, does that mean regardless if price moves up or down, I am losing $10.9375 for each day I hold onto this call contract. If so, then does that also include the weekend? Since right now is Friday after the close, does that mean at the at open on Monday, I will already be down $32.83 (10.9375 X 3) for holding the contract for Friday, Saturday and Sunday?\n\nI think you mean theta, but yes.  Theta is a rate--in this case, dollars per day.  A rate represents continuous change.  Think of your car's speed in miles per hours.  If you're traveling 60mph, you're not remaining stationary for 1 hour then suddenly teleporting ahead by 60 miles.

The premium or trade price I paid for this contract was 7.17.

Each strategy has its pros and cons and suitability depends on the situation at the time.\n\nOne way to decide between the two is consider your risk/reward goal. A CSP can lose more money than a long call, if you include the risk of owning assigned shares. A long call has unlimited upside, while a CSP has a capped upside.\n\nAnother way to decide is if you are playing for or against theta decay. Use the CSP if you want to exploit theta decay, use the long call if you think theta decay will be a small cost of doing business.\n\nBTW, if you go for the long call, decide on the likely timeframe for the profit event and then add 50% + 10 days to the expiration, to give cushion time for your forecast to be right and to avoid the worst part of the theta decay curve. So if you think your profit target will happen in 5 days, use an expiration that is (5 x 50%) + 10 = about 13 DTE, give or take. If the next monthly expiration happens to be 18 DTE, go for that, as monthlies tend to have better liquidity than weeklies.\n\nThe way you decide which strike to use is again risk/reward. More ITM is more expensive, thus you stand to lose more if your forecast is wrong, but gives you higher delta, so more money for favorable movement and higher probability of profit. More OTM is less expensive and thus higher leverage for gain% and you stand to lose less, but gives you lower delta and less money for a favorable move and lower probability of profit. \n\nEverything in options is a trade-off, so there is no \"best\" when it comes to applying strategies.

Polkadot is a good one that should have it\u2019s moment in the sun soon with upcoming announcements. \n\nThe one thing I would keep in mind is BTC dominance. Bitcoin looks to be preparing for a hefty run to the upside, so altcoins (which is almost my whole portfolio) are having the liquidity sucked out as people pile into bitcoin. Once bitcoin has its run, altcoins are going to go insane and put in higher percentage gains than bitcoin.  \n\nThis is just from my research and I recommend you do your own, but I\u2019m expecting bitcoin to pull back to around 48K before we start really taking off. I\u2019m considering selling at least some of my alts to catch the bitcoin run and then moving those gains back into altcoins because I absolutely do not want to miss the train on them. \n\nBitcoin is your safest bet. Smaller returns (still likely a 100% return from 50K to 100K) with lower downside risk. ETH will outperform Bitcoin while still having similar downside risk, but altcoins like ADA, DOT, even Solana (which I have some issues with because of how centralized they are) will provide even higher returns once the liquidity flows back into them. \n\nAlso keep in mind that crypto has been in a bull run since March 2020.

Nice to get my own perspective instead of relying on YouTube videos.\n\nThe bad: It's jerky sometimes and not the most comfortable ride.  It doesn't reverse out of my driveway (but will start if I backed in).  The set speed and limit are too high on the unmarked road in front of my daycare.  It drives too close to center, and crosses center, of unmarked wide residential roads.  It crosses the solid white line when it's in the wrong lane at an intersection (it needs to either recognize the right only signs up on the lights, perceive the lane marking earlier, or have a map/memory of the area).  It feels fast, especially after driving like granny for 2 weeks.  I felt compelled to disengage when it was going 45 in the right turn lane approaching a green light (nav wanted to go straight at a light and into the other side and into a bunch of road closed signs)... it kept wanting to take me back to a closed road that was torn up... I slowed the set speed down, and it will gladly navigate around the road closed signs.  It's nowhere close to robotaxis ready and will scare the general public, like my mom, if I were to give her a ride.  I will have to lower the set speed often to feel more comfortable.  It abruptly slowed down to 15mph on a 50mph road before I took over because I changed the navigation destination and it missed a right turn.  It could probably kill someone if they're not being vigilant.\n\nThe good: What the hell.  My car just drove me from my driveway to daycare to home to work to my brothers to halfway home before an intervention at a road closure.  It was scary, but it did it.

Sure there might be a short term shock over a few weeks because some weenie babies cry over spilt milk but the market will bounce back. If say the Feds increased interest rates from near zero to 2% literally tomorrow at open then holy shitballs - there would be some massive chaos in the market, everyone adjusting and a new low equilibrium would be found. IMO this was the basis for Michael Burry\u2019s short a few months ago and Tesla\u2019s SP would be impacted significantly by surprise interest rates (which IMO there shouldn\u2019t be any surprise when it goes up mid next year and some tapering maybe later this year or early next).\n\nBut famous investors like Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet and many others do not do their investing (buy/sell) based on macro but instead focus on the business.

The SPY/SPYG picks were because we forgot to pick and they needed ETFs.\n\nMy girlfriend has a 7 year old boy and we have a 1.5YO daughter. I put together a list of stocks to pick from (like 200-300 to pick from, ETFs and 10+ of each major market sector). We let them pick or play games to pick. The 1.5YO rolls dice most the time lol. We put in $10 every week to whatever they pick. 25% must be in ETFs for some stability.\n\nThey'll have access to the money once they're 18, accounts are still in our names just in case, and we don't expect to cash out enough to increase the capital gains taxes.

It\u2019s important to recognize that even though a war is unlikely to happen, the market can still be shook in predicable ways just from sensationalist news hype, etc. Like the old adage says: \u2018Buy the rumors, sell the news\u2019. Folks are commenting on this post from the perspective of \u2018what happens if war occurs\u2019 or \u2018how unlikely it is\u2019. Neither of those are the point. The point is the following: \u2018how will the markets be affected by the prospect of continuous, increasing hostile rhetoric?\u2019\n\nPersonally I am buying some shares and short term OTM calls in DFEN, which is a leveraged ETF that tracks defense stocks. Some quick background:\n\n-\tThe People\u2019s Republic of China (what we think of as China) considers the Republic of China (what we think of as Taiwan) as an integral part of their territory\n-\tThe Chinese government has rattled their sabres for decades and has consistently and vehemently declared Taiwan as their territory, and pledges to reoccupy it \n-\tThe United States has taken a diplomatic soft/strong approach where they oftentimes seem to pledge to protect Taiwan but do so hesitantly in fears of provoking the Chinese \n-\tTaiwan has the 19th largest GDP in the world and is home to Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), one of the most successful and prolific semiconductor companies \n-\tRecently revealed reports show that the US is helping to prepare Taiwan for an eminent invasion from China\n-\tRecent US weakness in global geopolitics (Afghanistan RIP) may make adversaries more brazen and likely to consider provocative actions\n-\tThe Chinese and Taiwanese governments have both recently made numerous statements and declarations regarding an eminent invasion. Hostilities are markedly at a more than short term high.\n\n\nSo given the ongoing tension, and recent notable increase in hostile rhetoric, how can we prepare ourselves?\n\nLet\u2019s say the rhetoric increases\u2026\n\n-\tHow would TSM share price be affected? Would competitors like Intel be an interesting play?\n-\tHow would this affect the current semiconductor shortage and associated logistics issues?\n-\tWould defense investments be a good idea (Boeing, Ratheon, Lockheed, DFEN)?\n-\tWhat can we do now?\n\nWe should always keep in mind that stocks can and will be affected without a single bomb necessarily falling.
