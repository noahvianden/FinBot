However make an entire generation homeless, poor, and hungry and you will get yourself a revolution quick smart. China knows this, it happened before, and that is why they are rapidly moving to knock the current housing situation on the head with an iron bloody hammer. The majority of people, the workhorse of their nation, can no longer ever hope to afford to buy a home to live where they work (sound familiar? It is a global trend). They watch their 'big city' counterparts earning 100x their wage and buying multiple properties worth more than their entire families intergenerational wealth and despair.\n\n# **Political Power.**\n\nThe rising house prices are not only causing unrest in the majority of population, they are also shifting the balance of power from the government to 'land holders'. There is a reason why you can not buy land in China, you can only lease it from the government for up to 70 years. Holding the ability to grant or revoke land rights gives the government power, large wealthy developers and individuals are seen as a threat to that. That is why China is also cracking down on wealthy tech businesses and billionaires at the same time.\n\n# **Debt and Growth.**\n\nFinally, debt. The debt issue in China is like a noose around the neck of their economy. People poor more and more money in to buying and building homes, but homes do not actually generate anything, they are simply a roof over your head. They do not manufacture, they do not innovate, houses produce nothing, and yet housing investment makes up more than 30% of China's GDP and is quickly becoming/has become their primary growth sector.  As the bubble grows the real growth of the nation slows and what is left is an economy based on false wealth of having the most brick boxes.\n\n# **China is not going to step in to save shit.**\n\nDevelopers will be picked apart by the government vultures and parceled out to party favorites till all that is left are the rotten bones. They will finish existing developments to pacify the people and ensure debts to contractors who actually make things are repaid, but only so those contractors remain whole in order to build factories and infrastructure. All while convincing the majority of their population that this is because of the greed of the wealthy and they should trust in the power of the communist government more to see to their needs thus increasing their political power.\n\n# **Manufactured 'crisis'.**\n\nThey are intentionally putting their country through a period of self imposed recession in order to rebalance the economic scales. They started this process over a year ago, they have been preparing for the fallout it will have.All major governments know what is going on and they do not like it because it could cause people to wake up to the international ponzi scheme that is real estate \"wealth\" while exposing their ever weakening economies.
