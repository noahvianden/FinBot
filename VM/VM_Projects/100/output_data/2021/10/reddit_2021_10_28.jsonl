Leaked reports, if true will be able to beat AMD at their respective price points. (Of course AMD can always just play price cuts. Additionally, AMD has already showed their new tech V Cache which can supposedly improve peformance by up to 15% over their existing 5k Ryzen series but those will come ETA 1st half 2022.) Intel is also going to release GPUs (which will probably be buggy since its the first time Intel is selling GPUs), but they \\*claim\\* they can fight with Nvidia's RTX 3070. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNew CEO May be good for intel. He was the ex VMWARE CEO and used to be an Intel employee before. Was mentored by Intel's founder. He tripled VMWare's revenue while he was their CEO from 2012-2021. Intel is also investing heavily into R&D and making new foundries, which is in line with USA's national interest in not being overly reliant on an endangered Taiwan SMC in case China takes over it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportantly, Intel just failed their Q3 earnings HORRIBLY (AS EXPECTED from SHITEL) and cut guidance. Their stock crashed from $56 last week to $48 today. The stock is partially beat down (though imo, i think it still could bleed out further. Will pick up more INTC if it drops more.) Expectations for this company has been reduced due to their poor performance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy buy these calls instead of the stock? Because there is almost no theta for these calls. $30 strike + $18.15 = $48.15 for a 2023 LEAP. And $40+$8.05 = $48.05 for a 3mths call. Stock is at $48.05 at time of posting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a half decent chance that Intel can do a partial AMD. AMD was a loser that made inferior cpus for 10 years. Intel has been a loser for 2 years. Even being competitive with AMD is an upgrade from being a loser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Intel has positive catalysts in new, competitive CPUs launching on Nov 4.

{"title": "Facebook changes company name to Meta", "selftext": "Facebook on Thursday announced that it will change its company name.\n\nThe name change, which was announced at the Facebook Connect augmented and virtual reality conference, reflects the company\u2019s growing ambitions beyond social media.\n\nOver the past few years, the company has ramped up its efforts in hardware, introducing a line of Portal video-calling devices, launching the Ray-Ban Stories glasses and rolling out various versions of the Oculus virtual-reality headsets. The company has indicated that augmented and virtual reality will be a key part of its strategy in the coming years.\n\nIn July, Facebook announced the formation of a team that would work on the metaverse, a classic sci-fi term Facebook has adopted to describe its vision for working and playing in a virtual world. Two months later, the company said it would elevate Andrew \u201cBoz\u201d Bosworth, who is currently the head of Facebook\u2019s hardware division, to the role of chief technology officer in 2022. And in its third-quarter earnings results on Monday, the company announced that it break out Facebook Reality Labs, its hardware division, into its own reporting segment, starting in the fourth quarter.\n\nFacebook also said this week it\u2019d spend about $10 billion over the next year developing the technologies required for building the metaverse.\n\nZuckerberg on Thursday also provided a demonstration of the company\u2019s ambitions for the metaverse.\n\nThe demo was a Pixar-like animation of software the company hopes to build some day. The demo included users hanging out in space as cartoon-like versions of themselves or fantastical characters, like a robot, that represent their virtual selves. \n\n\n\nFacebook changes company name to Meta https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-company-name-to-meta.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard", "id": "qht5z1", "created_utc": 1635445233.0, "score": 1412, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 664, "comments": [{"body": "This reminds me of when Snoop Dogg changed his name to Snoop Lion", "score": 1062, "replies": [{"body": "Puff daddy enters the chat.", "score": 202, "replies": [{"body": "Poppa diddy pop", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Edward Norton to Brad Pitt and back again!", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13287889957427979}, {"body": "Snoopdi scoop lion shit", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ye", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13540662825107574}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3653263449668884}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36689871549606323}, {"body": "P.

SaaS is the best, easiest recurring revenue model in the market right now, in my opinion. It's my top reason for liking the company.\n\nI think FB is probably a decent bet to beat the market right now, but I don't invest in companies I despise. It's unethical data mining practices turn me off. I also personally know more people leaving the platform than people who are excited to use it. People are growing tired of social media, in my experience.\n\nSame goes for Amazon. They're digital Walmart to me. Low pay for employees and gutting local retail with prices brick and mortar can't match. Now, if they'd spin out AWS, I'd be in...\n\nI don't use Apple products personally, and I find their hardware to be expensive for the brand rather than the performance. Like FB, they're probably a good bet to continue to beat the market -- everyone has a phone, and their footprint in China grew some 80% last quarter, a record for them -- but I invest in what I know and use, which isn't Apple products. I'm also not crazy about retail stocks, which could also be applied to Amazon. Again, give me all the SaaS; it has so much less overhead.\n\nI think Netflix is a bad product in general and I no longer use it. I find their original content to be horrible and their service to be expensive. Same as FB, I personally know plenty of people leaving their platform. If I'm out of the service, I'm out of the company.\n\nI don't have as much to say about Google. I use a lot of their products and services, sometimes without even knowing it's Google owned. Anti-trust legislation is a real concern with Google (ironic if I like MSFT, I know). It's a company I'll probably end up putting some money into at some point, but right now I'm more excited about other opportunities.\n\nBUT ... I've been at this for only four months!

And oh yea, they are the most expensive too. But to their defense, they do, by far, have the best dev support of the big 3 but the achieve this by being a lot less flexible and much more limited in capability. \n\nIt is what it is. MSFT is not going to catch up. They will reach a limit and abruptly stop growing once all their legacy partners convert. But that said, MSFT will always have major legacy enterprise which is highly profitable. But the truth is they havent innovated anything in about 20 years... They arent as bad and corrupt as IBM or T but they are definitely not innovative either. \n\nIf anyone catches AWS it will be GC. They do have some advantages but man... legacy is hard to shake. AWS being the 1st out the gate with reliable cloud really matters. So many companies are entrenched in theirs that its very hard to move over and simply not worth the cost. We are going through this right now at my work. We went with GC about 1 year ago but we got bought out and our mother company is all AWS... and to integrate our teams and streamline administration we will need to move to AWS as well.

Salesforce is a different story entirely in that regard and their moat is Huge because you can\u2019t escape that platform.\n\nGoogle cloud will probably have the best interface and will be the winner in terms of usability and features but the windows enterprise ecosystem is Microsoft\u2019s bread and butter. As a cheap bastard I find all of them expensive but wealth buys what they already know and flock to it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There is no common tie between consumer use and cloud. Thus the familiarity argument doesnt apply at the consumer level. Cloud is exclusively a enterprise tool. Applications run on cloud, but cloud is not the application. You can just as easily run any MSFT cloud application on any of the cloud providers. It would perform better on GC and AWS especially internationally.\n\nSo the only familiarity we need to consider is enterprise. The problem with enterprise is professionals arent as limited as end users. So you ask a dev or admin which cloud to use and they will tell you that it will depend on what kind of functionality do you need, what performance you want, what kind of support, and finally how much you are willing to pay. Based on those, they will select a provider but none of the questions will be what phone or OS you run or what do you run in your local server room because it doesnt matter.\n\nAlso note that MSFT is actually not the internet server leader. In fact I seriously doubt their cloud runs windows. They never were internet server leaders because windows to this day, is still not very reliable for server use. Unix won that fight by a huge margin long ago. I know MSFT has made strides but trust me, its still not even close. We moved from Windows Servers 2016 to GC last year (Debian boxes) and guess what? We went from servers requiring regular maintenance every other week (because ultimately memory problems cause instance crashes) to literally not a single crash since last year.... NOT ONE. Nothing changed with the core server code and we still run some old windows servers so we know its not the code. Its just windows... its memory management design is just not reliable for server use.\n\nSo in terms enterprise internet servers MSFT is actually not the familiar face at all. But again, MSFT has their strengths which is why I still like them. MSFT strength is LAN management servers (not internet/WAN). They own that space. Further their tech support, is bar none, the best in the industry as stated above but it comes at a cost of both money and flexibility. Want to do something out of the box? MSFT is probably not for you. If you want maximum functionality you need AWS. If you want the best performance then Google has the best worldwide server farms. Azure will do fine, but again, its mostly just their old contracts being turned over to cloud.

Now, not sure if that is just from increased efficiency in the battery or also from being able to deplete it further (i.e. in theory a capacity increase), but seems with the 4680's Tesla's batteries will match of exceed the efficiency of Lucid's battery, with no clear way to improve on efficiency (tabless cells should be near 100% efficiency).\n\nThinking about it this way, makes sense how Lucid did what they did. It also strongly indicates that their batteries are expensive, as adding those extra tabs is not going to be an efficient process, like the 4680's.\n\nJust some food for thought here. If I am right, it helps explain why Lucid's cheaper models (the upcoming Touring and Pure) are not price-competitive and don't have better specs than a Model S LR. Simply put, the batteries Lucid is using is too expensive. 118 kWh's at $150 per kWh (making up numbers here) is $17.7K for a battery pack. On the other hand a 100 kWh pack (more efficient and gives lots of weight reductions so Tesla will actually get competitive range with less kWh's) at $75 per kWh is only $7.5K.\n\nFurther, if I am right, then bottom line being the best at manufacturing will be what sets Tesla apart. Lucid, will struggle with an overly expensive cost of manufacturing, which will prevent them from scaling or actually competing with Tesla in a meaningful way.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I doubt it's something like that, is not just the adding more tabs, while that would help, that would only be at peaks of power, and this is not what we have at EPA testing\n\nI never looked much at them, but the specs seem confusing, for example, they give a consumption of 250 Wh/mi on the charging rate spec, if we assume that this is for EPA highway, this means the pack is actually 130 kWh, unless that is from the wall, but that makes no sense to quote like that\n\nWe also have exploded view with 4 modules removed, that could mean that those packs have around 105 kWh for 406 mi range, a little bit less efficient than the Model S 2021 LR\n\nCharging we will need to see, but are safe (ish) to assume that the new Model S and X can support a peak of 300 kW in a 100 kWh pack, so 300 kW on a 130 kWh pack is amazing but not as much, if it also supports 300 kW on the 406 mi variant, which I doubt since they explicitly say that 900 V architecture is just for some versions, it will be good", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "EPA tests by depleting the battery and then charging, measuring the amount of charge the batteries take (in kWh's) and then doing their driving test till the car is depleted. They don't go by the spec on the battery.\n\nSo in simple the EPA is measuring input kWh's and output miles. So if Lucid is getting more range it almost certainly means they are more efficient. I don't think there is any doubt that battery efficiency is not perfect, so if you can improve that you can get more output miles per kWh. The 4680's with tabless have 5X the capacity and 6X the power and get 16% more range. That tells you, reducing electrical resistance improves battery efficiency. Hence, I suspect Lucid is using customized and expensive cells with extra tabs attached in order to achieve greater efficiency. Could be I am wrong, so would really like to see a teardown.

From an economic perspective it's a tradeoff between your enjoyment now, and your enjoyment in the future. If ~~you~~ *your friend* work more now, then that will be less enjoyable, but they'll have more money and security long term, so hopefully the free time in the future will be more enjoyable. So the factors to consider are:\n\n* How much they hate the job\n* Security, if there's already a good nest egg and all the basics are paid for, then that makes working more much less enjoyable\n* The diminishing returns on more money. Having more assets pretty much protects you from worrying about stuff, buying an extra boat or a fancier vacation tends not to make people much happier. Things like having strong social connections, giving to others, etc. tend to make people much happier than buying stuff for themselves (although a certain amount of money can make those things easier)\n* How much success and feeling like accomplishing personal goals matter. If \"getting to that level\" feels good, then that will offset some of the negatives\n\nPersonally, if I really *hated* my job, and I was financially secure otherwise, I don't think I'd keep going. But feeling \"successful\" at work doesn't really matter to me. Or maybe more accurately, it's possible to get the same/similar feeling from being successful at other things. We can take up hobbies that are competitive and do well at those, we can be successful working/volunteering at a charity or non-profit, we can take up artistic pursuits like writing or painting that can lead to concrete achievements (getting published, having a show in in a gallery, etc.) And having lots of savings/investments can make all those things easier and more enjoyable. \n\nPersonally, I think when your yearly investment returns start to make your annual salary seem less significant, that's a good time to consider retiring. If you're making 10-20% per year on investments with a 20% capital gains rate, then investing is probably as good as working around $4-5m, and you'd be making significantly more by $10m.

Like all that titanium might save a few pounds? How about instead of spending three years of the average american income (or 10 years of the average global income) I just take a big shit before I go drive my car, and it'll save the same amount of weight. For the same amount of money, on some bit of engineering masturbation that no one ever will be able to detect, I could change a college student's life by paying off their loans, or a family's life by paying off their mortgage. \n\nAnd the worst part is that 99% of these cars are going to sit in a garage and never be driven. They're not even fun to drive on the road. I think the Ferrari 360 might've been the last top end Ferrari that was actually enjoyable to drive on the road if you actually car about driving and not just being seen driving. These cars are all too wide and too low and mostly have terrible visibility and huge overhangs with expensive carbon fibre bits hanging out waiting to get scrapped off,  and the god-damn flappy paddle gear boxes will make you lose your mind if you ever get stuck in traffic. And they're so composed and balanced that there's no excitement unless you're going 100 mph and endangering everyone's life. And so it make sense that these cars spend their whole lives either parked in garages or valeted in front of expensive restaurants. \n\nAnd the Plaid is better than all of them. It's more fun to actually drive on the road, it's safer and more efficient and you can fit a couple extra people in them if you want to have a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois when you get back from the expensive restaurant.
