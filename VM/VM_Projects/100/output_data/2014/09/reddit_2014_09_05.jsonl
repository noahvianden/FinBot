GET OUT OP, PLZ!!!\n\nWhile Im here, and so many of you asked me options questions, Ill use this as an example to eroding time value.\nWIth only a few hours left for the trade to \"work out\", you would have to sell the contracts at the bid price, which is hwat anybody would be buying them off you would actually pay.  Now, with time quickly running out and traders are not looking to stay in an option with only a few hours left to live, the 'possibility' of making a profit in a limited time like this shrinks the market for traders themselves. \n\nWhat does this mean?  It means that in a parobolic move, possible traders are walking away not even looking at this trade, for example, 1 trader walks away, then 2, then 3, then 5, then 8, then 12, untill there is no market left for the contract.. what happens next? the stock begins to skydive (not by much but i wouldnt be surprised if it drops down 1-2%, fully eliminating the entire contract untill it simply expires and gets wiped out by the close.  \n\nIf this were a longer term contract,like say a month or so, then some traders would indeed buy the contract to hold it for 1 week at most if they anticipate the stock to move 5%+.\n\nWIth the bid/ask spread being 2% on such a time cap, the risk might be worth the reward.. but if the spread is 20% between what the bid (going rate) vs the ask (what youd want to sell it for), youd have to have the contract move 20% in just one day JUST TO BREAK EVEN.
