{"title": "The americanpegasus $16k pennystocks and crypto portfolio (for the lulz...): GASE, SKTO, ZMSPF, [DOGE], [NYAN]", "selftext": "Hi gang,  \n  \nFirst of all, please don't PM for investment advice.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not licensed to give a cat investment advice, much less a human.  \n  \nThat being said, I'm going into next week in **full lulz mode**.  \n  \nBased on rumors, hype, and other insanity around Reddit I am 100% leveraged into a multitude of downright *insane* investments.  That's real money people, and the best part: *psychologically significant* money.  \n  \nWhy?  If you didn't already know, I'm $20k in debt and have no savings.  I also like to live... *dangerously*.  Please do not copy my trades with the expectation of making money.  I will probably lose my money.  There's a good chance you will too if you follow me.  \n  \nTHAT being said.... :)  \n---------------------------------  \n  \n------------------------------------------  \n  \n**GASE** (*8521 shares / $6,143*): This is a new stock promotion off of the Ukranian energy crisis.  I did a large write-up already on WSB: (http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1wjdka/so_im_gonna_play_around_with_some_penny_stocks/)  \n  \n**SKTO** (*60k shares / $1818*): I dunno.  HeezyB said I should buy it.  Also there's a link that vaguely implies something that I don't understand, probably about how I'm going to lose my money: (http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pharmajanes-otcbb-aegy-announces-launch-175000186.html)  \n  \n**ZMSPF** (*2222 shares / $1793*): 3D Printing?  The moon?  What if we printed a new moon?  That could work, right?  Also, this ticker has FIVE full letters in it.  That's 25% more letters than most other tickers.  Based on that alone I give it 17-thumbs up.  Oh yeah, and some really rich smart guy said to buy it.  That's good enough for me.  \n  \n**{DOGE}** [crypto] (*2 million Doge / $3000*): LOL, I can't believe I paid like $300 per million for these.  Unreal.  I used to hold like 5 million, but I moved about 3 million into NYAN because I believe in that one too.  Anyway, with the halfening (when block rewards are decreased by 50%) approaching mid-February and more exchanges adding DOGE/USD transactions, I believe there's still some run left in this before the next crash.  However, it is extremely expensive currently, so I'm ambivalent about it at the moment.  \n  \n**{NYAN}** [crypto] (*200k Nyan / $3300*): This is less of an investment, and more of a personal project for me.  I am heavily invested into building the Nyan coin and community, and I plan to give away a large amount of my Nyancoin as I help introduce it.  I think this is going to be the end 'cat' alt-coin and think it's horrifically undervalued right now (about $400k marketcap, when it should be around $3 million).  But again, remember that I am heavily involved in the promotion and community building of it, so please don't take my advice on this one.  My goal is to eventually hold 337k of this because that's a significant Nyan-esque number.  \n  \n------------------------  \n  \nSo how fast do you think I'll lose all my money WSB?  I promise to post here if I have any significant position changes, because I do aim for full disclosure.  Anyway, this represents 100% of my savings and assets as of COB Friday.  \n  \nExciting times we live in, huh?  \n  \n----------------------------  \n  \n**edit**: All out of SKTO and ZMSPF for a little bit of profit, but not much.  Got 20% on SKTO and lost like 5% on the other.  \n  \n**edit 2:** Sold out of remaining GASE yesterday.  Looks like a possible failed pump; not chancing it.
