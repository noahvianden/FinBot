To the point of \"the audiences don't view them as political\" everyone viewed Black Panther as political, we just didn't have the weirdos coopting the word \"woke\" until years later. Like, seriously, go on the Black Panther subreddit right now and ask if the original movie is \"political.\" All the fans (people who saw and loved the movie) will say, \"Of fucking course.\" And I'm sure you're going to try to handwave them away as not being representative of the larger population as if  the people who did enjoy it the most are somehow detached from \"society\"\n\nAnd, yeah, you can argue that you can find examples of anyone saying anything.

{"title": "You're going to lose your shirt betting on Ev's", "selftext": "Over the past few years, I have seen this sub (among many others) buy into the EV hype and try and justify the insane valuations that some EV companies are trading at. There are a couple points that I would like to make, and I would love to have a discussion with anybody who would like to.\n\n* The top auto manufactures have a combined 2.7 trillion in revenue, 215 billion in earnings, and 2.2 trillion in market cap. Meaning the ENTIRE (or at least vast majority) of the auto manufacturing industry has a P/E of 10, and a P/B of .81.\n\n\\-Your favorite EV stock is trading at a P/E of 42 and a P/B of 8.22, meaning that to justify the valuation of Tesla, they would need to have 4.2 X the earnings and 10X the revenue of the auto manufacturing industry as a whole long term. I didn't write this post to single out Tesla, but it was hard to include P/E of other EV manufacturers because virtually none of them have positive earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor frame of reference, it's also worth noting that generally the PE ratio of the automotive industry is about 7-8, meaning that the industry as a whole (not just EV companies) could be overvalued. There's an argument to be made about potentially increasing margins due to the changes in the manufacturing process (EV's will have better margins) and technological advances justifying a higher P/E ratio across the board, but in the short term, getting those technological advances put in place is going to cost auto manufacturers a ton of money (should they choose to implement them). Tesla and the other EV manufacturers have an advantage when it comes to this, because they've committed to EV's only and don't have to worry about manufacturing ICE and EV at the same time or building the infrastructure to rollout EV's largescale. However, the traditional ICE manufacturers are going to follow the money, and if the money is in EV's, they will gladly lose money in the short term for earnings in the long term. We are already seeing this with virtually EVERY major auto manufacturer developing an EV.\n\nThe Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, etc investors presupposition that these companies are going to surpass traditional ICE manufacturers because they manufactured EV's first makes zero logical sense, and if you look at the history of \"disruptive innovation\" (as the guru of the hour calls it), it's almost never the first companies that disrupt an industry that are the most successful long term. The EV only companies have never been in a better position for market share than they were in the past, given that the traditional ICE companies are competing with them in EV's now.\n\nThe EV investors are also presupposing that the world will be moving to EV's only, which I don't believe will happen. There is certainly a reality in which the majority of new vehicles being bought are EV's, but there is also one in which they will not. There has been a lot of talk by politicians about EV mandates (these keep getting pushed back but are apparently still going to happen) but in the real world, there are a ton of people who prefer ICE vehicles and would not drive an EV. There will probably be a battle between the left and the right about these mandates and your guess as to what happens with that is as good as mine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, keep in mind that a move to EV's doesn't inherently mean more money for manufacturers. People aren't going to be buying more cars just because they switched from ICE to EV. These stocks will most likely do what they've always done and largely grow near the rate of the economy or slightly lag behind it. I'm not sure what Reddit's obsession with low margin, labor intensive industries is, but there are much better investments to put your money into.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you REALLY want to bet on EV's, find a traditional manufacturer at a good valuation that's betting on EV's. Volkswagen is a good one in my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer\\*\\* I do not own stock in any EV companies, but do have an open position in GM\n\nEdit: Typo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1bqjpyn", "created_utc": 1711699232.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "Most EV companies will go bankrupt.

I'm not so pessimistic personally when looking at recent developments. From the most comprehensive recent review I've been able to find recently:\n\n> The EU accelerated its shift away from fossil fuels in 2023, with record falls in coal, gas and emissions. Fossil fuels dropped by a record 19% to their lowest ever level at less than one third of the EU\u2019s electricity generation. Renewables rose to a record 44% share, surpassing 40% for the first time. Wind and solar continued to be the drivers of this renewables growth, producing a record 27% of EU electricity in 2023 and achieving their largest ever annual capacity additions. Furthermore, wind generation reached a major milestone, surpassing gas for the first time.\n\n> In addition to clean growth, falling electricity demand also contributed to the drop in fossil fuel generation. Demand fell by 3.4% (-94 TWh) in 2023 compared to 2022, and was 6.4% (-186 TWh) lower than 2021 levels when the energy crisis began. This trajectory is unlikely to continue. With increased electrification, this rate of demand fall is not expected to be repeated in the coming years. To reduce fossil fuels at the speed required to hit EU climate goals, renewables will need to keep pace as demand increases. \n\n> The EU is firmly on its way to transition from a fossil-based system to one where wind and solar are the backbone. In 2023, 24% of hours saw less than a quarter of electricity coming from fossil fuels, a major step up from just 4% of hours in 2022. As this shift becomes even more evident, so does the importance of enablers of a clean power system. Alongside wind and solar growth, grids, storage and demand side response will determine the power system of the future.\n\nSource: https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/european-electricity-review-2024/", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "In my street there is a hundred Cars, we already have barely enough regular places to park.\nIf me and my poor hundred neighbours would buy an unaffordable EV, i would be rected, because there are no possibilities to charge all that cars.\n90% of the private people here that drive an EV own a home, and a second car that is a combustible.", "score": -8, "replies": [{"body": "Public charging infrastructure is getting developed everywhere and will get better as it gets deployed (granted for now it's mostly in Western and Northern Europe but it'll spread all around the continent in the same proportions soon enough).

Tesla has ramped their auto division faster than anyone else in history so it often masks other revenue streams, but really just looking at the growth of these other segments (54% and 37% respectively) and the margins (50%, and 30%), it\u2019s fairly clear these will be where Tesla actually makes most of their profit in the future. It means they can keep pushing vehicle prices down to poach market share while still staying profitable. \n\nRobotics, AI, FSD, etc would be the cherry on top where if even one of them is successful it would 2-5x the market cap. But megapack and superchargers are real today and I think a lot of people miss the value add that\u2019s going to come from them. \n\nFully ramped, each megapack facility adds $20-25B in revenue at a 50% margin, and there\u2019s 2 expected to be fully operational by next year with a third on the way. They want 15-20 megapack factories by 2030, but even if you assume that\u2019s wildly optimistic and only 5-6 get built, that\u2019s still $100-150B in annual revenue. \n\nSupercharging is just as lucrative now that every major automaker has adopted Tesla\u2019s charge port design. They\u2019ve got ~50,000 supercharge ports globally and want to double that number every 2 years going forward to 2030. They\u2019ve monopolized a booming ecosystem where they get paid upfront for sale/installation, and then get perpetual royalties for charging. Often-times they\u2019re now pairing their superchargers with solar panels and megapacks to further offset cost and drive up margins.\n\nJust my $0.02 as someone who works in the energy industry and is seeing the parabolic demand shift EVs and AI chips are causing. A decade from now Tesla will most likely be an energy company that also happens to sell vehicles.
