{"title": "Tesla stands to earn billions by opening U.S. chargers to drivers of Ford, other EVs", "selftext": "As of Thursday, owners of Ford electric vehicles \u2014 the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning \u2014 in North America finally have the ability to power up using Tesla Superchargers.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley wrote in a post on LinkedIn that the charging partnership, which involves use of fast-charging adapters, should \u201cimprove the EV ownership experience,\u201d for Ford EV drivers, noting that \u201cI\u2019ve tested it myself and its works great.\u201d\n\nTesla has forged a similar agreement with General Motors, which was announced in June, giving GM customers access to more than 12,000 Tesla fast chargers in the U.S and Canada. GM CEO Mary Barra said at the time that her company expected to save up to $400 million of a planned investment in building out EV charging stations.\n\nThe partnerships mark a strategy shift for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who for years touted the exclusivity of Tesla\u2019s charging network and his company\u2019s ability to build reliable charging locations that would keep consumers from sitting in long lines. Becoming the charging standard has required Tesla to invest heavily in technical and business development.\n\nBut Tesla has plenty to gain from working with others.\n\nSam Fiorani, vice president for global forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said these efforts should eventually yield huge financial benefits for Tesla, including from environmental credits and fees for charging sessions.\n\nCurrently, Tesla operates about one in three charging stations in the U.S. Even if adoption of battery electric vehicles slows domestically, and the fleet of electric vehicles is smaller than what the government and many automakers planned six months ago, \u201cTesla could still see $6 billion to $12 billion a year,\u201d by 2030 from its expanded charging business, Fiorani said in an email.\n\nWhile Tesla could lose some customers to other brands by making charging easier, AutoForecast said there are other reasons car buyers flock to Tesla.\n\n\u201cPeople shopping for a Tesla aren\u2019t typically cross-shopping at Kia, Ford, or Mercedes-Benz dealers because they simply want a Tesla,\u201d Fiorani wrote. \u201cCompetition will continue to heat up and Tesla will inevitably lose some sales to rivals, but loyalty to the brand means the vast majority of owners will return to Tesla with little or no comparison shopping.\u201d\n\nAllowing other automakers to tap its charging network also opens up some federal money for Tesla under President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\u201cTesla is not afraid to use government regulations for income and has been working all possible revenue streams for much of its existence,\u201d Fiorani wrote.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for further information.\n\nTesla reports charging revenue with its \u201cTotal automotive & services and other segment revenue.\u201d The company hasn\u2019t said whether it may break out revenue from non-Tesla vehicle use of its charging network.\n\nWilliam Navarro Jameson, Tesla\u2019s Strategic Charging Programs lead, wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday that getting to this point with Ford has required a lot of \u201cinteroperability testing\u201d along with creating all the necessary hardware and software integrations and working through legal issues.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many pieces to this puzzle that have been put in place over the past 18 months,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOn social media, Tesla touted the opening up of its charging network in North America and circulated a link to entice more retailers to host Superchargers at their facilities.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/tesla-to-earn-billions-from-charging-partnerships-with-ford-others.html", "id": "1b3kl34", "created_utc": 1709264726.0, "score": 549, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "So Tsla is going to be the Shell and Chevron EV Charge station for America?", "score": 266, "replies": [{"body": "Yes and more.\n\nJust why do you think Tesla is valued more than all the other auto makers combined?
