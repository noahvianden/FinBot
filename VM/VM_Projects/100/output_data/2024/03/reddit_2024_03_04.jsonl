Then the attorneys could in theory vote their shares against our interests. And the final harm is that they proposed no restrictions on when and how they can sell, which means they can just dump the shares on the open market (remember when Elon sold billions in 2022 and cratered the stock, and the stock still hasn\u2019t fully recovered despite the broader market at all time highs?).\n\nSo there is a campaign to make sure that the Deleware court is flooded with letters opposing the legal fee:\n\nhttps://x.com/teslaboomermama/status/1764425180116660320?s=46&t=tR1HmRezK8kVu8Ep9gB5gw\n\nThe big point is that there is no financial benefit from what the lawyers achieved. The lawyers argue they won a $55 billion financial benefit for shareholders by rescinding Elon\u2019s comp package, but in fact, the Tesla board could simply put the same $55B package to a revote with proper disclosures (as requested in the original complaint), meaning that there was no financial benefit, only a procedural one.\n\nTo protect our interests, I highly recommend that we write letters to the court.

McCormick,\n\nI invested in Tesla starting in 2020 after spending several months investigating the company. I was impressed by its products and management which are largely due to Elon Musk\u2019s ability to recruit and organise engineers of the highest quality. \n\nAmong other things, I invested because of the compensation package awarded to Mr Musk. I considered it to require the achievement of milestones which were extremely ambitious, but which would make worthwhile targets even if they were not met. I believed that this compensation package was an interesting and innovative way of providing a meritorious incentive to Mr Musk for his work in the company. \n\nAs a shareholder, I was dismayed by the lawsuit. The plaintiff\u2019s attorneys did not represent me or my views. I consider it to be frivolous at best and probably deeply malicious. \n\nI wanted Mr. Musk to have his 2018 compensation package when I invested. I would vote for it again now.  There was no benefit to shareholders from the lawsuit. \n\nLosing the compensation package might well remove any incentive Mr. Musk has to work for Tesla and this might well cause extreme damage to the company and its stock price. \n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s attorneys have done nothing for me as a shareholder and in my opinion are entitled to nothing. I strongly feel that it is unjust that the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys have asked for such an egregious payment in shares. This dilutes the voting power of the existing shareholders. They should have to justify a cash payment, if anything.\n\nShareholders\u2019 rights should remain paramount. \n\nI have made some money from investing in Tesla, but now I am potentially going to lose a large proportion of my money depending on how this case proceeds. This could cause extreme damage to the stock price and impact my savings very badly and I am worried about what you are going to decide. \n\nI thank you for considering my views as a small shareholder and I look forward to your response.\n\nYours sincerely,\n<my name>", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "LOL, how is saving shareholders 50B not a benefit?
