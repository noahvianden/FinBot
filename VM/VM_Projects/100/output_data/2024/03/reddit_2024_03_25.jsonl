Meanwhile, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, sold $150 million in stock last week, his first cash-out since taking the top job at the bank 18 years ago. Around the same time, Leon Black, cofounder and former CEO of Apollo Global Management, shed $172.8 million in stock\u2014also a first-ever stock sale. \n\nIn dozens of trades since the beginning of February, Mark Zuckerberg unloaded about 1.4 million shares of Meta stock worth roughly $638 million, according to an analysis from insider stock sales data firm Verity.

{"title": "EU launches probe into Meta, Apple and Alphabet under sweeping new tech law", "selftext": "The European Union on Monday opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta, in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation.\n\n\u201cToday, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet\u2019s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple\u2019s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta\u2019s \u2018pay or consent model\u2019,\u201d the Commission said in a statement.\n\nThe first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called \u201canti-steering rules.\u201d Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.\n\n\u201cThe way that Apple and Alphabet\u2019s implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering,\u201d EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said during a press conference on Monday.\n\nApple has already fallen foul of the EU\u2019s rules on this. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.\n\nThe third probe focuses on Alphabet. The European Commission said it is looking into whether Alphabet\u2019s display of Google search results \u201cmay lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google\u2019s\u201d other services such as Google Shopping over similar rival services.\n\nThe fourth probe focuses on Apple. The  Commission said it is investigating whether the company has complied with obligations under the DMA to ensure that users can easily uninstall app on iOS and can easily change default settings on iOS. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine.\n\nThe Commission said that it is \u201cconcerned that Apple\u2019s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called \u201cpay and consent\u201d model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The Commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service, is in violation of the DMA.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta\u2019s \u2018pay or consent\u2019 model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.\u201d\n\nThierry Breton, the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, said during a press conference that there should be \u201cfree alternative options\u201d offered by Meta for its services that are \u201cless personalized.\u201d\n\nGatekeepers is the term used to label large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU.\n\n \u201cWe will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,\u201d Vestager said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/eu-launches-probe-into-meta-apple-and-alphabet-under-sweeping-new-tech-law.html", "id": "1bnaa9e", "created_utc": 1711362402.0, "score": 438, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Didn't Google shopping already get sued for this and they changed their ranking algorithm as a result?

Steam is competing with GOG, Epic, EA, Ubisoft, Xbox, Blizzard, itch.io, and a number of smaller companies yet still manages to print an astonishing amount of money.

Do you think the App Stores marketshare is going to suddenly drop just because people have options? Of course not.\n\nYou also haven't refuted my logical consistency claim. Alphabet (Google) makes Android, which is also used for cheap subsidized devices, yet no one is hesitating to argue that they should be forced to face additional competition. For that matter, do you think Nintendo should be compelled to open the Switch simply because it *isn't* being sold at a subsidized price? It's a line of reasoning that leads to nonsense.\n\nThe principle of hardware openness is not something that should be defeated simply by asserting that your business model \"requires it\". Subjecting companies to different standards based solely on their per-unit profit encourages those with lucrative exclusive software storefronts to price their device just low enough to qualify as \"subsidized hardware\". There would be absolutely nothing stopping Apple from doing so.\n\nPC is an entirely different ballgame, and the average console user absolutely is not going to seriously consider switching.

Current pricing is too high **even if it works** and most people won't pay which means take rates and Tesla revenues are lower than they could be. \n\nIt isn't worth 12k to most people unless it is actually a level 4/5 system but I don't think current cars can get there without better hardware.\n\nFord offers Bluecruise for $800 per year. GM's SuperCruise costs $2500 upfront or $25 per month. Sounds pretty fucking reasonable compared to $200 per month or $2400 per year. \n\nSo lets say right now there is a take rate of 5% because it is too fucking expensive for most people and most of them are not nerds like you and me. That means Tesla is making a paltry $600 per vehicle. Sure they may get 50% of the 95% of people to try it for 1 month on a whim at the $200 price. That is still only $700 of revenue per vehicle. \n\nCompare that to FSD at $4,000 and still a rather pessimistic take rate of only 25%, that would yield $1,000 per vehicle. And more importantly 5x more people would be exposed to FSD while riding in their friend's Tesla.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5969581604003906}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3227896988391876}, {"body": "A Model 3 LR with FSD is $82,000 CAD.
