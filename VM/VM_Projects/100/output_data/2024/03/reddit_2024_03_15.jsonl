Furthermore, if inflation hasn't gone down yet and at this point, is starting to go up, what makes you think it will magically go down?\n\nThink about what the fed would have to do in order to maintain market stability after having lowered rates when inflation is increasing and or stagnating.

{"title": "$TSLA market cap will never be under 1 trillion after this year", "selftext": "TL;DR I work in deep tech, I did not believe proper full self driving can be done, but it's happening for fucking real. v12.3 is genuinely close to the real FSD that Elon has been promising since 2016. There's zero reason why this won't propel $TSLA to trillion-dollar club.\n\nI'd originally bought $TSLA at $20 (adjusted for splits) back in 2018, sold most of it in 2021 (helped me buy a house), and started loading up again since last week. I work in tech, and deeply understand engineering. There were many reasons for selling my shares besides needing cash. For example, I did not believe in the business prospects of Cybertruck, Optimus, solar roof, and similar new products. But by far the biggest reason was I couldn't see FSD happening for real, because of technical limitations. Elon has himself said that Tesla valuation should be close to nothing if FSD does not materialize. Without getting into too many details, I studied the technicalities behind it, and my conclusion was it's just not possible. And it started to feel like Elon is trying to hide that reality and fool people (and himself).\n\nBut, a new technology arrived, and that conclusion became invalid. And I've been amazed how swiftly a large company like Tesla has taken full advantage of it.\n\nWe all know something changed in the technology space since 2022: large neural nets (built upon the transformer architecture) that power ChatGPT, Bard/Gemini, etc. This same technology has started powering Tesla FSD since last couple of versions of it. Similar to how first version of ChatGPT was very good, but with many flaws, all new FSD (with end-to-end neural nets) was very good, but with many flaws. Well, now v12.3 is out, as of last week, and it's now *extremely good, with very few flaws*. It's really just a matter of solving edge cases now; at least as far as launching it in the US is concerned.\n\nI actually believe now there is no technical reason why true FSD cannot be done. In fact I think it'll be fully achieved this year itself. And we all know Elon is going to demo the shit out of this \u2013\u00a0may be even dedicate an entire public event to this by end of year. When that happens there's nothing stopping $TSLA from getting to ATH and beyond. So I'm buying.
