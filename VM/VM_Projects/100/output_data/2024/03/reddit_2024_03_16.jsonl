The Fed's Leading Indicator Hasn't Been Wrong Since 1966, And The Answer Is Clear.**\r  \nWhen viewed over long periods, Wall Street's three major stock indexes -- the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average, the broad-based S&P 500, and the growth-stock-heavy Nasdaq Composite -- have risen in value, without fail over time.\r  \nHowever, it's a far different story when viewed from a narrowed short-term lens of months, or even perhaps a few years. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite can be completely unpredictable over shorter timelines. In fact, all three stock indexes have alternatively traded in either bear or bull markets in each successive year since this decade began.\r  \nTruth be told, there is no perfect forecasting tool or ideal blueprint that's going to provide 100% accuracy. There are no indicators that are going to perfectly tell investors or economists what stocks, or the U.S. economy will do next. Nevertheless, there are a couple of reliable predictive tools and money-based metrics that have, over extended time periods, correlated strongly with moves in the stock market and/or U.S. economy.\r  \nOne of these reliable indicators, which happens to be a leading economic indicator tool used by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has an uncanny track record of forecasting downturns in the U.S. economy.\r  \nAt the moment, the U.S. economy is humming along nicely. U.S. gross domestic product is growing positively on an annualized basis, and the labor market appears healthy, with the unemployment rate clocking in at a low 3.7% for January. But there are storm clouds on the horizon.\r  \nEvery month for the past 65 years, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's recession probability tool has utilized the spread (difference in yield) between the 10-year Treasury bond, and three-month Treasury bills, to determine how likely it is that a recession will occur over the next 12 months.\r  \nNormally, the Treasury yield curve slopes upward, and to the right. This is to say that bonds set to mature in 10 or 30 years should generally have higher yields, compared to short term Treasury bills maturing in one year or less. Normally, the longer your money is tied up in fixed term, interest-bearing securities, the higher the yield should be. Generally, longer-term debt carries higher risk, and thus higher interest rates than shorter-term debt. The most recent inversion between the 10-year Treasury bond and the three-month Treasury bills occurred in late October 2022. Since then, the yield curve has remained inverted.\r  \nBut when things get out of kilter, and investors are clearly concerned about the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy, the yield curve tends to invert. And just as the term implies, a yield curve inversion occurs when short-term bills spike to higher yields than long-term bonds. The greater the yield-curve inversion, typically the higher the probability of a recession occurring. Also, the economy has typically fallen into recession within six to 24 months after an inverted yield curve.\r  \nThat being said, a yield-curve inversion doesn't guarantee a recession is imminent. There have been inversions where a recession didn't take place. However, every recession that's occurred since World War II was preceded by a yield-curve inversion. It's been a telltale harbinger for every economic downturn since World War II.\r  \nOver the past year, we've witnessed the steepest yield-curve inversion in roughly four decades. Not surprisingly, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's recession probability tool now indicates that there to be a 62.94% likelihood of a recession taking place by or before January 2025. Although this isn't a guarantee, nor is it the highest recession probability on record, it does mark the one of the highest probabilities for a recession to take place since the early 1980s.\r  \nThe Fed's leading recession indicator doesn't have a perfect track record of forecasting downturns -- but it's pretty darn close. Despite a recession probability of over 40% in October 1966, no economic downturn occurred. But since this incorrect prognostication in 1966, any time this recession probability tool has surpassed a 32% likelihood of a downturn, one has taken place not long thereafter. With a reading of 62.94%, the writing would appear to be on the wall that a recession is very highly likely in 2024, based on this predictive indicator.\r  \n\r  \n**Equities and Recessions:**\r  \nSince 1955, equities have peaked six times after the start of a yield-curve inversion.\r  \nHere are the years when equities peaked after yield-curve inversions:\r  \n\r  \n**1955**: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) reached its 52-week high after the yield-curve inversion.\r  \n**1988**: Another instance where the DJIA reached its peak following an inversion.\r  \n**1998**: DJIA reached its 52-week high during an inversion.\r  \n**2000**: The dot-com bubble era saw the DJIA reach its 52-week high after an inversion.\r  \n**2006**: The DJIA reached its 52-week high once more after the yield curve inverted.\r  \n**2019**: Most recently, the DJIA again reached its 52-week high following an inversion.\r  \nAlthough the U.S. economy and the stock market act independently of one another, corporate earnings often suffer when U.S. economic activity slows, or shifts into a recession.\r  \nIf the NY Fed's recession tool proves accurate, and a recession comes to fruition in 2024, a sizable pullback in equities can also be expected.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble", "recession", "dow"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Shorted NVIDIA and Bitcoin last week.
