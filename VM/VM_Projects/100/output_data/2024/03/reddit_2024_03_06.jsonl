Please :).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">How does selling calls lower the cost basis\n\nIt won't literally change the cost basis i.e. the number that's shown by your broker. But if you want to keep track of the premium you collect in e.g. an Excel sheet, you can think of it as lowering your cost basis that way. Getting some of the money back that you spent to buy the shares in the first place.\n\nObviously if you manage to do this enough times over the course of several years (for long term holders), you can get most, if not all, of your money back, meaning your cost basis of the shares will become \"zero\". The shares then become a risk free investment aka playing with house money. Or if someone really believes in the company, then they can simply reinvest the call premium into buying more shares each time.\n\n>The premiums you get from selling calls are subject to short-term capital gains. So you're still creating a taxable event, right?\n\nYes, but it will be negligible compared to taxes you'd have to pay by realizing gains on shares. Imagine someone has been holding NVDA for years and they're up 800%. Yes it would be considered long term capital gains, but the short term taxes for a covered call will be nothing compared to the taxes of realized gains on a hugely profitable share position. That's the beauty of option leverage. You can use small tax events to manage around (i.e. avoid) much larger tax events (i.e. shares)\n\n>How would you deploy covered calls in the OPs case to their benefit?\n\nWhen Google stock gets overbought, you sell an OTM call as sort of hedge, but it's not a true hedge obviously because the delta of the call will only decrease as the share price drops.\n\nIn OP's case it would have been at the end of January when Google stock was beyond the 2 standard deviation bollinger band and a whopping 78 on the daily RSI. That screams \"overbought\" and would be the time to start managing risk.\n\nWhen a stock is overbought there will be great demand for calls which means the call premiums will be juiced. In OP's case they could've sold a .30 delta OTM call for above average premium (due to juiced demand). And because the stock is overbought, OP can use this call premium to finance a long put (\"protective put\") that's near ATM as a way to lock in their gains, since overbought stocks tend to correct. This allows OP to protect their gains without creating a taxable event for their shares. This is actually known as an \"option collar\" and is a popular strategy for risk managers.\n\nIf your protective put does go ITM and is ITM nearing expiration, you don't have to let it get exercised and lose your shares. You can simply sell the put to close the position and lock in the intrinsic value.\n\nIf OP feels their OTM covered call is or will be threatened, that means call premiums are still juiced which will make rolling the call up and out much easier.. But it has to be done while the option still has plenty of extrinsic value. Preferably OTM altogether. If a covered call gets too deep ITM it will greatly increase the difficulty of managing such a position.\n\nIf I was OP I would not sell a call as of today. They did nothing to manage their gains in January and have since experienced a 15% downturn.

{"title": "New York Community Bancorp tumbles 40% and is halted as troubled bank reportedly seeking cash infusion", "selftext": "Shares of struggling New York Community Bancorp. fell more than 40% on Wednesday amid reports that the regional bank is seeking a cash infusion.\n\nReuters and the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the bank was looking to outside investors for cash to shore up its balance sheet. NYCB did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nThe stock was halted for news pending when shares were down 42%.\n\nShares of the bank were already down sharply on the day before the reports. The stock is now below $2 per share after starting the year above $10.\n\nA cash infusion would be the latest development in a turbulent start to the year for NYCB. The bank disclosed in late January that it was dramatically raising the allowance for potential loan losses on its balance sheet. That was followed shortly by Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgrading the bank\u2019s credit rating to junk status, and NYCB naming former Flagstar bank CEO Alessandro DiNello as executive chairman.\n\nThen last week, NYCB disclosed that it had \u201cidentified material weaknesses in the company\u2019s internal controls related to internal loan review\u201d and announced that DiNello was taking over as CEO.\n\nThe questions surrounding NYCB are reminiscent of those that swirled around Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic before all three failed in the spring of 2023. They were among several regional banks that struggled as higher interest rates pushed down the value of older Treasury holdings and led some depositors to move their accounts elsewhere.\n\nWith the U.S. economy continuing to show surprising strength and inflation still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, traders have been dialing back expectations for interest rate cuts this year. Those higher rates could keep pressure on the banks themselves and on commercial real estate, which is a key business for NYCB and many other regional lenders.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/new-york-community-bancorp-tumbles-40percent-and-is-halted-as-troubled-bank-reportedly-seeking-cash-infusion.html", "id": "1b86tv0", "created_utc": 1709748908.0, "score": 644, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "JP Morgan Chase: \"This will make a fine addition to my collection\"", "score": 267, "replies": [{"body": ">JP Morgan Chase: \"This will make a fine addition to my collection\"\n\nUmm...

I don\u2019t got time to write essays and soliloquies on what is essentially social media. And your right I want economics to follow fundamental economic laws so the children of America can have a prosperous future. Some of you are greedy souls with heads in the sand or even worse aware of the situation at hand trying to obfuscate the economic understanding of these not educated in it to keep your paper net worths inflated. Anyone that works in banking know that you borrow against your assets as your assets rise in value so a drop in valuation has a house of cards effects as one is borrowed against the other. Literally there are so many textbooks that were the gold standard decades past that say everything about our current way of doing business economically is ultimately a Ponzi scheme. We will never pay back our debts, only way we go into a giant war to avoid paying or we enslave the middle class through austerity. See Germany WW1 and 2. That\u2019s the only way this goes 10-30 years in the future. Just like we have laws that should stop illegal immigration already in place but not being enforced. We have fundamental economic guidelines that were adopted for our banking system which are not being enforced. And what happened with svb shouldn\u2019t have happened and what did happen was it opened up a new emergency mechanism that they could use at free will till the program was ended. Look into it, the mechanism has a loophole that allowed the banks to borrow against their treasuries at the values they bought at and not what they had on hand and some were using that to buy more treasuries further increasing their ability to borrow more. It\u2019s not talked about. Because unless you do your own research they do not tell you how they screw you. And yes I\u2019m making my money in the markets. It\u2019s getting easier and easier every day cause the corruption is so blatant and you just copy the corrupt. But again I care about the future of Americas children! I\u2019ll leave this for food for thought, if you think that the Svb bailout was so innocuous then why even create the new cash \ud83d\udcb0 injection mechanism for banks to borrow more cash based on treasuries on the values they were bought at and not currently at? Why open up the mechanism to all banks and not just distressed ones? Why not put limits so healthy banks couldn\u2019t dip in. There\u2019s a reason and the reason is money. If you\u2019re an elite your properties are north of 20 million. You have dozens. You need this inflated real estate game to keep going. All the elites in America are colluding together. It\u2019s one big team. Money never lies. Always follow the money trail. Today why did the former Treasury of the United States of America bailout NYCB with his firm? Why is government finance positions just a revolving door to Wall Street? That too after NYCB made a deal with the feds to absorb SVC assets, on the day that Powell was suppose to testify to congress. If you thought I was talking conspiracy before I\u2019ll give you a real one now. The prior is just facts. Dems want rate cuts so Biden becomes president. Powell and repubs want Trump obviously so they want to cut rates next year . They intentionally waited till today (Dems) to make the bank that absorbed SVC look like it was failing a year after the banking issue as Jerome was testifying to put pressure on him to lower rates. But trumps buddy Steve comes through with cash injection saving the day. Because they cannot lower rates this year if they want Biden to lose.

{"title": "NYCB shares soar 30% after troubled regional bank announces $1 billion capital raise", "selftext": "Struggling New York Community Bancorp announced a $1 billion capital raise and a leadership shakeup on Wednesday, headlined by former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nNYCB has agreed to a deal with several investment firms including Mnuchin\u2019s Liberty Strategic Capital, Hudson Bay Capital and Reverence Capital Partners for over $1 billion in exchange for equity in the regional bank, according to a press release on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMnuchin will be one of four new members the bank\u2019s board of directors as part of the deal. Joseph Otting, former comptroller of the currency, is also joining the board and taking over as CEO.\n\nReuters and The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Wednesday that the bank was looking to outside investors for cash to shore up its balance sheet. The stock was halted for news pending when shares were down 42%.\n\nShares of the bank were already down sharply the day before the reports. The stock is now below $2 per share after starting the year above $10.\n\nThe cash infusion is the latest development in a turbulent start to the year for NYCB. The bank disclosed in late January that it was dramatically raising the allowance for potential loan losses on its balance sheet, with its exposure to commercial real estate being a potential issue. That was followed shortly by Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgrading the bank\u2019s credit rating to junk status, and NYCB naming former Flagstar bank CEO Alessandro DiNello as executive chairman.\n\nThen last week, NYCB disclosed that it had \u201cidentified material weaknesses in the company\u2019s internal controls related to internal loan review\u201d and announced that DiNello was taking over as CEO, for what proved to be a brief tenure.\n\nThe questions surrounding NYCB are reminiscent of those that swirled around Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic before all three failed in the spring of 2023. They were among several regional banks that struggled as higher interest rates pushed down the value of older Treasury holdings and led some depositors to move their accounts elsewhere.\n\nWith the U.S. economy continuing to show surprising strength and inflation still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, traders have been dialing back expectations for interest rate cuts this year. The higher-for-longer rate environment could keep pressure on the banks themselves and on commercial real estate, which is a key business for NYCB and many other regional lenders.\n\nThe struggles for NYCB may have caught regulators off guard as well as investors. The regional lender acquired much of Signature Bank out of receivership from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last March.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/new-york-community-bancorp-tumbles-40percent-and-is-halted-as-troubled-bank-reportedly-seeking-cash-infusion.html", "id": "1b898d8", "created_utc": 1709754458.0, "score": 468, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "Who would ever think that buying stocks of bankrupt banks give best returns ever.", "score": 354, "replies": [{"body": "In ~2008 Mnuchin and co bought Indymac for ~$1B and then sold it for $3B in 2015, in part by kicking people out of their homes.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Here, he will kick property owners out, too.

That time period gave us a lot of massive swings to the downside and upside, so it's a good time period to test its robustness. The data presented are live trading results / out of sample data, so no hypothetical results. Here are the statistics from Interactive Brokers:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/U2OSwLH\n\n* Return: +50.138% vs SPY +37.702%\n* Max Drawdown: 4.41% vs SPY 16.68%\n* Sharpe Ratio: 2.50 vs SPY 0.91\n* Sortino Ratio: 3.33 vs SPY 1.39\n* Daily Standard Deviation: 0.48% vs SPY 1.03%\n* Downside Deviation: 0.36% vs SPY 0.68%\n\nI wish IBKR would provide upside/downside capture ratios like Kwanti does, but they don't, so I had to run a manual calculation of the weekly upside/downside capture ratios.\n\n* Upside capture ratio is 0.47, so when SPY is up 1%, my strategy is up 0.47% on average.\n\n* Downside capture ratio is a NEGATIVE 0.14, so when SPY is down 1%, my strategy is UP 0.14% on average.\n\nIt's quite remarkable, and it's my life's greatest work, so it's not accessible to the public since it's a proprietary creation. It's what I use to manage some client portfolios that are sophisticated enough to understand the risks of trading options. The only thing I can tell you is that it's a trend following strategy and I primarily use weekly SPY expirations to take advantage of the steepest part of the theta erosion curve. The algo is a sizing mechanism, much like the card counting mechanism in blackjack. When the odds favor good cards coming up, you size up your bets, and when the odds favor bad cards coming up, you shrink your bet size. Do this thousands of times, and you get quite an edge. For card counting, it gives you a 1% edge, so odds of winning are around 51%. The algo is much more forgiving, with a win rate of 85.7% in 2023.\n\nWhat are some of the stumbling blocks you're running into that's preventing you from accomplishiing what you're looking to do?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s absolutely unbelievable\u2026 congrats! Thank you for such a detailed and thoughtful response. I read your question to me as to what\u2019s wrong and the answer is me. I\u2019m what\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve wasted years of time and energy and money and have gone nowhere and now I\u2019m watching everything I\u2019ve worked my life for just melt away because I refuse to buy and hold and risk getting destroyed in the next 10 years just to be back to even at the end of it.

I\u2019ve spent years learning and trying to find my way and I also find it hard to trust because there\u2019s a lot of frauds out there.

I understand where you're coming from because I've been there too. It hurts to suck, and I sucked at this for a long time, and I know what it's like to go nowhere for years. I realized I was always scared of losing money, and it caused me to be too cautious. I would give up lots of upside because I was so worried about the market falling. I learned later that markets behave in peculiar ways, and that investors gain confidence the higher the market goes, so it's a self perpetuating mechanism that reinforces itself, and when markets fall, confidence erodes and investors reduce their allocation to investments, again creating a self reinforcing mechanism. Hence the need to have a trend following system. I created the algo to be custom tailored to my personal psychological makeup, where I hate to lose and I'm always afraid of the market going down. That's where an unbiased system helps, and it has been a sort of artform that I've worked on getting better at for almost 25 years now. The result is the algo that you see.\n\nI recommend reading The Disciplined Trader. That book was on my shelf for literally 20 years, and when I finally read it, it opened my eyes and allowed me to finally become a great trader. It might help. It helped me get a top 20 finish in the US Investing Championships back in 2022, where I got a positive return while the markets took a beating.\n\nYou might also look to consider hiring a trading coach, or just outsourcing your investments to a professional. There's no shame in it. Smart people who know their limitations do it all the time. I can't create good drawings if my life depended on it, so that's why I hire graphic designers to do those things that I can't. The same applies for investing. Some people have strong psychological blocks that prevent them from becoming successful in that area, and that's very common. People overcome that by recognizing their limits and hiring someone instead who thrives in the environment that others just aren't suited for.\n\nAnd yes, there's a lot of frauds out there, so be sure to check people's backgrounds, look up their FINRA status, Yelp and Google reviews, and talk to clients to see what it's like to work with that advisor.

One nice thing about options is that you can trade so many different ways. It's not just about stock go up or stock go down.

Maybe you can look at buying some options playing on the direction AND an increase in volatility. Or maybe you see a stock with high volatility and you think it is at a point of resistance. You can go for credit  spreads or just selling an option. Stock/market is range bond?

In a freshly post-covid environment, eased by QE, it made sense that these types of stocks were some of the strongest longs in the market.\n\nThe cumulative effects of transition from a covid-dominated to post-covid dominated era only recently surfaced itself: WFH having percussive effect (by way of technology/concrete changes), the centralization of data through tech, and the virtualization of things that previously relied on more physical means: bitcoin vs banks, ai vs workers, capital vs labor.\n\nI believe the effects of all these recent changes are the most relevant forces in play since the pandemic. \n\nAs a result, the thesis of capital deployment changed. Capital has rapidly dispersed itself into players that are poised to benefit from these dynamics: such as NVDA being catalyzed through the events of covid, cryptocurrency demand, and now machine-learning (chip manufacturers in general).\n\nWith AAPL being out of the trends, and GOOG having the (repeated) let down, it makes *some* sense that they are at beaten down levels.\n\nI think this will continue until either enough capital has flowed into the trending sectors that it no longer makes sense to deploy capital there, or dynamics shift in favor of 'defensive growth,' where market behavior has shifted such that it makes more sense to proceed in a cautiously optimist behavior.\n\nIf not, unless AAPL makes meaningful strides in the trending sector (by recognizing essential design philosophies and capitalizing on that; ie forfeiture of fighting giants of the industry such as NVDA and focus more on niche), or GOOG understands how to leverage their competitive advantages better (make stronger generative-machines by using their economic moat, relative strength in various industries, and access to highly rich data, better), I believe they will continue to struggle to keep up with the trends.\n\nThis does not make it a bad play. AAPL is currently my largest position, and I continue to use my r/thetagang strategies to bring in income to keep increasing my share count.
