Some higher level margin accounts may only require a fraction of this amount, perhaps as low as $4,400 being held by the broker for 2 contracts. This is because the broker is allowing \"naked puts\" to be sold which have a higher risk in that more puts can be sold than the account can handle, and this is why only the most experienced traders can qualify for this approval level. These seasoned traders know how to manage their accounts and these trades to not take too much risk.  \n\nEven if the full $30K is being held, it is not all at risk as the odds of AAPL dropping substantially is low, or near zero odds of going out of business. \n\nYes, 30% of an account being risked in one stock is far too much risk. Limit risk to around 5% of the account in any one stock is a much better way to trade. If a stock does have a loss, which won't even be the full 5%, it will not have as large an impact. \n\nFind lower cost stocks you would be good own and make smaller lower risk trades on them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you guys typically close out your positions much quicker?\n\nYes. I close for a 50% profit using a gtc limit order to do so automatically. This takes off the risk and frees up capital to make another trade. Rinse and repeat as they say which can see the premiums and profits add up.\n\nLet's look at another random stock for a better example. BAC is trading around $37 and the 17May 35 strike is selling for .52 or $52. The full cost of the shares would be about $3,450, or $535 if using a high level margin account. Assuming a 50% profit of $26 over 25ish days, this would be a .007% profit on the full amount, or .05% on the reduced amount held. \n\nIf these trades can be turned over a full year it would be 14.6 trades for a $379.60 in profits. Note that the \"locked cash\" in account is held and then freed up when each trade is closed, so it is not cumulative, meaning the same $3,450 can be used over and over for the profit percentage calculation. $379.60 / $3,450 = 11% return. Using the lower amount held, the $379.60 / $535 = 70.1% return of buying power used.\n\nOnce again, it is crazy rare for stocks do not drop to zero overnight, so while it is possible to be assigned shares that drop and need to be held, the chance of any significant loss is low.\n\nSelling puts is the first step of the wheel strategy that sells puts for profits, then if assigned the shares to sell covered calls which with time and patience can often see the position recover. See this for my wheel trading plan which many have used as they got started with their own plan - [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the\\_wheel\\_aka\\_triple\\_income\\_strategy\\_explained/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/)\n\nThese are some posts from those who are running the wheel to show examples of their posted returns - [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/1bkcap6/wheeling\\_returns\\_over\\_trailing\\_12\\_months443\\_return/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/1bkcap6/wheeling_returns_over_trailing_12_months443_return/)\n\nAnother one - [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/18s7m1u/2023\\_wheel\\_strategy\\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/18s7m1u/2023_wheel_strategy_results/)\n\nYou can search to find others, but this does give an idea of how the wheel can work.
