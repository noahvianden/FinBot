WTI crude above $90 isn't the be all / end all number. We saw a sustained period of time in the early 2010's where oil was trading above $100 per barrel and the economy was growing. (2010 to 2015 as a matter of fact). Yes, the price per gallon of gasoline is an inconvenience but by no stretch does $90 per barrel indicate that there will be, or should be, a recession.\n2. I agree with the second paragraph of your comment, in general terms, however, I would add that significant amounts of job losses, taking for example the LAST two instances that we have seen (08/09 and 19/20) were responded to, by the fed and the US government, with very swift action and resolve. Yes, the markets dipped substantially, but, given the responses of the fed and the Us government, both of those instances proved to be 1. short lived pain (for investors) and 2. great long term buying opportunities, not only for individual stocks, but the general indexes as well.\n3. Time will tell on this one, however, there is the belief that 2022, effectively, was the \"recession\" as, in Q1 and Q2 of 2022, for consecutive quarters, GDP was negative. (Subsequently, oil prices were above $100 per barrel thru this period of time). I tend to believe that this was, in fact, the recession that most had been predicting and, given the relatively soft nature of it, was unnoticed my most OR wasn't necessarily as painful, why? Simple: The entire investment and media community was talking about how we are going to be in recession. When everyone is talking about it, and it happens, I think the pain becomes a little more tolerable because everyone is already planning for the worst.\n\nLastly, I tend to be optimistic in this particular case (yes, the dreaded \"this time is different\") why? Simple: The fed is acknowledging, even in the face of inflation over the past two months being, \"sticky\", that they are planning to cut rates. Sure, we can debate how many 25 basis point cuts (it started the year at 6 cuts and now, some speculate, may be 1 or zero cuts). Where it all ends, know one truly knows and, in my view, as I have said before, the April report (March CPI and PPI) will be a real indicator of if the inflation battle is still a downward trend OR if there is more fighting to do.

In relative terms, yes, it is quickly, especially when you consider that the financial system, across the globe, was literally on the precipice of complete collapse (Empirical data supports my thesis, IE: in 1937 it took the market 17 years to get back to ATH's, in 1968 it took nearly 25 years to get back to ATH's and in 2000 it took nearly 14 years to get back to ATH's).

Why not $100? $150? What about $89.99 per barrel?\n\nI tend to agree with you, in general terms and in part, on the second paragraph, where we are definitely in a higher short range of inflation than the feds 2% target, but, in historical context, it is hardly a \"high inflation period\", unless your definition of \"high inflation period\" is 3-4% on a 1-2 year basis? My view on this front is that there is, literally, zero reason to cut rates, especially given that the data is showing we are not at the 2% inflation rate number, hell, we are not even in the 2's at this point. Further, the argument that interest rates are prohibitive is laughable to me as well. Factually, I would argue that interest rates aren't even neutral at this exact moment in time. The economy keeps chugging along with no immediate, or apparent, issues. \n\nThe oil argument, I feel, is one that you haven't completely thought thru. Sure, in the short term, if oil prices go up, with the abundance of dollars that are still swimming around, it could be digested for a period of time by the consumer, however, in the mid-to-longer term, there is little doubt that higher oil prices will lead to decreased demand which, in turn, will lead to supply outstripping demand, thereby, creating a potential deflationary situation (depending on how much demand (consumers) would pull back on spending).\n\nThe fed, contrary to popular belief, is not in full QT mode. 1. They haven't raised rates in nearly 8 months. 2. Money printing, while paused for a period of time on the M2 side of the equation, has, in actuality, started up again, albeit, at a VERY moderate pace (hardly restrictive, however) and 3. The fed is, as of their last meeting, \"starting to slow their tapering of the balance sheet\". Those three tools, along with, very likely, more stimulus dollars in the event of need, sound like effective tools to me? Oh yeah, what about the government overspending to the tune of $1.6 trillion a year? Hard to go in a recession when the steroids just keep flowing, no?\n\nIn any event, yes, we will see a recession again, however, the severity of it (outside of a black swan event or major geopolitical event), in my view, make the depth of the recession something that presents nothing more than a buying opportunity. Politics dictate that the economy can't stall for too long, as, for whomever is in office at that time will pay a political price they don't want to pay (losing elections).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "crude at $90 should translate to gas around 4.5$/gallon. That's a large enough external shock to tip the US into a recession. If you want me to give the exact number, no one can do that. However, the Fed and every economist think we are one external shock away from tipping into a recession. Crude at $90 could be that external shock, and traditionally, spiking oil prices have been the most common external shock leading to past recession. 10 year rate above 5% is also another external shock.\n\nInflation at 3-4% is high compared to the Great Moderation period, which is where we are. If you want to compare with the 60s and 70s, the economy was quite different back then. neutral rate was vastly higher back then. You can argue what the neutral rate is, but NO ECONOMIST seriously thinks it's much higher than 4%, including the Fed critics like Larry Summers, and the most hawkish Fed members like Kashkari. It is definitely not 5.5%. In fact, all Taylor rule variations say the Fed fund rate should be around 4.5% right now.\n\n[https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-hutchins-center-explains-the-neutral-rate-of-interest/#:\\~:text=Since%201972%2C%20the%20estimated%20neutral,has%20remained%20low%20since%20then](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-hutchins-center-explains-the-neutral-rate-of-interest/#:~:text=Since%201972%2C%20the%20estimated%20neutral,has%20remained%20low%20since%20then).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe economy is \"chugging along\" for a few reasons : increased immigration (2m higher than normal trend), consumers willing to draw down excess savings for spending due to belief of strong job market, consumers and corporates have already refinanced their debt so they aren't affected by the high interest rate YET.\n\nAll of them are temporary phenomenon. Biden cannot continuously let immigrants in forever, especially when Congress is fighting over border issues. If Trump gets elected, immigration is definitely gone. More immigrants, more workers, higher GDP, higher payroll.\n\nExcess savings is close to depleted and will likely get depleted within 2-3 months. It's been depleted for bottom half income group. When excess savings is gone, consumers will cut down on spending to build up savings, and that leads to the recession domino I described.\n\nThough consumers and corporates are currently sheltered from high rates, that cannot last forever. Homeowners have to move for familial or job reasons eventually. They have been delaying selling their house, but data shows existing home sales are starting to increase. And I seriously doubt if they lost their job, they could actually afford current rent prices, which would likely be more than double their current mortgage. Corporate refinance cycle will start later this year and early next year.\n\nThere's also no \"abundance of dollars that are still swimming around\". I've already explained that in my consumer savings drawdown.  If you're talking about money market fund money, those are money that would've been in checking account that were moved to mmf due to interest rate. We saw the spike in early 2023 after SVB happened and average Joes became aware that interest rate wasn't 0.\n\n[https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/blog/sf-fed-blog/2023/11/08/data-revisions-and-pandemic-era-excess-savings/#:\\~:text=Excess%20savings%20calculated%20as%20the,National%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Research](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/blog/sf-fed-blog/2023/11/08/data-revisions-and-pandemic-era-excess-savings/#:~:text=Excess%20savings%20calculated%20as%20the,National%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Research).\n\nYou don't think the Fed is in full QT mode?
