Assume NVDA is at the close of 875.28 not the AH price of 851.50. \n\nOne option for LEAPS is the 12/19/25, 680 strike. The mid is 343.25. It will cost you 34,325 and will breakeven at 1023.25. At 680 it\u2019s worth 0. \n\nThe premium on an ATM synthetic is ~$0. You own an 875 Call and you\u2019re short an 875 put. At 1023.25 you\u2019re up 14,825 at 680 you\u2019re down 19,500. It doesn\u2019t matter what expiration you choose, the premium will always be ~$0. It will tie up $30k in capital for the position. If you do move down significantly your margin requirement may increase depending on your broker. If NVDA falls below 525 you will lose more money than you would with the LEAPS. \n\nThere are a lot of ZEBRA possibilities. One is Sep 20, 2024, 700/860 +2/-1. Total premium is $33,113. The breakeven is $871.13. Max loss is 33,113 at 700. At 1023.25 it\u2019s worth $48,325. \n\nSo how many leaps do you want me to sell you? I\u2019ll give you a really good deal.\n\nEdit: I should be clear the relative downside of the synthetic is the price falling below the level where you would lose more with the synthetic than LEAPS. The down side of the ZEBRA is, if you match the strikes and expiration, the ZEBRA requires more capital and thus has more risk and a lower return on risk at the higher prices. \n\nComparing a ZEBRA/LEAPS at the same strike expiration, using the same amount of capital, LEAPS outperforms ZEBRAs at the extreme lower and upper ends of the price range. The ZEBRA outperforms it in the middle.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.\n\nOne thing is I'm doing this in an IRA, so no margin.

If so, understood.

In a long position you still have risk of losing premium. The difference between a long call and a short put at the same strike is the long call has the ability to exceed the return of the short put if realized volatility exceeds IV and that the put will earn a return if the price doesn\u2019t fall greater than the premium.\n\nThat said, prices move down faster than they move up. But that phenomenon is implied in put skew. You can create a short put position with long positions. This is actually something you figured out. 3 legs of a box, makes you long or short the fourth leg. \n\nThat why short ITM call LEAPS with a long synthetic, simulates a short put.
