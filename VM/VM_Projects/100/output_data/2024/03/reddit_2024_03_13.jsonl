This move aimed to establish Intel as the primary provider for the military and intelligence sectors.\r  \n\r  \nThe CHIPS Act, signed into law by President Biden in August 2022, signifies a $53 billion effort to enhance the U.S. economy\u2019s resilience and security. It aims to rejuvenate semiconductor manufacturing within the nation, encouraging companies to localize their production processes. With the Pentagon\u2019s recent decision, the anticipated funding structure and the future of Intel\u2019s role as a specialized semiconductor supplier for defense applications are now under reconsideration.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "1bdqrsf", "created_utc": 1710334574.0, "score": 440, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Title misleading, they didnt pull out, contract is signed but pentagon wants another entity to pay the contract.", "score": 306, "replies": [{"body": "amazing how much intc price is controlled by misinformed retail", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "Yup, best time to buy.
