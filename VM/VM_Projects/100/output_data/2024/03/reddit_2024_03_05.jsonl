{"title": "What\u2019s the future of Apple?", "selftext": "The world is going into the AI era, and I just don\u2019t see Apple in it.\n\nIt seems iPhone is close to its fullest potential, they are throwing the same phone out for many years now, and people are much less hyped about it. While back then, it was worth it to get the new one every year for the upgrades, now new iPhones are just A(n+1) processor, new colors, and a bit better camera. They look the same too, so it has lost its \u201cstatus symbol\u201d attribute too.\nI don\u2019t see it changing soon. Pretty much same with iPads.\nApple Watch is like.. it\u2019s a watch, they can improve on it, but I don\u2019t see people sitting on needles waiting when the new one will come out. They can improve battery life, make it brighter every year as the sun, make it do something with every sort of sign language hand movements (why though?) but that\u2019s it.\nMacs aren\u2019t going to save them either, they are faster for sure, but there\u2019s not a huge market for them, or in other words, no massive growth is expected.\nThere\u2019s potential in VR, but in my opinion VR is very very far from being able to be an everyday wearable, and it\u2019s for sure they won\u2019t be the ones developing VR to that point.\nWhy? Well, that\u2019s my main point. Apple has never been an innovator, they were always the last to adapt something, and only when they were able to \u201cperfect it\u201d (even though they have massively failed many times).\nI\u2019m just afraid they aren\u2019t good positioned for either promising areas: AI, and VR.\nMy theory is they will be afraid of AI, because it\u2019s something that\u2019s much harder to control, and perfect. I don\u2019t see how Apple, being a control freak, would be able to live with something that\u2019s not predictable.\nFor VR, I think they will wait until they will be way late from the game. They will come out with something that\u2019s 5 years behind, but I\u2019m not sure they will be able to get away with it (as they were able to do with iPhones - which I cannot understand how they did till this day).\nThey also don\u2019t have a shovel in the AI gold rush as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia do.\nI\u2019m genuinely worried about the future of Apple, and seems like they can be the next Nokia.\nJust to clarify, I\u2019m not anti Apple, I\u2019m the one who buys all the crap they throw out (iPhone, watch, beats, Mac, iPad), that\u2019s why I see they are getting less and less exciting.\nWhat do you think?", "id": "1b7d0v8", "created_utc": 1709664410.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.39, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "You should short Apple", "score": 123, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah do it OP.
