Blackwell just set everyone back 2 years imo with their new formats and dynamic precision.   What ever everyone else is already building is now obsolete.  NVLink5 and NVSwitch enabling many more GPU to GPU communication is a thing I think few competitors understand.  They will try and bolt systems together and use ethernet and well, good luck optimizing that.\n\nThis is opposed to the AI complexes Nvidia is building to service one model.   It's a data center problem, not a server and node problem.\n\nOmniverse and Robotics are clearly the next big opportunities to extend the Nvidia AI ecosystem.\n\nJensen was a bit off in his presentation -- out of breath, lost his place a couple of times, and two demos that bombed.

What I think he should do is assemble a presentation team who can advise him on how to make a presentation that will wow the audience or anyone else watching the keynote virtually ( specially potential investors and media ) .

Omniverse will be the holy grain of prototyping for any manufacturing industry from a small product to a whole manufacturing plant. \n\nThe nice part about Nvidia is that nothing Jensen talks about is new. The idea of drug discovery, robotics, digital twins, etc. are all decades old. But what Nvidia does is to unify them and to make them accessible for each industry. Nvidia creates platforms and environments to finally put all the ideas to practice. But the process is slow and will be slow. They are huge undertakings so don't expect any significant revenue from 90% of what has been shown at GTC yet.\n\nIt's a developer conference and it's about get as much mindshare and as many researchers as possible onboard so that they will use Nvidia technologies in the future.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "He's not selling to retail.

The same platform which offers GenAI, the same platform which offers robotics and the same platform which offers automotive.\n\nA customer like Mercedes could:\n\n- run FSD in their cars  \n- use a digital twin for production  \n- run different domain specific LLMs and other AI models in their company with company data  \n- use intelligent robotics and warehouse management  \n- etc.\n\nand all of this powered by Nvidia HW on-prem or in cloud.\n\nNvidia is building several SW platforms and they are all synergized by ONE HW platform. \n\nThe compelling TCO of Nvidia is that if you go with their HW platform then you can reach 100% utilization with tons of different applications. \n\nAnd the best thing of all, Nvidia will be used in many industries but not directly compete in any of them. My example of Mercedes above can be easily swapped with BMW, Porsche, BYD, GM, Ford and so on. It doesn't matter which car company could succed but they could all partner with Nvidia for one or more solutions.

{"title": "How Does TSLA Get to 20M EV Sales by 2030?", "selftext": "I'm doing an updated DCF analysis following TSLA's recent price drop and I want clarity on some assumptions.\n\nCurrently the maximum production for TSLA's factories are:\n\n||Model S/X|Model 3/Y|Semi|Cybertruck|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Fremount|100,000|550,000|||\n|Nevada|||(Pilot)||\n|Shanghai||950,000|||\n|Berlin||375,000|||\n|Texas||250,000||125,000|\n|**Total**|**100,000**|**2,125,000**|**0**|**125,000**|\n\nThis adds up to 2.35m. However, TSLA sold \\~1.8m vehicles in 2023, of which \\~500k were the Model 3 and \\~1.2m were the Model Y.\n\nCurrently TSLA has excess production capacity but since Model 3/Y sales have stagnated, this is being underutilised. \n\nTSLA currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 40. I believe this is pricing in the next growth phase when the next-generation vehicle is released. The current rumours are that it'll begin mass production in July 2025, and I've assumed it'll take 18m to ramp up to a \\~500,000 production rate (December 2026) with annual production of 1.3m by Dec 2027.\n\nSo by December 2027, I am assuming the following sales:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Model S/X|60,000 (slightly lower than now)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Model 3|500,000 (same as now)|\n|Model Y|1,000,000 (slightly lower than now)|\n|Semi|75,000|\n|Cybertruck|400,000|\n|Roadster|60,000|\n|$25,000 Vehicle|1,300,000|\n\nThis totals \\~3.3m and by this time, Gigafactory Mexico will be up and running so along with expansions of of other sites, TSLA should have enough capacity.\n\nI know I'm only looking 4 years ahead, but how is TSLA expecting to ramp up to 20m in the following 3 years? Elon Musk has commented the need for 10-12 Gigafactories by 2030 but that doesn't seem sensible with these assumed sales figures. I've only included TSLA's announced vehicles but they cover a large variety of market segments so I don't personally think the next major growth driver will be a new vehicle; it'll have to be something like energy storage or FSD.\n\nSo I want to discuss my assumed vehicle sales numbers. Am I not being optimistic enough? What are the predicted sales numbers for the next generation vehicle?  Baring in mind that the US is typically not a large market for hatchbacks and the top-selling hatchback of 2023 was the Toyota Corrolla, which sold \\~1m. Personally, I think the biggest wildcard is the Tesla Semi, since sales of heavy truck vehicles are predicted to reach 4.76m by 2030, which not only makes 75,000 seem very low, the margins are also likely to be greater. But even if you assume \\~2m Semi sales, that's still \\~5m annual sales, well off 20m.\n\nWhy would another 4-6 Gigafactory's be needed and what would they produce?", "id": "1bhqfj5", "created_utc": 1710767658.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "20 millions by 2030 Is very probably not reachable, we might see 10-12 millions by 2030 and 20 millions by 2035.\n\nThe model 2 won't sell 1 million cars /year, it will be like the Ford model T.

So far they haven't shown inclinations to do any of those things nor have they mentioned any of those things in reporting, and time is running out. \n\nThere are just so many real-world considerations I don't think people have given serious thought to with regards to Semi \u2014 the path for success is narrower and more complicated than \"ramp up\".

Video and 3d. We need these models grounded in physics.\n\nWe NEED BIGGER GPU'S\n\nI want to introduce you to a very BIG GPU\n\nBlackwell - David Blackwell (mathematician, game theorist, probability)\n\n2 largest dies possible.\n\n128 billion transistors\n\n20 peta flops\n\n384 g HBE ram\n\n40 petaflops of AI performance\n\n80 petaflops\n\n80 GB/s bandwidth\n\n36 Grace CPU's\n\n14.4 Tb/s bandwith\n\nNVLINK\n\nGB200 NVL72\n\nQuantum InfiniBand\n\nLiquid Cooling\n\nJesus this thing is SKYNET itself\n\nGH100 most advanced today - Blackwell is 2x the size physically and will be the most advanced. 208 billion transistors.\n\nGrace Blackwell system - But there is more.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\n2.5 x FPA for training over G Hopper\n\nFP6 -\n\nFP4 40 flops 5x - important for inference.\n\nInference is generation - old computing is retrieval of data - this is generating tokens.\n\nVast majority of content will not be retrieved but rather generated. This is FP4 - and Blackwell is 5x the inference capability.\n\nSeems like enough but why stop there. It's NOT enough.\n\nWe NEED A BIGGER GPU.\n\nJ Huang is cooking\n\nBlackwell is a BEAST\n\nWe still NEED MORE Need another chip\n\nNVLINK Switch Chip\n\n50B Transistors - It doesn't even make sense.

WTF lol My goodness.\n\nThe inference capability of Blackwell is 30x greater!\n\nFP4 Tensor core and NVLINK Switch - is the true key to the innovation here. it is communicating 10x faster than the past.\n\nBlackwell is the shit. There is so much Blackwell is going to bring. It's going to bring the AI industrial revolution. Sovereign AI - Telco's everyone is signing up for blackwell.\n\nJensen Huang is cooking!\n\n**Update:**\n\nDigital Twins with Nvidia's Omniverse DGX Cloud is a really big deal. You can create and build a digital twin world so that you can scale and build faster. Also, it has profound robotics implications.\n\nAGX - SOC - Designed for Robotics\n\nJETSON - This is legit. I work on this.\n\nThe virtual world is Omniverse - It is hosted in the Azure Cloud\n\nAI and Omniverse OVX (digital twin) They are giving a platform for\n\nA robotics building / warehouse and there will be some autonomous systems.\n\nThis is wild, the NIMS and DGX Cloud you can virtualize a world that you can train your robots and hardware on. it's how you'll test the hardware running their autonomous robotic stack.\n\nYou will have to have the digital twins.\n\nSiemens is building the Industrial metaverse.\n\nNvidia Omniverse Cloud\n\n**Update:**\n\nAutonomous vehicles as a service. THOR for BYD first usage.\n\nApple getting direct link to tie Apple Vision Pro to Omniverse. So apple to microsoft Azure. lol.\n\n**Update:**\n\nEnded with Robotics, Nims, Jetson, Omniverse Digital AI workloads / Digital Twins. This may become the largest company in the world. This will all be going to robotics. This will be the next industrial revolution. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dil81p0i16pc1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f2cb3bb5e3538b498154cc63d63793422f6518\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qh3sjr0i16pc1.png?width=1815&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca808f59767cd8c95b3e51b3472c001a5ffcdfc3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5u675x0i16pc1.png?width=1873&format=png&auto=webp&s=44bb81d716d12d6efc2fb7371f560a418369d94e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orowzo3ky5pc1.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a3ccec7abb337e49f0d3696944fae5d9dda96c8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gb5bp3ky5pc1.png?width=1744&format=png&auto=webp&s=97faef219bbbf6f110e1d17df33a6337967f6751\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q4cp81zix5pc1.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b1b428c8b868588b23177f5bf2848adbca372f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzu0g3zix5pc1.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=908de6e6c22c229117d329aa9f7e498fc736efc1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osz3q8zix5pc1.png?width=1794&format=png&auto=webp&s=779ab1f1e5d828f95f236a27e1ead297c305c35c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4at2pdzix5pc1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&s=709f1ca61c24d12e2e30885db7c96f1d509361ce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ifzpk8yp5pc1.png?width=1831&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1c4749a26fe1d710881b36c57ed5eef5e83f066\n\n[Digital Twin World weather simulator. ](https://preview.redd.it/4396xr44s5pc1.png?width=1879&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd110b195bde7aa8ec8ba1d02d70af3ec1d096f1)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7r9hpyh5o5pc1.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a2381959e279dfa0afff7b834712695e7d51bb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6tybxh5o5pc1.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=797d8a47a88e8eb9bcdbd66b9e000767c7896a67\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bu6415i5o5pc1.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=4419a6d0e98ac7e0d985d18bc89cf90fc1403384\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gc35u1i5o5pc1.png?width=1849&format=png&auto=webp&s=14aca1044d68a16df10d4a7611b2cae5db2b8399\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p154s5i5o5pc1.png?width=1756&format=png&auto=webp&s=b79d1c82e77ca56dd84115f2b742d7103f1fb605\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z1330hqal5pc1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=2896d921a41f13628f61c0bc6f445ed670737d67\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcxdnwpal5pc1.png?width=1743&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5a8f373c1282020529d830fa2e867806f80adce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbhmxzpal5pc1.png?width=1795&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2b87fd09f38d68dc3b7586f56805c521d3dbac8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ri2wtse8g5pc1.png?width=1951&format=png&auto=webp&s=d30cae91fcbfd448cf00ef0742481aa37cd48a9d", "id": "1bi0gwk", "created_utc": 1710792477.0, "score": 159, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 5 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 1614 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13822801411151886}, {"body": "Everyone watching the talk just to see if the stock pumps lol", "score": 129, "replies": [{"body": "lol He's saying the craziest shit right now.
