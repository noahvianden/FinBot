The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.\n\nAntitrust enforcers said Google gained scale and data benefits from its illegal distribution agreements with other tech companies that made make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nMehta, who ruled this summer that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets, plans to hold a trial on the proposed remedy next spring and issue a decision by August 2025. Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta\u2019s decision, but must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Android business encompasses the operating system used on smartphones and devices as well as apps.\n\nOn Monday, a different federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store for the next three years to resolve a separate antitrust case related to its dominance of app distribution on Android smartphones.

Barely keeping up with inflation is, by definition, not growth.\n\nThe initial post didn't bring up wage growth at all. *\"People can\u2019t find jobs to pay their bills, or working 2-3 jobs to make ends meet.\"*\n\nYou tried to refute that by offering up non-adjusted big percentage increases data on year-over-year numbers that are 3 months old.\n\nThen you offer up a short term montly BLS report to prove that everything was great (which you misquoted to the upside).\n\nIt was one month. Why would you present it as a shining star when you seem quite aware of the overall picture?\n\nAnd now you're agreeing wages have **barely** kept up with inflation. That doesn't refute what OP said at all.\n\nI'm not sure what the vague \"skipped the most important parts\" is meant to mean.\n\nYou've provided two sources - one which disproved your assertion that wages had grown 1.3% (when it clearly said 0.9% and that was \"seasonally adjusted\") and your other source shows that wages have not grown at all - they've barely kept up with inflaton.\n\nThe page says wage growth was lower than inflation during a critical period in 2021-2022 means that **real wages fell** for most workers during that time, even as nominal wages climbed.\n\nIt also stated many households struggling with the cost of essentials like **rent, housing, and food**, which continue to rise faster than wage gains for many workers.\n\nI gave you 20 data points and offered 31 more. 4 of those points of data are positive.\n\nIf you have any to add, please do. So far, I'm not getting much besides a lot of hand waving and self-contradictory sources.\n\n*\"Anyway, anyway, the reason the stock market has been hitting new highs is that the doom and gloom description of our \"wrecked economy\" is not true.\"*\n\nThis is wildly inaccurate. The stock market and economy often have a VERY wide divergence (you did see 2020-2021, right?).\n\nFurther, the tendacy for the market to hit ATH at the beginning stages of a recession/before a market correction/crash is well documented.\n\nYou know what else happened right before the economy and market blew up in 2000 and 2007?\n\nA blockbuster BLS jobs report.\n\nI'm not saying history repeats, I'm saying that looking at one monthly report of data and claiming it supports that the economy is in great shape is absoluely and demonstrably fool hardy.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation", "crash", "recession"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6508157253265381}, {"body": "As far as this goes: \n\n  \n\"the US economy and company earnings have had some strong positives which have a more immediate affect on the stock market, I suggest.\u00a0\"\n\nI have 4 positive indicators vs. 16 negative or neutral. \n\nHere's an abbreviated version of posts I just did:\n\n# 1.

Animal idolatry doesn't interest me. I'm here for the money. \n\nI just successfully traded the up and downtrend in China, the Japan carry trade unraveling, and predicting the 2022 crash - sorry, correction - was profitable too. My positions are publicly posted. \n\nCurrently I hold a majority of shorts - market and company specifics, yield based trades that are a no-brainer, and a limited about of consumer staples positions which I'll add to when it makes sense. For now, they're a plan to capitalize on the market's concerns about inflation.\n\nI'm not sure I need to ask (and correct me if I'm wrong), but I'm assuming you're a buy&hold, DCA, non-equal weighted index fund ETF guy who takes swings at individual companies once in a while - if at all - based on very basic research.\n\nThere are millions of you. \n\nAnyway, I don't always win but I definitely have progresessed beyond thinking the stock market always goes up or always goes down. \n\nI'm not sure what your list is about. \n\nI said there were 4 positive points. 16 negative. \n\nIf you think the economy is thriving based on the data I gave you, I don't know that you should be talking about macroeconomics at all. \n\n75% good, 25% bad and you're going with good? \n\nAnd, again, I didn't even give you the 30+ real estate market indicators - none of which were positive (happy to do that if you'd like).\n\nWorth considering::\n\n- Historically, when inflastion peaks and rolls over, it's a precursor to widespread unemployment in 12-24 months.

Looking beyond the basic U-3 number is a start. Or dig into the effects of Fed hikes on the economy - most notably that each 100bps hike typically results in unemployment rising 0.5% - 1% around 12-18 months later (the Fed itself notes this). \n\nSo, after 550bps worth of hikes, unemployment has only gone up 0.2% instead of 2%-5%+?\n\nI guess this time is just different?\n\nAs far as wage growth goes, we just had a protracted conversation about the fact that wages (by your words) have \"barely\" kept up with inflation and we have not broken even with pandemic/inflation losses.\n\nIf I could offer you any advice it would be that there is no harm in being wrong.

Because productivity growth continues, especially in the US, earnings growth is also expected, which will drive prices higher.\n\nWhile there is a large swath of households and individuals struggling to make ends meet, poverty continues to decrease:\n\n[https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2024/10/a-little-money-perspective/](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2024/10/a-little-money-perspective/)\n\nExtreme poverty (for example, those suffering malnutrition and without heated shelter) has decreased from over 60% to under 20% around the world in the past 100 years. Our poverty definitions need to shift (for example, indoor plumbing, internet access, etc) with the progress made in reducing poverty, but certainly, people can feel that the world is doomed, even if the data demonstrates the opposite. Tricky politicians will tell you that household wages are stagnant, but they won't tell you that household sizes are shrinking, so that they can anger voters about things getting worse, when in fact they are getting better.\n\nWe all know that life is unfair, and that tragedy strikes hard, and it is hard not to take it personally. But the data is the data, the truth is the truth.\n\nStock ownership is also a way to capture both real and nominal (inflationary) gains. While there are no guarantees that the next 100 years will be anything like the last 100, one path towards generational wealth is to invest a cup of coffee a day for 50 years, and end up with more than $1 million by doing so. Instead, people don't understand the power of compounding returns over time, and fritter their incomes on more car than needed instead of becoming investors and owners.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6252391934394836}, {"body": "Stock prices reflect two things: the value of the stock and the value of money.
