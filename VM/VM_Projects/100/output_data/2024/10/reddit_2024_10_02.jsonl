{"title": "Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter", "selftext": "\nTesla\u2019s stock slipped 3.5% in premarket trading after the company reported third-quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced, slightly below analyst expectations of 463,310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year-over-year increase, Tesla\u2019s growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition, particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter, but with just 32,100 units sold, Tesla\u2019s lead remains substantial.\n\nTesla\u2019s 2024 outlook remains uncertain, as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup, the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum, particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tesla\u2019s stock surged 32% in the third quarter, erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company\u2019s upcoming earnings report and marketing event, where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements, including a potential robotaxi design.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html\n", "id": "1fufyjo", "created_utc": 1727875027.0, "score": 136, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Looks like Tesla sales have effectively plateaued.

To restore consumer confidence, which was lost for a reason: people close to them losing their jobs due to industry closures (which weren\u2019t performing) or because they lost value in their only form of investment, which was real estate.\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing if the country manages to do it right (as Ray Dalio says, a beautifully deleveraging cycle). It can be a difficult process but China, being an authoritarian country, is well positioned to handle it. They have all their debt in their local currency, they have large reserves to back up a possible currency collapse, and they control the banks and companies across the country.\n\nAlso, while the drop in real estate value seems chaotic, it\u2019s really not.

{"title": "RoboTaxi Day Will Pay, it just wont be Papa Musk", "selftext": "Do I need to link the montage of Elon promising self-driving cars by next year? If you're still glazing that fraud, this post isn't for you, imho betting on Tesla's competitors is the way to make real money on Robo Taxi day. \n\nHere are the facts: Google's Waymo is far more advanced than Tsla's FSD. Waymo has over 20+ million miles of real-world driving and 20+ billion miles in simulation to Tesla's 0 fucking miles. Google invested in Uber in 2013, so it's no surprise they partnered to embark on their self-driving ambitions. When Tesla fails to deliver, I believe we will see a spike in Uber as the market realizes that Tesla will not be a true competitor in autonomous driving.\n\nAnother potential winner of Tesla's RoboTaxi days is Mobileye (MBLY). They used to be a partner of Tesla until they cut their ties with Tesla based on Elon's lies about the current capabilities of Tesla's FSD. MBLY currently has several partnerships with car makers including NIO, BMW, and Volkswagen. \n\nIn 2021, Mobileye announced that the first robotaxi services would be deployed in Munich, Germany. This partnership is still active, with the goal of launching a scalable autonomous ride-hailing service in the coming years. \n\nTesla's failure on 10/10 I believe will open the door for the market to realize it isn't at true player in the space and will boost UBER and MBLY. \n\nI'm still building a position, but I have 10/18 MBLY 15 C\nand UBER  10/11 77 C and 10/18 80 C\n\nMBLY also has a very high SI, so if it goes, it will go. \n\nI've been pretty spot on of late, so let's see.\n\nEdit: Uber calls paid", "id": "1fuii9x", "created_utc": 1727881834.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 5 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 342 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 9 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.023536382243037224}, {"body": "i saw a mom put her kid into a waymo this morning in west LA\u2026. waymo has already won", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "I ride Waymo here in Phoenix now almost exclusively.
