Let me lube you guys up with a small play this monday to get in the mood.\n\nToday I got 2 earnings plays for y'all: **Crocs** and **PayPal**, both reporting tomorrow before the open. I also have 2 bonus lotto plays on 2 no-name trash companies that report today after the bell; they\u2019ll be in the TLDR at the bottom.\n\n1. **CROX** \\- In my last post, I opened a long position on DECK since I noticed a big trend with Uggs all over social media, and it paid off. Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don\u2019t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don\u2019t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That\u2019s what I did, and I\u2019ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.\n2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square\u2014they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall.
