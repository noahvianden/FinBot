{"title": "TESLA CYBERCAB VS WAYMO : AN ANALYSIS ", "selftext": "For all the regards who don't know, Waymo is the market leader in true autonomous vehicles right now. They have been operating a fleet of robo taxis (fully autonomous cars) in multiple cities for a while now. \n\nSo I did a short comparison and analysis. \n\n\n\nKEY POINTS FROM \"WE, ROBOT\" EVENT:\n\n\n\n1. The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.\n\n.\n.\n\n2. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 \u2014 although he said it could be as late as 2027. \n\n.\n.\n\n3. Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.\n\n\n.\n.\n\n4. Cybercab was revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla's \"We, Robot\u201d event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. \n\n\n.\n.\n\n5. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn't rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nTESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH \n\n\n\n.\n.\n\n1. Sensing the World:\n\n -  - Waymo's Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.\n\n\nI. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D \"point cloud\" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.\n\nII. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.\n   \n\nIII. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.\n\n\n\n\n- - Tesla's Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.\n\n\nI. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.\n\n\nII. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it's expensive and unnecessary.\n\n\n- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla's vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).\n\n\n\n.\n.\n\n\n2. Understanding the Environment:\n\nI. Waymo's HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.\n\n\nII.  Localization: This allows Waymo's cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.\n\n\nIII. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what's coming and plan routes accordingly.\n\n\nIV.  Tesla's Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.\n\n\nV. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.\n\n\nVI. Adaptability: Tesla's system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.\n\n\n\n- - Why this matters: Waymo's HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla's approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI's ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.\n\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n3. Deployment Strategies:\n\nI. Waymo's Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.\n\n\nII.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.\n\nIII.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.\n\n\n\n IV.  Tesla's Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.\n\n\nV.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.\n\n\n VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.\n\n\n- -  Why this matters: Waymo's approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla's approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.\n\n\n\nThese are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla's approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.\n\n\n\n. . . . . .  . \n\n\nEDIT:  THE MUSK PARADOX \n\n\nThe entire Tesla brand is highly dependent on Elon. Essentially Elon is Tesla. A lot of the Tesla Brand value is tied up with Elon Musk the human.\n\nThis wasn't a problem in the past when Elon seemed like a nerd who just loved tech and posted memes.\n\nFast forward to 2024, the guy is full blow republican (not saying it's bad or good). He is actively involved with politics.\n\nIMO, He's too busy \"owning the libs\" and fighting cultural wars (\"woke virus\"). \n\nNow combine this with his other behavioral problems like self administration of ketamine and using other drugs, and we have a recipe for disaster.\n\n\nFYI, I'm not an Elon Hater. I used to admire him and it's sad to watch his downfall.\n\n\n. . . . .\n\n\n. . . . .\n\nTLDR;\n\n\nIMO, the event was Very Disappointing. \n\nElon announced (NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED) basically what he has been promising for years (TRUE AUTONOMY AKA FSD).\n\nIt was no different than the previous announcements of FSD and Cybertruk.\n\nI expect delays (regulatory approvals and the actual tech being ready).\n\n\n. . . . .\n\n\n\n. . . . . \n\n\nUPDATE :\n\n. . . . . \n\nFor all the regards who don't understand what WAYMO actually is, I just did another post analyzing Google (the owner of Waymo) and why they're the number 1 player in AI, robotics and self driving.\n\n. . .\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/d3tSIKLRIJ", "id": "1g188s3", "created_utc": 1728648554.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 420 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.019792191684246063}, {"body": "I like the TLDR part!", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Elon announced concepts of a plan", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Following his mentor to the letter", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19255053997039795}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04911993071436882}, {"body": "Here\u2019s my TLDR of OP as someone in Phoenix who almost exclusively takes Waymo \n\nWaymo - I\u2019ve taken over 100+ waymo trips, I call it and it\u2019s there 5 minutes later.

{"title": "GOOGLE: The Real Leader In AI, Robotics and Self Driving ", "selftext": "This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. \n\n\nRight now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. \n\n\nGoogle is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. \n\n\nYou must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? \n\n\nThe reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. \n\nGoogle had something called \"PROJECT MOONSHOTS.\"  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. \n\nAI research and development was a part of it.\n\nIn 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.\n\nDeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.\n\n\nThe Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).\n\n\nNow going back to \"PROJECT MOONSHOTS\" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  \"Project Moonshots\" into \"X COMPANY\".\n\nYes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. \n\nThis is what X Company does -\n\nX's mission is to invent and launch \"moonshot\" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.\n\n A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. \n\nWork at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and \"Captain of Moonshots\".\n\nThe lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.\n\n\nSELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. \n\nThey are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).\n\n\nWhile Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. \n\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n\nTLDR;\n\nGOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE. \n\n\n\n. . . . . \n\n\nEDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup \n\n\nIf (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. \n\nIMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture. It will get DOJ/Anti-trust lawsuits worldwide off Google's back, without really impairing their ability to develop AI and other futuristic tech.\n\n\nEven this can potentially take years to materialize, if it ever actually happens.
