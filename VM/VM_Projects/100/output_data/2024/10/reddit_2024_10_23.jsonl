{"title": "$ACHR Revolutionizing Urban Logistics/Transportation in Congested Metropolitan Cities", "selftext": "**TLDR: Undervalued at 1 billion Dollars, Long Term High Risk/ Very High reward Investment, 2 Major Catalysts Soon, Large emerging market with only 2 current actual competitors(174 bill market by 2034 and 1.5 Trillion by 2040). IMO, current Fair value is $10+.**\n\nI've been diving into the world of eVTOLs lately, and I think Archer Aviation **($ACHR)** is a massively undervalued stock in an overvalued market. With yesterdays FAA approval paving the way for this new industry and some major catalysts on the horizon, I think we are at the moment of being not too early and not too late.\n\n**A New Era in Air Transport**\n\nYesterday, the FAA released groundbreaking regulations approving a new category of air transport: powered-lift aircraft. This is the **first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years.** This historic rule will pave the way for EVTOLS to start operating, a market projected to be worth **$1.5 trillion by 2040**. This is a significant step towards revolutionizing urban transportation, logistics, and even emergency response services.\n\n[The Future of Transportation](https://preview.redd.it/b8sjqgt6zowd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=971938b24d338e68769b9e1684ff48ef32bc245f)\n\n**What Are eVTOLs?**\n\neVTOLs, or electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft, are a new type of air vehicles that offer a quieter (operating at about 45 dB), more cost-effective in build and operation(Can be 1/10 the cost of a helicopter), and cheap to supply with energy(10-50 minutes of charge in the current state of batteries) alternative to traditional helicopters. They are also easier and quicker to build than helicopters leading to scalability.\n\nThe leading companies in this space are:\n\n* **Archer Aviation (ACHR)** valued at 1.15 Billion at $3.22\n* **Joby Aviation (JOBY)** \\- valued at 4.45 Billion at $6.20\n* **Volocopter** \\- a private German company valued at 1.87 Billion\n\n**Archer Aviations Midnight**\n\nArcher's flagship eVTOL aircraft, the **Midnight**, is designed to revolutionize urban air mobility, especially in congested metropolitan areas. Here's why it stands out:\n\n* **Cost Efficiency**: Operating the Midnight can cost around **$500 per hour**, dramatically less than the **$10,000 per hour** it costs to operate traditional helicopters like the Blackhawk in disaster relief scenarios. This drastic reduction in operational costs comes from its electric propulsion system, which involves fewer mechanical parts and significantly lower maintenance needs. It make it a very affordable faster means of transportation/logistics.\n* **Speed and Range**: Reaches speeds of up to **150 mph** with a range ideal for **20-50 mile** trips, turning hour-long commutes into minutes.\n* **Quick Turnaround**: Equipped with a battery system that can **charge in minutes(10-40 depending on route) between flights**, allowing for rapid back-to-back operations.\n* **Safety Features**:\n   * **Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP)**: Uses **12 electric motors** and **12 propellers**, so if one fails, others compensate\u2014no single point of failure.\n   * **Redundancy**: Features **6 independent battery packs** for enhanced reliability.\n* **Quiet Operation**: Operates at around **45 dBA** during forward flight, significantly quieter than traditional helicopters, reducing urban noise pollution.\n* **Payload**: Can carry over **1,000 lbs**, suitable for both passenger transport and potential cargo operations.\n* **Ease of Production**: Designed to be **easy and quick to build** for scalable manufacturing.\n* **Efficiency in Development**: Archer completed its required 400 flight hours for testing significantly ahead of schedule(4 months).\n* **Military Interest**: U.S. Air Force entered into contracts with Archer Aviation worth up to **$142 million** due to its advanced capabilities, aesthetic appeal, and potential applications in rapid response and logistics\n* **Significant Backlog of Orders**: Archer has amassed a **backlog of orders worth nearly $6 billion**, highlighting strong market demand and confidence in the Midnight's potential.\n\n[Archer Midnight](https://preview.redd.it/x8xbkx8mzowd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ea39ef5ab8569a32edd07b4e11a28caf28f951)\n\n[Archer Midnight](https://preview.redd.it/dt1t7i7rzowd1.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d1ef5dc2040c0f950f40a32e885c7088d87c2a9)\n\n  \n**Upcoming Catalysts for ArcherOpening of the Covington, Georgia Factory**\n\n1. **Upcoming Earnings Report (November 7, after market close)**\n   * **Potential Highlights**:\n      * **Funding Updates**: Possible announcements of new funding or partnerships.\n      * **Operational Milestones**: They've completed over 400 test flights 4 months ahead of schedule. This indicates that they are laser focused on getting to the market asap with possible updated guidance and timelines.\n      * **Market Expansion**: In the last month, the CEO went to Abu Dhabi and major announcement is rumored to be about their operation in Abu Dhabi next year as the first market. Moreover, they were in discussion in India for a possible operation over there.\n      * **New Funding?**: With Archer beating deadlines, I'm optimistic for some type of funding being announced. I wish for an announcement of No offerings lol for certain period of time like AST did where the stock rose from $8 to $27 but I dont think this would happen here just wishful thinking.\n\n**Financial Situation and Institutional Interest**\n\nArcher Aviation's financial footing is solid, especially for a company pioneering a new industry:\n\n* **Cash Reserves and Runway**:\n   * As of Q2, **$590 million** with a quarterly cash outflow of about **$80-90 million**, they have an **18-month runway**.\n* **Backlog of Orders**:\n   * They have a massive **$6 billion** backlog for their Midnight aircraft, indicating strong future revenue potential.\n* **Stellantis Partnership**:\n   * Stellantis is contributing up to **$400 million** to help Archer ramp up production to 650 units annually. Stellantis will cover manufacturing labor costs and capital expenditures for initial production.\n   * **Warrants Issued**: Archer has issued **$30 million** in performance warrants to Stellantis, which vest upon achieving certain milestones.\n* **Military Contracts**:\n   * **U.S. Air Force Deal**: Contracts worth up to **$142 million**, including the delivery of up to six Midnight aircraft and collaboration on pilot training and maintenance.\n* **Institutional Ownership**: As of Q2, 21 hedge funds held positions in ACHR with around 31% institutional ownership.\n\n**Leadership**\n\n* Billy Nolen, Former acting FAA Administrator, was pouched from the FAA to act now as Archer's Chief Safety Officer. His main job is to speed certification ASAP.\n* **CEO Adam Goldstein,** aka the Kendall Roy that Logan always wished for (doppelganger), is very active on social media with him making a video on Youtube after every Quarterly earnings explaining what happened in the quarter in details. I really respect this level of transparency as it shows how confident they are. They also actively invite YouTubers and media to tour their facilities and provide detailed updates on the manufacturing process and progress.\n\n**Valuation Gap: Archer vs. Joby why archer should be At +$10**\n\n* **Market Caps**:\n   * **Archer (ACHR)**: \\~$1.1 billion\n   * **Joby Aviation (JOBY)**: \\~$4.43 billion\n\nWhile Joby is ahead in development and timelines (10-20% ahead) with recently receiving FAA authorization for a software platform, at its current valuation, ACHR is very undervalued. It has a **$6 billion** backlog of orders for their **Midnight** aircraft, Secured contracts worth up to **$142 million** with the U.S. Air Force and has strong partnerships with industry giants like **Stellantis** and **United Airlines.**\n\nIMO, **current fair valuation for ACHR should be at least at +$10**(This post is already long can go into details if you like in a future post) and we would still not be at JOBYs current valuation\n\n**Risks and Considerations**\n\nInvesting in emerging technologys such as eVTOLS is High Risk/ High reward:\n\n* **Regulatory and Technological Risks**: Delays in FAA certification or unforeseen technical issues could disrupt progress.\n* **Financial Risks**: This industry requires high capital which increases the risk of debt and dilution.\n* **Operational Risks**: Manufacturing complexities or infrastructure challenges could delay production timelines.\n* One bad incident in this industry could derail everything\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nACHR provides a great entry point for this new industry as it's very undervalued (**Fair value +$10**) in my opinion. It's a long term High Risk(the type that might go to zero lol)/ Very High Reward play if everything pans out according to plan.\n\nI'm not a financial advisor and this post isn't financial advice. This DD is very highly speculative and might contain mistakes. It's an opinion post and my opinion might be wrong lol. That being said, don't invest in this stock based on this DD and do your own research.\n\n[.](https://preview.redd.it/5ub7baxo2jwd1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae4b999b8cd218bd68a597e86152bec16695758)", "id": "1gae2h6", "created_utc": 1729699135.0, "score": 2067, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 9 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 138 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1488713026046753}, {"body": "a partnership with Japan Airlines could even be announced according to the Japanese press", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "With Archer?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Japan Airlines has suddenly switched its \"flying car\" partner for the 2025 World Expo (Osaka-Kansai Expo) from Germany's Volocopter to the US's Archer Aviation.
