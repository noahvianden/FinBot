{"title": "AI is not a bubble.", "selftext": "Lot of posts and blogs talking about how AI will be a bubble. Here is my thought on why AI is here to stay.\n\n1. **Coding/Development:** >90% \"Coders\" use AI in some form. Co-pilot/IDEs and what not. As someone who does something similar, I can not imagine going to back to the non-AI days. Most of my friends in the space share the same sentiment. Is coding going to become obsolete in itself? No way. At least not anytime soon. Even if there does come a time when it does, I do think \"development\" in itself will go away, ever. A few people I know who use AI for non-technical work also agree to the above for their own work. Seldom do some not as well.\n\n2. **AI is just not LLMs and chatbots**. A lot of non-technical folk will be surprised how much AI is adopted in the everyday world. All of that is here to stay. While currently, a lot of it may be gimmicky, down the line, real use-cases will be adopted. Healthcare is one such field (especially the admin stuff) where AI is really going a step up. Another is manufacturing. Yet another good example of this is the mobile phone industry. Although the AI (specifically those features which are built to make life easier) still feels horrible to use on phones, it is being widely adopted in a multi-billion dollar industry. \n\n3. **Lifecycle**. Any AI product is quite easy to improve. What I mean is that, just \"better\" data can massively improve models. LLMs are a good example of this as its adoptions into different sectors is purely data-driven. Therefore, there really isn't a fear of going out of fashion because it is relatively easy to adopt new trends. Obviously a big debate can happen here but my point is, AI, as how it is conceptually can not exactly become obsolete because it is easy to upgrade the underlying tech.\n\n4. **Robotics**. As we come closer to adoption of robots, a big necessity of actual working robots will require innate AI capabilities to adjust to unknown surroundings. \n\n5. **Alternatives**: There is no real alternative to AI as a field. Obviously boiling things down, it is statistics. But I mean to say that, if a product is using AI and doing well, there is no real alternative to throw AI out of the equation and get similar results.\n\n`Now, what are the limiters?`\n\n**1. AI is expensive to incorporate.**   \nAI is still very early. All AI products are still being cheaply sold to accommodate mass adoption. As things become more adopted, prices will rise for companies to make a profit. AI is also extensively used in research for numerous fields. AI being expensive is never going to stop these labs from using AI. \n\n**2. AI is not exactly safe.**  \nNothing is these days :) Your data has been stolen long before AI days.\n\n**3. AI needs insane compute infrastructure.**  \nThere is enormous amount of money going to into building better compute. Both CPU/GPU/TPU/FPGA and so on. Compute is not only for AI, it is for science. I do not believe there will come a time where we hit a mark where one says -- \"Hey, that is enough compute\". \n\n**4. Data related issues.**  \nData is becoming worse as the internet is being filled with Ai generated stuff, however, it is not going to stop progress. It most definitely is already hindering it though. \n\nOverall, from what I have noticed this past 1-year, there is no limitations so strong to hinder further adoption of AI in itself.\n\n***Bottomline:***\n\nWhile in no way do I mean that AI companies today is going to 100x your investment, but the overall AI trend here to stay. `What people fail to recognise is that, there are quite a few things which AI already does much better than any human can do.` Not just gimmicks, but actual real world necessities -- and these \"number of things\" is only going to increase with the years to come. **Companies like FAANG who heavily invest in this are definitely here to stay.** How much they will maximise shareholder value is a different story haha. Also, its been note even 2 years since ChatGPT first came out. All these development has happened short of 24 months. \n\n  \nNote: I work on AI, obviously biased. But I do not think any of the above statements made come from a highly biased perspective.

{"title": "BEPC: Large Reactors and the Overlooked Nuclear Banger (LEU 2.0)", "selftext": "[Vogtle](https://preview.redd.it/m85u5mlkwbwd1.png?width=1015&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9554a635616f0c5042bb10047944119ad4e091c)\n\nI'm riding high on OKLO and LEU payouts (check the post history on for a recent 10x trade within two weeks). After a sector has been on fire for weeks week, the question becomes what is left that still has juice?\n\n**The answer: Large Reactors. Specifically Brookfield Renewable Corp (BEPC)**\n\n  \n**LARGE REACTORS**\n\nSMRs have been getting all the attention in the media. When Mag7 talks about nuclear - they talk about SMR. Why? Small is beautiful. And less intimidating. This is more about optics that strategy.\n\nLets get into the data: *Altman wants multiple 5 GW AI centers built across the countr*y.\n\nSMRs produce yield 10 MW to 300 MW. And that upper end is theoretical, because none are in production. Even assuming a 300 Mwe output, that is 15 reactors per data center.\n\nLet's take a step back. Is the gov really going to start building dozens of SMRs at once - before a single one is up and running and established with a proven performance and safety record? Especially after decades of building scarcely any reactors at all?\n\nFar, far too much risk. Yes, there will be a handful of SMRs built to prove out the technology. This may take around a decade. *And then* those need to for a number of years (and likely be iterated upon) before these is the confidence to deploy these widely.\n\n**In sum, to go from 0 to many SMRs will take decades.**\n\n**We don\u2019t have decades. AI is a military horserace between the US and the rest of the world \u2013 particularly china \u2013 and in two decades the winner of that will already be decided.**\n\n  \nThe US needs to scale up nuclear energy production NOW. There is only one path to do that. And in sweeping report by the DOE - with industry and government as a target (i.e. no incentive to whitewash things by playing up SMRs) - the DOE outlines that plan:\n\n[https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LIFTOFF\\_DOE\\_AdvNuclear-vX7.pdf](https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LIFTOFF_DOE_AdvNuclear-vX7.pdf)\n\n  \nThe main parts of the report. \n\n- SMRs won't cut it for scaling out nuclear\n\n- They need \\*a single design of a large nuclear reactor\\*. \n\nIt must be a single design because of the realities of our national nuclear workforce.

Yet there has basically only one major nuclear project in the US in the past four decades. *That project is Votgle.*\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nIf you happened to be a young buck in the 70s working on nuclear, maybe you have some experience on another major project. Odds are you are retired now, and it\u2019s a long distant memory at best.\u00a0 For absolutely everyone else \u2013 you only experience of a major reactor build is Votgle.\n\nProject Votgle was a beauty of a project. And what did they use? Westinghouse. In the 80s Westinghouse PWRs. And as recently as 2023, Westinghouse AP1000s.\n\nEveryone in the country has the same single reference for a major successful nuclear build-out. And it was built on the AP1000s\u2026You now have to build 5-10 nuclear plants of a single design asap.\n\nWhat are you going to pick?\n\nUnderstanding Vogtle makes it very clear while the DOE is so bullish on AP1000s in the report.\n\nNow onto BEPC...  \n\n\n**BEPC: THE WESTINGHOUSE STAKE**\n\nWestinghouse builds the AP1000s. And Westinghouse was bought out a few years ago by a consortium including BEPC. Hence BEPC is basically only one of two ways you can get exposure to Westinghouse. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/752veemapbwd1.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb8b0209a2eb693b873e9262b9975df933a881d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adwnem3hpbwd1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=99d40940a008486e0a3eff7aca09db83670019e4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ruu2z75kpbwd1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcfc93de40acb905f169b370058d5e542e23690\n\n\n\n**BEPC: THE MICROSOFT DEAL**\n\nYou may be familiar with CORZ, a bitcoin miner that has been running 300% on a deal for 200 MW of power. BEPC has a deal with MSFT for 50W. **That is 50x the power.** Let it sink in - \"largest ever corporate partnership\" and \"key enable of potentially one of the most significant technology innovations in history.\" This is not hyperbole. BEPC is a major player here.\n\n[https:\\/\\/bep.brookfield.com\\/sites\\/bep-brookfield-ir\\/files\\/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2\\/2024\\/brookfield-renewable-corporate-profile-may-2024.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/n6ib4ccopbwd1.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=8810295447003dc26912325356b808ef7a53ea0f)\n\n\n\n**BEPC: VALUATION AND CHART**\n\nWhat else is it important to know? The company is trading with a PE of \\~17 and dividend of 4%. This seems shockingly cheap compared to nearly every other nuclear trade. Or an energy supplier of any kind with key partnerships to the big AI players.\n\nThe chart to me is pure poetry. \n\nMy read - BEPC has seen very little of the froth hitting nuclear or energy in the past month - but over the past week the market is starting to wake up.\n\nMore or less the same setup when I picked up LEU calls that 10x'd once it rapidly re-rated. In that case I saw something that was starting to inflect, did a deep dive, liked what I saw and figured it had plenty more to run, and levered the fuck up.\n\nI think this could happen here as well. And on 30% move - which every nuclear play seems obligated to make, though at different times - the contracts are going to outright print.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ib52jc15vbwd1.png?width=1395&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab8fbc11ff885279491b1d8dc02e3da8bd22ff9b\n\nIn sum, long af BEPC calls of various strikes and expiries.  \n", "id": "1g9ljpz", "created_utc": 1729612536.0, "score": 181, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 5 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 34 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1enp6n0/ambp3_ambi_the_most_beautiful_short_squeeze_ever/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ft3itl/leu_the_fat_pitch_for_a_us_uranium_enrichment/) \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "first time actually reading this is detail. pretty useful bot", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22488680481910706}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29580774903297424}, {"body": "your DDs have the ability to bend reality\n\nI'm in", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "The DD is indeed bending reality.\u00a0 In addition to Vogtle 3&4, there was another project that survived the post-Fukushima wipeout of US new nuclear builds.\u00a0 That was V C Summer 2&3, another pair of AP1000s.\n\n\nWestinghouse was so far behind schedule and over budget in building these four plants that it went bankrupt.\u00a0 That's why a private equity firm like Brookfield owns them in the first place (before it sold half to Comeco).\u00a0 The V C Summer utility decided not to continue, but the Vogtle utility did, at great cost.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt's because of this experience - and the fact that wind and especially solar are far cheaper these days - that no one is looking to build more AP1000s, or any other large nuclear reactors, in the US.\u00a0 Europe has had similar experiences in France, Finland, and the UK.\u00a0 Among non-authoritarian countries in the last couple of decades, only South Korea has managed to build large nuclear reactors on a reasonable budget and schedule.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI'd be very wary of all the hype around nuclear, be it uranium, SMRs, or large reactors.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "China is building big nuclear, at first with Westinghouse\u2019s help but now mostly on their own afaik.

I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 5-10 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item?  I'm not sure how Westinghouse's revenue on reactors shakes out.  Do they simply sell the reactor and it's parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up?\n\nEdit: Actually, I think I have that wrong.

The government hasn't exactly been spearheading the development of AI, I wouldn't be one bit surprised if the private sector figures out how to get the capacity needed quicker. Also AGI is probably more than two decades away, and it requires ingenuity and creativity just as much as it requires raw power, so megawatt count isn't deciding the winner. It could be that your hypothesis is derived from the results you are seeking.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Right. They do not use large reactors in submarines.\n\nFor some applications the primary consideration is size. For stuff that needs sub 30-300 mw SMRs are useful.\n\nHowever, large reactors clock in 30% cheaper per unit of energy produced than SMRs. That is a huge difference. So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw (i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid - i.e. majority of energy demand) then large reactors are the way to go.\n\n  \nThe actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 5-7 data centers of 5 GW power each. That would take roughly 35 large power reactors. And they are just talking about what OpenAI wants.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/)\n\nMicrosoft just struck a deal to re-open a nuclear plant in NY as well.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7354379892349243}, {"body": "I\u2019m long BN.
