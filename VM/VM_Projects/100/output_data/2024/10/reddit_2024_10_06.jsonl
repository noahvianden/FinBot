I've found the answers are about 70-95% accurate depending on the topic, and I simply confirm the data with the citation when I need accurate figures.\n\nMaybe a better way to describe the value for me is that it has sped up my process for finding and vetting and using information. However there is also an additional layer to this, which is functionality that Google doesn't provide. For example, I can ask CGPT to generate graphs and tables for me to quickly visualise data which might be difficult to consume at a glance. I can also ask it to generate custom images, which I use in presentations. They can even be used without copyright issues for corporate purposes. By taking a picture, CGPT can also summarise ingredients on packaging and medications and tell me if I might have interactions, given my medical history. It can provide tailored meal and exercise plans, and help me track progress.
