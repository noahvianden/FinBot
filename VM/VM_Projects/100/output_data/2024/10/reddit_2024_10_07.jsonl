You should probably just have held for the long term, and accumulate more shares when Nvidia goes down or has some temporary corrections.  You would likely do a lot better with that approach.

Nvidia is not Tesla, and I think diamond hands are the way to go with Nvidia.\n\nI have around 6000 shares of Nvidia at an average cost around $65, and I don't have any plans to sell.
