For most of August, I was trading up and down because the swings were crazy. When things stabilized a bit, I ended with a position of 4,000 shares, using margin. I sell calls to pay for the margin interest and some. In that time period of crazy swings, I had a positive up swing of $115,000 in one day. On the down side, I had a day of minus $59,000, which was a day I picked up a ton of NVDA and AVGO. As scary as the down day was, I felt great about how much of those 2 companies I was able to purchase! The call premiums are elevated because of the volatility, so easy to pay for margin.

He owns 7 million shares of OKLO and if they are able to capture a portion of that business, it would be a massive source of recurring revenue. Aside from that, there was an NRC white paper released last week stating that new nuclear site reviews (post-initial) can now take as little as 7 months, which significant towards scaling efforts. Oklo already has an order book of 1.35GW which translates to $1.2B/yr in annual recurring revenue post-deployment.\n\nAs far as other reasons to believe- They have the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, a strong leadership team with PhDs, first mover advantage within the NRC application process and have hired on former regulatory staff, reactor technology that was already proven through decades of testing between 1964-1994, unique expertise within uranium recycling, and probably most importantly, partnership commitments driven by a robust commercialization model that is scalable and profitable overtime. This fits well with the future local energy needs of AI data centers.\n\nIs current valuation too high? Maybe not. They are further ahead of NuScale ($SMR) by as much as 5 years, and are fully funded through their first two builds through 2028, so lower risk of dilution. If they were trading at NuScale\u2019s market cap of $4.7B, that would imply over $40/share, so closing that gap may provide more upside. I\u2019m confident that OKLO will be a 10-bagger in the next 5 years and potentially 100-bagger in the next 15 years when the heavy scaling takes place.

{"title": "NVDA I will cheer for you", "selftext": "On Monday, NVIDIA surpassed last week's intraday high of $140.89, closing up 4.14% to set a new closing all-time high of $143.71, and closed with a market capitalization of $3.53 trillion, closing in on Apple's $3.6 trillion market cap.\nDespite last Tuesday's dip in NVIDIA's stock price after ASML's earnings blowout, and the market's concerns about slowing AI spending remain, NVIDIA's stock price still recorded a 2% gain last week, a cumulative increase of more than 50% over the bottom at the time of the market's collapse in early August.\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be firmly bullish on NVIDIA ahead of its November earnings report. According to Bloomberg survey statistics, analysts expect NVIDIA shares to rise to $ 148.37 in the next 12 months, including a number of highly bullish analysts on NVIDIA, for example:\n\nOn Friday, Bank of America raised its Nvidia price target from $165 to $190. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, among others, said buying Nvidia is a \u201conce-in-a-generation opportunity.\u201d\nLast week, investment research firm CFRA raised its price target on NVIDIA from $139 to $160.\nIn the view of Bank of America analysts, the overall AI market demand is growing strongly, in addition to this is also worth noting that NVIDIA's strong performance in the field of enterprise AI, such as partnerships with Microsoft and Accenture and other companies, Bank of America to raise its target price of the other factor, NVIDIA is the preferred partner for enterprise AI hardware and software.\n\nWedbush analyst and NVIDIA majority owner Dan Ives expressed a similar sentiment in a report sent to investors on Sunday. He claimed that enterprise spending is growing in giant waves as AI adoption scenarios explode, and NVIDIA is leading the way.\n\nIves predicts that the AI infrastructure market will grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies investing $1 trillion in AI capital expenditures during that time. \u201cIn short, we think tech stocks are poised for another 20% rally in 2025, and this tech bull market driven by the AI revolution is just entering its next phase. We believe that the Fed and Powell have initiated an aggressive rate-cutting cycle, that a soft macroeconomic landing is still the way forward, and that tech spending on AI is a crossover spending wave that is just getting off the ground in the tech sector.\u201d", "id": "1g90siv", "created_utc": 1729544665.0, "score": 762, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 5 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1900894045829773}, {"body": "I hate thoughts and posts like this, because I was committed to taking profits at $150, but now I feel even more greedy.....perhaps $160?", "score": 228, "replies": [{"body": "I took profit at 850, and now I kinda wish I didn't, but no matter what it does I got my principal + back from the sale.", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "yeah, I had a secondary batch I got around $750 when many on WSB were saying \"good luck bagholders, way over valued, bubble, yadda, yadda\".
