And mass production starts before the end of the year.\n* First products will be Panther Lake (client) and Clearwater Forest (server) in 2025. The process yield is healthy (with Defect Density below 0.4).\n* In phase one they were aggressive in pushing the company to compete (with TSMC and others), he now announced they are moving to the second phase, becoming profitable. Intel is working on cost-efficiency and nimble operations (aka milking every cent out of all those multi-billion investments).\n* Pat also revealed that Intel Foundry (18A node) has 12 active customer engagements and 8 product tape-ins expected by 2025. We know that both [Microsoft ](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-expects-overtake-tsmc-making-fastest-chips-this-year-2024-02-21/)and [Amazon](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-aws-expand-strategic-collaboration-chip-manufacturing-2024-09-16/) have officially announced switching to using Intel 18A for their upcoming custom AI chips, that leaves 10 mysterious customers ( there has been rumors of [NVIDIA](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/nvidias-suspected-2025-processor-is-now-rumoured-to-be-built-by-intel-using-off-the-peg-arm-cores-yes-an-nvidia-chip-built-by-intel/) & [Qualcomm ](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-build-qualcomm-chips-aims-catch-foundry-rivals-by-2025-2021-07-26/)so far).\n* Talked about cost reduction strategy (15,000 Layoffs and $10 Billion in savings).\n* There is strong demand on Intel advanced packaging products (EMIB & Foveros). And for those who don't know, just like TSMC's CoWoS, there is insane demand in packaging segment right now (and in many cases it's the bottleneck for AI chip production, along with HBM memory)\n* In phone call with SEC of Department of Commerce, said, they are lamenting that people aren't more concerned about the supply resilience after the COVID chip shortage shock, and there is a need to diversify their supply chains away from Asia.", "id": "1g2pkxs", "created_utc": 1728825861.0, "score": 648, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 7 | **First Seen In WSB** | 7 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 59 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.024677405133843422}, {"body": "Active customer engagement = we emailed them and they have replied", "score": 494, "replies": [{"body": "1) Nana will haunt their asses until they do a deal. \n\n2) Nana will haunt TSMC\u2019s foundries, slowing down output. \n\n3) Intel will rocket to $200 in Q3 2025 when NVDA shifts all their business to them. \n\n4) And on the third quarter, Nana will raise her grandson out of the red, starting his life as WSB\u2019s Lord and Savior.

{"title": "Part 3: Archer Aviation is Going to Pick Up Major News from Japanese Airlines (JAL) and Sumitomo Because of Volocopter's Insolvency", "selftext": "Insolvency is one hell of a word that nobody wants to hear but here we are. Volocopter is a German Advanced Air Mobility AAM company that has fallen on some bad times as of lately. Here's what we know. The silence is deafening and there is blood in the waters. \n\nVolocopter had a direct relationship with investors such as Mercedes Benz-Group, Geely (also backing EHang), and Japanese Airlines JAL specifically via Sumitomo Group. Sumitomo group has invested millions into Volocopter through multiple funding rounds and most recently a Series E funding round that concluded March 4, 2023. \n\nTo date, Volocopter is ahead and behind in so many ways regarding the eVTOL AAM business. Volocopter is positioned in the Asia markets nicely in collaboration with Geely in China and Singapore obtaining flight agreements with local aviation authorities to integrate eVTOL services within Singapore's urban transport network. Geely, gives them potential of market entry into China. All seem like good news and blue sky's ahead. Not so fast. \n\nThe other Asian entry point is from JAL and Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo. This is where things start to get real interesting because the background news for JAL, Sumitomo, Volocopter, Mercedes, Geely, and Archer Aviation has been decimenting at a dizzying pace. The news for Volocopter and VoloCity is not good news for Volocopter at all. \n\nThis information broke on a Japanese website and was alerted to me on another reddit sub. [https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/02892/100200027/?n\\_cid=nbpnxt\\_twbn](https://xtech.nikkei.com/atcl/nxt/column/18/02892/100200027/?n_cid=nbpnxt_twbn) The site is in Japanese but you can translate it. The funny thing is it was not picked up by any US news sites as of yet. The news is telling and potentially disastrous for Volocopter. \n\n**10.04.2024 Sumitomo changes aircraft from Volocopter to Archer Aviation...** \n\n>Figure 1: Status of each company's investigation published by the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition The big change is that JAL's flight operations have been taken over by **Soracle**, a company jointly established by JAL and Sumitomo Corporation, and **the aircraft used has been changed from Germany's Volocopter to the U.S. company Archer Aviation**. Incidentally, Marubeni is also considering using aircraft from the U.S. company Lift Aircraft (Source: Japan Association for the 2025 World Expo).\n\n>The major change from the status of consideration disclosed in August 2023 is that the flight operations that were previously planned to be carried out solely by Japan Airlines (JAL) will be taken over by Soracle, a new company jointly established by JAL and Sumitomo Corporation in June 2024. **In addition, the aircraft to be used has been changed from the Volocopter-type eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft \"VoloCity\" from Germany's Volocopter to the fixed-wing aircraft \"Midnight (M001)\" from Archer Aviation of the United States** (\u00a0**Figure 2**\u00a0).\n\nArcher Aviation has not reported on this news yet. There has been nothing but silence. Why? \n\nBecause of this I did some digging. Let's start with Volocopter. Why the switch? Turns out that Volocopter is going through a lot of turbulence right now. Remember, Volocopter is a private company so getting a lot of details is difficult but one can read the tea leaves. \n\nThe first sign of real trouble is none other than the Paris Olympics where Volocopter was supposed to have its day in the sun. The setup couldn't have been more perfect for Volocopter eVTOL AAM entry point into the Asian and European air transportation markets. French President Emmanuel Macron was supposed to fly one from right inside central Paris as the first commercial eVTOL flying passenger. That never happened and in short, Dirk Hoke and Volocopter fumbled the ball or rather, pooched the kick. I don't know many european phrases for \"they fucked it up\". \n\nFor some reason, Dirk Hoke and Volocopter thought that their 2 seater eVTOL/AAM in which 1 seat is a pilot and the other is a passenger was going to make it through the European Aviation Safety Agency EASA in time for the Paris Olympics. It did not and the eVTOL demonstration was scaled back significantly leaving perhaps a death blow to the eVTOL maker. \n\nThe fallout has been severe whilst coming from multiple angles and corresponding investment groups related to Volocopter. Reports started flying (more flight puns) that dreams were dashed and Volcopter failed to deliver. \n\n[August 8, 2024 France 24:](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240808-paris-flying-taxi-test-flights-scrapped-during-olympics)\n\n# Paris scraps plans for Olympic \u2018flying taxis\u2019\n\n>Despite initial promises, so-called 'flying taxis' will not be circling above Paris during the Olympic Games this summer. German manufacturer Volocopter Thursday said it has scrapped test flights of the 18-rotor drones that resemble small helicopters over delays in the certification for the vehicle\u2019s engine.\n\n>Volocopter CEO Dirk Hoke said the delay was due to \"an American supplier who was not capable of providing what he had promised\".\n\n>He said the motors would be sent back to France next week but not in time for the test flights to be held in Paris before the Olympics close.\n\n[August 9, 2024 Axios:](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/09/air-taxis-olympic-moment-whats-next) \n\n>**Why it matters:**\u00a0Air taxis were supposed to be\u00a0[zipping over Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAJQ1t6ErMg)\u00a0during the past two weeks, but the electric aircraft \u2014 which take off and land vertically \u2014 still need regulatory approval.\n\n>**Driving the news:**\u00a0One such company, Archer Aviation, plans to launch a Los Angeles air mobility network as early as 2026, it announced yesterday.\n\n[August 11, 2024 AP News reported:](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-paris-flying-taxis-82af3b21726dc6ebbc99da076b98d14b) \n\n# Air taxis failed to get certified for the Paris Olympics.

To put it nicely, they're fucked. \n\nI don't if you caught the repeated blaming by former, now transitioning, CEO Dirk Hoke of an anonymous \"American Supplier\" who seemingly did not deliver a part is the sole reason why they did not obtain EASA Type Certification. I get that this happens in hardware and hardware and manufacturing is well HARD. I understand that but the notion that your entire premises of existence is on a single American part is ridiculous and as my father used to tell me; I don't want to hear excuses. \n\nAgain, the fallout from here would prove to be severe for both Dirk Hoke and Volocopter. For Dirk Hoke's part [he is out as CEO of Volocopter](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/volocopter-to-undertake-leadership-changes). For Volocopter somewhere in the news cycle [via news publication The Air Current the words considering Insolvency and \"finding new funding\"](https://theaircurrent.com/feed/dispatches/volocopter-secures-new-funding-from-existing-investors/) has entered the chat; or rather the venture capital news corners. \n\nIt's so bad that [Dirk Hoke has already found another job as of September 18, 2024](https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/news/dirk-hoke-appointed-as-new-ceo-of-voith-group/). \n\n>Dirk Hoke has been appointed as the new President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Voith GmbH & Co. KGaA. The Voith Management GmbH\u00a0[Shareholders\u2019 Committee](https://voith.com/corp-en/company/company-overview/supervisory-board.html)\u00a0announced that Hoke will assume the role no later than April 1, 2025.\u00a0\n\nTo this day, while there are new board members on Volocopter from Mercedes (former Daimler AG) and Geely China there has been no news on acquiring a new CEO for the role. \n\n>[Volocopter to Undertake Leadership Changes](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/volocopter-to-undertake-leadership-changes): September 2, 2024\n\n>Dr. Dieter Zetsche, former CEO Daimler AG, appointed as Chairman of the Advisory Board\n\n>Dr. Zhihao Xu, CEO of Geely Technology Group, joins the Advisory Board\n\n>CEO Dirk Hoke to step down from his role in February 2025 at his own request\n\n**The GREAT News for Archer**\n\nTo me, it is very telling that NO NEW CEO has been appointed to Volocopter. Where does all that Series Funding from A - E GO? Sumitomo in that news article as of 10/4/2024 seemingly backed out of Volocopter and  is now dealing with Archer Aviation. \n\nEven though Volocopter is private you can track their balance sheet roughly through [Crunchbase ](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/volocopter/company_financials)and other sources. They roughly have $579 million of investment from investors, including Geely, WP Investment, Mercedes-Benz Group, Intel Capital, and BlackRock as[ reported in their initial Series E funding round for $170 million](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/series-e-financing-round). But you'll notice that they had a ridiculously long funding roundt that turned into a big Japanese pivot by the end - [Volocopter in Japan](https://www.volocopter.com/en/newsroom/japan-series-e-regulatory-pathway). So if we're tracking, the Series E funding round went from March 4, 2022 to March 4, 2023 concluding on the Japanese JAL Sumitomo news. \n\nTo put it in perspective, OpenAI's funding round started in October 2, 2024 and concluded in 2024. \n\nThe notion that Volocopter took an entire year to close a funding round can only mean one thing. Stipulations and milestones. And I mean stipulations and clauses like you've never imagined a contract could have. You don't deliver TYPE certification we're taking our money back. You don't do this, we're taking our money back. You don't do that, we're taking our investment back. Or, they never really got the investment in the first place through not reaching milestones. \n\nThe tea leaves are easy to follow here. You close Series E funding by the Japanese Osaka Asian corridor. You promise and underdeliver for the Paris Olympics and blame the Americans. You don't receive TYPE Certification from EASA on time. All of this has lead to Japan now pulling the rug and the seemingly that $579 million investment is no longer Volocopter's.\n\nThat's how I read these tea leaves. Moreover, Archer has not given any recognition to the news that was laid out by that Japanese news paper. One can only surmise that the deal(s) are still being worked out by Archer, JAL, and Sumitomo. Something is there obviously but we just don't know exactly what. \n\nNews on this, should be breaking soon if not immentily. \n\nIn the least, I would imagine Archer gets to take over any investment once promised to Volocopter from JAL/Sumitomo Group and is the reason Volocopter is in an absolute death spiral of solvency need. At the most, perhaps this is an opportunity for the first eVTOL AAM merger where Archer takes the entire investment, more investment, and portions of the Volocopter IP to obtain a larger Asian corridor presence in China and other premium Asian markets outside of just Japan. \n\nI hate to say it but for Volocopter this makes a lot of sense. The 2 seater aircraft is bland and uninspiring. It doesn't yield the future but rather some teenagers scaled up a DJI drone and tried to make it a company. I hate to give the brutal take there but that is what their passenger aircraft looks like. The other parts of their business seem much more promising and practical like the transport drones and object delivery eVTOL plans. Leading with a 2 seater eVTOL is DOA in my opinion but they do have interesting pieces for sure such as an already up and running smaller size manufacturing plant located in Bruchsal, Germany. \n\nThis DD is highly speculative and is based on assumptions and news articles that are leading but not anything definitive. After, Joby's Toyota announcement I believe Archer is cooking up their own major news announcement that coincides with their own regulatory approvals from the U.S. FAA, specifically the SFAR.\n\n The other news here worth noting is specifically what Japan Airlines has been doing in the eVTOL space. The company that I mentioned [Sumitomo Corporation and JAL jointly establish an eVTOL operating company as of June 3, 2024 named Soracle.](https://www.sumitomocorp.com/en/jp/news/topics/2024/group/20240603) \n\n>Sumitomo Corporation has been pursuing commercialization in air mobility services since 2018 as it seeks to diversify its longstanding aviation business. In 2020, as part of efforts to develop this new market in Japan, it invested in a company developing an air traffic control system for unmanned aircraft that will be critical when integrating these mobility services into society.\n\n>JAL aims to create relationships and social connections through the movement of people and goods by leveraging the technology, observations, and operational expertise it has accumulated in the air transportation business to operate air mobility services and further develop its business in Japan.\n\n>JAL and Sumitomo Corporation entered into a business alliance in the air mobility sector in 2020 (\\*2) and have been working toward the realization of eVTOL-based mobility services. In addition, the two companies are undertaking studies and making preparations (\\*3) for the development of a next-generation air mobility business, including participation in the \"Public-Private Committee for Advanced Air Mobility, Air Mobility Revolution and Social Implementation \u2013 The Osaka Roundtable (\\*4), which positions Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan as a milestone toward the social implementation of air mobility services.\n\n>The establishment of Soracle will leverage the strengths of both companies. This includes Sumitomo Corporation\u2019s airline industry network and the expertise it has built up through diversified business activities and JAL\u2019s expertise in safe air transport operations. The new company will provide opportunities to further strengthen Sumitomo Corporation and JAL's cooperative relationship, and accelerate their respective air mobility initiatives through the operation of eVTOL services.\n\n>Both companies aim to realize the social implementation of safe and reliable eVTOLs, build a transportation network connecting the regions and create new value through mobility in the sky.\n\nSo all of this [once planned excitement for JAL and Volocopter](https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2021/10/26/japan-airlines-plans-evtol-operations-from-2025/) is now being shifted to Archer Aviation. What else may become shifted to Archer in the Asian Markets? \n\n**October 26, 2021**\n\n>JAL said that eVTOL \u201cis expected to play an active role in a wide range of fields, such as Air Taxi services, emergency lifesaving and disaster response, taking advantage of its mobility similar to that of a helicopter\u201d.\n\n>\u201cJAL, as a professional aviation company, aims to create a prosperous and sustainable society through safe and secure comprehensive air mobility operations,\u201d the carrier continued.\n\n>\u201cUtilizing our expertise in air mobility operations, we will provide next-generation transportation and mobility infrastructure that meets the needs of local communities, and promote initiatives to achieve the SDGs while solving local issues in areas such as disaster response and medical care.\u201d\n\n>Last year Japan Airlines signed a cooperation agreement with German aircraft manufacturer Volocopter (pictured) \u201cto promote the development of the Urban Air Mobility industry for next generation air transportation options of passengers and goods\u201d.\n\nWaiting for this news to break any day now. \n\nI am building shares at the current cost basis of $2.85 and \\~$3.10. I am also building calls in the 1/17/2025 and April time frame. I am no longer adding to my October 18th calls.

The powertrain team that I took over was less than 15 people. We used mainly off the shelf components, motors, inverters and battery cells from prototype [vendors.Fast](http://vendors.Fast) forward to 2024, the powertrain team is more than 150 people in total. [Alex Clarabut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-clarabut-4163162/) leading battery, [Dillon Thomasson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dillon-j-thomasson/) drive units, [Stephen Spiteri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-spiteri/) power electronics and [Paul Frihauf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulfrihauf/) leading BMS to name just a few. All rockstars in their fields of expertise. For sure the best team in the [hashtag#evtol](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=evtol&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7242558532988932096) industry. And one of the best in the whole \u201eelectric transportation of any kind\u201c industry.We have designed and validated our own motors, inverters, batteries and battery management systems. Hardware, controls, software, system integration - we did it. We have established a close development and commercial cooperation with our battery cell supplier Molicell. We have established close collaboration with the [Stellantis](https://www.linkedin.com/company/stellantis-slovakia/) engineering community ([Ned Curic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nedcuric/), [Michael Bly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micky-bly/)).In other words: Powertrain is set up for success and a safe launch.On the manufacturing side it was pretty clear that no existing supplier could give us what we need: the combination of aviation certified manufacturing and leading edge EV craftsmanship. So we designed our own scaleable manufacturing system. And built it. And brought it up. And it runs very well. Kudos to [Isaac Harper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacharper/) and [Heath Smoot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heath-smoot-49355816a/)!The team is set up so well that they will be just fine without me. Which I consider the ultimate goal of a leader: built a team that is so good that they can do great without you. YOU GOT THIS, ARCHER POWERTRAIN TEAM!!! \ud83d\udd0b \ud83d\udcaa So for me it\u2018s time to move on. I have not 100% decided yet what to do next. It will for sure be in the \u201eelectrification space\u201c. The intention is also to revive my European roots and at least have one leg in Germany. Germany treated and educated me very well (kudos to my Alma Mater [Ruhr University Bochum](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ruhrunibochum/)!).

{"title": "Boeing\u2019s Endless Doom Loop Gives No Respite to New CEO", "selftext": "> As Boeing Co. lurches from one crisis to the next, there\u2019s been one constant for the embattled planemaker: Its predicament appears to be only getting worse.\n\n> From a freak accident that blew a door-size hole into the fuselage of an airborne 737 Max to revelations of sloppy workmanship and now a crippling strike entering its second month \u2014 the icon of US manufacturing hasn\u2019t been able to catch a break since the first days of January. Cash is dwindling, plane production is anemic and the stock is heading for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis in 2008.\n\n> Combined, the episodes have exposed quality lapses at Boeing and its supply chain, alongside a corrosive culture a quarter-century in the making, where pressure over costs and schedule permeated decision-making. Earlier this year, customers finally revolted and the board shook up leadership, hiring Kelly Ortberg in August out of retirement to fix the beleaguered manufacturer. \n\n> In his two months on the job, Ortberg has made a series of blunt moves. He removed the head of the defense and space division and tried to short-circuit a strike by taking a higher offer directly to workers \u2014 a move that backfired and only hardened the union\u2019s resolve. \n\n> His latest maneuver came late on Friday, when Ortberg said Boeing would cut 10% of its workforce, equivalent to about 17,000 people. And he tucked in a hint that more dramatic steps might be needed to get the company back on course. \n\n> The comments suggest that Boeing under Ortberg may double down on the field for which it is best known: Commercial aviation. The unceremonious departure of Ted Colbert as head of the defense and space business put those subsidiary\u2019s shortcomings into sharp relief \u2014 made more glaring still on Friday when Boeing said the unit would have about $2 billion in charges in the third quarter. \n\n> Rating agencies have put Boeing on notice with a warning that it may slip below investment grade, a move that would make the planemaker the biggest so-called fallen angel in corporate US history. The company has only a small buffer on top of the $10 billion of cash and short-term securities that it needs to avoid slipping to jut status. The toll from the strike increases the urgency to tap markets sooner rather than later for fresh financing. \n\n> All told, Boeing will record $5 billion in combined charges for its two largest businesses when it formally reports third-quarter earnings, the company said Friday evening in a surprise announcement. Besides the defense and space charges, Boeing will book additional costs for pushing back its 777X model once more, leaving its largest widebody aircraft with a delay of about six years.\n\n> Much is unclear about Boeing\u2019s turnaround efforts. The ramp-up in production that was supposed to help cash flow has been undercut by the recent strike, and the defense and space business continues to hemorrhage money. \n\n> Longer-term, Boeing may need to make some tough calls on unprofitable areas like its space endeavors. The division made global headlines a few weeks ago when its Starliner capsule returned to earth without humans on board. It was an ignominious end to its first crewed mission to orbit after NASA decided not to risk putting two astronauts back into the glitch-prone spacecraft.\n\n> When the strike started in mid September, the CEO urged workers to embrace the future and not hold grudges, a nod to a 2014 contract that cost them their pensions. Senior management took solidarity pay reductions when Ortberg announced furloughs to preserve cash, and the latest job cuts will also include executives and management, he said.\n\n> But with so-called touch labor accounting for less than 5% for the total cost of a commercial aircraft program, some observers wonder why Boeing isn\u2019t moving with more urgency to end the work stoppage that\u2019s adding to its financial distress. \n\n> The strike is cascading through Boeing\u2019s supply chain, heightening the risk that the recovery in the planemaker\u2019s own factories will be slow and halting even once workers are back on the job. And so far, Boeing hasn\u2019t said where the workforce cuts will occur, or what they might cost the company in terms of severance. Announcing the job cuts in the middle of labor negotiations is also a strategy fraught with risk. \n\n> On the one hand, Ortberg wants to instill a sense of urgency and shared sacrifice, said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. But on the other hand, the move threatens further antagonizing the very workers Boeing needs to restart jetliner production, at a time when skilled mechanics are in high demand. Even before Friday\u2019s announcement, the war of words had intensified. Both Boeing and the union filed formal complaints accusing the other of breaching the protocol for labor negotiations.\n\n(Selected Excerpts from Bloomberg)", "id": "1g2wx8k", "created_utc": 1728845813.0, "score": 688, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 2275 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19663606584072113}, {"body": "Boeing's hitmen haven't worked in months", "score": 158, "replies": [{"body": "They got laid off", "score": 77, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4621184766292572}, {"body": "\ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.038032010197639465}, {"body": "puts on BA then if the hitmen are off.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Great read I always heard the labor cost were less than 5%.

I have worked for all the biggest aircraft companies in the world, including Lockheed, Boeing and Airbus and at least 8 others. I have written class 1 software, (DO-178C DAL A), and achieved certification for that software on those aircraft. Additionally I have designed complete avionic suites inculding all sensors, integration and testing (DO-254). I have also been a developer for ILS and GPS systems. As a contract consultant I am totally capitalist, however even I know the importance of an experienced loyal workforce. \n\nI know the steps that have to have happened to fuck up that badly. The Flight Control Systems (FCS) are safety critical. They are class 1, (DO-178C DAL A). Nothing should interfere with their operation. Yet MCAS was allowed to overwrite the FCS. When you design a Safety critical system you use multiple types of sensors from multiple locations as input. MCAS used 1 sensor in 1 location and used this to overwrite outputs from the FCS. The amount of lies and fake documents produced to get that through the certification bodies is a lot!\n\nThe whole reason for Boeing doing this is because the Airbus 320 family were using engines that were 20% more efficient. That is a big saving on the operating costs and customers liked that. Boeing had to change their engines to compete. They added larger engines which changed the position of the 737 centre of gravity. When this happened the Flight Control System (FCS) software should have been rewritten and retested. This would have cause around 12 months delay  and around $20 million. Instead they came up with MCAS. That is inherently  unsafe as it it one sensor in one location. They also never told the pilots about it as that would have meant retraining. They have now provided retraining however MCAS is still unsafe! The correct solution would be to change the FCS software.\n\nYes I am totally serious. Each of the CEOs Muilenburg onward are no different from each other. The only hope is a 180 degree shift in position and I don't think that will happen. \n\nMy prediction is that Boeing are in the shit. They will be split up and those parts sold of. Defence is worth having, someone like Lockheed or Airbus will take over commercial and space will be dumped. There will be other bits too.
