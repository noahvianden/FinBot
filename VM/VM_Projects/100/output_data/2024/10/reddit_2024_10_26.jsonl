{"title": "Week 43 $841 in premium ", "selftext": "I will post a separate comment with a link that includes the detail behind each option sold this week.\n\nAfter week 43 the average premium per week is $773 with a projected annual premium of $40,218.\n\nAll things considered, the portfolio is up +$43,612 (+19.59%) on the year and up $92,973 (+53.65%) over the last 365 days. This is the overall profit and loss and includes options and all other account activity.\n\nAll options sold are backed by cash, shares, or LEAPS. I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.\n\nAll options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. I took out $17K earlier this year for taxes and various expenses. I replaced some of the $17K with a $9K deposit recently. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. \n\nAdded $500 in contributions to the portfolio. This is a 28 week streak of adding at least $500.\n\nThe portfolio is comprised of 95 unique tickers with a value of $172k. I also have 141 open option positions, up from 135 last week. The options have a total value of $94k. The total of the shares and options is $266k. \n\nI\u2019m currently utilizing $39,150 in cash secured put collateral.\n\nI sell options on a weekly basis. I prefer cash secured puts and covered calls. Sometimes I\u2019m ahead of the indexes and sometimes I\u2019m behind. My goal is consistency in option premium revenue. As shown below, I have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. \n\n1 year performance (365 days)\nME 53.65% |*\nNasdaq 44.44%  |\nS&P 500 38.73% |\nRussell 2000 33.70% |\nDow Jones 27.48% |\n\n*Taxes are not accounted for in this percentage. The percentage is taken directly from my brokerage account. Although, taxes are a major part of investing, I don\u2019t disclose my personal tax information.\n\nI have been able to increase the premiums on an annual basis and I will attempt to keep this upward trend going forward. \n\n2025 & 2026 & 2027 LEAPS\nIn addition to the CSPs and covered calls, I purchase LEAPS. These act as collateral to sell covered calls against. You may have heard of poor man\u2019s covered calls(PMCC). The LEAPS are down $4,129 this week and are up $34,257 overall.\nSee r/ExpiredOptions for a detailed spreadsheet update on all LEAPS positions including P/L for each individual position.\n\nLast year I sold 964 options and I\u2019m at 1,138 year to date.\n\nTotal premium by year:\n2022 $8,551 in premium |\n2023 $22,908 in premium |\n2024 $33,257 YTD |\n\nI am over $74k in total options premium, since 2021.

If your 12 month return is 55% and your \\~10 month return is 20%, that means you had a two month \"bang up\" period of \\~35%, and those will quickly fall off the table, so unless you have a similar time this Nov/Dec, your 12 month will rapidly drop down towards that 20%.\n\nSo let's use your preference of 12 months of 55%.

I have portfolio of approx.25k\u20ac and I had an idea of using options with collection of premiums, so mainly margin covered puts and covered calls on bi-weekly to monthly expiries. Do you think that is viable strategy?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hi Mithril1991. Thank you for the comments and question. Good work on the 32%YTD. \n\nDo I think collecting premiums on covered calls (CCs) and cash secured puts (CSPs) is a viable strategy? It is what I have been doing for a while and it has been working for me. \n\nThings to considers:\n\nI personally don't use margin. I used to when interest rates were lower, now I collect interest on my unused investment capital. If rates get back to a level where I it makes more sense to leverage the money, I may revisit margin.\n\nCan you contribute on a regular basis? I am not saying this is a must for everyone, but if you want to grow your account, you should not just rely on returns. I personally contribute $500 per week. This is the amount that I know that I can commit to with my current budget.\n\nCSPs and CCs are one-legged options. I think these are enough for what I'm doing, you can get into multi-legged spreads that can be beneficial for managing risk and leveraging your account. I use the KISS method which is keep it simple stupid (stupid is me in this case). Once you have learned the basics of covered calls and CSPs, spreads are not too difficult to wrap your head around, but some of them can be a bit trickery to roll, manage.\n\nHow much time do you have to watch the positions during the day? Me personally, I roll a lot. My objective is to collect the premium and keep the shares on covered calls. Will I be upset if the shares are assigned and called away? No, I understand the way that the option works and like the way an option has defined risks and outcomes, upfront. This means that I roll A LOT. If the position goes in an unfavorable direction, I may roll up and out. If it goes in a favorable direction I may roll down and in. \n\nHaving a healthy curiosity for business news helps too. Knowing the companies you invest in is half the battle. Knowing the macro-economics of the business news world is necessary too. You should keep on global and domestic news stories. Not all of them, but the ones that affect the companies you invest in. This means you should be aware of tariffs, the upcoming election, fed meetings, rate cut rumors, and your companies quarterly earnings schedule. \n\nCan you invest without emotion? You have to make a lot of decisions, sometimes you have to make decisions quickly. Are you making decisions that will affect your budget in that month? When starting out, you don't want to rely on income from investing. Having added pressure to preform can lead to high risk outcomes. So, investing money that you don't need for a long period of time is a must. \n\nTLDR: Investing takes a commitment of time and money. Options can be a lucrative tool to add to your investment repertoire. You should keep up on business news and keep your emotions in check. \n\nBest of luck to you in your new journey!

Thanks for the comments. First of all, nice job saving up $10k. Usually my first suggestion is getting your financials in order. If you are able to save up $10k, it looks like you are doing something right. \n\nWith your description of what you are looking to do, it looks like you want to start a \"wheel strategy\". This is a widely popular strategy. I am ignorant to the UK tax systems, so I am not helpful in that aspect. If you are able to find volatility on stocks that you intend to own long term, I think you are on the right path. \n\nAs far as tips go, you can wheel where you find the volatility or you can find tickers that you believe to be long term. I personally just collect tickers that I believe in for a long term, buy and hold strategy. On top of that, I sell options for premium. These premiums compliments the buy and hold. \n\nAlso, I think that taking pieces of investing advice from a broad range of sources and making your own path is the best way to go. You are the one that knows your financials. You know how much you can contribute and how much time you want to dedicate to investing. With those knowns about your personal situation, you can start to incorporate other strategies into your repertoire until you have a custom strategy that best suites your personal needs. \n\nHope this helps.
