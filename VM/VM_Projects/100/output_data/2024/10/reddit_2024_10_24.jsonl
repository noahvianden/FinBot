Lower material costs, an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to Tesla\u2019s best quarterly earnings in more than a year.\n\n> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk offered an upbeat outlook for 2025, citing the rollout of more affordable models that Tesla has yet to identify. \u201cSomething like 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess,\u201d he said on a webcast.\n\n> Tesla\u2019s shares jumped 22% Thursday in New York, the biggest gain since May 2013. That helped add tens of billions of dollars to Musk\u2019s net worth and sent the stock into positive territory for the year, erasing a slump in the weeks since the CEO unveiled self-driving taxi and van prototypes.", "id": "1gbcged", "created_utc": 1729801533.0, "score": 208, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "How much of this has to do with the sales of regulatory credits?", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "739MM regulatory credits contributing to a 2,167MM net income.
