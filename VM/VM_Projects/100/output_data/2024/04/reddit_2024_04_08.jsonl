{"title": "Snowflake (SNOW) ls worth buying on declines", "selftext": "I bought Snowflake #SNOW at $154 today.\n\n\n\n**Positives:**\n\nThere is some sandbagging in the guidance for the incoming CEO to make a better mark, I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve completely elaborated on likely growing revenue streams.\n\nNew CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy has an excellent resume, 15 years at Google, then he co-founded Neeva, which was bought by Snowflake. With his tech cred he actually has better product knowledge than the outgoing legendary CEO, Frank Slootman, and his tech cred should be a big factor in taking Snowflake forward.\n\nIts partnership with Nvidia is a fairly big deal for a recurring AL/LLM solutions/services. Snowflake\u2019s AI product, Cortex should be out in the second or third quarter of 2024. Snowflake has also responded well to Databricks comparisons and shouldn\u2019t be seen as lagging. The other new product Snowpark should also grow a lot faster.\n\nSnowflake\u2019s free cash flow margin was very impressive at 35% of sales last year. Like most tech companies it doesn\u2019t generate GAAP profits, but this a hugely positive number, it exceeds Crowdstrike\u2019s 30% and several other tech growers. It has indicated 29% free cash flow margin for 2024.\n\nMoving to a consumption model has shown poorer forecasted revenue growth at 22-23% but bookings are growing at much faster levels, Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) grew at 41% so this is not a long term problem.\n\nNegatives\n\nThe company is expensive at 15x sales with only 23% growth! Even after the stock being 35% lower than its 52 week high.\n\nIt could stay sideways for a year, or if there is another weak quarter, it could drop to $130-135, where it\u2019s down to 12-13 x sales.
