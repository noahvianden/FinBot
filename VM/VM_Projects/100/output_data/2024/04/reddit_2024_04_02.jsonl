{"title": "Warren Buffett-backed EV maker BYD surprises with stellar first quarter sales as Tesla continues to slide", "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-backed-ev-maker-222549280.html\n\n> Chinese carmaker BYD is gaining momentum in the increasingly competitive global EV race, while the dominance of longtime leader Tesla wanes.\n\n> The Warren-Buffett backed carmaker on Monday reported a 13% year-over-year increase in \u201cnew-energy\u201d vehicle sales, which includes both electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In total, the company sold 626,263 vehicles in the first quarter, of which about 300,114 were pure EVs.\n\n> BYD\u2019s strong first quarter performance contrasts with plummeting expectations for Elon Musk-owned EV maker Tesla, whose stock has dropped nearly 30% year-to-date.\n\n> Several analysts have revised down their projections for the company\u2019s first quarter vehicle deliveries (an approximate gauge for sales), after reports of a cutback in production at Tesla\u2019s factory in Shanghai.\n\n> Wedbush Securities cut their estimate to 425,968 from about 475,000. If Wedbush\u2019s prediction is accurate Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries will have grown less than 1% year over year, but would still be higher than BYD\u2019s pure EV sales during the same period.
