It also comes in different configurations like a bundle of eight Gaudi 3 chips on one motherboard or a card that can slot into existing systems.\n\n>Intel said that the new Gaudi 3 chips would be available to customers in the third quarter, and companies including Dell, HP and Supermicro will build systems with the chips. Intel didn't provide a price range for Gaudi 3.\n\n>\"We are working with the software ecosystem to build open reference software, as well as building blocks that allow you to stitch together a solution that you need, rather than be forced into buying a solution,\" Sachin Katti, senior vice president of Intel's networking group, said on a call with reporters.\n\n>Gaudi 3 is built on a five nanometer process, a relatively recent manufacturing technique, suggesting that the company is using an outside foundry to manufacture the chips. In addition to designing Gaudi 3, Intel also plans to manufacture AI chips, potentially for outside companies, at a new Ohio factory expected to open in 2027 or 2028, CEO Patrick Gelsinger told reporters last month.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "1bzvurm", "created_utc": 1712678644.0, "score": 533, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "faulty disgusted sink tan oil lunchroom unite resolute joke air\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -31, "replies": [{"body": "Wtf", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20174509286880493}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2569994628429413}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.028101209551095963}, {"body": "\"So why is Intel comparing Gaudi 3 to the H100 and H200 instead of\u00a0[Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPU](https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-unveils-next-gen-blackwell-gpus-with-25x-lower-costs-and-energy-consumption/), which launched in March?

Which is why you've got to wonder if Musk refusing to clamp down on LIES about the upcoming election, outright lies aimed at deceiving the voters, is actually a great idea.\n\nThese Lies include:\n\n1. The leftist candidate plans to close down churches when elected\n2. The current president wants to let men use public-school restrooms next to little girls\n3. The former right-wing president confessed to Cannibalism and Pedophilia.\n\nHow do outright lies help voters make informed decisions? It's pollution.\n\nIn the past certain political groups advertised FALSE information on Twitter about voting places and dates to groups they thought unlikely to support their candidate. These people getting false information about what they needed to vote, where to vote, and when to vote, prevented them from casting their votes.\n\nHow does being lied to about when, where, and how you can legally vote help democracy?\n\nPeople forget that there are all sorts of laws regulating speech in every country. There are laws against McDonalds taking out adds saying that Wendy's burgers contain rat poison.There are laws against McDonalds releasing an ad that says the CEO of Wendy's is a pedophile.\n\nBrazil's law IS on the extreme end. They are also dealing with extreme and escalating disinformation campaigns. At bot networks become more sophisticated and better able to imitate humans through AI LLMs, this is only going to get worse. Content platforms will have to find ways to moderate avalanches of disinformation for the health of their platform and to reduce the impact of corrupt propaganda.\n\nI'm all for unpopular TRUTHS being shared. But alarmist lies about candidates don't help democracy, any more than lies about a rival restaraunt's burgers being poisoned helps people make an informed choice of where they want to eat. It's information pollution.\n\nSo why is Musk refusing to comply with the law? Is he making a big, principled stand? He sure didn't when actual dictators told him to restrict anti-dictator content. He was happy to do that. No, he's only making a big stand now, when he'd have to do something about the misinformation that is aimed at subverting legitimate elections.
