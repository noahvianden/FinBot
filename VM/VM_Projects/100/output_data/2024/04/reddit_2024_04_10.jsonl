At this point, most people will die on that hill then try to see a different point of view.\n\nI agree and disagree with your point on social media.  Those companies are very much like any other company that works in media.  Most of their revenue is based on ads.  So newspapers print ads and social media has links that they get paid for based on how many people click on it.  \n\nArticles are written by people who write them for the purpose of getting viewership and the editors print the ones that they think their viewers will read and hopefully see the ads and increase revenue.  \n\nThis is a rule to propaganda.  Not that someone is printing some huge lie.  They are printing what they think the people want and therefore, increase their bottom line.  \n\nOnce they have a certain amount of followers and they have gained an \"honest\" reputation, they can bend the truth.  Or in some cases, just outright lie.  Some people may fact check it and call them out for it, but most won't and will believe it to be truth.  \n\nIf they lie too much, their reputation is eventually tarnished and people lose interest and then the bottom line reflects this. Unless the viewers are in an echo chamber, in which their belief system is reinforced with bad information.  \n\nThe technology has been there since we had language.  The Nazis used it during WWII before social media and it has been used throughout centuries by monarchies and religions to get people to pay taxes or lay down their lives for a purpose, whatever it may be. \n\nThe name propaganda came from the Catholics during the 17th century but it was really utilized in the modern day by Edward Bernays.  If you are interested, he wrote some very interesting books that I recommend.  \n\nIn my opinion, it's just understanding if you are being manipulated and/or being proactive about figuring out if someone is telling you the truth or not.  Sadly, a lot of people do not take the time to do this for one reason or another.  \n\nThis is where I believe the government should step in and investigate these companies/people.

I try to take the bigger picture into consideration as to where things are heading and keep that in mind when making a trade. \n\nRecently day trading strategy has worked almost every time with a profit. Ive learned over the past 3 years through trial and error on what works for me. learned some expensive lessons and this is what I've been doing since. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not buy options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI buy block shares on major break outs and keep a tight stop loss. It works 99% of the time with a gain or break even. The other 1% I take a small loss. Over time I'm building back my portfolio. \n\nExample: I use technical analysis mostly on my day trades. I'll scan the premarket for the volume movers and I check the news in the morning for anything that might have happened over night or could be a catalyst for an upcoming trade. Once i find an attractive set up ill establish small position on what I see as a steady level of support. Ill slowly start to accumulate until it reaches a massive breakout range and then ill buy a block of $5k ( by starting my small positions first i am always in the green starting off) . Ride that parabolic move up and wait for a cool off or pullback to establish its price discovery to see where buyers are stepping back in. I then set my stop loss to break even average to give it room to breath. That way worst outcome is break even with some transaction fees. I will usually ride the momentum until it breaks the closes level of support and then I'm out of the trade completely to reassess reentering or being done with it completely. It might be a small gain or a massive gain depending on the break out but it almost guarantees me something in the green. Shares also allow you to turn your day trade into a swing or a long if the trade starts working against you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is instead of buying a contract for 100 shares on a timeline. Buy the 100 shares outright and allow it to work on your time instead of the markets. \n\nSince I started using this day trade technique I've been able to make up a large portion of my losses already from some of the losers Ive had over the years, I still have a ways to go but as for now I'm gonna stick to what's working. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbiggest lessons learned \n\n1. Stop loss no matter what... allow yourself some room to wiggle but always set a stop loss if the trades working against you\n2. cut your fucking losers, and take your fucking profits ... Im a very stubborn person and rode the memestock craze through the AMC squeeze  where i was up 26k just to hold through another year to sell for a 3k profit. I was delusional in not taking profits , my other mistake was buying into some Chinese ADR massive pumps in gambling with a lotto ticket (MEGL,HKD) I was delusional to think id be able to average down on some of these irrational pumps. I ended up chasing those losers until i finally capitulated years later with a massive loss. CUT THOSE FUCKING LOSERS YOUVE BEEN HOLDING ON TOO.. and reallocated that capital. \n\nAs someone who sees the forest and not the trees. This is a risk on market.

As far as my day trades I don\u2019t go by percentages I got by technical analysis of major areas of support/ resistance. I look for volume and momentum and will nibble until it picks a direction. I use 5k blocks to day trade with. Sometime I\u2019m scalping these trades within seconds to minutes to mitigate my risk and taking what I can. \n\nI\u2019ll start a position with $200 at a major level of support and usually it will bounce from that and enter my position, that gets my foot in the door. I then use the 5 min to slowly accumulate off that support or in that zone as I increase my position. Usually there\u2019s a major breakout ahead and up until that point I nibble. At the major break out I\u2019ll dump the rest of the 5k and let it ride. If it drops I\u2019m still in the green because of my average and I will set a stop loss at break even. This will give it time to pick a direction. If I get stopped out I reasses sometimes leave the trade all together , if it climbs I ride it through the major break out and wait for it to retrace to see where buyers begin to step in again. Once I see that first level of support start to build (even if it is weak) I set my next stop loss at a 100% to ensure I made all the gains even if it is small. As it begins to climb to new levels and building new support I dial back my stop loss from a 100% to 75% and quarter it down. That way if the first support gets triggered I lock in profits and still allow my break even stop to ride incase it continues up. That way I have like 4-6 brackets and maybe a Hail Mary to let ride incase it runs parabolic or turns into a swing to squeeze more out of it.  \n\nThis might be confusing but hope this helps a little", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8225232362747192}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4947044551372528}, {"body": "Where do you keep track of all this data.
