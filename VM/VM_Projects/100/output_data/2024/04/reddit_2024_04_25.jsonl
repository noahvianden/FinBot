Nominal GDP growth was still at 6.3% in 2023, 6.7% over the second half of 2023, and 5.1% for Q4 2023. And I'm doubtful it will have fallen below 5% in Q1 2024 either (as GDP Now is projecting 2.4% real). I'd say that will probably need to fall at least below 4.5%.\n>\n>    2. Core PCE, their preferred target, was only 1.9% annualized for the second half of 2023, very slightly below target, so there is reason to at least think they could be getting close. But it did surge to 4.4% over the first 2 months of 2024 (5.6% in Jan, 3.2% in Feb). These numbers are volatile month to month, and factors like an unseasonably warm winter could also impact them. But this suggests there could yet be some work to do.\n>\n>    3. While I'm not buying recession forecasts at this point, there are still at least a few indicators flashing warnings, and overall I think the data suggests there may be at least some additional slowing already baked in through summer. So best not to over-react to recent numbers being a little worse than expected.\n\nSo I see nominal GDP at only 4.8% to be a good thing, getting closer to where it needs to be. The market is reacting more to the inflation number, but given we already knew Core PCE was at a 4.4% annualized rate for the first 2 months, coming in at 3.7% annualized for the quarter really isn't terrible. \n\nOverall, we shouldn't yet be expecting the Fed to lower rates anytime soon with these inflation numbers, but this also suggests they won't need to go in the other direction and increase rates, either. \n\nThe main point in that post above was that due to the usual volatility in month to month or even quarter to quarter inflation numbers, you don't want to over-react to short term numbers there, and nominal GDP is probably a better measure of whether policy is where it needs to be in the longer run.\n\nInflation itself will have a tightening effect on consumer spending and economic growth.
