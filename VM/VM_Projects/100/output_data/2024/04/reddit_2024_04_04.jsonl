If 1hr RSI lines cross down then I sell weekly CCs, if they cross up I stop selling and buy calls instead.  If the daily price is hitting the upper bollinger band then a rally is probably in-progress and I ignore the shorter-term signals until price stops touching the upper band for a few days.

It is a typical range of emotions for people who are newer to this type of strategy.  I will give you my 2 cents.\n\nFirst:  Selling covered calls is typically done for 2 main reasons.  The first is because its an income strategy to produce \"income\" selling premium.  Its done in conjunction with selling cash secured puts as part of a wheel strategy.  There's a few universal rules to this.  1: Only do the wheel strategy on \"great companies\" you know will recover if they go into correction. and 2: This strategy works best in a Tax advantaged account like Roth or Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account) because you don't pay taxes on the premium received in those accounts.\n\nThe 2nd reason people typically sell covered calls is because they are OK with letting their shares go if the stock goes above the strike price they sell but if it doesn't they plan on holding anyway.\n\nSuffice it to say that selling covered calls SHOULD NOT be done on a stock you will want to sell for a loss if it starts to correct.  Now that doesn't mean your thesis on the stock cant change.  So if your thesis on the stock changes then by all means closing your position is prudent.  But make sure its a factual fundamental reason and not an emotional one.\n\nSo with all that said what you do depends on what you think about Tesla.  If you think they have fundamentally fallen from grace for whatever reason and it doesn't align with your views on the business then selling is justified.  Move on and learn from the situation.\n\nBut if you still believe in Tesla and they have not broken down fundamentally then hold it.  A loss isn't a loss until you realize it by selling.\n\nA final words of wisdom tip I think might help you is this.  When you receive premium for selling covered calls make an excel tracker to keep track of all the per share premium received.  Subtract \"taxes\" from that value to give you an accurate representation of how much your \"cost basis\" has come down per share.  This only works if you keep track of the premium and subtract the taxes from it.  You could also add to that by investing the premium in a high yield savings for the rest of the tax year and then figure out the interest that your premium grew to.  There are many things you can do but the most important thing is to take emotion out of it.

That's borderline small cap territory. Even boring Puma's market cap is more than double that of UAA\n\n**Fundamentals**:\n\nUAA has a good balance sheet with a debt to equity ratio of 31%. Four years ago it was at 87%. It also has a net profit margin of 7% - it's highest for years\n\n**Ownership**\n\nFounder/CEO Kevin Plank owns 12% of UAA. BDT Capital Partners owns 10% and has been steadily building its stake. BDT is a PE firms with a seemingly good record of successful turnarounds.  Bryon Trott (the CEO of BDT) is known to be Buffett's favorite banker. \n\n**Stock price**\n\nI already mentioned this at the start but the stock currently trades at 13% *lower* than the price at the Covid crash\n\n**Brand Awareness**\n\nScores 88% in the brand awareness according to Statista\n\nSo sounds like a slam dunk,. Not by any means. UAA has had quite a few problems. Eg:\n\n**Management:**\n\nUAA has had 3 CEOs in four years, not a good sign,\n\n**Inventory Management**\n\nUAA had a major issue with overstocking which forced to deeply discount its inventory, with obvious implications to the brand.\n\n**Brand Likeability** \n\nOnly scores a lowly 41% according to Statista.\n\n  \nUAA has issues that its still needs to resolve and constant turnover of senior management doesn't help. BDT's involvement should help keep a steady reign on the ship and hopefully turn around a brand which is well known, but seems to be a little lost. At current valuation there looks to be a reasonable margin of safety and its solid balance sheet should give it some resilience.\n\n  \n***Disclosure:*** *I'm long UAA and this is a small position for me (1.5%).

But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.\n\n## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes\n\nLet\u2019s start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn\u2019t matter much towards the end. But it\u2019s true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria\u2019s cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.\u00a0\n\n## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry\n\nLosing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you\u2019re the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit\u2019s about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.\n\n## PMTA Registered List\n\nAltria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don\u2019t even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They\u2019re all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.\n\nSo Altria\u2019s bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it\u2026 until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.\n\n## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape\n\nSo Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you\u2019re underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA\u2019s tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/). The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they\u2019ll get it if they approve.\n\n## Altria\u2019s On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they\u2019re expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).\n\nOne of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.\n\n## Altria\u2019s \u201cMoving Beyond Smoking\u201d Plan\n\nAltria is dead set on its new campaign, \u201c[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)\u201d. They know smoking rates are declining so they\u2019re repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That\u2019s why Morningstar says they\u2019re worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it\u2019s a value stock.\n\n## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev\n\nAltria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes.
