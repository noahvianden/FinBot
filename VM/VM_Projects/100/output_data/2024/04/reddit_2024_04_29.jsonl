Since everyone is blindly bullish on NVDA, you should have avoided including the ticker in your question.\n\nTo answer your option related question, you are looking to make the most money because you think NVDA will be under $200 in 2 years.\n\nSay your crystal ball works only 2 years out, and it is cloudy in the meantime, then you need to wait until one week/month/quarter before the 2 year mark and buy all the 300-350 puts you can buy. You could trade other options or spreads to finance the put purchase.\n\nOn a serious note, you have no idea if and when they will be accused of financial misreporting, and you have no idea if they are actually doing anything wrong, yet you are accusing them of fraud. Go easy now, tiger.\n\nMy advice, as someone who has traded options for over 25 years, is that you do not focus your anger and disgust at a company that is doing well, where you see potential pipeline or other issues. I did that with a phone company that was ran by a serial fraudster, and while I ended up being right, and the stock crashed 80% from it's highs, I barely made any money on it. I would trade bearish call/put spreads each quarter, hoping they would come clean about a buried regulatory ruling which pretty much killed their business model, but they never did. I lost or broke even for over a year, close to two years. Then one day they came clean, not only about the ruling but about other shitty issues they had not properly disclosed, and the stock tanked and kept tanking. Then in the end, it was sold to a foreign company. It was a winner's curse - I felt vindicated for being negative and short, and staying short, but I barely broke even on the trades.\n\nPS: being an accounting genius is a rare trait....instead of looking for that one time windfall because of your accounting smarts, look for more frequent smaller wins that will add up, and do not be emotional about it.

Buying a benz is such a scrub move. \n\nThe brand is less for the rich/wealthy but poors who want to pretend to be rich. Just like Coach, Supreme, Hermes, Ferrari, or anything from LVMH (Great investment btw. Been owning it for years and it's paid off off like a boss. Basic bitches, bitchy bitches, bossy bitches, slutty bitches, classy bitches, etcetc. Don't matter they all love LV bags.)\n\nReason why is because those who are actually rich/wealthy value their time the most and that's not Mercedes. You don't own the Merc. Merc owns you: cringe salesmen, constant brake downs and error messages, price gouging dealers mechanics, higher insurance, \"recommended\" BS from premium fuel to authentic parts, lifestyle creep, the quality is a lie since most new models won't last 100K+ (for that you want a Lexus/Acura, Honda/Toyota, Subaru or Porsche if you must go German), you can't park it just wherever for fear of damage, you can't max rev it because it's your precious merc, and every mofo trying to rip off your lil'merc logo. \n\nEven the actual wealthy/rich people who drive benz don't \"own\" merc cars: ***they lease them***. That cuts the Merc BS you have to deal with in half: cringe merc dealer will just give you the advertised lease price, breakdown issues are the dealer's problem, overpriced maintenance/parts isn't your problem either, plus the multiple warnings for shit going wrong are all covered, and you'll return it after your lease ends so you can redline that shit as much as you like. One good thing about Mercedes is their service reps and service are decent so most rich mofos like just dropping off the car whenever it has problems/maintenance, picking up some free coffee/breakfast, getting a new service vehicle for the weekend or a concierge to wherever they are going, and then get their car back fixed and washed (cause they value the time/convenience).", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Just gonna leave this here - I drive a Benz built in 2012.
