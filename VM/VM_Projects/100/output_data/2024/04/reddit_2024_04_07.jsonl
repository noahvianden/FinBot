It\u2019s a question that gets asked here quite often. I\u2019ll explain.\n\nAs a shareholder, you own a part of the business and therefore own a part of the business\u2019s earnings, as well as their assets and any liabilities they have. That means as the company\u2019s earnings and assets increase, the value of the company increases. The share price follows this value growth in quite complex ways. Sometimes a share price follows a company\u2019s value with a strong correlation (over the long term 10+ years it will follow the share price exactly), but sometimes it can lag the company\u2019s true value or go above where it should be. \n\nThis lag or overshoot in the share price can sometimes take years to revert to the business\u2019s true value. Sometimes if it\u2019s really lagging a company will buy back its shares or issue a dividend. But in reality the lag is always temporary because the business has increased its earnings and is therefore worth more. This increase in value represents an increased yield to investors and eventually gets reflected in the share price. You can think of this as a dividend yield if that\u2019s easier to wrap your head around (i.e as a company\u2019s earnings increase they can naturally increase their dividend).\n\nThis brings me back to my original point: you should think of yourself as part owner of a business and look for companies with good financials and high free cash flow. Because free cash flow is what companies use to pay dividends.

This is because growth stocks might offer the potential for higher returns through stock price increases as the company grows.\n\nFocusing solely on dividend stocks from the start might lead to missing out on the higher potential returns that growth stocks can offer. While reinvesting dividends is a solid strategy, the compound growth from high-performing non-dividend stocks or ETFs might outweigh the benefits of dividend reinvesting in the long term.
