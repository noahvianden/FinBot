Let\u2019s go over each category here\n\nMercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot & we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.\n\nHere\u2019s the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot \n\n1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets\n\n2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.\n\n3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns\n\n4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn\u2019t work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights \n\n5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn\u2019t work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones\n\n6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use\n\n7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes \n\n8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required \n\n9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country\n\nSo if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress & will be big winner in this category. \n\nNow before you tesla haters, \ud83d\udc3b open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy & is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real & constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable \n\nThey won\u2019t go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash.

The AT&T deal is really encouraging.  I\u2019m not really bullish on Rivian but it has commercial streams which provide better support than consumer streams.  So from a sustainability perspective they stand a better shot than Tesla in this way.  These deals are more important than the rental deals as the rental companies generally flip inventory every 3 years and Teslas do have resale issues given battery conditioning challenges.  This makes them less attractive for these large scale purchases.  The commercial deals are fully capitalized purchases, longer use cycle, but lower barriers to just get refresh orders and continuing revenue since fleet consistency is advantageous (sticky vendor benefit).\n\nHertz dumping Tesla confirms a market direction problem. They can make a great car but it doesn\u2019t mean the market wants it.  As irrational it is, EV range fear is a real problem and winters in the north don\u2019t help change the market opinion.  The Model 2 could potentially confirm it\u2019s not a price issue and more of a usability issue for people which would be devastating.  Given how they are reusing as much as they can for the Model 2, this has to be part of the hedge - why waste time really building something that ultimately won\u2019t sell.\n\nFSD as a feature isn\u2019t really part of the purchase conversation that will make or break a sale for most people.  Consumers are still worried it won\u2019t make it 2 blocks to get them to the grocery store still.  So as far as stock impacting, it pales to actual delivery numbers and frankly probably won\u2019t move the stock since only nerds and techies care.  FSD technicalities are better debated on the Tesla subreddit.\n\nFSD as IP though is interesting and a question on the earnings call alluded to that when Elon did confirm they are in discussions to license out the technology with at least one carrier.\n\nThe market appetite is really around hybrids.  The market is concerned on range and hybrids still use gas which consumers are comfortable with.  If the Model 2 sales are not extremely strong - and I mean significant blow out, Elon is better off changing the narrative by discontinuing producing cars in general. He can claim a win by saying he jump started an industry to develop a platform to then build FSD, charging infrastructure, battery technology, and autonomous technology.  At the end of the day if you put a Prius and a Tesla in front of your average soccer mom, she\u2019s probably taking the Prius.  Gas isn\u2019t going away and techies and environmentalists need to get over themselves and understand this reality.\n\nHe can let the auto industry continue to make vehicles and just focus on licensing the technology and selling components for everything at a higher profit margin.  Who cares if he sells cars for a profit, the stock will get hammered just from the lowering of the multiple as market size critical capacity will be reached if they stay as a car manufacturer.
