The market at the time was very favourable, there was very strong demand for a practical EV and Tesla capitalised on that. They caught legacy car makers with their pants down. They offered a product far better than anyone else at the time because nobody else cared. I do not think its fair to attribute the success of Tesla purely at Elon's feet. The real unsung heroes at Tesla are its engineers. Unfortunately, Tesla has begun to haemorrhage some of its best and brightest more recently and the EV technology lead, not lead... EV technology chasm that Tesla had has mostly been squandered now. Take Peter Rawlinson for example, he turned the Model S into what it is today, not Elon. Look at what he is doing now, it is hard to deny that Lucid makes the best luxury EVs thanks to him. They might not be cheap, but they are better than a Model S in absolutely every metric. It was the technology that Tesla engineers pioneered that went into the Model 3 and turned Tesla into a global EV powerhouse. Tesla was practically untouchable in the EV market.\n\nBut where has that gone since then. Tesla used to have the fastest, the longest range, and best value for money EVs on the market but not any more. Others car makers, especially the Chinese EV manufacturers have all but wiped out much of Tesla's lead there. The only lead that Tesla really has today is in FSD technology, and even there the technology gap is quickly closing as other manufacturers catch up.

Tesla has been going backwards. Just about half its market value has now been wiped out. Instead of leading Tesla, he is too busy partying with rightwing nutjobs on Twitter. The Cybertruck was beaten to market by almost every other manufacturer, and is nowhere near as good as it was promised to be. The Roadster 2.0 is still vapourware. The Model 2 which should have been Tesla's primary focus is now indefinitely postponed. The moment where things are starting to get difficult, where is Elon?

I reiterate, for your understanding, every auto company since Ford over 100 years has gone bankrupt in the US. These companies were not starved of bright intelligent people working nor were they lacking people with business qualifications . The top CEO position makes the difference in a company and the extensive list of failures by far outweigh the success Elon bred.

It's that simple if you're concerned about valuation don't buy Tesla. Tesla has previously had the world's highest concentration of short positions in the world.

Save yourself some stress and sell your position.\nSo for actual company performance you think they have been \" going backwards \" the stock price once valued the company over $1 trillion dollars in Nov 2021.
