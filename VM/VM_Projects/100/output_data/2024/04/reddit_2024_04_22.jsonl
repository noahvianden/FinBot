Likewise, most of our grid is still from coal/gas and has seen marginal increases at absolute best (and regression in some states!).\n\nThe EV play was also coupled with rising gas prices and the idea as we enter an age of declining EROEI (essentially peak oil but less 2000s blog terms) that we need to move toward more electric non-gas vehicles.

{"title": "Tesla- Don't You Dare Buy Calls", "selftext": "Despite this not being financial advise, here are 24 reasons you should not go long on this stock in any way or form:\n\n1. Ceo takes Ketamine\n2. Ceo takes Ketamine (this is not a control c, control v mistake)\n3. Pay-package related dilution expected (\\~10%) and is another dumpster fire of a debate; possible shareholder revolt coming\n4. QoQ negative growth of sales has materialized (first negative quarter)\n5. Decrease in operating margins (read point 6)\n6. Price wars in an oligopolistic industry are akin to a knife fight that nobody wants to walk away from. Also they are just beginning instead of ending (Li Autos decreased price today in response)\n7. Robo-taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem\n8. Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough, the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation\n9. Lay-offs, talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming, special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth\n10. Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i.e. democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states\n11. Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over-priced a few earnings ago\n12. Ceo is not full-time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars\n13. China is bank-rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD, Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory)\n14. Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer\n15. No single product that could yield out-sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization\n16. Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift\n17. At the end of the day, no car-marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique\n18. Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1/6 or 1/8th the price\n19. Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe-dream\n20. Cash balance controlling for short-term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues, the existing slight-above junk credit rating will worsen\n21. They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny, they don't talk about that much anymore\n22. Just laid-off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected\n23. Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla\n24. Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned. This show marks of irrationality which needs to be met with the timing of positive solvency\n\nHere is 1 reason you might consider buying:\n\n1. Regard\n\n-------------------------\n\nPrice Target: By September \\~$100\n\nAnd now if your response is...\"call it is because inverse WSB\"...then you deserve that cute little financial grave.\n\nPositions: Bought majority of my positions they day Robo Taxi was announced.
