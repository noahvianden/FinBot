{"title": "Tesla Autopilot has 'critical safety gap' linked to hundreds of collisions: NHTSA", "selftext": "Federal authorities say a \u201ccritical safety gap\u201d in Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system contributed to at least 467 collisions, 13 resulting in fatalities and \u201cmany others\u201d resulting in serious injuries.\n\nThe findings come from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysis of 956 crashes in which Tesla Autopilot was thought to have been in use. The results of the nearly three-year investigation were published Friday.\n\nTesla\u2019s Autopilot design has \u201cled to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,\u201d the NHTSA report said. The system did not \u201csufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.\u201d\n\nNHTSA\u2019s filing pointed to a \u201cweak driver engagement system,\u201d and Autopilot that stays switched on even when a driver isn\u2019t paying adequate attention to the road or the driving task. The driver engagement system includes various prompts, including \u201cnags\u201d or chimes, that tell drivers to pay attention and keep their hands on the wheel, as well as in-cabin cameras that can detect when a driver is not looking at the road. \n\nThe agency also said it was opening a new probe into the effectiveness of a software update Tesla previously issued as part of a recall in December. That update was meant to fix Autopilot defects that NHTSA identified as part of this same investigation.\n\nThe voluntary recall via an over-the-air software update covered 2 million Tesla vehicles in the U.S., and was supposed to specifically improve driver monitoring systems in Teslas equipped with Autopilot.\n\nNHTSA suggested in its report Friday that the software update was probably inadequate, since more crashes linked to Autopilot continue to be reported.\n\nIn one recent example, a Tesla driver in Snohomish County, Washington, struck and killed a motorcyclist on April 19, according to records obtained by CNBC and NBC News. The driver told police he was using Autopilot at the time of the collision.\n\nThe NHTSA findings are the most recent in a series of regulator and watchdog reports that have questioned the safety of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology, which the company has promoted as a key differentiator from other car companies.\n\nOn its website, Tesla says Autopilot is designed to reduce driver \u201cworkload\u201d through advanced cruise control and automatic steering technology.\n\nTesla has not issued a response to Friday\u2019s NHTSA report and did not respond to a request for comment sent to Tesla\u2019s press inbox, investor relations team and to the company\u2019s vice president of vehicle engineering, Lars Moravy.\n\nFollowing the release of the NHTSA report, Sens. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., issued a statement calling on federal regulators to require Tesla to restrict its Autopilot feature \u201cto the roads it was designed for.\u201d\n\nOn its Owner\u2019s Manual website, Tesla warns drivers not to operate the Autosteer function of Autopilot \u201cin areas where bicyclists or pedestrians may be present,\u201d among a host of other warnings.\n\n\u201cWe urge the agency to take all necessary actions to prevent these vehicles from endangering lives,\u201d the senators said.  \n\nEarlier this month, Tesla settled a lawsuit from the family of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer and father of two, who died in a crash when his Tesla Model X with Autopilot features switched on hit a highway barrier. Tesla has sought to seal from public view the terms of the settlement.\n\nIn the face of these events, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk signaled this week that they are betting the company\u2019s future on autonomous driving.\n\n\u201cIf somebody doesn\u2019t believe Tesla\u2019s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,\u201d Musk said on Tesla\u2019s earnings call Tuesday. He added, \u201cWe will, and we are.\u201d\n\nMusk has for years promised customers and shareholders that Tesla would be able to turn its existing cars into self-driving vehicles with a software update. However, the company offers only driver assistance systems and has not produced self-driving vehicles to date.\n\nHe has also made safety claims about Tesla\u2019s driver assistance systems without allowing third-party review of the company\u2019s data.\n\nFor example, in 2021, Elon Musk claimed in a post on social media, \u201cTesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle.\u201d\n\nPhilip Koopman, an automotive safety researcher and Carnegie Mellon University associate professor of computer engineering, said he views Tesla\u2019s marketing and claims as \u201cautonowashing.\u201d He also said in response to NHTSA\u2019s report that he hopes Tesla will take the agency\u2019s concerns seriously moving forward.\n\n\u201cPeople are dying due to misplaced confidence in Tesla Autopilot capabilities. Even simple steps could improve safety,\u201d Koopman said. \u201cTesla could automatically restrict Autopilot use to intended roads based on map data already in the vehicle. Tesla could improve monitoring so drivers can\u2019t routinely become absorbed in their cellphones while Autopilot is in use.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/26/tesla-autopilot-linked-to-hundreds-of-collisions-has-critical-safety-gap-nhtsa.html", "id": "1ce2p7z", "created_utc": 1714182190.0, "score": 443, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "Its almost like people think the Autopilot will pilot the vehicle automatically.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Nah\u2026 look around you when you are on the roads and see the number of people looking at their phones as they drive.

This is a sketchy move, Moskovitz claims, because an earlier version of Autopark was already released with FSD years ago, resulting in inflated numbers.\n\n\"The data is presented in fraudulent ways, and it doesn't say what they claim it says even when they make it up,\" he wrote.\n\nArticle continues.

It's also seen as a status symbol, as evidenced by the high prices of gold watches. So, attributing its value solely to its shine is simplifying things, but pretty accurate..\n\nHowever, in today's digital age, denying the value of Bitcoin as a digital asset that offers freedom and a store of value is denying reality. Emphasizing its public nature, lack of centralized control, and accessibility to anyone is crucial. The current volatility of Bitcoin is partly due to its relatively young age of just 15 years.\n\nDrawing parallels with gold is not only helpful but essential for many to understand the concept of value. What is the value of things?? Both Bitcoin and gold represent stores of value, albeit in different forms.

Maybe it\u2019s not a bad idea to own some, perhaps my perception was naive although I still think that\u2019s the only value bitcoin has.

This is partly as a response to the strict anti-money laundering policies imposed by states. When Bitcoin first gained traction, it was primarily used in underground markets for drugs, weapons, and other illicit activities (remember Silk Road and the chaos it caused back in 2011).   \nWhile there's some truth to this narrative, it's not solely about money laundering or illegal transactions any more. Now millions of honest people adapted bitcoin as value.  \n  \nAnd why is that?? Bitcoin reflects the growing distrust in fiat currencies due to government control and mismanagement.
