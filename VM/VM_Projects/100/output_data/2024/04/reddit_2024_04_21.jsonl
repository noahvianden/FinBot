{"title": "Sell 100 $42 Tqqq puts Jan 2025", "selftext": "Could you please give me your advice? \ud83d\ude4f\nIt is so stressful to see the AI stocks tank on Friday. I was hoping to make money on Nvidia with its earnings and possible stock split next month. But now I am thinking whether it is better to bet on TQQQ for the long term.\n\nI have $550,000 in my brokerage account. I am considering selling 100 puts on TQQQ expiring 1/17/2025, strike $42 for $6.4 premium. \n\nCash required: \ud83d\udd37$420,000 and premium \ud83d\udd37$64,000. Tqqq price now:\ud83d\udfe5 $49.58.    Breakeven price: \ud83d\udd37$35.6\nThe Breakeven price is similar to Oct 31, 2023 level before this epic 5 month stock rise.\n\nScenario 1: On expiry, TQQQ is above $42. I get to keep the $64,000 premium. Plus my cash would make 5% p.a. in the money market. Total return 25% annualized.\n\nScenario 2: TQQQ ends up below $42. Then my effective cost is $35.6 which should be ok, right? I will then sell covered calls on the TQQQ.\n\nDo you think I am taking too much risk? I missed the chance of getting into the market with the October lows. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dCan I sell these puts now say on various days (4 to 5 days)?\nI am so stressed out trying to decide when to buy into the market. \nPlease comment. I need your help!!! Many thanks! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "id": "1c9lrf9", "created_utc": 1713716081.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "I know there are psychology aspects with market participants and splits but technically once it\u2019s happened splitting on its own affects nothing, options are adjusted", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Ahh yep \ud83e\udd1d", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1405729353427887}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0036554113030433655}, {"body": "Thanks!", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.020040255039930344}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0036554113030433655}, {"body": "Tqqq has gone split, not reverse split.
