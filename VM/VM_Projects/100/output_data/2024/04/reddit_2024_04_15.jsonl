{"title": "Why the $TSLA dam will burst at $166.50", "selftext": "Don\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t technical analysis (I already ate all my crayons). \n\nElon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers, borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter, which he didn\u2019t realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. \n\nNow TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn\u2019t even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against, and the stock has tanked, and he hasn\u2019t been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. \n\nThat price? $500. But it\u2019s $165 you say! Yes, but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. \n\nThe stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That\u2019s because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. \n\nWill it close below? I don\u2019t know, but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge, increasing your risk) for so long, and we\u2019re one bad market day from the dam bursting. \n\nLong deep out of the money puts, short the stock, sell calls. \n\nSource: r/gonewildstories (nsfw)", "id": "1c4oi3f", "created_utc": 1713193533.0, "score": 248, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 5 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07451838254928589}, {"body": "the stock has closed below 166.66 like 4/5 times since 03/15 or am I crazy? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/939oew5wznuc1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1b708346c41473aee5665d47e0da03597e4cef7", "score": 356, "replies": [{"body": "Shhh", "score": 121, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11760823428630829}, {"body": "He probably was issued a call if there wasn\u2019t cash in the account but the calls are not due for 5 days.
