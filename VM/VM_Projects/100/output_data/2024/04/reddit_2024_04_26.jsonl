EBIT -1.3B\n\nTesla revenue down 13%, deliveries down 10% and EBITDA 3.4B\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nBecause it suggests that it's not Tesla's problem, but an industry problem.\n\nIf people think EVs are eventually going to gain share over the longer term despite short-term weakness, as regulations force it or charging infrastructure improves, then Tesla stands the benefit in the long run.\n\nBefore 2024, people thought legacy automakers had 'terminal values' of $0. \n\nIn investing, stocks are valued based on future cash flows. The terminal value is what you expect the company to deliver in perpetuity. It accounts for a lot of the stock value.\n\nCash flows might be 1,1.2, 1.4, 1.8 then 2 for perpetuity. \n\nAt 10% discount, the terminal value figure is 20 assuming no growth.\n\nLegacy automakers wouldn't get the $20 terminal value figure, which might make up 70% of the stock price. So you would see legacy automakers bringing in 10B in profit yearly but be valued at 50B. They expect those profits to be paid, then once ICE cars have a market share of 0%, there's nothing left. Since legacy automakers have tons of debt, there wouldn't even be anything left over after selling all their assets. \n\nBut in 2024 the story changed. Legacy automakers had more years left in them, and more breathing room to transition to EVs.\n\nThe original story is still believed but expected date of the demise of ICE cars has been pushed back another half decade. \n\nThat's why legacy automakers have been mega outperformers over the past year. Toyota has been selling record hybrids.\n\nThe long-term vision of any stock should not be derived from a quarter, a season or year.\n\nIt might not be as obvious as Micron, which delivers 2B profit, then 6B, then 9B then 6B loss.\n\nEvery industry has their own risks and cycles. World events like covid, war, inflation etc. affect each industry differently. While it's not necessary to follow world events, competitors and cycles, it is important to understand as context before judging a stock.\n\nThere are different tiers of investing.\n\nBottom tier. Seeing Meta results down. Meta = failure.\n\nNext tier. Knowing ad spending is weak everywhere, so Meta isn't that bad.\n\nNext tier. Knowing ad spending will rebound in future, so don't project based on bottom of the cycle.\n\nNext tier. Considering buying before ad spending rebounds when the stock price is lower. \n\nNext tier. Knowing that everyone else already knows it's going to rebound, so they already priced in the rebound.\n\nNext tier. Finding errors about what people think they know about the future that they have priced in, or the less often considered factors that aren't priced in.\n\nNext tier. Knowing you have limited time and effort to exert, things that aren't priced in cannot be priced in as they are unexpected, so after 'optimizing probability' the best action after setting up your portfolio is to do nothing 99% of the time. Protecting your portfolio against yourself, acknowledging you make errors and can't know about the future better than the market 99% of the time.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "This is an outstanding comment, very well done. \ud83d\udc4f", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08357718586921692}, {"body": "You forgot the tier of the guy I heard about that invested heavily in $CMG 10 years ago because he really, really, really liked Chipotle and ate there every day.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Funny.

{"title": "Tesla's shady Q1 results (real GAAP EPS at $0.12 or 65% below reported EPS)", "selftext": "**Deferred FSD Revenue Recognition May Have Boosted Q1 Profits Significantly**\n\nTesla\u2019s Q1 revenues missed by 2.3% and non-GAAP EPS was 8.2% below estimates (see Figure 3). This was not as bad as had been feared and the stock ripped upwards by 13.3% in after-hours trading.\n\nDespite continued price cuts, a one-month shutdown of production at their German factory, and 20% lower deliveries than in Q4 2023, Tesla somehow managed to eke out roughly flat Automotive gross margins of 18.5% in Q1 versus 18.9% in Q4 2023. Imagine having flat gross margins despite 20% lower volumes and roughly 5% lower prices.\n\nThis sounded alarm bells in my head and it turns out to be the biggest takeaway from the Q1 results: deferred FSD revenue recognition must have been huge. While Tesla noted in their Shareholder Deck that they recognized deferred FSD revenues in Q1, they did not provide a number and none of the analysts on the earnings call asked about it.\n\nA few facts about Tesla\u2019s FSD deferred revenue recognition:\n\n* Deferred FSD revenue recognition is only disclosed in Tesla\u2019s 10-Qs and they are booked within Automotive Revenues.

Henry Ford built his first automobile, which he called a quadricycle, at his home in Detroit in 1896. After the formation of the company in 1903, the first Ford car, the original Model A, was assembled at the Mack Avenue plant in July of that same year. It wasn\u2019t until five years later, in 1908, that the highly successful Model T was introduced. This marked a turning point in the history of transportation and the automotive industry. Ford Motor Company revolutionized the automotive industry by mass-producing vehicles that were affordable to the masses and introducing the moving assembly line.\n\nThe period with the highest number of auto manufacturers in the U.S. after 1903 was during the early 1910s. Starting with Duryea in 1895, at least 1,900 different companies have been formed, producing over 3,000 makes of American automobiles. The industry saw a significant rise in the number of automakers, including the emergence of the Big Three - Ford, GM, and Chrysler. However, events like World War I (1917\u20131918) and the Great Depression (1929\u20131939) drastically reduced the number of both major and minor producers. By the end of the 1950s, the remaining smaller producers disappeared or merged into amalgamated corporations. So, the peak of auto manufacturers in the U.S. can be considered to be in the early 20th century, before these events.\n\n**From the peak of 1,900 different US auto manufacturing companies to the 1960s, 99 percent of US auto manufacturers went out of business**\n\nThe early 20th century saw a boom in the number of auto manufacturers in the U.S., with around 1,900 companies being formed. However, a series of events including World War I, the Great Depression, and the increasing competition led to a significant reduction in the number of auto manufacturers. By the 1960s, the vast majority of these companies had either gone out of business or had been absorbed by larger corporations. This period of consolidation led to the dominance of the \u201cBig Three\u201d - Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler. So, approximately 99% of U.S. auto manufacturers that existed at the peak in the early 1910s were no longer in business by the 1960s. It\u2019s a testament to the intense competition and rapid evolution of the automotive industry.\n\n**The new vanguard: Tesla, Apple, and Google enter the fray?**\n\nIf its so difficult to become a profitable auto manufacturer, why do companies like Tesla, and tech companies like Apple and Google seem to think that they can easily come in and dominate the auto industry? With the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles, tech companies are attracted by the shift in customer preferences towards more technologically advanced, and connected vehicles. However, it\u2019s important to note that entering the auto industry doesn\u2019t guarantee success, and these companies will face significant challenges, including manufacturing at scale, regulatory approval, and intense competition. While Tesla, Apple, and Google are not traditional auto manufacturers they have significant resources, and strong brand recognition.\n\nHowever, the auto industry is known for its high barriers to entry, complex supply chains, and significant regulatory requirements. Manufacturing cars at scale is a massive undertaking that poses significant challenges, even for well-resourced companies.\n\n\u00a0", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "**Tesla \u2013 The New King In Town?**\n\nTesla has been manufacturing electric vehicles for over a decade and has shown significant progress.

While it\u2019s true that Tesla\u2019s current valuation is high compared to its revenue, it\u2019s important to understand that stock prices are often driven by investor expectations about a company\u2019s future earnings potential, not just its current revenue. Even so, Tesla\u2019s stock is worth more than that of Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen and Stellantis combined. Even though Tesla is an automaker, it\u2019s valued as more of a tech company, with a share price that puts it in the camp of companies like Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft.\n\n**Rank \\* Company \\* Market Cap**\n\n1 Tesla (TSLA) - **$536.71 Billion**, USA\n\n2 Toyota (TM) - **$305.47 Billion**, Japan\n\n3 Porsche (P911.DE) - **$87.57 Billion**, Germany\n\n4 Mercedes-Benz (MBG.DE) - **$85.15 Billion**, Germany\n\n5 BYD (002594.SZ) - **$84.72 Billion**, China\n\nInvestors may be pricing in the expectation that Tesla will continue to grow and dominate the electric vehicle market, which is expected to expand significantly in the coming years. They may also be factoring in Tesla\u2019s potential in other areas like energy storage and autonomous driving technology.\n\nHowever, high expectations also mean that Tesla will need to deliver on these growth prospects to justify its valuation. Any setbacks or slower-than-expected growth could impact its stock price. Tesla\u2019s once-robust margins have been in steady decline since Q2 2022, but fell under 20% for the first time in years during the first half of 2023. Tesla reported margins of 18.2% in the second quarter, a result of the automaker\u2019s many price cuts across all models and markets.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has attributed the discounts to lower demand in an uncertain economic environment, but analysts also see headwinds in supply chain issues and increasing competition. With the stock price continuing to tumble, bears say Tesla\u2019s share price is starting to reflect the reality of the company: Tesla talks a big game, but in the end, it\u2019s just an automaker with automaker problems.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a metal bender like everybody else,\u201d Kevin Tynan, senior automotive analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told TechCrunch+. \u201cThe bulls want you to believe that Tesla is somehow a different kind of company, and it deserves a different valuation more like what you would afford to a tech company. But the reality is, it has automaker margins now. It has automaker problems and automaker cyclicality in its core business.\u201d\n\nWhile the historical failure rate of auto manufacturers provides some context, it doesn\u2019t necessarily predict the future outcomes for Tesla, Apple, or Google in regard to their respective auto manufacturing endeavors. Their success will depend on their ability to leverage their strengths, navigate challenges, and deliver products that meet the needs and preferences of consumers in a rapidly evolving market.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl", "de", "tsla", "msft", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "lmao, this comment ***perfectly*** captures the pervasive Dunning-Kruger effect from this sub holy fuck", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1333250254392624}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.66156405210495}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36216819286346436}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "Same same", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16460192203521729}, {"body": "I would have been gone years ago.

{"title": "4680 Discussion ", "selftext": "As an investor, I would appreciate a non-biased discussion here on Elon's remarks about the 4680 battery during the latest earnings call. I always believed that batteries, the 4680 in particular, were the Trojan horse for Tesla and would result in a significant cost and efficiency advantage for them.\n\nTelsa held their \"Battery Day\" back in Sept of 2020. I think we would all agree that from what Tesla presented, they are way behind on the 4680...both from production volume and 4680 efficiency goals.\n\nDuring the earnings call Elon made reference that the 4680 project was a \"hedge\" against the rising battery costs they were seeing at the time, especially during the COVID period and when all manufacturers were placing large battery orders. Tesla is now seeing battery costs come down significantly as other manufacturers push back their EV forecasts.\n\nIt seems to me that Elon is now de-emphasizing the 4680 battery. We are still behind on volume and efficiency gains that were presented in 2020. Are any other investors concerned with this? BYD (parent company) was founded with the focus on rechargeable batteries. We have been told that batteries are a big cost of any EV and price competition in China is continuing to drive EV prices lower. It would seem that if 4680 efficiencies are not be gained as one thought or planned for, this is impacting Tesla margins. With Elon's recent comment about the 4680 being a hedge, and recent large Tesla battery orders from other battery manufacturer being reported, is the 4680 project starting to be pulled back behind the curtain? Will this cost and efficiency advantage ever evolve to the cost advantage we all once envisioned?\n\nPS. I understand AI (FSD) and the cars continuous data training is the true Trojan \ud83d\udc34 and the path to billions.

Without battery supply for the structural packs, that's no longer possible.\n\nNow Elon Musk is saying they want to expand to 3 million vehicles/year using existing production lines.  This is a far less ambitious goal: an order of magnitude fewer cars.  \n\n**IMO, Tesla is now a purely FSD bet.**\n\nMy financial modeling in 2015-2016 for Tesla was that it was worth $60-70/share (or about $1100-1200/share in pre-pre-split terms) as a mid-stage mass manufacturer selling about 2 million cars/year and 10 Billion in energy products, and a modest but respectable growth rate.  \n\nIf the 20+ million cars/year is now off the table, and FSD does not improve as quickly as hoped, I see significant downside in TSLA's market cap.  \n\nHowever, if Tesla does achieve FSD, bot, and AI training services, I think the stock may be worth $1600+.\n\nMostly this is all-or-nothing now.", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I think you're right and state well how things have changed and how much everything hinges on FSD. \n\nThere's plenty of other failed projects too: insurance (that was meant to roll out in all 50 states and has stalled), solar roof (total fail), solar in general (going nowhere), semi and roadster (way way behind).\n\nI guess it's reasonable that not everything works and yeah it seems that we're always chasing after the next shiny thing and not really stopping to evaluate what happened to the last shiny thing that didn't pan out.\n\nI used to think we were headed to 20m or at least 10m and yeah it really feels like that's not the case anymore.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I think insurance is really for \"when\" autonomous driving comes.

Hell, even his biography is playing out like he wanted to a few years ago...all in on robotaxi where  he had to be convinced to have a supposed model with steering.\n\nThe fact that Tesla can build cars, today, with the FSD capability included for 40+k is amazing to me. The legacy manufacturers can't even compete on EV cost today on... nevermind they don't have the capability that FSD provides when you consider FSD doesn't need to be geo fenced to highways/certain roads, under certain speeds, need to have car to follow, etc. I don't know how  legacy automakers will even train their fleet with limited data to keep pace with Tesla.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I also don't see how another company catches up to FSD (before V12 I was skeptical that vision only was the way to go).

Elon was right to compare this to Google search, no other search engine can catch up when Google is able to get so much more insight from its vast amount of traffic to make their search engine way better than the rest.\n\nThe only thing I see in the future impacting FSD would be an EVTOL transportation company that makes cars obsolete. Certainly autopiloting an EVTOL from start to destination in the air is way easier than navigating on roads, so the issue right now is just the hardware itself.

Are any other investors concerned with this?\n\nYes, it's quite disappointing. But the writing has been on the wall for some time now that 4680s were falling well short of promises.\n\n> BYD (parent company) was founded with the focus on rechargeable batteries. \n\nYes, and they had a multi-year head start on batteries. People like to tout Tesla's head start in autonomous driving and EV drivetrains, but forget the knife cuts both ways. BYD, CATL, LG, and Panasonic have deep experience in batteries. Tesla learns fast and is doing well, but these companies aren't standing still either.\n\n> We have been told that batteries are a big cost of any EV and price competition in China is continuing to drive EV prices lower.\n\nIt's not just competition - one thing that is driving EV prices lower is lower input costs, primarily batteries. Tesla 4680s are almost surely cheaper now than their input costs were in 2020. But Chinese cell costs are also way down.\n\n> It would seem that if 4680 efficiencies are not be gained as one thought or planned for, this is impacting Tesla margins.\n\nI don't think so, their input costs on purchased cells are also dropping as they discussed on the call. The impact on margins is mostly from dropping sales prices and volumes (which affects production capacity utilization).\n\n> With Elon's recent comment about the 4680 being a hedge, and recent large Tesla battery orders from other battery manufacturer being reported, is the 4680 project starting to be pulled back behind the curtain? Will this cost and efficiency advantage ever evolve to the cost advantage we all once envisioned?\n\n4680 still achieves two things:\n\n1) It gives Tesla more in depth expertise in battery cell chemistry and manufacturing. While this is irrelevant in competing with Ford, GM, and VW, it's probably essential as they go toe-to-toe with BYD. Chinese competition is in another league and Tesla needs to bring their game up to that level. It doesn't mean they have to make all their own batteries, but they do have to have hands on and in-depth involvement and understanding of state of the art battery production.\n\n2) It still works as a hedge. Yes, EV sales growth is slowing right now. This probably won't be permanent, and battery demand and prices can easily re-accelerate. So having a hedge on perhaps their largest single input cost is important for Tesla in the future, even if they don't end up needing it.\n\nAs an example of what China is achieving in the last few years, look at CATL's recently unveiled Shenxing Plus battery. 1000 km range that charges at up to 1 km/s. But the kicker is that it's an LFP cell that essentially matches the performance of their NMC flagship Qilin from 2022.
