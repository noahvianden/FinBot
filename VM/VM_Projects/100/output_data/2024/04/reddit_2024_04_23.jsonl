{"title": "Tesla cutting around 2,700 jobs in Austin as part of broad restructuring", "selftext": "Tesla is eliminating around 12% of its workforce at a factory in Austin, Texas, as part of a broader restructuring the company announced last week.\n\nAccording to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act letter on Tuesday, the layoffs affect 2,688 employees at the facility in Travis County. In 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk moved the company\u2019s corporate headquarters to Austin from Palo Alto, California.\n\nMusk said in an internal memo last week that Tesla was cutting more than 10% of its global headcount as the electric vehicle maker reckons with flagging sales and increased competition. He did not say which departments or locations would be most affected.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare the company for our next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity,\u201d he wrote. A subsequent WARN notice filed in New York indicated that 285 positions were being eliminated at a factory in Buffalo.\n\nTesla employed 140,473 people as of December, according to filings.\n\nTesla officially opened its Texas EV and battery factory in April 2022, with a \u201ccyber rodeo\u201d party. The company now manufactures some of its Model Y crossover utility vehicles in Austin, and has started to build its Cybertruck there.\n\nMusk later called the Austin factory, and another assembly plant in Germany, \u201cgigantic money furnaces,\u201d in an interview with Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a fan club that promotes Tesla vehicles.\n\nAccording to filings with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, Tesla was planning to spend upward of $770 million last year on the construction of expanded facilities in Austin, including for battery cell testing and manufacturing, cathode and drive unit manufacturing, plus a die shop, among other things.\n\nTuesday\u2019s WARN filing said, \u201cnone of the employees are represented by a union and none of the employees have bumping rights,\u201d or the right of more senior workers to replace those with less seniority.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/tesla-cutting-close-to-2700-jobs-in-austin-as-part-of-restructuring.html", "id": "1cbe0bw", "created_utc": 1713901748.0, "score": 437, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Can't get any cheaper labor in the USA than in the South.. where else will people work for 10-12hr besides Mississippi?", "score": 151, "replies": [{"body": "Ford is making its Mach E in Mexico already so that\u2019s obviously where most EVs will be made if the compnayies care about margins.", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Honda is (supposedly) building in Ontario.

The only market that doesn\u2019t care about Elon\u2019s tweets, mostly because they can\u2019t read them, is China and with the TikTok bill having passed the CCP is going to rain down thunder on American companies that haven\u2019t been able to flee fast enough. The CCP already forced Tesla to stop lowering prices against their companies inside of China killing off the only short term advantage Tesla had and now BYD and the like are cranking out equally good cars for half the price missing only FSD which doesn\u2019t work in China. \n\nI\u2019m a decent sized shareholder that picked up everything at 152.00 per share, sold at around 180.00 and got back at 141.00. I have massive incentives for Tesla to do well, but this new car chatter I don\u2019t expect to see anything this year and possibly next. Elon said everything that shareholders wanted to hear on that last call and it worked. The stock should be around 133 but here we are recused by another batch of promises. When is the average Tesla investor going to realize that Elon just gives us what he plans on doing and maybe we see it in a decade.

As u can see every time it touches that up trend line it backs off. Meta strong move allowed price to be way above the long and short term moving averages, whenever a stock is that far away from its moving averages for this long it checks back completing sequence of a up trend which goes up and down for the most part or a down trend which goes  down and up. With all this things I see as I chart my decision or direction I\u2019m choosing  for meta is that it has down side to it but who knows? Earnings tomorrow tell me what do you think?
