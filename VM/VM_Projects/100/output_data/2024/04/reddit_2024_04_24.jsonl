{"title": "Nintendo is an \u201cinevitable\u201d now \u2013 a high-return secular growth juggernaut that should just keep getting bigger and more profitable with time", "selftext": "Nintendo is an \u201cinevitable\u201d now \u2013 a high-return secular growth juggernaut that should just keep getting bigger and more profitable with time. Better yet, with Nintendo\u2019s IP flywheel finally in full effect, the earnings snowball you were first told about many years ago is not only rolling and getting bigger, but it\u2019s set to accelerate as higher-powered hardware drops in the near term and the software release slate normalizes thereafter. \n\nWhich brings us to another key reason to celebrate Nintendo\u2019s fast-approaching \u201cthrough the looking glass\u201d moment: **It's not just about its dedicated videogame platform business. Nintendo has been taking steps to diversify its income streams for years outside of its core business of videogames by slowly and successfully monetizing its IP via theme parks, movies, and other capital-efficient avenues that are just now beginning to reveal themselves.** It\u2019s still early innings, mind you, but we\u2019re happy to report that years of constant assertions that Nintendo would shy away from properly monetizing its gold-plated portfolio of unrivaled IP look positively ridiculous in hindsight. With the blockbuster success of the Super Mario movie, as well as its theme park and other IP-related initiatives approaching critical mass, Nintendo today has multiple sources of high incremental margin revenue that will begin to snowball over the next several years.  \n\nTo say the same thing a slightly different way, the quality and visibility of Nintendo\u2019s business in early 2024 is radically superior and less risky relative to what it was at any point in its roughly 13-decade history, even if these structural improvements are not broadly appreciated as such. Furthermore, now that Nintendo is armed with the market-leading Switch platform and a self-sustaining IP flywheel on the far side of exit velocity, we remain more confident than ever about its efforts to properly leverage its Apple-like ecosystem of hardware, software, and services across its loyal, 122 million+ strong global customer base.  \n\n**Let's recap why we think Nintendo is slowly but surely sending old bear arguments into permanent hibernation:** \n\n1. Nintendo just printed its highest TTM revenue and operating profit figures in the Switch platform\u2019s history, seven years into an aging console \"cycle,\" despite having released only two top-tier first-party \u201csystem sellers\u201d over the previous 18 months.  \n2. Nintendo\u2019s Apple-like ecosystem (reinforced by a very Disney-like IP content flywheel) has radically improved the economic resiliency and visibility of Nintendo\u2019s revenue and cash flow, de-cyclifying its earnings power in lockstep.  \n3. With the release of the Switch 2, Nintendo is primed for continued massive margin expansion by reaching a previously untapped market for the company\u2019s consoles. \n4.

I agree that we are in the middle of a transition phase for Nintendo. It was always a matter of time before they start utilising their strong IPs to establish diversified income streams. Nintendo Online services will also be a big factor for growth and stabilisation. At this time Nintendo gets very few third party AAA games, and often times need to \u201eencourage them\u201c due to the lack of power the Nintendo Switch has. I expect that raw power will be less and less important in the console market going forward, as publishers are more and more interested to maximise the customer base. We already seeing this with how they have a hard time of letting go the 120 million PS4 installbase, even Sony itself.\n\nThere will be a time when Nintendo will get more and more if not nearly all major 3rd party releases. This will be another growth/earnings drivers as they will get a cut out of every sold game, for only existing.

Good luck competing with Mario, Zelda, Pok\u00e9mon(the most valuable entertainment IP - Nintendo holds about ~32% and has all games exclusive), Animal Crossing, Donkey Kong and Nintendos brand itself. $12B cash which alone would cover about 5 years of operate expenses, without doing anything. \n\nOne last thing I want to highlight which is overlooked many times: Nintendo is one of few companies in the world, which gets paid to advertise. They released the Mario Film and got a share of the profits and a bit for licensing the IP. Immediately after the movie, sale figures for Nintendo Switch AND various Mario games received a massive boost. The Movie was an 2 hour ad for the game, and the game is an ad for the movie (not even talking about merchandise here). This going forward could be massive. In 10 Years we will be talking about the 2020s, when Nintendo became the new Disney (Disney Shareholder myself).\n\nI think this should absolutely not be overlooked.

And I don\u2019t think those scenarios are going to be legally allowed anytime in the next decade, if ever, no matter how good of a track record it can demonstrate. Insurance isn\u2019t going to take on that liability and I sure as hell am not.

For one, past net income doesn't matter, only future net income does, and China has started a price war with Tesla which Tesla simply cannot win outside of America. Layoffs, specifically what Tesla did with regards to factory workers is bad, because car production has flat costs and only is profitable with economies of scale. In addition, Tesla had 5.5% margins last quarter and this likely only gets worse as they are going to have to continue lowering their car prices to get sales. Total company net income divided by cars delivered is down to $3000 the lowest since 2020, and is not likely to get better with the competition from China, running factories under capacity, loss of preferential tax treatment, etc. Tech companies can produce the same with less resources because their margins are so high, and do not require massive capex spending. Tesla does not have that luxury. I know how bond rates affect the economy, and I expect them to be flat or even increase later this year.\n\nAnd on your last point, China is absolutely NOT in a recession, the reason Apple and Tesla are doing poorly in China is because native brands are simply outcompeting them. Apple is getting outcompeted by Vivo, Huawei. Tesla is getting outcompeted by the massive amounts of EV companies, most notably BYD.
