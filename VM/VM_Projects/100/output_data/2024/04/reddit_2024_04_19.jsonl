This is as cyclical as it gets. They lock in orders placed some time in advance and the machines get delivered to customers based on a set time-frame as agreed in the contract.\n\nIt should be obvious that after Samsung, TSMC or TI or Intel announce they are building factories at X, Y or Z locations, they will place a mostly confirmed order with ASML for a set number of machines, and until more factories are added, ASML is going to sit pretty on its butt for a while.\n\nThe real question people should be asking is whether ASML's peers have managed to release a machine that is as good as, if not better than ASML's for the bleeding edge. One of ASML's biggest moats is that it actually has people on the factory floor to operate the machines it sells to its customers - I read this in a research report on the semiconductor space. So there is an effective service lock-in.\n\nWhy am I mentioning ASML in a thread about Nvidia? Because ASML's sales slowdowns don't mean much for design firms. If Nvidia needs 10 million chips to be produced during a specific time frame, and Samsung/TSMC can accommodate that requirement, it doesn't matter one bit to Nvidia's bottom line whether the foundries are expanding their production lines or not. The only thing that matters is whether Nvidia can get enough of these items out of the door into their customers' hands.\n\nYou might say that this implies silicon design firms are placing fewer orders with foundries so they see no reason to expand. However that misses an important point - creating new fabs take time - at least 2-3 years. Foundries are not going to announce new fab locations every 6-8 months and have them all ready to output chips at quick notice. So if an Nvidia needs 30 million chips now, but TSMC can only supply then 15 million, it will take a while before new production lines are set up (think a couple of years) and at that point the Nvidia's requirement may have changed completely after coming to terms with the reality of their market. So an immediate drop in demand doesn't mean anything for long term growth.\n\nBut because design firms tend to be relatively asset-light, they don't have to bear the risk of capacity expansion at their supplier coming in too late.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "itll hit 900 again i believe but it might be a a while, need more groundbreaking ai powered by nvidia gpus to drive that price up, no clue in the world why were down 10% rn", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Depends on what your investing thesis is.
