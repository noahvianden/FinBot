{"title": "Amazon cuts hundreds of jobs in cloud computing unit", "selftext": "Amazon\u2019s cloud computing division is laying off hundreds of employees in its physical stores technology and sales and marketing units, the company confirmed on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact,\u201d an AWS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make these decisions lightly, and we\u2019re committed to supporting the employees throughout their transition to new roles in and outside of Amazon.\u201d\n\nThe cuts were first reported by GeekWire.\n\nAmazon\u2019s lucrative AWS unit has seen its sales growth decelerate in recent quarters as companies trimmed their cloud spend amid rising interest rates. Amazon executives expressed some optimism in February when they said the market is starting to show signs of a reacceleration.\n\nThe cuts to AWS\u2019 store technology team come after Amazon said it would remove cashierless checkout systems in its U.S. Fresh stores. The AWS unit includes teams overseeing the cashierless tech, called Just Walk Out, as well as its Dash smart carts and Amazon One palm-based payment technology. The store technology team was moved out of Amazon\u2019s retail group and folded into its cloud computing division in 2022.\n\nThe AWS spokesperson said the company decided to make cuts to the store technology division \u201cas a result of a broader strategic shift in the use of some applications in Amazon\u2019s owned as well as in third-party stores.\u201d\n\nAmazon continues to trim its headcount after more than a year of mass layoffs. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs across almost every area of the company. So far this year, Amazon has laid off employees in its Twitch, Audible, Buy with Prime, and Prime Video and MGM Studios units.\n\nEmployees in the U.S. will continue to receive their pay and benefits for at least 60 days, and they will be eligible for a severance package.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/03/amazon-layoffs-hundreds-of-jobs-cut-in-cloud-computing-unit.html", "id": "1buvr9l", "created_utc": 1712158783.0, "score": 475, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "They should mention how they overhired at one point!!!", "score": 237, "replies": [{"body": "Management will never admit that", "score": 69, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5325360894203186}, {"body": "They hired everyone to prevent competition.
