{"title": "Here's What the Gulf War Will Do to Your Assets", "selftext": "The world just changed. You think that's too dramatic?   \na) Close the tab and come back on Monday when you see your charts.  \nb) Poke holes into the scenario bellow and argue for a different outcome\n\nGulf War went very quickly from unlikely to happening. One predictable consequence is that Oil prices will shoot up. \n\n**History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes:**  \nThe Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War, was a conflict fought between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria.  It began on October 6, 1973. Geopolitical tension arising from it (OPEC proclaimed an oil embargo against nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War) was a catalyst for 1970s energy crisis which lead into the highest inflationary period of past 80 years. Oil prices went x 4, then some more, inflation followed..\n\n**Two important macro differences from then and now:**  \nDebt levels are vastly higher and labor market is much tighter now. \n\n**Sudden 180 degrees turn:**  \nWorld was expecting and counting on that the interest rates have peaked and it was only the question of how soon and for how much they would come down. This set the modus operandi for all over-indebted entities - and there are many (both private: e.g. commercial RE sector and public e.g. govt. debts) that are underwater (mathematically proven to be unable to service debt payment if rates stay at current levels) who are doing \"extend and pretend\" on their loan maturities, waiting for lower rates to come around to be able to refinance. \n\n**The only Achilles Heel of Central Banks**  \nis the inflation. It paralyzes the Central Banker's strongest weapon: QE. \n\n**Oil prices don't need to go as high (x4) as in 1974 to cause a havoc:**  \nHigher inflation will hinder central bank's ability to reduce interest rates so they will have two options:  \n1. Increase interest rates further and push zombie entities out of business due to vastly higher debt levels than in 1974 (some examples: half of the commercial RE sector with 1.2 trillion debt outstanding in 24 months, third of France's private sector with it's all time-high private-debt-gpd at 280%, Italy's government whose already at current rate levels on a trajectory for missing debt payments...)  \n2. Monetize debt through inflation, which will be nastier this time around with wage-price-spiral in the mix.   \n**Which option would you choose?**     \nIf I were a central bank or a govt. - would definitely go with the second option, it's a lot better PR, hence I take this assumption.\n\n**What happens with your assets?**  \nReal assets survive (housing went x2 in 1970s, gold x4), stock market and bonds tank (higher inflation = higher required return = lower price), cash is trash. \n\nCountdown has started, post your scenarios.", "id": "1c3dxoe", "created_utc": 1713047054.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 116, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 273, "replies": [{"body": "I agree, it looks like a mild response from Iran to the Damaskus attack.

To regain cost basis they have been shorting Rivian into the ground.\n\nEven though it was almost entirely held by institutions during IPO, somehow with only a 12% decrease in institutional ownership (some of the only shareholders) this accounted for almost a 70% decrease in price.\n\nWhile I can only add one image, more than half of the put volume is still out of the money by a lot, and short interest for this stock is thru the roof at an all time high. if the stock were to rally 10-20% it could put these institutions in a very tough spot & I just don't see the end goal here.\n\nThey have a signed contract with Amazon set to deliver 100k delivery vans and the ceo is clear that they will be in an overall positive profit margin by Q42024. They have more assets to liability.\n\nWhich leaves me to 1 conclusion. These shak' quant analysts r shorting this stock for coke money.\n\nI already have $14.000 worth of 2.5 leaps expiring January of next year but I want to hear what you all think!", "id": "1c369xs", "created_utc": 1713026786.0, "score": 121, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 days ago\n**Total Comments** | 3 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 days | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Bro why buy dead stock?

If they don\u2019t beat or exceed their production target of 57k, the company will fail.\n\nTo a larger understanding, auto companies function by production a little differently than most manufacturers. While most manufacturers want to produce where their marginal costs and marginal revenues line up, auto manufacturers want to produce where their average variable cost is the lowest. \n\nIf you charted average variable costs, with X being the quantity, and Y being cost, it typically looks like a Nike swoosh. Your AVC is extremely high in the low production level, before hitting a pit. The reason auto manufacturers want to minimize AVC is of the very complex supply chain that autos have to stay active, and the falloff of revenue from excess supply. If auto manufacturers over produce, the autos are sold at a discount either on a clearance as the next year models will be coming out, or in secondary markets. As a production cycle nears the end of its year, usually around June and July for the big three, the risk cost to hold the vehicle rises rapidly.\n\nRIVN has never been able to escape the low production/ High variable cost end of this hypothetical chart. Even at 57k production this year, they will be in the left side of the Nike swoosh of AVC. It\u2019s a recipe for failure, and if a manufacturer can\u2019t cover AVC, they reach a dreaded shutdown point, where there is no reason to keep producing.\n\nThey had a lot of high hopes from the IPO, but they\u2019ve failed every checkpoint they\u2019ve ever come across.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5985503196716309}, {"body": "They should have kept their original pricing.

Maybe take a look at a footprint chart or DOM history and you'll see a more thorough story of what's actually happening.\n\nClaiming that price is dropping makes no sense while looking at the order book *alone* is like crossing the street while looking only to the left and not the right.  You're missing extremely important information and your ass is going to get wrecked for it.  Evidence being this confused post you're making right now.  Hell, a collection of limit orders (the order book you're staring at right now) is *literally incapable* of moving the price; only active orders hitting the bid or ask can do that.  Remember that, it's kind of important!\n\nConsider this scenario to help this make more sense:  The price of thing is $10.  There's a bunch of limit orders within whatever price range you're watching right now and they're fairly even.   Some news hits or whatever and the price begins moving up, towards $11.  Then it hits $12.  It breaks out of range and is continuing to move, aggressively now.  Plenty of active traders are going to view this as a breakout opportunity, as a new trend, etc and want to act; Now your limit orders consist of tons of prior longs looking to exit and capture profit; however, anyone wanting to buy in at this point is probably only going to actually get filled if they buy at market rather than placing a limit.\n\nThus, a seemingly strange circumstance in which the price is moving up, but the order book is showing outsized sell pressure.  Active orders will continue pushing the price up so long as delta continues piercing through the sell pressure.  It's no surprise that limit orders on the buy side lag when the price is continually moving in that direction.\n\n\n\nI guarantee that if you had a DOM heatmap open you'd be seeing *heavy* amounts of active sells at the same time you saw this order book.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for explaining!!
