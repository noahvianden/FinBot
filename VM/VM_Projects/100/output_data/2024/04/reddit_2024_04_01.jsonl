After that loss, odds of his next bet hitting was 47%, and even if he did win, he only would win 1 k overall. Odds of his next bet hitting is still 47%, and now given that he lost 3k already, he was risking 3k more to only break even. Odds of that next red hitting were also 47%. Odds of him loosing these 3 bets in a row was 15%, risked 6k for a 1/6-1/7 chance of loosing 6k and having nothing, there was a 10% chance of winning all 3, thus losing all 3 was 1.5x more likely then winning all 3 thanks to those greens.\n\nThe 24 blacks in a row had no influence, but the lay person thinks no way its going to be black again for 25 in a row, no way its going to be black again for 26 in a row, no way its going....

Keep doing this and you will eventually bust and lose an absurd amount......all for the prospect of just winning 1 dollar.

Including profit. \n\nAlso as others have pointed out, you can sell higher strikes. If you sell a higher strike and during the same expiration there is zero impact on your buying power. Or you can sell a lower strike and make the position into a bear call spread. The idea would be as if the stock is below the lower strike, ie, $990 or trends down until expiration. \n\nFinally, price discovery is still at play. Nobody really knows where NVDA is headed market cap wise bc this AI opportunity is revolutionary, encompassing every sector and Nvidia is positioned to hit every sector. Even analysts continue to shift price targets upwards every quarter. \n\nAgain, you just need one of these parabolic sessions. Is it risky? Yes. Is it possible. Yes.

Instead of buying 1000 C and paying premium, why don't you sell 1000P and you receive some premium. The effect is that you are long-delta, meaning that you benefit from the stock going up. If the stock is at 950 before maturity, you just roll over the 1000 P and get paid more premium.\n\nObviously, with options, there is no single best strategy. There are just different tools for different needs. What I am saying is that for someone who wants to benefit from the stock rising, I think being long out of the money calls is a terrible bet. I always sell some deeper in the money puts and I benefit from the stock rising and I get paid premium (+interest).

The structure is called Bull Put Spread and it is a credit. If your broker pays you interest, you will have some gains coming from there too. It can be significant once you accumulate a big position.\n\nNow coming back to your specific situation, what I'd do is: Sell 1000C and I'd sell     950P. It means that if stock is between 878 - 1071 on 19Apr, you probably will make some money. I say probably, because I don't know your entry point for the 1000 Call. Play with the strategy below. Add a Long 1000 Call at manually edit your entry price. Then sell that 1000C at market and simulate how your P&L looks. \n\n[https://optionstrat.com/build/short-strangle/NVDA/-.NVDA240419P950,-.NVDA240419C1000](https://optionstrat.com/build/short-strangle/NVDA/-.NVDA240419P950,-.NVDA240419C1000)", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much !!!

{"title": "300k Account Wheel Update - Month 18", "selftext": "Hello all!\n\nThis is the March 2024 update. Find the previous update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/1b42kmg/300k_account_wheel_update_month_17/).\n\nIn March of 2024 I closed 25 trades with an average hold time of 19 days to collect $7,642 in premiums. This month went well. I got a bit more aggressive which led to me rolling one position, which ultimately ended up being profitable for me, and also being assigned one position. Currently negative on that new position (ROKU), but I'm able to sell calls on it easily as my basis is right around the current share price. I'm fine holding the company as I think it is undervalued at the moment due to the vizio/walmart news.\n\nBelow are the March trades:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[March Trades](https://preview.redd.it/n0wskbbo7yrc1.jpg?width=965&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=160861789dafee33600bb03b038d02fe3f3b1101)\n\nMy total **realized** profits after 18 months is $117,557. I have **unrealized gains** of $1,300.\n\n**This brings my NET profit to $118,857. This equates to a 39.6% gain on the initial 300k I started with. QQQ is up 48.3% and SPY is up 30.5% in the same time frame.** \n\nI did a good job outperforming the QQQ this past month as my account was up 2% while QQQ was flat this month. QQQ is still outperforming over the past 18 months, though I'm slowly closing the gap. SPY actually outperformed QQQ this month, being up 2%, which was in line with my account. I'm happy to be outperforming SPY over the past 18 months though. I do believe if there is any volatility or broad market pullbacks, I'll be able to catch up to the QQQ and outperform. The goal isn't to outperform on any given year though, but to return a consistent 10-20% yearly gain. So far my annualized rate of return over the past 18 months is 25.5% which I am very happy with.\n\nBelow is the P&L statement for my account and all current positions. \n\n[March P&L Statement](https://preview.redd.it/i43b1jpi9yrc1.jpg?width=1657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3908da6ce8b349ae1c20241378c584894ea8781e)\n\n Lastly, my running log of trades going into the future... \n\n[March Running Log](https://preview.redd.it/a9qqotwl9yrc1.jpg?width=962&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55698c16306688305ed76c1ab697a9396a004cab)\n\nThanks for everyone that has joined the trading group and shared their experiences as well!

{"title": "NVDA Spread update", "selftext": "\nThis is an update from my previous post [\u201cAnyone ever gotten this?\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/SOSGImr0kf) \n\nFirst, here's the rundown of what happened: So, I had this genius plan to score an \"easy\" $500 by dealing with NVDA options. I sold 10 calls at the $902.5 strike for $2.75 each and hedged with 10 call contracts at the $900 strike that I got for $4.75. Quick math: that's a breakeven at $902, selling for $902.5, netting me a sweet $0.50 per share. \n\nBut here's the kicker, I didn't know you could call your broker until 5:30 PM if your option expires in the money. Long story short, the buyer of my $902.5 strike calls ghosted, leaving me with 1000 shares of NVDA from the expired $900 strike calls and a cash account deficit of $897,813.87. Which is some RH BS because the shares were worth $901,250, but still stressful AF. \n\nI wasn't thrilled about being on the hook for $1000 for every $1 move in NVDA. But Robinhood's 24-hour market came in clutch. I unloaded those shares on Sunday night at $909.62 a pop, raking in a profit of $7.62 per stock. I probably could have made more if I held but I\u2019m relieved I\u2019m out. Crisis averted, tendies secured. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\udd11\n\nTLDR: Robinhood told me I owed them almost $900k after I did an NVDA spread without knowing about DNE, so I almost got spread, but got lucky and ended up making $7k or 350% in four days.", "id": "1bsq8l9", "created_utc": 1711932635.0, "score": 1006, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 163, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 8 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 47 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 11 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09123896807432175}, {"body": "Jesus you got lucky", "score": 667, "replies": [{"body": "it\u2019s Easter \ud83d\ude09\ud83e\udd0c", "score": 62, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1304851472377777}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21712955832481384}, {"body": "Could\u2019ve been -$125,000", "score": 114, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21437476575374603}, {"body": "Wild ride.
