But FSD v12 is impressing people and so true autonomy is just around the corner, and since production of the next gen vehicle will be limited volume early as things take time to ramp so it\u2019s better to have those few vehicles be awe-inspiring steering wheeless robotaxis rather than a $25k subcompact that\u2019s the new Toyota Corolla/VW Golf etc\n\nFSD as is will most likely hit a local maxima requiring either better hardware and/or rearchitecture to get to true FSD.

True broadly rolled out mass produced robotaxis are still far away.\n\nAnyways all of this speculation about Tesla being a robotaxi company owning and operating a giant fleet of vehicles seems a bit misguided. Providing mass market transportation services has always been a bit of a commodity, is capital intensive, and has generally been low margin unless one has a monopoly or is protected by regulations (e.g. airlines, taxis, rideshare, scootershare, bikeshare, car rentals, turo, buses, subways, etc). \n\nThe real money to be made is not in operating a taxi service where you own all the hardware, but in selling expensive pieces of hardware (i.e. an autonomous vehicle) to consumers and businesses\u2026hardware that can do something their current equipment cannot, and charging them subscription fees or other service fees, and charging third-party app developers fees to develop apps for this hardware. This is the business model that has made Apple the most profitable company in the world.\n\nSo yes if Tesla can make a truly autonomous vehicle by 2025 then it will not need to make a $25k human driven car. And it will not operate a robotaxi service. But it will sell a lot of these autonomous vehicles for a lot more than $25k and it\u2019ll also make a lot of profit via service fees.\n\nCan Tesla license FSD to other automakers? \nSure if those automakers design their cars around Tesla\u2019s hardware.

If there was any lack of conviction, the spread would be decreasing and the inversion reversing.\n\nBasically the bond market is creating a Mexican standoff with the Fed.  If the Fed decides it does not want to cut, the rate spread would decrease, if not inverse again, which would potentially cause another run at the regional banks (as they would have to take writedowns on existing 10 yr bonds due to the lower yields they would be holding as new bonds would be higher), and mortgage rates would shoot up another 1% which would in turn raise PCE pushing the Fed further away from their goal.\n\nPowell\u2019s best move now is to keep applying rhetoric to control the markets while trying to build consensus.  So Kashkari can say whatever he wants - he\u2019s not even voting this year, Powell has been toeing the line by explicitly repeating now that he expects cuts this year.  The market doesn\u2019t care when, so long as it happens at some point.  If it doesn\u2019t happen in June, the bond market may start to lose its conviction though.  Because the bond market has it priced in, the actual Fed rate doesn\u2019t matter as much as the 10 yr benchmark rate is already down 1%.  Cutting the Fed rate won\u2019t really move that much.  The first cut is purely symbolic from a rate perspective.\n\nThe only thing worse than getting bitched at for making cuts at during the last 90 days of an election year is causing a bank run at that same time.  The Fed is aware of unemployment, they know what the market has priced in, and Powell knows he can\u2019t will the market to think any differently.  Goolsbee is on board, Mester is on board, Bostic I don\u2019t think is far behind, Bowman is a lost cause (she didn\u2019t even mention the second half of the Fed\u2019s mandate - unemployment - when she ran her mouth), and Williams will come around when he gets bitched out by Dimon.  At this point Dimon I doubt wants or needs another gift from the Feds to absorb another bank.  Barkin is aware of the unemployment side though his view is hawkish - he is at least aware.  If his thesis is wrong, he\u2019s an easy flip.

June is still on the table and most reasonable to do 25bp still since it won\u2019t really change anything - the market has it priced in the bond market.\n\nIf they don\u2019t cut it in June, they will need to come out and explicitly call out the cut otherwise it could be a bloodbath.  The most logical times then are in Sept and December still.  The market will need some assurance it is actually coming and Powell will have the cajones to do it during an election cycle.\n\nThe problem then becomes the depth of the cut.  If they don\u2019t do June, they could basically destroy the summer home buying season which would mean a 50bp cut right off the bat, which wouldn\u2019t be the best thing in the world.  Instead of small cuts, they\u2019ll be making larger ones to try to keep the market from a complete stumble.  This will probably be the biggest argument for the June cut. 25bp in June is positive but not a news maker - it\u2019s maintenance. 50bp in Sept/December means the Fed fell asleep at the wheel and is trying to prevent a recession (which ironically has a 50/50 chance in 2025 since the Fed tends to be late to the party - so to a point the market does expect them to screw this up).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If anything, it would have to be after the election. I wouldn't wager on Powell doing anything before then. Also, if inflation data and jobs numbers keep coming in hot, wouldn't that eliminate hopes of a cut? Wouldn't hikes then be more likely if we make it to election day with data coming in stronger and stronger?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not necessarily. The stubbornness of PCE is coming from housing and housing equivalents.  Those won\u2019t go anywhere until mortgage rates come down.  That\u2019s the biggest part the Fed is concerned about.  Volatiles like energy hurt the number but those aren\u2019t as big of a concern as the core PCE values and they\u2019ve been targeting housing specially now for months and it\u2019s been a tough nut to crack.\n\nThe other problem is by end of 2024 the CRE loan issue goes in to full swing. They\u2019ll need to trim rates to keep the banks propped up to avoid every Regional from becoming insolvent as the losses stack up.  A run on the stocks is just as bad if not worse than an actual bank run.\n\nThe hot jobs number is not as hot when you look at the data closely. Two things have happened - 1) Older people have left and aren\u2019t coming back so no longer count as they aren\u2019t participating and 2) Full time employment went down while part time employment went up.  These two things make a hot jobs top line number not as hot and the Fed can read the nuance of that pretty well.  Legal immigration has kept jobs filled, but main street is beginning to buckle - the Black unemployment data is somewhat eye catching.\n\nAn increase at this point would be suicide as it would cause a regional bank run with the CRE loan issue right around the corner.  Housing is unaffordable as is and a rate increase actually makes it worse.  The Fed\u2019s mandate is dual - it\u2019s inflation AND employment.  Powell has said he wants to see a downward trend and other Fed Govs have said they could live with inflation above 2%.  That\u2019s really the long term reality.  The other Central Banks are going to start cutting. If the Fed only focuses on the 2% number, they would need 10% unemployment for a full year to get it - and that\u2019s not really possible.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["cpi"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5826079845428467}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6673754453659058}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.481191486120224}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5408118367195129}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45928052067756653}, {"body": "It doesn't matter what these people say.

This 20 bagger will haunt me.\n\nThe strategy was simple and regarded: Tesla had 3 green daily candles in a row leading up to Friday- which if you\u2019ve been following Tesla\u2019s dog water performance lately- is a huge anomaly so I figured Friday is leaning towards a red day. So I entered the 167.5Puts when Tesla was barely up trading at 169.10 and planned to sell when tesla reached 164ish for an easy 10 bagger from 3.5k to \n35k.\n\nOne problem: I sold only 10 minutes after opening my position for a small loss of 500$.
