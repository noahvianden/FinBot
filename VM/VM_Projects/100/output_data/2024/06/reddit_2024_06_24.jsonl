Apple is delaying most of the interesting AI features in the WWDC until 2025 anyway. Even when they launch, it\u2019s yet to be determined if they\u2019re any good. Even if they are, not everyone cares about them. I think it\u2019ll have a modest impact to sales in the EU at best, and only by the end of next year. That downward pressure would be mitigated - at least in part - by upward pressure in the U.S.\n\nLong term, however, is very interesting. The EU recently signalled an intent to investigate multiple potential breaches of the DMA. The DMA permits fines of up to $1B per day for non-compliance in Apple\u2019s case, and/or 20% of global revenue for individual breaches. There is no technical reason to prevent third party access to at least some of these new features, which means Apple is attempting to sway public opinion by maliciously denying access to new features. Which is *not* a breach of the DMA.  Both sides have therefore signalled an escalation in the conflict, and both sides have enormous stakes to win and lose. If Apple loses, they must permit third party developers to distribute their apps to customers without notarisation or fees. This could meaningfully dent Apple\u2019s App Store revenue in the EU. *That* would hurt their stock price and growth. It also wouldn\u2019t end with the EU.
