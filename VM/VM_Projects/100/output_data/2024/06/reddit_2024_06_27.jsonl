How many outstanding shares does NVDA have anyway, and how many do you think you would have to short or buy to move the price in a particular direction?\n\nThe irrational overly exhuberant posts I see on NVDA here terrify me. You expect NVDA to do nothing but rise and then blame some incognito agent for the (very modest) drop when investors see signs in the broader industry that things may not be as rosy as the high NVDA valuation demands? If we do enter a bubble and it pops, I fully expecting you all to ignore the reality, try to catch the falling knives, and blame your incognito agent of choice for purposely manipulating the market.\n\nIf the stock market was the weather, you would blame the thunderstorms on some untraceable agent for purposely unleashing destruction on a perfectly fine community and probably attribute all sorts of ill intent to that agent---when in fact there is no agent but just a complex dynamical system with lots of interactions between air pockets to give rise to the thunderstorms.
