{"title": "Tesla internal data shows company has slashed at least 14% of workforce this year ", "selftext": "Tesla\u2019s hefty downsizing since 2023 has reduced its global head count to just over 121,000 people, including temporary workers, internal records suggest, indicating that the automaker has slashed more than 14% of its workforce so far this year.\n\nThe latest figure is not from precise payroll data, but from the number of people who are on Tesla\u2019s \u201ceverybody\u201d email distribution list as of June 17, a tally viewed by CNBC.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to \u201ceverybody\u201d that day. He told employees, \u201cOver the next few weeks, Tesla will be doing a comprehensive review to provide stock options grants for exceptional performance.\u201d He added that options grants will also be awarded to \u201canyone who does something outstanding for the company.\u201d Tesla\u2019s plan to reinstitute options grants, after previously pausing performance-based equity awards, was reported first by Reuters.\n\nTesla\u2019s layoffs announcement landed in April, when Musk sent out a companywide email telling employees that the automaker would be cutting more than 10% of its staff. Layoffs at that point were already underway.\n\nBloomberg reported that Musk was aiming for a 20% staff cut. Musk indicated that the number could be even bigger. On the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call later in April, he said Tesla had reached an inefficiency level of 25% to 30% after \u201ca long period of prosperity\u201d that began in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made some corrections along the way,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cBut it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth.\u201d\n\nIn a filing for the fourth quarter, Tesla said its employee head count worldwide at the end of December was 140,473, a number that represents salaried and hourly staffers. The \u201ceverybody\u201d email list includes temporary workers. At around 121,000, that suggests Tesla has reduced overall headcount by at least 14% since the end of 2023.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn at least one instance, Musk\u2019s head-count reductions went too far. Tesla dismantled its Supercharging team, which consisted of hundreds of employees, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. The company later hired some of those people back, according to posts on LinkedIn.\n\nThe broader cuts coincide with a slippage in sales at Tesla as the company reckons with an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China as well as brand deterioration that a recent survey attributed partly to Musk\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d and \u201cpolitical rants.\u201d For the first quarter, Tesla reported a 9% drop in annual revenue, the biggest decline since 2012.\n\nAcross the auto industry, EV sales growth slowed this year after two years of rapid expansion. The slide was particularly acute for Tesla, whose Model Y was the top-selling car worldwide in 2023.\n\nA Tesla employee, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive internal issues, told CNBC that some factory workers are fearful more layoffs could follow in July, depending on second-quarter results.\n\nA production and deliveries report for the second quarter is expected from Tesla during the first week of July.\n\nMusk has promised investors the company will soon publish a new \u201cMaster Plan,\u201d which would be his fourth, and that Tesla will reveal its design for a \u201cdedicated robotaxi\u201d on Aug. 8.\n\nTesla shares were little changed on Friday at $181.71. The stock is down 27% this year, while the Nasdaq is up 18%.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/tesla-has-downsized-by-at-least-14percent-this-year-internal-number-shows.html", "id": "1dm0ejw", "created_utc": 1719076166.0, "score": 245, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "Meanwhile stockholders gave him $56 billion and he rewards his workers with pink slips.", "score": 114, "replies": [{"body": "They are delusional. \n\nDid you see the sales pitch on the voting webpage? \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair lawyers get paid like superstars.\u201d\nBitch, you\u2019re the literal highest paid mother fucker on the entire planet.

Calhoun hasn\u2019t done a bad job but he inherited a mess in 2020! He\u2019s right to go 2025. But he still wants to be remembered for being the guy that went all in on quality assurance.

People don\u2019t seem to realize max\u2019s are still flying everyday for years now since the no fly order was rescinded!\n\nDefense and space turned a profit last earnings after being what kept overall earnings red last few years mainly due to being stuck in old pre inflation income contracts with inflation affected costs!! Like the damn Air Force one and much more! Everybody missed that! \n\nServices turned a profit! \n\nBut now commercial is bleeding cash again but it\u2019s damn self served!! If they had opted to produce at faa prod cap they wouldn\u2019t have. But what it is all about behind the scenes is making sure they get spirit aero systems back because congress has to see it as part of quality assurance to literally become the monopoly again! Because damn global antitrust in the first place forced them to spin it off in 2005-06. Which is the damn reason bad politics created the problem in the first place! We lived in an era where globalist policies opted for outsourcing and chopping up a great company and then whined when consequences of said policies happened. Expected fucking consequences. \n\nSo if you want to play the blame game you should really blame the right damn part, yourselves, your parents and naive policies and electing stupid officials along with management 2000-2020! \n\nNow! The only reason that spirit deal has been postponed is still because literally Airbus doesn\u2019t want to become a Boeing customer and need a replacement deal when spirit is Boeing again. You let Airbus and EU roll you over on the spirit chop up almost 20 years ago and still letting them dictate the pace of taking spirit back thus control of quality back! \n\nAlso why when Boeing asked for more lending after last earnings the order for 10 billion was filled in a day! You don\u2019t ask yourself why? In 2020 Boeing got long term loans for 0.3% interest rates! The last batch of \u201cfunding\u201d will be to stay cash positive this hiatus we are in but also to pay for the damn buy back of spirit!\n\nGeez fucking Louise\n\nMake this post after free cash flow is positive in 25 and growing 26 and 27 (the latter when also dividends is reintroduced) it has all been in the news lately and stated by management but hey nobody pays attention when there is hate in the air \ud83d\ude02", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

You are at the point t now of making even wilder and more unrealistic bets to try to make back a huge loss.  You need to go to a hard stop and dissect what you did and what happened with every trade so far.  It should be obvious you made some poor assumptions, maybe up to ridiculously awful.  There is a lot of risk in most investments, hopefully you see that.  The top 3 to 5 holdings of the best performing funds is a good place to begin to make better picks.  You and I know nothing and should be leaning on the professional expertise of seasoned investors who have actually made money.  It can be done, but you just have to really stop thinking you know what you are doing and making choices of stocks no one has heard of.  Start with something very simple and get good at it.  You could paper trade for 3 months or so and see how you do while your remaining funds sit in an interest bearing account.  Try learning and trading the TQQQ, the ETF Of the QQQ.  Use a simple system like the Bollinger Bands to enter and exit as your investment GPS.  IT is easy to see some trading strategies like this and grow your skills and become very successful.  Don't fall fir the YouTube get rich quick on $5K stories.  There is a huge difference between skill and getting lucky.  With skill you can reproduce your results, with luck not so much.\nOne last thing, really understand what is a reasonable and rational expectation to grow an account 1, 2, 3 percent or more in a week.  I know it can be done some weeks, but many weeks you won't hit that mark or even go down.  How to average 2 percent or more is key.  One way was if you had just put 10K in Nvidia, when you got the money and you would have hit all your goals.  Go back and look.  Now ask yourself, why you didn't find it and instead did something wildly different??  You need to know the answers to these questions.  There have been at least 50 pretty solid stocks that have doubled or up 50 percent so far this year. How come you didn't find a single one of those?   Figure that out before you do anything else.  Or just go to a casino or buy lottery tickets, people win there too.  Do a little but of reading and research to improve your outcomes.
