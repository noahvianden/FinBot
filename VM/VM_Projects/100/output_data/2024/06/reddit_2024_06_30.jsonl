They started scratched on Metroid because it wasn't to their quality. If they wanted to make a quick billion, they could release Fortnite skins. Nintendo will not, probably ever. Not even on their own console as exclusive.\n\nEvery 6 years they release a new console. While the Switch was fantastic and amazing, they eliminated 2 consoles for one. Back in the early 2010's, Nintendo was flying high with a handheld and console. With that, they are very hit or miss with consoles. For every Switch, DS, and Wii they have had Virtual Boys and Wii U's. The Wii U almost removed Nintendo from the console space... and in the next decade, I am convinced apps will take over consoles.\n\nThird-Party, all I am saying is that no new big entry Grand Theft Auto (or similar big ip) has released on a Nintendo console. That would be a big opportunity for them, but they never seem to build those bridges.\n\nIn many ways, the brainchild of Nintendo is aging. A lot of the creative minds that established these IPs Mario, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Metroid, Zelda, Pikmin, and others are aging.
