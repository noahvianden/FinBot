I would review from time to time the list of the totals, if I see a large number, for me it might be anything over 5k, I would review the stock and see why that transaction cost me 5k.

It's weaker at some things computers are traditionally very good at, but at the end of the day the bitter lesson is that it inevitably surpasses code written by us humans. At the end of the day you need a certain level of general intelligence to achieve full self driving and current neural networks seem to be very close to meet this requirement while old school coding is basically dead in the water.\n\nWaymo of course still uses a lot of neural networks, but the difference is that they're still subordinate to the control code. This lets them deploy their fully autonomous system now, because there are still lines of code which say something like \"if the lidar seems something in front of the car jam the brakes and wait for human intervention\". Current neural network have nowhere close to having that certainty, they still sometimes just derp out completely.\n\nThe TLDR is that Tesla is actually running way ahead because they swallowed this bitter pill early.

But it wasn't, and turns out that a ZIRP still kept inflation at 2%, which gives that figure at least some credibility. Of course QE provided some additional stimulus akin to a negative interest rate, but it makes sense that 2% is a good number because 0-1% risks recession and higher than 2% would have been a bit chaotic during the pre-2000s growth phase where rates had to be lower. Technology has contributed to some of the deflationary impacts we seen on the natural inflation rate for sure, and without it you can argue ZIRP would be too low.\n\nIn conclusion, I do think 2% is a good enough buffer above the 0% mark, higher and lower probably don't make sense to anchor.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "So, lots to unpack here:\n\nFirst, the 2% target is relatively new, or at least having an explicit goal of 2%, as per this St. Louis Fed article, didn\u2019t arrive until 2012:\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2019/january/fed-inflation-target-2-percent\n\nStating in pertinent:\n\n\u201cAlthough the FOMC didn\u2019t explicitly name an inflation target until 2012, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has argued that the U.S. had \u201can implicit inflation target of 2 percent after 1995.\u201d (See Bullard\u2019s presentation from Sept. 12, 2018. In that presentation, he also noted that 2 percent became an international standard in the inflation targeting era that began in the 1990s.)\u201d\n\n\n\nThe article is interesting bc they kind of implicitly say, it\u2019s a random number:\n\nWhy not zero? Or a negative number? \n\nDavid Wheelock, a St. Louis Fed group vice president and deputy director of research, addressed these questions in a 2017 podcast. He acknowledged that there isn\u2019t a general agreement among economists, but he laid out three arguments that people make for having a positive inflation target\u2026\n\n\nHe basically goes onto state that having 0% inflation doesn\u2019t stimulate growth and that having some level of inflation gives the fed room to pivot, cut, whatever.\n\n\nSo, it\u2019s not as if 2% makes no sense at all, it\u2019s just that there has to be some inflation, but not too much, and 2% is a decent middle ground\n\nLikewise the article discusses the obvious fact that 2% isn\u2019t a constant goal, it\u2019s a longer term goal. Having inflation above 2%, or below 2%, it\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s on a longer term timeframe that they shoot for 2%.\n\n\n\nNow, as far as the remainder, I personally subscribe to the theory that technology, by its very nature, is disinflationary.\n\nI don\u2019t really think that\u2019s a debatable point.\n\nAs we become more technologically advanced, having some baseline level of inflation is probably necessary because we are perpetually disinflationary via technological advancement\n\nOf course, someone will come along and talk about printing money, and other inflationary issues, but I\u2019m speaking in the general sense.\n\nZIRP policies, and the efficacy of those policies:  \n\nthat conversation inevitably leads into \u201cmodern monetary theory\u201d, a topic which is fairly controversial, and itself engenders political biases and other issues that are non-financial.\n\nIts a heavily debated topic with no clear answer imo", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "*This \u201cpivot.\u201d Is it in the room with us now?*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
