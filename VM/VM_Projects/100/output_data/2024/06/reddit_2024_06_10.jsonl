I love the challenge of growing one of the most successful practices in my area. \n\nJust some quick background. I was an athlete, a Wrestler. That paid for College(or most of the money I got would have been gone). But I was wild. I drank in the off-season, partied, got in trouble. ONE time though, got into a fight with a bouncer. Had no idea what was happening, in a group of \\~20, a bouncer knocked my friend out COLD(head bounced off the pavement and for a little more context, he died of a slow brain bleed 9 months later...were they connected? I don't know). \n\nBut if not for the lawyer I had, a younger guy who fought like hell for me, I'd have quit school(or never started law school) as I'd have been a violent offender. He went above and beyond.\n\nThat's MY little anecdote. \n\n  \nThere are people who have had VERY poor representation and they're sitting in jail because they took the plea bargain I was offered(2 YEARS and 5 years of probation) because they couldn't afford bail.\n\nI'm not looking to defend child abusers, but kids who made a stupid mistake, or people who I think were the target of a lazy investigation. I love what I do and I think there's value to it.\n\nAnd right now I have 2 full-time employees, and I'm just early on in starting my own practice. I love making an argument...and...that's my hobby.\n\nAlso, I think when you don't have something driving you, when you just have hobbies, you start to lose motivation. It's not good to be 40(well, not quite, 39) and to stop working. \n\nBut again, I also don't think my money would last. I have dreams of making a LOT more money and...well, other goals that are pretty far out there, so I'm not going to put them out there yet. \n\n  \nThat's NOT a slave mentality, that's my life.

Instead of using GPUs, by eliminating MatMul, they are instead able to use FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) which are far cheaper, and were also shown to be considerably more efficient than GPUs in the study. \n\nMind you, this is new stuff and the first study to come out so the implications and viability remains pretty unclear at the moment, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that AI is developing fast and new alternative technologies are already being looked into and developed. If there is a need to buy trillions of dollars of something, people (corporations) will be very innovative at finding a different approach that will reduce those costs.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "It's a good research paper and something that is thought provoking.

{"title": "Riding the AMD Wave", "selftext": "Let me give you the lowdown on what\u2019s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it.\n\n# Current Play:\n\nSo, AMD's been moving\u2014up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here\u2019s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That\u2019s a 78% drop in volume! Something\u2019s brewing.\n\n# Analyst Chatter:\n\nThe street\u2019s buzzing. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n* **Citigroup:** Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says \u201cbuy.\u201d\n* **Morgan Stanley:** Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an \u201coverweight\u201d rating.\n* **KeyCorp:** Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with \u201coverweight.\u201d\n* **DZ Bank:** Upped to a \u201cbuy\u201d with a $190 target.\n* **Wedbush:** Stays \u201coutperform\u201d with a $200 target.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a solid \u201cModerate Buy\u201d from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They\u2019re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix.\n\n# Financial Pulse:\n\nEarnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue\u2019s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady.\n\nKey ratios to watch:\n\n* **Debt-to-equity:** 0.03.\n* **Quick ratio:** 1.92.\n* **Current ratio:** 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it\u2019s got a beta of 1.69, so it\u2019s got some juice in a volatile market.\n\n# Insider Moves:\n\nNow, insiders are moving. **CEO Lisa Su** unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and **EVP Mark Papermaster** sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting.\n\n# Institutional Maneuvers:\n\nBig players are piling in:\n\n* **Norges Bank:** Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD.\n* **DZ BANK AG:** Boosted their stake by over 800%.\n* **International Assets Investment Management LLC** and **Capital World Investors:** Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion.\n* **Price T Rowe Associates Inc.:** Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth.\n\n# My Strategy:\n\n**Technical Setup:**\n\n* **50-Day Moving Average:** $161.33.\n* **200-Day Moving Average:** $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages.\n\n**Entry Points:**\n\n* **Short-Term:** I\u2019m eyeing a dip around $165. That\u2019s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce.\n* **Long-Term:** If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it\u2019s time to load up.\n\n**Exit Strategy:**\n\n* **Short-Term Gains:** I\u2019m looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley\u2019s targets. Quick win.\n* **Long-Term Hold:** Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush\u2019s target lies. That\u2019s a juicy exit if it runs up there.\n\n# Market Conditions:\n\nKeep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs.\n\n# The Bottom Line:\n\nAMD\u2019s got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It\u2019s a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200.

We'll probably get it this month or next.\n\n>  Also worth noting AMD has no TensorRT equivalent.\n\nvLLM is AMD's alternative. AMD is going the Open Source route.\n\nIn the consumer dGPU, AMD has actually closed the gap with RDNA2, but gaming PC is very Nvidia centric. This market is very price and margin sensitive, and Nvidia has a big economies of scale advantage. Also AMD supplies chips for Consoles. And so this is where their attention is.\n\nDatacenter has much more margins to work with, to where AMD is not constrained by the differences in economies of scale.\n\nWhen it comes to consumer mobile GPUs. I think AMD has a huge opening there as well. This is due to AI PC. AI PC is increasing the need for memory bandwith, which was what always held iGPU back.

ARM chips are only more efficient at light workloads. At heavy workloads x86 has an edge, due to SMT. This is why AMD has a strong presence in high performance consoles. And this is why ARM hasn't been able to dethrone Epyc in datacenter.\n\nAMD's core competency is hardware for high performance computing.

{"title": "After watching WWDC - Puts on Apple", "selftext": "Ok regards, this is a summary of my notes as I watched the WWDC.\n\n**TLDR:** Puts. Apple isn't ready. They are talking about a bunch of capabilities that will EVENTUALLY be ready, who knows when, and with what cost. They are no better than anyone else on the market. And if we are just getting calculator apps, I think it's going to take a while - like their self-driving cars.\n\n**What they brought:**\n\n**Holy crap, Apple has been showing \"BRAND NEW SHIT\" at WWDC - which has been on other fucking phones for the past 3-5 years.**\n\n* You can now hide apps on your phone? WTF. In their demo, the moron puts it in a 'secret folder' and it's still visible. LOL.\n* They advertised SCHEDULING OUTGOING TEXTS - bro I had this for 10 years. Ooooohhhhh, it gives me suggestions on custom words - you ducking morons, done.\n* It encrypts message to message - RCS that Google has been pushing. Done.\n* You get categorization for emails..... LATER THIS YEAR!?! Ok moron, even Yahoo Mail has been doing it for the past 6-12 months.\n* Tap to cash? That demo was making them hover their phones for some lame ass animation for 10 seconds.... bro, I want 3 seconds and done. PoS Wallet app.\n\n**Home & Audio**\n\n* Lol at their 'game mode' - ain't no one playing on your devices. But sure bro, keep dreaming.\n* The headphones work ONLY if developers of ALL MAJOR TITLES put in an effort to make it specifically to Apple, and I don't see that happening.\n* They are bringing a BRAND NEW Snoopy screen saver - that does mean they get a 1 trillion upgrade though. That's fair.\n\n**WatchOS**\n\n* Training modes are not bad, they have this market down pretty well. Upgrades were based on using your overall metrics to let you know where your training is at, and you can get better insight into your vitals so you know your high/low capacity when training.\n* They got some pregnancy metrics as well, meh, helps the preggos, but they didn't go into any extra details. It's just.... ok. Nice.\n* There are a whole bunch of attempted 'predictive' things - like when you travel it'll pop up to offer translations. Or if you have a ride coming from Uber/Lyft, it'll try to notify you. A few predictive things, where they are using the buzz word 'machine learning'. This can be good, or it can be annoying if it's constantly late or missing the mark, which I guess it will at the beginning.\n\n**iPad**\n\n* They are bringing in...... a calculator. WTF. LOL. WTF.\n* They are trying to push the \"Apple Pencil\". I guess they didn't have it before. Still. WTF.\n* Math notes was a cool feature - you write out math problems and it solves it live for you.\n* They had some pretty cool features, I am not sure if anyone will know how to use - I'm your average idiot, and it looks advanced to me. Lots of actions to work out that I'm losing money.\n* They had a big focus on Smart Scripts, which makes your handwriting better, but man, do I feel sorry for anyone that is still having to do notes by hand.\n\n**macOS**\n\n* Lol, their starting feature is that I can plan a hike on Apple Maps. Naw bro, no thanks, there are much better apps to do this in, that won't end up with me walking over a lake.\n\n**Safari**\n\n* They again mention 'machine learning', which isn't AI. This is predictive elements, standard quo of shitty AI precursor. Machine learning does not equal AI. It can if you have a big GPT model behind it, but you have to give your data to them if you aren't developing it yourself.\n\n**Gaming**\n\n* They are desperately trying to get into the gaming space. Baldur's Gate was mentioned as the highlight. This is something they are losing out on to other options. Not sure where they are, but they seem to be mentioning it a few times, so I am guessing they are trying to pull in anyone to develop on their platform. The Ubisoft collab shows this.\n* ASS-ASS-INS Creed looked choppy on the lake. Same while looking over the shoulder of the samurai. No thanks bro.\n\n**AI**\n\n* The main thing. They want it Powerful, Intuitive, Integrated, Personal and Private. They are trying to pose it as 'personal intelligence'. Apple Intelligence.\n* If you sold when they mentioned this, good job. If you held on to see the shit show. I feel sorry for you.\n* They showed a bunch of SHIT. Predictive emails? WTF. Exists by 20 providers.\n* Lol, it can make my mom a superhero through 3 styles?? YOU FUCKING SUCK!!!\n* They had 'we're building Apple apps to blah blah blah'..... \"BUILDING\", as in it's NOT READY NOW???\n* GTFO. These are all concepts apparently.\n* Sooooo, let's get this right, after talking a FUCKTON about privacy, I am going to believe APPLE that they will use my information responsibly to cater to customization. And none of this will ever leak, or be abused by any other apps you give access to this. Good luck guys!\n* \"Most of this runs on the phone, but there are times you will need more powerful servers\", yeah, here we go.....\n* This is where GPT comes in. All the info you have, and their assumptions about you, are supposed to be fed into a cloud (Private Cloud Compute) as they call it, which means they are just on ChatGPT Enterprise.\n* Apple will most likely be paying them A FUCKTON of money. They are going from charging Google billions to be their default search engine, now they will be paying GPT billions for their Enterprise computing.\n* The winner here is OpenAI. Not Apple. Apple becomes OpenAI's bitch. Siri makes 1.5 billion requests every day, do you know the ChaChing sound that is going to be coming towards OpenAI? Not all of them will go through, but man, Apple will have costs. Enterprise level costs.\n* The security breaches that will be happening. They are talking about it getting a context about you from emails, photos, messages, everything. It will be all over, trying to guess who you are, what you are about, and it's all going to a mystery cloud. Same thing that Windows just received blowback over - they are trying to convince us that it will be fine with them. Good. Luck.\n\n**Point of the story here** - they are all forward-looking things - \"things we will get\". Until then, there will be a lot of missteps, costs, and blowies behind Wendy's dumpsters.\n\n**Side notes from what I saw:**\n\n* Craig had a big center stage here. I think he is the next in line for Apple, or if he blows it, he'll end up in a Wendy's.\n* The voice editing was annoying - they minimized accents and just came out sounding like they were trying to whisper to my ear, but in a creepy way, like the hobos giving handies behind Wendy's dumpsters.", "id": "1dct4e4", "created_utc": 1718045172.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 24 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 11 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20209863781929016}, {"body": "\"Sent from my iPhone\"", "score": 168, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, but a lot of these iPhone upgrades were available on blackberries 15 years ago (encryption, scheduling messages\u2026) not a good look when you have to steal ideas from  the dawn of the tech you\u2019re pretending to be at the leading edge of.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07721228152513504}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15309779345989227}, {"body": "I have an Android and iPhone, one for the wife, one for the gf, but this post was sent from mah fridge.\u00a0", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Calls on Samsung Family Hub ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4113774001598358}, {"body": "you dog", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11189530044794083}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4187542796134949}, {"body": "\"via Satellite\"", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.337139368057251}, {"body": "TLDR - Apple will finally offer features that Android had 5 years ago lol.
