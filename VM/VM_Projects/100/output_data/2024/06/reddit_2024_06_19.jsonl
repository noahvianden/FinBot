In fact I'm sure they will. But, again in my opinion, what Amazon as a company \"needs\" to make money out of AI can be accomplished with what they have.   That's not to say the new chips won't be better, faster or more efficient.  They will.  The question is whether they will be so much better that it warrants a complete tossing of the old and purchase of another 25 billion in new ones.  \n\nKeeping the old ones and backing up the truck to buy some new ones isn't going to generate $25 billion in 2026 revenue for NVDA.  It will generate revenue for sure, but not like it's doing now.  \n\nNVDA is in a \"frantic race to develop the most powerful tool ever.\"  Totally agree.  I just don't know that Amazon, Meta or MSFT will need the \"most powerful tool ever\" to do what they need to do to convert AI into revenue, which is really what it's about.   Look at Oracle, for example.  They crunch databases and AI will revolutionize what they do.  Whether they need to buy the latest and great lest every year to accomplish that it questionable.  \n\nTesla is a huge buyer as well, but like the others they're developing their own and while the moat is big, it's not unswimmable.  \n\nAdvancements are amazing.  I've had a couple Ferraris and they were so fun.  Did I ever actually go 200 mph? No.  Did I need to upgrade when they came out with one that could go 220mph and was much more fuel efficient? No.   If I never owned one and wanted to buy one today, would I be excited by the 220mph ability? Absolutely.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your opinion seems to be: I have a Ferrari, so my opinion is great. I'm happy you're doing well, but your individual consumer with a car example is not a good analogy. The equivalent here would be Ferrari putting out a car that instead of going 220mph, goes 5000mph(25x better performance) while using 4%(96% less power draw) of the fuel. Even that is being quite reductionist when comparing Hopper to Blackwell.\n\nA better analogy would be they're like the US Military. The best equipment, but also the best infrastructure, economics, and supply chain/logistics. You've got a BRICS-like consortium trying to put together a platform that will dethrone them, but at this stage it's laughable in comparison and there's no \"nukes\" in this industry as a trump card for NVDA to worry about. That could change in the future for both USM and NVDA, but as it stands there's no real competition.\n\nI guess you skipped over the performance/efficiency numbers I sent you on Blackwell vs Hopper?Using 96% less power while generating 30x performance is going to be something large cloud providers, and other customers are going to want. These companies are looking to lower their carbon footprint, as well as, their power bills. These advancements are delivering OOMs better performance and efficiency. It's possible that changes and becomes incremental in the future, but there is zero tangible sign of that happening in the foreseeable future. Rubin will offer OOMs better performance and efficiency  than Blackwell...so there's your 2026 revenue.\n\nLet's take a look at Oracle, since you brought them up. Oracle is also a public cloud provider, and none other than OpenAI selected them last week as their partner to scale inference and training. That's on top of NVDA themselves being an OCI customer.

AWS and Google have shown they can create solid chips, and other players will enter.

One, the stock will get obliterated if earnings or guidance come in even a little light. That 40x forward multiple may be justified, but if earnings or guidance come in light and you have lower than expected earnings plus a multiple that changes from 40x to 50x, you have a recipe for a 30-40% drop. \n\nThe second major issue is that semis are fundamentally cyclical.

More than three-quarters of companies in the AI basket had climbed in 2023.\n\nInvestment funds that tried to pick a wide spread of AI beneficiaries have had a similar experience. More than half of the individual stocks in BlackRock\u2019s Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, Invesco\u2019s AI and Next Gen Software fund, and First Trust and Nasdaq\u2019s Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF have declined this year.\n\nMona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said: \u201cInvestors are looking a bit more at the earnings story among \u2018AI\u2019 names. The differentiator with something like a Nvidia is they have delivered on the bottom line, showing real data.\u201d\n\nNvidia has more than doubled in value this year, after more than tripling in 2023, and its market cap is now well over $3tn. However, the massive demand for its graphics processing units is such that, measured as a multiple of its sales over the previous 12 months, the stock is actually cheaper than this time last year. \n\nIn contrast, tech groups such as Salesforce, Snowflake, Intel and Adobe \u2014 now far smaller than Nvidia by market value, but classed as large-cap stocks \u2014 have fallen sharply after strong gains in 2023.\n\n\u201cIn tech the bar was quite high [in earnings season] and if you missed that bar you got hit hard,\u201d said Citi\u2019s Kaiser. Salesforce suffered its worst one-day drop in 20 years after publishing a disappointing quarterly update last month.\n\nAlthough some have taken the shift as a sign of rationality returning, Rob Arnott, chair of asset manager Research Affiliates, said the AI-linked rally still \u201chas the look to me of a classic bubble\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne of the things about a classic bubble is you do see smaller players fade before big ones start to suffer,\u201d he said.\n\nArnott stressed that he was a believer in the long-term impact of AI, but said \u201ca lot of the benefits are going to come gradually, and the market is pricing in immediacy\u201d.", "id": "1djh7bs", "created_utc": 1718797736.0, "score": 407, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "The ones listed are all at the end of the AI line.

I was going up 1 strike a month collecting a few dollars each time. Red days were my friend. Thankfully, I used the premiums to buy soxl and tqqq. One thing you have to think about is taxes. I bought qqq held for a few months, then started selling calls against the shares. Once my short call went itm, I was sitting on 10k of short-term gains. No way in hell was I paying 3500 in taxes. I kept rolling with the intention to get past the one year of ownership mark to get taxed on the capital gains vs. ordinary income. \n\nRight now, I have a deep itm call on slv I roll weekly. It's a few dollars here and there, but I use my premiums to buy more shares, so I don't have red days on that account.\n\nWith your situation, if nvda is ever red, consider rolling back down and trying to collect as much premium as possible.

This instigated the Florida government to push to regain control over land in the state that had previously been near given over completely to Disney. Ultimately Disney reached a settlement with Florida where they paid a settlement ***and*** lost their pseudo control of the area, although it also lets them expand and seems pretty light handed moving forward. There is also the money it costs to maintain this high level of a lawsuit for 2+ years, whatever losses occurred from pulling out of the initial billion dollar expansion plans, and the massive loss of trust from the shareholders and public who previously thought Disney was invincible. \n \n **- [THE DECREASING MEDAI QUALITY LOSING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS FOR THE COMPANY.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/189s6tn/using_the_25x_multiplier_disneys_films_have_lost/)** \n That isn't an article, just a collection of some of their losses on some of their movies over the last x period.
