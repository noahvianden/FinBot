And when it\u2019s time to take them out just rebalance by wheeling out. Add leverage to the point you are confirmable with, hedge the equity and bonds (this will probably be your most weighted holdings) and then over leaver  some more via options. Simulate your ports\u2019s SPX 20% drawdown and see if you risk a margin call (most brokers can do this). Adjust leverage until you can theoretically survive a 20% drawdown then look up tail risk hedging (this is still black magic for most people).\n\nMy reasoning is to make money by selling options during good times and when the swan commeth, I will have a very diversified low correlated portfolio with some 1/3 put back ratio hedges that will hold my margin steady until the swan turns out to be black or not.\n\nIf the swan is white then I just chill and take a break from selling puts. Maybe sell some calls on the shit you\u2019ll get assigned & remember to roll the 1/3 back ratio puts so you don\u2019t end up expiring in the valley of death.\n\nIf the swan is black then brace for impact because your wonderfully crafted low correlated port will turn to shit and will very fast autocorrelate with the SPX. At this point you should constantly keep your eyes on your maintenance margin and of that spikes you should start buying low delta puts on SPY.\n\nMonitor in the background the price difference between a S&P500 etf like SPY and a S&P500 mutual fund. In a market that is liquid the spread should be arbed out by algos. But if that spread widens then it is clear the liquidity event has started. At this moment you should start liquidating your portfolio and just keep the hedges. If you are lucky enough you can time the market bottom, dump the hedges for massive gains and go back with all that sweet, sweet cash you have on the sidelines. But don\u2019t go back into all that diversified crap. Go back in gradually into SPY as it is probably the most liquid.

It\u2019s great for big wide orgs that don\u2019t need a lot of organization of their projects, or project management tooling. Their calling card is *accessibility* over feature richness: great APIs, centralized SSO, big flat open organization page UX, public and free storage options. GitHub on its own is extremely anemic when it comes to kanban/scrum \u201cproject\u201d tooling- which is where Atlassian has the primary advantage with Jira. It\u2019s common to see Jira bolted onto other VCS solutions to fill the gap. GitHub also has a paid-only onprem solution. The FOSS analogous option is Gitea, which is tiny in comparison to everything else. GitHub wins with CI/CD simplicity with its @modular system which lets people curate libraries of CI functions and share/reuse them. Highly pluggable, more accessibility. They have free package repos built in. Their releases API is best in class. \n\n- Gitlab is free as fuck. As in, nearly its entire featureset works OOTB without slip-and-sliding people into buying anything at all. CI just works. Single board Kanban is there. Private orgs just work. Runners work. Releases are all there. It has a more than sufficient toolset for kanban/scrum tooling, issue management, builds, k8s integration, whole 9. Running it on-premise though is archaic. It\u2019s still designed like a fat monolith with 12 different services composing the stack. It still does not have a good k8s implementation for running on k8s clusters, and people opt to just run the single monolithic pod or VM (native packages) version instead. I think over half of the fortune 100 use it for on prem because it\u2019s TRULY free, whereas GitHub\u2019s onprem option is paid only, same with bitbucket. It\u2019s THE ONLY real on-prem free option with full features batteries included. The SaaS platform (Gitlab.com) is not anywhere near as popular as GitHub because it\u2019s really a tool more designed for private use, and as such it\u2019s not as UX-focused to be a big \u201cpublic portal\u201d for projects. I don\u2019t event think that\u2019s gitlab\u2019s goal.\n\n- Bitbucket sucks on its own. It\u2019s minimal in featureset because Atlassian sells their *suite* of tools in bundles, and it\u2019s intended to be sold alongside Bamboo, Jira, and Confluence to be feature-complete. \n\nEvery one of these primary options has their own market strategy and niche it\u2019s trying to hit. I\u2019d argue Gitlab is king of on prem, GitHub is king of SaaS, and bitbucket is king of economy of scale (institutional adopters).\n\nWhere Gitlab is \u201cfailing\u201d is pushing their primary business model of CALs+Support:\n\n1. SO MUCH of the product featureset is free, most consumers can avoid paying for it at all. \n\n2. WHEN YOU DO need support, their support sucks major donkey dick because they\u2019re frankly understaffed/underskilled to solve some of those more complex issues (when they seldom occur). They don\u2019t have as large of a support engineering foundation as say, Red Hat, and many of the engineers that built Gitlab came from there, and never took the time to capture/outline their strategy for running a services based revenue generating part of the business- a case of too much engineering not enough business sense.\n\n3. Their upsell to paid enterprise edition (EE vs CE) is nonexistent. I have never seen them try to push us or anyone else to turn on EE-only features, and they\u2019re just *not that compelling* to do so. Their marketing and sales strategy is just milk-toast. You can install EE, and run it in free mode which is the same as just having CE.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, most consumers just use one or two features of Gitlab that they really need, which is just proper on-premise isolation of proprietary code and content. There is so little incentive to base an entire company\u2019s operations on JUST Gitlab that the sales exposure and opportunity there is slim unless GTLB decided to grow a pair and more aggressively upsell people to EE. \n\nThis is my experience and opinion, and I\u2019m a $350k/yr TCO engineer in the space.\n\nWe ourselves use multiple Gitlab EE (free mode) instances on-prem, just for internal stuff that houses sensitive data and our skeletons in the closet, but majority of our real world product development occurs on both GitHub.com and Gitlab.com SaaS because we\u2019re a FOSS leader.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Great breakdown thanks", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.022954439744353294}, {"body": "Holy shit.
