{"title": "NVDA short thesis (puts)", "selftext": "Nvidia has soared to new heights that have never before been seen. Easily overtaking Apple as the most valuable company in the world. Now to my immaculate and brilliant short thesis\n\n\u2022 Nvidia is currently valued at over $100,000,000 per employee \n\u2022 Nvidia has a PE ratio of 71 compared to Apple\u2019s 31\n\u2022 Book value per share of $2.00 half of AAPL which has a $4.84 \n\u2022 Annual revenue of 60B compared to 383B from Apple\n\u2022 7B cash on hand (28B for Apple) \n\nNow this may just seem like a comparison of why Nvidia is trading at insane multiples compared to Apple. But let\u2019s not forget Apple has been the darling of the Dow for the past 15+ years and it\u2019s going nowhere. Especially after an extremely strong WWDC event that reminded people why Apple is the best company in the world. Nvidia is due for a pullback at these levels. \n\nAI has been nothing but a buzz word as hundred of mega-mid cap companies scramble to acquire chips to create there own LLM and other AI models. However no company yet can even remotely show how their billion dollar investments in AI has born any fruit. As these companies quickly see how fruitless AI is compared to its costs. Many companies will abandon the \u201cAI gold rush\u201d and NVDA strong forecasted growth will shrink and companies stop buying chips/cancel existing orders. \n\nMy final and most well thought out point of my entire short thesis. My 83 year old grandma just asked me if I\u2019d heard of that company called Nvidia because she just bought some in her retirement account. If this is a sign for a pullback I don\u2019t know what is. \n\nCONCLUSION: if my grandma is hopping on the Nvidia hype train. It\u2019s time for us to hop off.
