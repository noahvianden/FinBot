I've compiled a database of tech company stock splits from $CSCO to $MSFT back to 1991 to obtain the following stats:\n\nAverage 3-day performance after a stock split:\u00a0***-0.8%***\n\n% of times negative 3-days:\u00a0***52.0%***\n\nAverage 6-day performance after a stock split:\u00a0***-3.4%***\n\n% of times negative 6-days:\u00a0***72.0%***\n\n*\\*\\*days measured as next 3/6 trading days, not calendar days*\n\n*---*\n\nI like my odds here on a bearish play on $NVDA following the stock split on Monday.\n\n**POSITIONS**: July 5 $1140P.
