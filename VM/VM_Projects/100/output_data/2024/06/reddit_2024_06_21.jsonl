{"title": "Netflix Launches Its Own Line of Popcorn for $4.50 a Bag", "selftext": "Netflix will now sell you a ready-to-eat bag of popcorn to go with your ready-to-binge TV show.\n\nThe streamer is teaming with popcorn company Popcorn Indiana for the new line of Netflix\u2019s Now Popping snacks. The two flavors are \u201cCult Classic Cheddar Kettle\u201d and \u201cSwoonworthy Cinnamon Kettle.\u201d The Netflix-branded popcorn will be available at Walmart stores nationwide and at other retailers; Popcorn Indiana has a locator search for where to buy it at this link.\n\nAn 8-ounce bag of Netflix Now Popping costs $4.49, according to grocery chain Shoprite. That means if you buy one bag of each flavor, you\u2019ll already have paid more than the monthly cost of the Netflix Basic plan with ads ($6.99/month in the U.S.).\n\nNetflix likely doesn\u2019t expect to suddenly start making a bucketful of money by selling snacks \u2014 rather, the more important part of this is getting its brand in front of shoppers at thousands of retail outlets. Note that AMC Theatres also has its own line of popcorn, launched in 2021 as a bid to extend its branding and perhaps make some extra revenue after movie theaters suffered a dramatic drop-off during the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix\u2019s Now Popping isn\u2019t the first food-related brand extension for the company. In 2020, it inked a deal with Ben & Jerry\u2019s, which introduced Netflix & Chilll\u2019d flavor (peanut butter ice cream with sweet-and-salty pretzel swirls and fudge brownies). That\u2019s still available on store shelves.\n\nA \u201cmovie night and popcorn go together like a hot dog and a bun, ice cream and sprinkles, or a beach day and a lounge chair,\u201d the streamer said in announcing the popcorn line. \u201cThat\u2019s why Netflix and Popcorn Indiana have teamed up to debut Now Popping, a new ready-to-eat popcorn line available to snack on now.\u201d\n\nAmong other moves it has made to instantiate the Netflix brand IRL, the company \u2014 famously averse to long theatrical release windows \u2014 now runs three movie theaters: New York\u2019s Paris Theater, the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood and the Bay Theater in Pacific Palisades, Calif. And in 2025, it plans to launch entertainment, restaurant and retail complexes (dubbed \u201cNetflix House\u201d) in Dallas and King of Prussia, Pa., occupying more than than 100,000 square feet each at abandoned department store locations.\n\nPopcorn Indiana was started by \u201ca team of folks out of the Northeast\u201d and named after the small town of Popcorn, Ind., according to its website. In 2017, Cleveland-based Eagle Foods acquired Popcorn Indiana and the product is now produced at a single facility located in Waukegan, Ill.\n\nNetflix announced the new popcorn line as part of touting its summer lineup of TV shows, movies and games. Those include the third and final season of \u201cVikings: Valhalla\u201d and new seasons of \u201cToo Hot to Handle\u201d and \u201cBarbecue Showdown\u201d; rom-com \u201cA Family Affair\u201d starring Nicole Kidman, Joey King and Zac Efron; and \u201cBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\u201d starring Eddie Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\n\nSource: https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/netflix-popcorn-walmart-1236043686/", "id": "1dkri9l", "created_utc": 1718931418.0, "score": 477, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "They should have included a weekend trial of Netflix.", "score": 265, "replies": [{"body": "\"Credit card required to activate free trial\"", "score": 88, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41885462403297424}, {"body": "This would be a great idea.", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21090582013130188}, {"body": "Didn\u2019t the video rental stores used to have some snack package or something?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN\n \u2014 \nBoeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft was set to mark its crowning achievement this month: Ferrying two NASA astronauts on a round trip to the International Space Station, proving the long-delayed and over-budget capsule is up for the task.\n\nStarliner is halfway to that goal.\n\nBut the two veteran astronauts piloting this test flight are now in a tentative position \u2014 extending their stay aboard the space station for a second time while engineers on the ground scramble to learn more about issues that plagued the first leg of their journey.\n\nSpaceflight veterans Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore arrived at the space station aboard the Starliner on June 6. NASA initially projected their stay would last about a week.\n\nBut troubles the vehicle experienced en route, including helium leaks and thrusters that abruptly stopped working, have raised questions about how the back half of the mission will play out.\n\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will now return no earlier than June 26, NASA announced Tuesday, stretching their mission to at least 20 days as engineers race to gain a better understanding of the spacecraft\u2019s problems while it\u2019s safely attached to the space station.\n\n\nOfficials have said there is no reason to believe Starliner won\u2019t be able to bring the astronauts back home, though \u201cwe really want to work through the remainder of the data,\u201d said Steve Stich, NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program manager, at a Tuesday news conference.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner spacecraft docks to the International Space Station on June 6, 2024. \nRELATED ARTICLE\nAstronauts\u2019 return delayed again as Boeing and NASA try to learn more about spacecraft issues\nMeanwhile, Boeing has sought to frame the mission as a success and learning opportunity, albeit one that has left the Starliner team grappling with the \u201cunplanned\u201d side of the mission, as Mark Nappi, Boeing\u2019s vice president and program manager of the Starliner program, put it Tuesday.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for astronauts to unexpectedly extend their stay aboard the space station \u2014 for days, weeks or even months. (NASA has also said the Starliner can spend up to 45 days at the orbiting laboratory if needed, according to Stich.)\n\nBut the situation makes for a moment of uncertainty and embarrassment that joins a long list of similar blunders by the Boeing Starliner program, which is already years behind schedule. It also adds to a chorus of unfavorable news that has followed Boeing as a company for some time.\n\nA nail-biting finale\nBoeing and NASA engineers said they are opting to leave Starliner \u2014 and with it, Williams and Wilmore \u2014 aboard the station longer than expected primarily to carry out additional analysis. The helium leaks and thruster issues occurred on a part of the vehicle that is not intended to survive the trip home from space, so mission teams are delaying the spacecraft\u2019s return as part of a last-ditch effort to learn everything they can about what went wrong.\n\nDanger looms any time a spacecraft returns home from orbit. It is perhaps the most perilous stretch of any mission to space.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft on NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is pictured docked to the Harmony module's forward port on June 13 as the International Space Station orbited 262 miles above Egypt's Mediterranean coast.\nThe Starliner spacecraft on NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is pictured docked to the Harmony module's forward port on June 13 as the International Space Station orbited 262 miles above Egypt's Mediterranean coast. NASA\nThe trip will require the Starliner to hit Earth\u2019s thick atmosphere while traveling more than 22 times the speed of sound. The process will bake the spacecraft\u2019s exterior at roughly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\nWhat do you think?\nJoin 121 others in the comments\nView Comments\nThen, a set of parachutes \u2014 which Boeing redesigned and tested as recently as January \u2014 must safely slow the capsule down before it reaches terra firma. (Starliner will be the first US-made capsule to parachute to a landing on the ground rather than splash down in the ocean. Boeing hopes that approach will make it easier to recover and refurbish the Starliner after flight.)\n\nA series of setbacks\nStarliner\u2019s journey to this historic crewed test mission began in 2014 when NASA tapped both Boeing and SpaceX to develop a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAt the time, Boeing was seen as the stalwart aerospace giant that would likely get the job done first while SpaceX was the unpredictable newcomer.\n\nOver the past decade, however, tides have shifted.\n\n\nSpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon spacecraft safely completed its first crewed mission \u2014 which appeared to go off without a hitch \u2014 in 2020. And the vehicle has been regularly flying astronauts and paying customers since.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft launched NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to the International Space Station, marking the spacecraft's inaugural crewed flight, on May 30, 2020.\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft launched NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to the International Space Station, marking the spacecraft's inaugural crewed flight, on May 30, 2020. Joel Kowsky/NASA\nThe two astronauts that piloted Crew Dragon\u2019s inaugural flight \u2014 Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley \u2014 also stayed aboard the space station longer than expected, notching more than 60 days rather than the brief stint expected on such test flights.\n\nBut Hurley and Behnken\u2019s stay was extended so that the astronauts could lend a hand with daily activities aboard the space station, which at the time was understaffed. The extension did not directly relate to specific software or hardware problems with SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon.\n\nSpacecraft issues, on the other hand, have marred Boeing\u2019s Starliner program practically every step of the way. The vehicle has faced years of delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.\n\nThe first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clock off by 11 hours.\n\nVanguard\u00ae\nIs an IRA right for you?\nBy Vanguard\u00ae\nLearn More\n\nA second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicle\u2019s thrusters.\n\nStich, the NASA program manager, indicated during a June 6 news conference that it\u2019s possible engineers may not have completely resolved those issues from 2022.\n\n\u201cWe thought we had fixed that problem,\u201d Stich said, adding, \u201cI think we\u2019re missing something fundamental that\u2019s going on inside the thruster.\u201d\n\nMichael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering associate professor of practice at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who was a consultant for Boeing\u2019s spaceflight division from 2009 to 2014, told CNN that it would be difficult to determine whether additional ground tests may have caught the thruster issues at hand.\n\nBut Lembeck emphasized that evaluating the success of this test mission is not as simple as comparing it directly with the inaugural crewed test flight of SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon.\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule, atop an Atlas V rocket, lifts off from launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41 Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Fla.

Boeing\u2019s kind of having to build a crew vehicle all up from scratch.\u201d\n\nShould this Starliner test mission encounter additional setbacks, however, it could put Boeing in a situation where it must rely on its rival to get Williams and Wilmore home.\n\n\u201cThe embarrassing backup is that a Crew Dragon would have to go and retrieve the astronauts,\u201d Lembeck said. The spacecraft \u201ccould be sent up with two crew members and sent back with four \u2014 and that would probably be the way home.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s broader problems\nBoeing executives have repeatedly sought to make clear that the Starliner program operates independently from the company\u2019s other units \u2014 including the commercial aircraft division that has been at the center of scandals for years.\n\n\u201cWe have humans flying on this vehicle. We always take that so seriously,\u201d Nappi said during a news briefing in April before Starliner took flight.\n\nNappi at the time also declared that the Starliner team was operating at \u201cpeak performance\u201d and \u201creally looking forward to executing\u201d a safe mission.\n\nFamily members of the crash victims of the Boeing 737 MAX8 in Ethiopia, hold photographs during a news conference on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Washington.\nRELATED ARTICLE\nBoeing committed \u2018the deadliest corporate crime in US history\u2019 and should be fined $24 billion, victims\u2019 families say\nWhen asked about that assertion on Tuesday, Stich, the NASA executive, said that officials at Boeing and NASA had always expected to find additional issues that needed to be hashed out during this test flight.\n\n\nWilliams had alluded to that expectation during a pre-flight news conference, saying, \u201cWe always find stuff, and we are going to continually find stuff.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s not going to be absolutely perfect as we fly the spacecraft. \u2026We feel very safe and comfortable with how this spacecraft flies, and we have backup procedures in case we need those,\u201d Williams said.\n\nStich, however, acknowledged on Tuesday that Boeing and NASA might have been able to prevent some of the hangups the Starliner has encountered: \u201cPerhaps we could have done different testing on the ground to characterize some of (the thruster issues) ahead of time,\u201d he s", "id": "1dkucl6", "created_utc": 1718940438.0, "score": 657, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 6 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 34 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1741054803133011}, {"body": "Those astronauts were potential whistle blowers.", "score": 665, "replies": [{"body": "*In space, nobody can hear you whistle*", "score": 282, "replies": [{"body": "It's very easy to fall out of a window in space... it can happen to *anyone*, comrade.", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39040428400039673}, {"body": "Such an amazing comment", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15298646688461304}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42267653346061707}, {"body": "Holy fuck I just sharted myself\u2026\u2026", "score": 52, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.011229311116039753}, {"body": "Puts on astronauts", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.393602579832077}, {"body": "In space nobody can hear you scream", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Or shart", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "And scream, and shart, and let it out\n\nWe say ohhhhh ehhh ohhhh\n\nYou are now now rockin with Will.i.am an britney bitch", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1581408679485321}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09933212399482727}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3952786326408386}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4053407609462738}, {"body": "If BA wasn't a US company it would be bankrupt by now.", "score": 471, "replies": [{"body": "If BA wasn\u2019t morally bankrupt, it would be a legitimate company by now.", "score": 188, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "USA Military Industrial  Complex company.

{"title": "NVDA's Big Drop in Prices: The True Reason Behind the AI Chip Revolution", "selftext": "Recently, Anthropic, a small startup with funding 5-6 times smaller than OpenAI, launched their latest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with performance surpassing OpenAI's flagship GPT-4. Google also quickly released Gemini-1.5-Pro, which swiftly outperformed GPT-4-Turbo. Sounds interesting, but how is this related to NVIDIA? Simply put, both Google and Anthropic use Google's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chips to train both of these models. Shortly after OpenAI announced the \"divine\" GPT-4, Anthropic only began to release their first model, Claude-1, which was like a joke compared to the modern GPT-4. Google was even slower in launching Google Bard, later renamed Gemini 1.0, which became a meme, and everyone thought OpenAI would be unbeatable. OpenAI relied on expensive and power-hungry NVIDIA chips, spending $100 million and several years of training to launch an expensive GPT-4 model that most regular free users couldn't access. In less than a year, Anthropic and Google easily surpassed them, launching models superior to GPT-4 at a cost 10 times cheaper, with training costs also 10 times lower and only taking a few months.\n\nThe situation with general-purpose GPU chips for AI training is similar to using them for Bitcoin mining in 2014 - expensive, energy-consuming, and wastefully space-occupying, until Bitcoin difficulty increased to the point where NVIDIA GPUs became useless and ASIC Bitcoin miners emerged to replace them. Therefore, thinking that NVIDIA will monopolize the AI chip market is just the thinking of Wall Street traders who only know companies through Bloomberg articles and have no expertise in the field.\n\nThanks to NVIDIA's expensive and inefficient GPUs, a basic user paying $20/month can still only access GPT-4 in a limited and expensive way, while Google is providing FREE API access to their FLAGSHIP MODEL, Gemini-1.5-Pro. Remember that Claude 3.5 Sonnet isn't even the flagship model, but just an inexpensive mid-tier model. Claude 3.5 Opus will be released and it will surpass GPT-4.5 or even GPT-5 thanks to NOT USING NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pj8ia6qd5v7d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcd49cc4ebd859cada3333eb678956372cc8484e\n\n", "id": "1dkwqna", "created_utc": 1718948890.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, Nvidia is gonna go down the shitter.

I know the topic, so if something is off or wrong, I either correct it or dismiss whatever part is has said incorrectly. The LLM demonstrably knew a series topic pretty well here\u2014with decent, useable feedback:\n\n[Here's an example of the process](https://poe.com/s/cZAFEciT6Ou9MXEUkBcN)\n\nIt helped greatly in developing a comprehensive and insightful response to the given story topic. I was able to quickly respond to a Reddit post about a narrative series topic, and it easily got double the most upvotes of anyone from the thread. A large majority of the people looking at the thread liked the response I had done using extensive LLM assistance.\n\nLLMs demonstrably can analyze given texts, as my example clearly shows.

The model showed an ability to draw logical conclusions based on given information and expand on themes in a way that was deemed valuable by the community.\n\nYour dismissal of these capabilities as \"bs hype\" is not just misguided; it's again: willfully ignorant.

The level of detail and nuanced understanding demonstrated in connecting Elaine's failed Princess candidacy to her later ruthless behavior as Kaiser is original thinking, not simply *rehashing existing ideas.*\n\nThe analysis draws connections between distinct elements of the story\u2014the Princess selection process, Elaine's upbringing, her failure in the selection, and her subsequent reign as Kaiser\u2014in a way that provides new insights into the character and the world-building. \n\nAgain, the[ LLM-assisted comment response](https://www.reddit.com/r/TowerofGod/comments/18rewfj/comment/kf1qtkb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) based on that sort of topic received strong positive feedback from the series-following community who read through that thread, indicating that the analysis resonated as both accurate to the source material as well as being meaningful. If this were simply **regurgitated content from the training set**, it's unlikely it would have been so well-received by knowledgeable fans. The LLM demonstrated an ability to integrate information, draw original connections, and provide insights that even dedicated followers found valuable and accurate.
