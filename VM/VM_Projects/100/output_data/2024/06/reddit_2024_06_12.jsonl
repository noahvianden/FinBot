I just limited out on AAPU near its current levels (34) this morning when I was sleeping, sticking with my self-imposed restriction of only rarely holding levered funds for a very short period of time when I have a very good reason. I'm holding my normal apple shares that I bought pre-earnings over a month ago, after being uncharacteristically out of apple for more than a year. The content of WWDC was completely [in line with my expectations](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d9wdst/aapl_and_wwdc_on_monday_expectations_for_ai_and/l7kxcsz/?context=3) with the exception that I forgot that apple doesn't do hardware announcements at WWDC and they are pretty secretive in general. I do still think that Apple AI will run TSMC LLM ASIC inference chips on Apple Silicon in the cloud but I could be wrong. I was watching WWDC on my vision pro (brought to me by, in part, by historical gains in Apple stock) and watching a separate window tracking AAPU's ~4% declines and feeling like other traders were watching a different stream.\n\nOver the last months I've also read a lot of comments made by people dragging Apple as a buy, and a lot of comments by people who are either angry or mystified over this week's apple gains, so I thought I would write an essay breaking all the reasons for the rally.\n\n* First off, Apple hasn't had revenue growth for well over a year, and its growth has been tepid for two years. Obviously, you want to own companies that are growing when they are growing, so Apple's stock price was stagnant or down over the last 18 months, while it was entirely discounted as an AI player while the AI chip stocks and AI-branded Mag 7 players ran away (with the exception of Tesla). At the very least, the street is now expecting positive iPhone growth this year, which is the dominant source of Apple's revenue, as its 2 billion+ users begin to upgrade. I personally don't expect Apple to blow us out of the park next earnings, but I do expect consistent and steady growth in iPhone purchases. I'm pissed that I have to upgrade to test the new Siri on a phone, but AAPU more than paid for that this week. After WWDC, I held AAPU until this morning, expecting that dedicated analysts would make their case to fund managers as to while WWDC was actually a big deal, despite the initial sell-off.\n\n* I think Nvida is best positioned to monetize B2B AI on both the hardware and software front (with NIMs and other software/LLM bundle and omniverse digital twin offerings, while I'm ST bearish on the overvalued software sector as a whole). But, I think that Apple is best positioned to capitalize on consumer-facing AI (again, with 2 billion+ users). Most people don't need AI that can one-shot hundreds of lines of code (which AI can't do now, but will be able to do in the future). Most of those 2 billion people need AI give short, confidential, and accurate answers to quick questions (which Apple AI will do this year) and act as an assistant (make three different cost-effective itineraries for a trip and execute on all the purchases for one with an okay, pull up all the news or websites that I will find interesting this morning based on my past behavior), which will happen soon-ish. \n\n* At WWDC, Apple subtly laid out their case of how they are moving forward with AI, which aligns with what a lot of experts have been calling for over the last year. This is that you have your own private on-device AI and own private Apple cloud AI, which interacts with other apps and websites, which will increasingly run using AI agents and novel LLMs, on your behalf. For most people, especially younger generations that are very locked into the Apple ecosystem, the amount of time they use their meat sticks on phones and keyboards will dramatically decrease. Yeah, Microsoft can do this too. But, Microsoft has a very long and problematic relationship with on-device privacy, starting with Windows 10, and progressively getting worse since then. If your AI knows you and is doing stuff for you, you want to be able to trust it. You don't want it to tell Microsoft, Meta, or Google all your pressure points that will result in you making a purchase. These three companies are all in the personal data-broker business, where all your data is supposed to be anonymized, but a programmer with a budget who knows anything about you can know almost everything about you. You also don't want personal AI to cause problems for you while acting as you on your behalf. Also, the difference between great AI software and pretty good software can be huge if you know that the software will inevitably make mistakes and do things that you don't want it to do. At WWDC, apple laid out their business model for the next decade, and it is clear that they are serious and have put a lot of work into it.\n\n* With regard to stocks, future performance will depend entirely on the monetization of AI. Apple can and will monetize AI through their new effort in many different ways. We don't know what Apple's current deal with Open AI is, but it is important to remember that Google pays Apple to use their search. Google turns this finders fee into ad revenue. As AI becomes more accurate and its critical thinking ability improves with retrieval augmented generation, which is critical for accuracy and reducing hallucinations that make AI a b*llshit machine if you ask it a truly complex multi-part question and is critical for an AI managing an OS. Apple will own 2 billion+ eyeballs and they can decide how they monetize those eyeballs and how much they want to make per eyeball at their leisure. \n\n* Whether or not they are currently using ASICs, Apple's official entrance into the AI cloud is a really big deal. Particularly, Apple can capitalize on its decades-long role as one of TSMC's most important customers. Through 2026, four companies have reserved the bulk of TSMC's entire 3 nm production line those companies are NVDA, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple.](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/06/11/news-major-clients-reportedly-fully-allocate-tsmcs-production-capacity-until-2026-3nm-process-in-high-demand/) Right now, if you are a different company or startup that wants to use the best technology to run your AI, you have to go through one of those four players, be satisfied with lower-scale or older-tech production, or wait until 2027 to start production and 2028 to launch. In AI years, 3-4 years is an eternity. We already know the players that will compete at the highest level between now and then, and Apple is one of them, thanks to their historically close relationship with TSM. Apple has been an AI player the entire time the stock was sleeping, and this week, the catch-up trade went into high gear. Apple doesn't hype all the great things that it plans to do to juice share prices, Tim Cook only reports on what Apple has already done in secret (though Apple is a leaky ship, so you can know a lot about what they are trying to do in secret of you read all the macrumors sites and cross-reference different rumors posted at different times for consistency). \n\nThese are the reasons why apple stock went up. People like me waited a year from the last WWDC to make a big bet before this WWDC. The lion's share of my portfolio, in order, is NVDA, TSMC, and AAPL. \n\nWith regard to how long to hold aggressive positions and when to get taxed on profits, I am super sensitive to major Mag-7 level companies notably cutting back on spending, or accelerating their layoffs. I am hoping these indicators will give me a month or so to load up on dry powder/go conservative. I will also keep an eye out for signs of absolutely imminent trouble with China, which would also crash almost all stocks everywhere. With NVDA, I am also on the alert for any reports of Blackwell water cooling failures. Water cooling is really hard to implement, especially when water pressure can't shut off for years, and leaks can't happen for years, or there will be disastrous financial consequences. I've been through many crashes, and it is critical that you watch the biggest customers of your biggest positions to see verifiable trouble ahead. But, I think I stick to evidence based investment with regards to taking profits, and I don't see evidence yet. \n\nThere is a lot of talk on CNBC about Cisco's crash after the dot-com bubble. I used to own Cisco. There were plenty of warning signs. Cisco's biggest customers were WorldCom, Sprint, and AT&T when it had massive year-over-year revenue growth. Two of those companies are no more. WorldCom was an Enron-scale case of outright fraud and they were buying Cisco routers to keep up appearances. Sprint over-extended its Cisco purchases. These stocks hit their highs months before Cisco hit its high. Cisco had tepid 15% YoY growth, down from massive revenue growth, the month it crashed. If NVDA's YoY growth goes from very positive to mildly positive, then that is really bad at these valuations, because trends in revenue growth have significant correlations, and going from great growth to okay growth can signal an inflection into a decline. So, I'm not going to try to get out at or before the top, I am going to wait until earnings numbers come in before running for the hills and rotating into bond proxies with good dividend yield.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Too much text, Apple went up because they\u2019re an excellent company and probably the best positioned for the long haul.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Great write up, thanks for comments on Cisco!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2971133887767792}], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl", "crash", "bubble", "nvda", "msft", "meta", "aapl", "amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Inverse Reddit for the win", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Inverse what some random redditor says?

What you need to recognize is that they likely aren't just running your queries through an llm. There is likely an application layer sitting on top of the model, orchestrating your request, using more traditional logic to determine the category of request as well as necessary OS interactions in order to trim down the query into a variety of smaller, specialized models, including, but not limited to, an llm designed to respond in specific formats that can then be interpreted by the application layer to present more complex answers and queue up actions. \n\nTo top it off, they have all of this running on specialized, dedicated hardware designed specifically to do these operations efficiently. \n\nI don't take issue with your assertion these models will be more limited than something like ChatGPT because, well, no shit.

Ireland\u2019s Ryanair got four and Alaska Airlines took three. Airbus said it delivered 53 planes last month.\n\nIn a critical Support line. BA (BOEING) is Set see a 120 in these coming months.

In the UK, it\u2019s fairly common for graduates to look for jobs outside of their university specialism, so naturally, he began to look for jobs in finance, banking and HF along with stuff that was actually within his technical remit. \n\nLo and behold, at every Finance and banking interview he went to, it would last less than 20 minutes, first round. At the end of everything, he was clearly upset that none of these institutions wanted to take him on and so he decided to talk to an alumni that had done quite well in finance. \n\nDuring the chat, the friend of his looked at my brother and said, \u2018You know, my friend, I wouldn\u2019t hire you for any banking or finance role, and you know why? *I don\u2019t see greed in your eyes\u2019.* \n\nSo take a moment to think through what was said back there; dude\u2019s an engineer, and what corporate asks him to do is to act like the wolf of Wall Street in what he does.

The backlog is 5600 airplanes! New orders means fuck all. You have cherry picked the past 6 months bad news and disregarded all the good news much like news outlets in general are doing to Boeing these days. Obviously you\u2019re short / put options wishing for a 120 price when fair value today sits at 200-220!\n\nFirst of all, the FAA production cap of 38 Max planes per month has no meaning at all, it is political. Boeing themselves has produced and delivered less than that since January because they have self imposed strict quality assurance guidelines and wants to send the message that they\u2019re taking the matter even more seriously (of a blown out door due to one mechanic missing 4 bolts, on an a plane with an American operator - Alaska Airlines, which is why the outrage even started in the first place. \u201cCan\u2019t happen to Americans attitude\u201d).\n\nIf you have ever listened to any statements by the company they say they will deliver and produce less than the FAA cap willingly the first six months of this year then scale to 38 per month by new years or q1 next year, so the whole FAA cap until then is moot! What it literally means is cash burn these 2 first quarters and on full year a small net cash burn. \n\nThereafter the FAA cap will be revised and possibly become more planes per month or remain the same. This is why they\u2019re doing less to show an even greater compliance than asked for at the expense of a hit in short term patience from investors that can\u2019t see past 6 months or even listen to the company at all. \n\nSecondly it is correct that most orders come at airplane fairs / air shows except for the irregular orders coming in irregularly all through the year. But before next months air show no new orders means fuck all. But the backlog of 10 years + makes new orders moot unless it is for a full year calendar which will NEVER happen!\n\nThirdly cancellations thus far has basically not come and the few that has come has NOTHING to do with the door plug incident. It has been either airlines defaulting or not affording their order. All in all this first half year net backlog has grown substantially! \n\nWith all this in mind. What it means is Boeings recovery has been postponed for a full year! What was meant to happen this year will happen next year and all their plans are postponed. What was looking great in free cash flow last new years is now on hold and looking great again new years between 2025-26. And the company is aiming for financial stability on the same time frame 26/27.\n\nFourth if you even looked at the quarterly earnings report it showed that defense (that was last years drag on earnings was finally profitable again) which means when commercial, defense and space (which mostly all three have had costs for apparent reasons the past +5 years) are all spinning again it will be back to a money making machine. \n\nSo your DD is entirely false, not forward looking at all like a DD should be and overlooks all key points as to why EVERY single analyst out there has a price target of 220-300 in the coming year. But I will admit that is too high! Fair value today is about 200-220 like I said and 1 year forward barring huge complications it\u2019s 250-260 at best and the same 200-220 at worst!\n\nShit like this post is ridiculous and brain dead bull with no insight into the industry at all, just hopeium you will influence people to hit your 120 target short", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Market dynamics are influenced by a complex interplay of factors such as technological advancements, investor sentiment, regulatory changes, macroeconomic conditions, and geopolitical events. However, some indicators that might signal the approaching burst of an AI-related bubble include: 1. **Overvaluation**: When the valuations of AI companies become excessively high compared to their earnings and growth potential, it could be a warning sign. 2. **Hype vs. Reality Gap**: A significant gap between the promised capabilities of AI technologies and their actual performance or commercial viability can lead to disillusionment. 3. **Market Corrections**: Broader market corrections or downturns often affect high-growth sectors like AI more severely. 4. **Regulatory Interventions**: Increased regulation or government interventions in the tech sector could negatively impact AI companies. 5. **Technological Setbacks**: Major technological hurdles or failures could undermine confidence in the sector. It's important to stay informed through credible financial news, analyze market trends, and consider the broader economic context when evaluating investment risks. Diversifying investments and consulting with financial advisors can also help mitigate potential losses from speculative bubbles.\n\n\"Ok, but with apple announcing their foray into AI, what kind of timeline can I expect?\"\n\nApple's entry into the AI space can certainly add momentum to the sector, potentially driving further investment and innovation. However, this also means that the market dynamics could become even more complex. Predicting an exact timeline for a potential bubble burst remains speculative, but we can consider a few key phases and indicators to watch:\n\n1. **Initial Surge (6-12 months)**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Market Excitement**: Apple's announcement and initial developments could lead to heightened excitement and investment in AI-related stocks.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Stock Price Increase**: Stocks of Apple and other AI companies may see significant price increases due to investor enthusiasm.\n\n2. **Mid-term Growth (1-3 years)**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Product Launches**: As Apple starts launching AI-driven products and services, this could sustain the growth and keep investor interest high.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Revenue Impact**: The impact of AI on Apple's revenue and profitability will start becoming clearer, influencing broader market sentiment.\n\n3. **Maturity Phase (3-5 years)**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Market Realities**: The market will begin to assess the real-world performance and adoption of AI technologies.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Correction Risks**: If there\u2019s a gap between the hype and the actual market impact, or if broader economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a correction.\n\n4. **Long-term Stabilization (5+ years)**:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Saturation and Consolidation**: The AI market may reach a saturation point where the high growth rates normalize. Consolidation among AI companies could occur.\n\u00a0 \u00a0- **Sustained Value vs. Burst**: Depending on how well companies like Apple and others integrate and monetize AI, the market could either stabilize at a new high or face a significant downturn.\n\nKey indicators to watch during this period include:\n\n- **Earnings Reports**: Look at Apple's and other AI companies' earnings reports to gauge how AI investments are translating into revenue and profit.\n- **Product Performance**: Assess consumer and enterprise adoption of AI-driven products and services.\n- **Competitive Landscape**: Monitor how competitors are responding and the pace of innovation in the AI sector.\n- **Regulatory Developments**: Stay informed about any new regulations affecting AI and technology sectors.\n\nWhile these phases provide a rough timeline, the actual timing of any market correction will depend on a multitude of unpredictable factors.
