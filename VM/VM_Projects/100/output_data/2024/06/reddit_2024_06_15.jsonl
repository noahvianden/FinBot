{"title": "Economist Harry Dent predicts stock market crash worse than 2008 crisis: The \u2018bubble of all bubbles\u2019", "selftext": "Harry Dent, the outspoken financial author and economist, isn\u2019t reversing course from his bold \"crash of a lifetime\" declaration this past December.\n\nSpeaking in an updated interview with Fox News Digital, Dent cautioned that the \"everything\" bubble\u00a0has still yet to burst, and\u00a0it may be a bigger crash than the Great Recession.\n\n\"In 1925 to \u201829, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened,\" Dent said on Tuesday. \"What do you do if you want to cure a hangover? You drink more. And that's what they've been doing.\"\n\n\"Flooding the economy with extra money forever might actually enhance the overall economy long-term. But we'll only see when we see this bubble burst,\" he added.\u00a0 \"And again, this bubble has been going 14 years. Instead of most bubbles \\[going\\] five to six, it's been stretched higher, longer. So you'd have to expect a bigger crash than we got in 2008 to '09.\"\n\n  \nInterested to know what you all think about this. I have also been seeing people go into other financial forums I have been in and saying the same thing. Apparently the signs will start to show themselves in late March 2025. I found it interesting that the CEO of Nvidia is set to cash out 700 million in Nvidia stock right around that time. Maybe it's a coincidence?  Please put politics aside and where the source of the news came from. Let's have an honest discussion.\n\n  \nFull article here: [https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/economist-harry-dent-predicts-stock-market-crash-worse-2008-crisis-bubble-bubbles](https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/economist-harry-dent-predicts-stock-market-crash-worse-2008-crisis-bubble-bubbles)", "id": "1dg77qy", "created_utc": 1718416663.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 124, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 165 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06623074412345886}, {"body": "I mean his wiki doesn\u2019t have the best track record\u2026 didn\u2019t predict the 2008 crash, and seems to inverse himself a lot, so ATH March 2025 probably the takeaway. \n\n* His 2011 book goes on to suggest consumer spending will begin to plummet in 2012 with the Dow bottoming out somewhere between 3,000 and 5,600 in 2014.
