I am by no means an expert but I have been pretty successful in predicting what the market and what certain stocks are going to do and have seen nice returns. Now I am someone who considers myself to be very tech savvy and keeping up with the trends and it wasn\u2019t until this year that my eyes were opened to the true potential and power of AI and what the potential of NVDA is. I am so amazed at everything that I have seen, I sold a lot of my positions and NVDA went from 12% of my portfolio to now 55%. \n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that AI hasn\u2019t totally caught on with the general population, but the reality is that AI will eventually be in everything, whether we know it/like it or not. I\u2019m convinced of this 100%. The beauty of AI is that it can be automatically integrated into everything people already know and use on a daily basis without having to try and sell them on a new product. People won\u2019t have to learn how to use a new technology, AI will simply enhance the features already available to them in their phones, computers, tablets, cars, etc. When Jensen Huang said this is a new \u201cIndustrial Revolution\u201d he wasn\u2019t kidding and I think this could be the biggest revolution in history.\n\nI came into this decade telling my dad, I think by 2030 we will have seen the largest stock market gains in history and it will tower over previous decades such as the boom we saw in the 90\u2019s. AI can be the catalyst to make this happen. So I\u2019m very bullish over the next 6 years and I would not be surprised if we are extremely underestimating the growth yet to be seen. Everything seems crazy or impossible until it happens. I mean we didn\u2019t even have a trillion dollar company until when? 2018? Now we have 3 companies hovering around $3T? In a span of 5-6 years?

You\u2019re starting around when I did! Fast forward 16.5 years and I can say getting into trading is literally the most pivotal aspect of my professional career. \n\nWhile most of my peers are just starting to hit their earnings stride trying to buy their first house, I\u2019m in an extremely fortunate scenario due to two primary things: saving like an absolute mad man through my late 20s and trading options. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s important to review things logically. My path is objectively uncommon and the product of extremely hard work (I\u2019ve spent over 30,000 hours trading and analyzing markets) crossed with luck.\n\nThe absolute best piece of advice I can give you is exactly what I\u2019d tell myself:\n1. You\u2019re not going to trade your current account into your future wealth. This point serves two purposes: to slow things down (you\u2019re not losing any time by learning properly) and to orient you on the right focus - the skillset which will ultimately sustain your path to wealth vs the early outcome of a small account. \n2. There is NO substitute for aggressively saving, literally as much as humanely possible, in your early 20s. This up front sacrifice lays the foundation of your initial capital to invest. \n3. Papertrade. See point 1. Taking the time to truly learn the products is absolutely vital. They\u2019re complex and regardless of how smart someone is, or how many hours they try to cram learning into a day, there\u2019s a reality about learning intricate tools like these. Papertrading serves as incredible practical application & since I\u2019m sure you\u2019re smarter than I was you\u2019d immediate start a trading log so you can maintain a live dataset from the very beginning. This also limits unnecessary drawdowns on your principal which early on can massively slow down your longterm growth. \n4. Develop the right trading mindset. To be successful as a trader, you have to wear many hats. There\u2019s no supervisor or boss to make sure you\u2019re doing the right things. A Bayesian approach is essential. And please, don\u2019t be lured around by the one off stories of a person here or there that make it huge on a single trade. Those instances happen, but for each successful case there are hundreds of blown accounts. You can choose to try to hit the lottery, or you can adopt a slower but higher probability outcome. \n\nTrading in general (options happened to be the primary vector for me) can literally be life changing but it\u2019s not fast easy money by any means. I grew up poor with a single mom that worked multiple jobs and now live a very comfortable life in my early 30s.

Even the safest-looking option strategy will have some downside risk in the event of unexpected occurrences, and such events have a non-zero probability. \n\nThere is no such thing as a free lunch in finance. If you are making money from a strategy, you are taking on some risk. Even if you believe you understand the basics of an option strategy, there may be unforseeable scenarios where you could end up losing all your money. The only way to stress test your strategy without the hands-on experience of years of trading is to code and backtest your strategy over multiple years, including those with extreme events.

It\u2019s essential you learn TA to understand how each security works - as each one moves differently but tells a story.

Those emotional tickers will lead you down a pathway to losses vs taking a trade based on what the chart is telling you. \n\nCharts do not lie and once you apply technical analysis when forming a thesis - options aren\u2019t dangerous at all. Just requires you focus on a few liquid assets and study them to understand how market participants agree or disagree with prices then trade the structure and cycles that favor your intended direction up or down. \n\nDepending on if you\u2019re a scalper, day trader, or swing trader - which will be made apparent through trial/error - you can develop your own process specific to your risk tolerance ultimately building a mechanical process when considering entering/exiting a trade. \n\nOptions aren\u2019t scary when used correctly.

Why do you think this hardware is being bought, it's to improve what is currently available and take it 10 steps further...\n\nThe point is, those solutions may have an upper boundary.\n\nWe'd like to think that throwing more and more compute into ChatGPT or whatever will make it smarter (and eventually turn it into something like AGI), but if fundamental problems aren't fixed (e.g. hallucinations, lack of fact checking/answer validation, inability to make the model adhere to the laws of logic in its answers), it may turn out to be a complete waste of resources. The model architecture needs to be developed first.\n\nAnd your argument (\u201ein the future...\u201d) is as valuable as \u201ein 6 months we'll have reached the limit. Why? Because I predict so\u201d, i.e. both are worthless. It's pure speculation that has little to do with what's currently available.\n\n> Why web dev? Because it's full of repetitive tasks that an LLM can handle and in 99% of web development you're not making anything new and you're not coming up with new solutions to new problems.\n\nI see creating a function or two with the help of an assistant, but it won't create a separate feature that could be seamlessly into the codebase (I mean, it could, but you never know if it's done right or not, unless you go through its solution step by step). It's hard to get it to work with larger projects.\n\nBy the way, again, the question here isn't about whether the models are useful, but whether it's worth to spend billions for the latest hardware. My answer is still *no*, because once a closed source model is trained, many open source alternatives emerge, so people can still reap the benefits without having to pay e.g. for GitHub copilot subscription (let alone dozens of others) \u2014 there are fewer subscribers, and the revenue is decreasing.\n\n> Have you seen the progress in video generation, look up Sora and compare it to what we had 1-2 years ago...\n\nYes, I did.

Again, you're purely speculating here.\n\nIt's cool that you can generate a video of dogs playing in the snow, but it doesn't mean you'll be able to make actual quality content that way.\n\nMaybe we'll see tons of AI generated movies, all of which will be completely shitty, yet the average consumer will get used to it. It'll be the beginning of the end as far as cultural taste is concerned (it's kind of beginning already with TikTok \u2014 and social media in general \u2014 and its algorithm recommending videos to make people scroll into oblivion).\n\n> Chatbots handle a ton of queries that used to need a human.\n\nExample of industry where it's used? Unless it's ready-made questions and answers, companies are skeptical of chatbots.\n\n> As AI improves, it\u2019ll cover more ground.\n\nAgain, the *what if...*\n\n> AI can analyze medical data way faster than a human, freeing up doctors for more critical tasks.\n\nLLMs aren't (for the most part) needed for that (and they're the biggest models out there). Regular ML models are orders of magnitude smaller and can be trained within days using simple GPUs in the cloud.\n\n> ML has been used in analytics, but AI is making it way more accurate. It\u2019s about better predictions and optimizations, saving time and money in energy, ag, and manufacturing.\n\nUh, any example? What do you mean by AI here, because I'm still not sure \u2014 as I've told you several times, those ML models are tiny in comparison to e.g. ChatGPT-4, and they don't need as much compute. So what kind of AI are we talking about?\n\n> You\u2019re splitting hairs. Whether it's a huge LLM or a specialized model\n\nNo, the issue here if spending billions on the hardware is worth it. It started after ChatGPT was out and it's for the most part used to train and run LLMs (which aren't that useful; your arguments cover specialized ML models, which don't require the newly bought hardware, so they're irrelevant here).\n\n> AI is driving innovation and the bigger its data gets the more expensive it is to train.\n\nNot sure what you're trying to prove here. The costs to train AlphaFold are *4 orders of magnitude* smaller than to train ChatGPT.
