{"title": "Vote For will not dilute the stock price by 10%. Here is why", "selftext": "The market had already accounted for the dilution resulting from the stock grants in the 2021-2022 compensation package. What the market did not anticipate was the Delaware judge\u2019s ruling that voided this pay package. If this ruling is anti-dilutive, should the stock price not have risen by 10% following this decision? Instead, the stock price fell nearly 10% the same week and continued to drop until a recent rally, following Elon\u2019s visit to China to accelerate FSD deployment in the Chinese market.\n\nSo, why did the stock price fall? It fell due to the uncertainty resulting from this ruling, and the market dislikes uncertainty because it\u2019s a risk that is hard to quantify, requiring a higher risk premium on the underlying asset. Another factor the market dislikes is conflicts between shareholders and executives, and potential proxy fights. A vote against the pay package would exacerbate this uncertainty and risk, potentially further tanking the stock price and causing more permanent damage to market confidence in repairing the relationship between shareholders and executives. This might lead some major investors to sell to protect their investments, with fewer buying before the conflict is resolved.\n\nTherefore, a vote FOR this pay package would not only avoid diluting shares\u2014since this has long been priced in\u2014but also restore market confidence in Tesla and its management\u2019s ability to lead the company in the long term.\n\nPS: I understand many people here are upset with Elon due to something he recently posted on X, but I\u2019m trying to convince you that for the long-term benefit, Elon remains the best leader to grow Tesla from $500 billion to $5 trillion in the era of AI/Robotics. Achieving that level by focusing solely on the car business is implausible. And I tend to think it\u2019s easier to motivate the leader to dedicate more time and effort to Tesla by rewarding him with more shares, as Charlie Munger said: \"Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.\"\n\nedit: For those who think Mercedes and Google are ahead of Tesla. You can hate Elon but please stop insulting Tesla. I\u2019m quite speechless. You should talk to some Waymo engineers about this\u2026 Here is a recent ex Waymo engineer who jumped Waymo for Tesla because he believes Tesla\u2019s FSD. https://x.com/charles_rqi?s=21\nThis dude join tesla because Elon\u2019s focus on FSD development, because Elon would spend billions of dollars to build AI infrastructure, and cutting costs from other departments accordingly. This time, supercharger department is affected, unfortunately. I wish Tesla has unlimited resources to play in this game but unfortunately GPU and topnotch AI talents cost lots of money. So before you vote against the pay package, I want you to seriously consider did Elon really failed at leading when Tesla is the top leader in autonomous vehicles? These talents would be very disappointed if Elon left.", "id": "1cksx0b", "created_utc": 1714920487.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "If share dilution is priced in, then canceling the package isn\u2019t priced in, therefore when the package is rejected, 10% dilution is avoided, and will be then be priced back into the stock.\u00a0\n\nLogic is not your strong suit bud", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Feel bad about TSLA?\n\nDon't like Elon?\n\nDon't like the TSLA sub?\n\nNothing good to write about?
