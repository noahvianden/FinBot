But remember that the people posting in this subreddit are in the top 10% or 20% most knowledgable and informed retail investors - if you read this paragraph and want to argue with it, then remember I'm not talking about you.)\n\nIt's ok for a fund to lose money, as long as the retail investor's advisor can point to the S&P 500 and say \"look, it's gone down too; everything's lost money this year - what else are you gonna invest your money in?\" But if a fund loses money when the stockmarket is going up then it's going to see outflows - investors are going to sell the fund and invest their money somewhere else. Their friends will laugh at them and say \"this should be a lesson to you, no-one can beat the index\" - their friends will tell them all the kinds of things you hear from the index investors here on Reddit. Maybe it's ok to underperform the index for a year or so, but the managers of active funds are not allowed to significantly underperform the index for much longer than that - this is called \"career risk\".\n\nActive managers are not allowed to invest with \"conviction\" because their bosses won't tolerate this risk. \n\nConsequently, the vast majority of actively managed funds become closet trackers (a.k.a. *stealth trackers* or *index huggers*). They invest in a large enough number of stocks to diversify the risk down to systemic levels, but they basically get the same performance as an index tracker - a little bit more one month, a little less the next. BUT the actively managed fund has higher fees and costs, so it averages 1% a year less than the index. \n\nThis kind of mediocrity is acceptable - everyone in the industry knows and understands that they can't beat the index, and the fees and costs are unavoidable. As long as the underperformance isn't greater than the fund's OCF (TER) then everybody is happy - the sales team can go out and market the fund, there's a blurb about \"exploring opportunities for excellence and growth\" and the fund is pushed to suckers in the brochures of company 401k schemes. The fund's management make their money.\n\nWhen the advocates of passive investing say \"no-one is beating the market\" the part that they're not saying is that almost no-one in the industry is actually *trying* to beat the market.
