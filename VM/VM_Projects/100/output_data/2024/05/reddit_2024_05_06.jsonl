Originally someone said inventory was \u201cpiling up\u201d which I refuted by stating that their velocity of sales is still much faster compared to legacy auto, that\u2019s the point I was making. Comparing margins is very much a different conversation when you consider the fact that Tesla and legacy auto selling Ice cars are entirely different in terms of their cost structures, maturities, etc. You could still play that game but it\u2019s all for naught if you believe that we are headed towards 100% electrification which I personally would say is the case.
