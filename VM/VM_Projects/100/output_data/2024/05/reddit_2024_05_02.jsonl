And you can\u2019t be an AI leader without highend chips, and building AI data center requires lots of money ($10B+) and time. FSD v12 is really promising. Tesla shouldn\u2019t waste time waiting for its competitors to catch up.\n\nFrom user perspective, it doesn\u2019t matter who build supercharger.

The fact is the customer base has been scared away by his antics, there is already a surplus of unsold cars, that surveys conclude is down to Elons behaviour. He either needs to step down or step out of the limelight and assist the company from a role other than CEO, if he really cared about Tesla. I unfortunately doubt his ego will allow him to though, which is a shame, because Tesla has the ability to grow quickly if they focus on new models and production quality.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If you look at the data of the top selling cars in the last couple of months, you can see more people are buying hybrids, not other EV brands, meaning the slower growth of Tesla is probably more attributable to changes in customers preference back to ICE cars and not so much about his behavior. I think only a small number of people is scared away by his behavior but they are really the loudest group of people on social media that makes people think the brand is damaged. In fact, lots of people in America don\u2019t even know who build Cybertruck, so I think there is still much room for fufure growth.\n\nEven if Elon\u2019s recent behavior caused some damage to Tesla brand, I would think it\u2019s short term damage, and it can be fixed in the long term. It\u2019s definitely not something irreversible. And I think replacing him simply because of his recent behaviors will cause irreversible damage in long term. I don\u2019t think Tesla can convince AI talents to join without Elon. There are many big techs in Silicon Valley that are willing to spend big money to attract the top talents, why would they want to work at Tesla without a truly visionary leader? So i truly hope we can focus on the long term goal (AI, autonomy, robotics, energy storage), just give this guy some shares so his interests can be perfectly aligned with our interests.\n\nPS remember what happened after OpenAI board ousted Sam Altman? All AI talents threat to leave with \u201cOpenAI is nothing without its people\u201d. I believe the same thing would happen to Tesla if Elon decides to leave. Elon can easily go start a new company and raise billions of dollars and successfully convince all Tesla AI talents to join, and these AI talents will probably all leave Tesla for Elon\u2019s new company.
