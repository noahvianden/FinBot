{"title": "Walmart earnings beat as discounter wins over more high-income shoppers ", "selftext": "Walmart on Thursday topped quarterly revenue and earnings expectations, as the discounter made significant e-commerce gains, drove profits with newer businesses like advertising and won over more high-income shoppers.\n\nThe big-box retailer said it now expects to hit the high-end or slightly top its previous full-year guidance. Walmart had expected net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said one of the factors boosting Walmart\u2019s grocery business is the widening gap between the price of cooking at home and buying food at restaurants.\n\nPlus, he added, shoppers \u2013 especially with higher-incomes \u2013 appreciate the convenience that Walmart offers. For the first time, its delivery business surpassed its store pickup in terms of volume, Rainey said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got customers that are coming to us more frequently than they have before and newer customers that we haven\u2019t traditionally had, and they\u2019re coming into a Walmart whether it\u2019s a virtual store online, or whether it\u2019s one of our physical stores,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s what the discounter reported for the three-month period that ended April 30 compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 60 cents adjusted vs. 52 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $161.51 billion vs. $159.50 billion\n\nWalmart\u2019s net income jumped to $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared with $1.67 billion, or 21 cents per share, in the year-ago period.\n\nRevenue climbed 6% from $152.30 billion in the year-ago quarter. That increase includes a benefit of roughly 1% from an additional selling day in the period. \n\nAs the nation\u2019s largest retailer and private employer, Walmart is often viewed as a bellwether for the U.S. economy. Yet it has generally fared better during an inflationary period than other retailers because it sells staples like groceries and has a value-oriented reputation. That trend continued in the quarter, as the company \n\nSame-store sales for Walmart U.S. climbed by 3.8%, excluding fuel. The industry metric includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year. At Sam\u2019s Club, same-store sales rose 4.4% year over year, excluding fuel.\n\nE-commerce sales shot up by 22% year over year for Walmart U.S., fueled by store pickup and delivery of online orders, as well as the company\u2019s growing third-party marketplace. \n\nThe company also grew high-margin businesses like advertising as it pushes to increase its earnings faster than its sales.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/16/walmart-wmt-q1-2025-earnings-.html", "id": "1ctaa8b", "created_utc": 1715857458.0, "score": 331, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "Isn\u2019t Walmart winning high income customers a bad sign for the economy at a whole?", "score": 381, "replies": [{"body": "Not if the customers came from Amazon.", "score": 103, "replies": [{"body": "I used to blindly get everything from Amazon because 9 out of 10 times it was cheaper than elsewhere.
