TSLA is still one of the best performing stocks the past five years. Apologies if it can't hit $3 trillion market cap when it was $16 per share in 2019. I guess 10x the price in five years is such a bad investment.\n2. I'm hearing a lot of people talk about declined EV sales from TSLA. What they won't mention is Audi, Renault, Mercedes, BYD, VW, NIO, Polestar, Xpeng, and Geely all have declined EV sales with Toyota being the only car manufacturer with positive EV growth from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 and Toyota only sold 30k. Only other car company coming close to selling as many EV's as Tesla did in Q1 was BYD at 300k. Tesla sold 387k. This just proves it's a market issue and not a TSLA issue.\n3. Now, which one of the auto companies I have mentioned are working on robots, self-driving, and is actually profitable selling EV's? One thing people seem to always ignore is that EV is the future. Companies that do not move to EV's will fail to exist. So when people compare TSLA margins with the auto margins, what they ignore is the negative EV margins that the other car makers incur. That's the real margin gap you have to look at. There's a reason why GM/Ford and other legacy OEM's are slowing down EV innovation. It's because EV sales are down and also, they would be bankrupt if they sold more EV's because it takes away from their ICE sales and they're losing tens of thousands per EV sale. Let's say they make $15k per ICE sale and lose $30k per EV sale. Do you think these legacy OEM's can survive losing $40k per electric vehicle sold? So why would I be upset that TSLA is still the only profitable EV maker? BYD is TBD because they bulk in all vehicle sales so you can't really tell for sure whether their pure EV's are profitable.\n4. Elon is also the CEO of SpaceX. SpaceX sent the largest space rocket into space. If you're going to call Elon a scammer, please explain to me how a scammer can do something no one has ever done before. And may I remind you, most of the space rockets being designed in human history were government-funded. To own a private company and do it shows just how remarkable the company is being ran. Notice, no one ever protests SpaceX despite it being an Elon-ran company. Why is that? Because it's mostly paid lobbyists attacking him in the media from the energy/auto sector. He has no competitor in the space rocket industry so who is going to attack him? NASA? Also fun fact: Starlink did $1.4 billion revenue in 2022. It will do $6.2 billion in 2024. My point is, the guy is achieving great things and will continue to do so.\n\nI'm holding until 2035 at least. I don't see anyone innovating the way TESLA does. And no automaker will outwork TESLA.
