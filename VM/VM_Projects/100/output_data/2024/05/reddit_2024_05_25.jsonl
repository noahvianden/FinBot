Datacenter & AI that compete with nvidia and their chip foundry to compete with TSMC. That's it. \n\nIntel Gaudi 3 competes with nvidia h100 and amd mi300 class of accelerators. It looks like it's a very competitive product, but hardware is only part of the solution. Software is key and nvidia cuda is a big reason why. Intel and amd have a lot of work to catch up to nvidia here.\n\nIntel Foundry is years off. They're knee deep into building out these new foundries that wont be online for a few years. So its a long wait here. If they pull it off then it should grow to be a significant piece of their revenue pie. This area has the most potential to grow for intel based on how small of a piece it is for them at the moment.\n\n  \nit has potential... but you might be waiting forever for it, but it does have potential for what it brings to the table, especially with Intel Foundry.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd", "intc", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I have 32$ calls for July.
