I just think your reasons are based on a very limited view centered around LLM, but AI is so much more than LLM.\n\nWe don\u2019t often see \u201cmonetization\u201d of AI in the form of revenues because the benefits are mostly captured as efficiency gains. What you see is massive investments in data centers by companies, not necessarily for the purpose of developing LLMs, but a broader set of AI applications meant to replace human tasks or enhance human capabilities. The result is reductions in personnel everywhere. This trend has been underway for quite some time now and has displaced a lot of technical jobs \u2014 it\u2019s an old tale we\u2019ve all heard about. While the trend is not new anymore, I believe there is still room for growth as many traditional industries are still lagging behind on AI adoption. \n\nLLM, along with generative AI, is the newer AI trend that is again driving further investments in data centers. The difference is that it\u2019s now displacing creative jobs. Copywriter has literally become an obsolete profession overnight. I personally believe that there is a huge potential for growth there. The demand will likely continue as adoption of AI tools spread in creative fields, and the efficiency gains can be even more significant than in technical applications \u2014 imagine your favorite writer can now publish 10 books a year; blockbuster movies now cost less than a million to produce. Especially with image rendering and voice AI technologies\u2026 you don\u2019t even need to have the actual actors on set (this is already a common practice in China btw). Here you do see many startups capitalizing on generative AI tools, and guess what? NVDA has already invested in quite a few of them. \n\nAnd the point about competition \u2014 there is a lot of proprietary technology and knowledge involved in chipmaking. If it were so easy to develop your own, TSMC would not [still] be making more than 50% of the world\u2019s chips \u2014 everybody\u2019s been trying to catch up to TSMC for as long as China wants to invade Taiwan lol. It\u2019s literally the only thing that the Chinese has not been able to copy! I can only imagine the NVDA chips are even more sophisticated \u2014 not to mention there is already a whole ecosystem around their chips that\u2019s widely adopted by developers. \n\nHowever, as far as the stock price goes, since US investors are largely driven by stuff that they hear on the news like the GPT releases, maybe just as you predicted, the stock will likely fall if the next version is underwhelming, for a little while. \n\nI would still hold my 300 shares, though.

We\u2019re not talking about applications, we\u2019re talking about markets and training. All of the current AI hype is fundamentally based on transformers, which need training. That training is expensive. Sure you can build smaller models for targeted applications, but there are limits to how accurate any model can get without extensive training data, and there are limits to the training data sizes for smaller applications.. Smaller models will ultimately just split the training hardware market across more, smaller, customers. That doesn\u2019t necessarily change the market size.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the *cost* scaling laws for AI training well. The previous commenter\u2019s point was that if the scaling law is poor, then training hardware demand will increase slower. That\u2019s not really a controversial statement. Even if model size and application breadth changes, that doesn\u2019t change the general conclusion that if the scaling law is power, then Nvidia\u2019s price will start being more and more priced in.\n\nPoor growth of hardware demand = poor growth for Nvidia revenue. This is really really straightforward. There are second order effects, sure, (AI might enhance AI training hardware productivity for instance) but there\u2019s a reason we call them second order.

They made a machine so big and complex that no one person understands it. Present tense is appropriate, because no one is allowed to understand it all completely. You see, if someone understood the machine, they could build a better one. \n\nNow the current problem with Intel: they are unable to innovate. Innovation is the opposite of optimization. Intel is really good at optimizing, and if they had a better product, that would be the way to success. \n\nHowever, AMD exists. AMD figured out how to link a bunch of incomplete-CPUs together - called them \"chiplets\" - and so now they make better CPUs than Intel. When only two companies make a product, the product quality and performance matters a lot more than the price difference or the business relationships or even the brand loyalty that exists in the marketplace. \n\nYour bet implies that INTC will be able to make a 'better' CPU than AMD in the next year, which they can't.
