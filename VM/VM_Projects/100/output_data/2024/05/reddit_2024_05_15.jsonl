It impacts sentiment and spending habits, which in turn impacts M2 and M3 money supply, which impacts lending and investment activities.

As more people bought homes, real estate prices skyrocketed, and fewer renters meant rental prices fell. In the pre-GFC 2000s, rapidly rising home prices \u2014 driven largely by reckless lending practices and rapidly falling mortgage rates.\u2013 led to CPI appearing lower than inflation actually was.\n\n>It seems perverse, but that is what happened.\n\n>Today, we are dealing with a bizarre inverse variation of that situation. Home prices are rising, in part due to a lack of inventory but exacerbated a great deal by rapidly rising mortgage rates. Those rates are driven primarily by the FOMC action. The combination operates to price many potential buyers out of the market.

{"title": "Enjoy this market while it lasts and ffs, be careful", "selftext": "We're still in a market of extremes. Long delta is rewarded daily and without fail. Shorts are punished mercilessly. The Nov-Mar is historic, with the S&P still routinely exceeding the expected move to the upside. \n\nIs this a good or bad thing? The answer is both. Historically, this type of sustained directional move is unsustainable. That doesn't mean a major reversal is imminent. It is important to keep in mind that the longer it goes on, the greater the likelihood of an extreme pullback/correction/bear market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nmff3h96hl0d1.png?width=2455&format=png&auto=webp&s=e42333d369cc6bb3e278a56b0abb1274b8af3f84\n\nNo one cares about extremes in momentum when its directionally to the upside, but when it reverses, it gets ugly quick. \n\nAbove is the current S&P 500. [This is a link to the inverse of the same chart](https://imgur.com/a/TO84pmq). This is not an attempt to scare anyone or imply we're going to crash. It is just to illustrate the level of volatility we are realizing with implied volatility at a very low level. \n\nI've written this before, but one-directional markets are bad for premium sellers. You need chop to sustain IV, unwind and open new positions and reset. When we only move in one direction - as we have for going on for nearly 6 months -its like a spring getting wound tighter and tighter.\n\nThis market is reminding me of the run up in the late 90's. [This is a link to the S&P in 1995](https://imgur.com/a/UUUS4tS). Seems insane, and it was.[ If you zoom out to 2001, in this chart](https://imgur.com/a/KU3yK1i). You can see how much further it ended up going. Even if you bought the top of the '95 rally, you'd be up almost 100% if you held through the crash of the early 2000's.\n\nAre we going to experience a significant correction? Almost certainly.
