If you are just trying to chase the AI wave of investment money I can't really help you. Speculative bets on companies trying to apply AI to their current business are akin to putting money on the roulette table IMO. Or more accurately you're putting some money down on a headline and hoping when the next headline appears someone else will buy your stock for more.\n\nIf you want to invest in the products and applications of AI, the more tangible players are limited right now. I think most companies investing are going to discover that LLMs are more limited in application than they thought. It'll turn out that putting an LLM next to their current business process doesn't just magically make everything faster or more cost effective. IMO its akin to hiring last season's MVP for the NFL and making them a top executive at your company. They are undeniably a top player in their field, but they probably don't know shit about running a major corporation. So you end up spending a ton of money in this exercise to just discover that maybe AI wasn't the right fit for your company's product. This exact same thing happened a few years ago when everyone went nuts over Web 3.0 aka blockchain. It turns out that blockchain is very slow and has a very limited application space. If your product boils down to getting results quickly to a customer on the web, your best bet is still a classic server + database + frontend architecture that we've been iterating on since the 90s.\n\nThere ARE applications though! Microsoft probably has the best application with Copilot currently. I'm unsure if the Office version is any good, haven't used it, but the coding version is very helpful and I'll advocate it at any company I work at from now on. Applications where AI can help \"un-stuck\" you and make you more productive seem like great investments. There's some heated debate in the art community right now over AI-generated images, but I get the impression that AI will win over creatives eventually because it will help them produce more. Productivity boosts seem like great long-term investments. Most of my stock is in Microsoft because they saw the opportunity and the product and they've been putting massive investment into OpenAI.\n\n> The issue is creating the software for actual use of AI and generating cash flow.\n\nYes, but consider that AI software has existed for a long time. The chips took off because they made LLMs more usable. My company has been using Google Vision for over 4 years though, long before any of this current trend took off. LLMs are probably going to be an important milestone but not the only AI application going forward. Small Language Models are beginning to pick up some steam right now. They require small amounts of power and help drive data discovery in sensors. There's probably a big use-case waiting for this type of software that no one has landed on yet.\n\nMeta saying \"we are going to put AI in the metaverse\" is one of the most baloney statements I've ever heard.

{"title": "Selling puts on margin. Tell me why it will not end well.", "selftext": "I have positive experience with the wheel but I want growth with less taxes now, so I want to keep ~100% of my money in ETF and collect credit from selling options. I'm not in a hurry, doing my research to at least think I know what I am doing, especially when it concerns margin which I have not used before.\n\nOne strategy I thought of was the wheel, but more cautious (lower delta) on put side to reduce chance risk of assignmen  and more aggressive on call side, potentially selling stock without call contract in case price bounces back, to pay back margin loan asap and reduce interest payment. The size of all wheels (sum of margin loan and puts assignment costs) is limited to 20% of ETF part of portfolio. Stock choice limited to higher quality to reduce random crash chance.\n\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. Does it make sense? Or does experience show that it is one more strategy which does not beat my own ETF portfolio and just ends up as a loss, requiring me to sell some ETF? Does 20% limit mentioned above look reasonable or I under/over-estimate the risk?\n\n2. Because of margin loan interest would it be better to use stop loss and buy back puts for loss instead of assignment? Maybe use put credit spreads instead?\n\n3. Does \"wheeling\" on margin basically mean selling naked puts, requiring higher options approval levels? If yes, is it one more \"hint\" to use spreads instead?\n\n4. If I use IB margin account for this strategy, do I lose anything if I do not have portfolio margin?  \n\n5.

It's the equivalent of systematically selling covered calls. You can interpret this as realized volatility tends to be lower than implied volatility and the market has positive expected value.\n- Wheeling is a safe strategy if you expect the market to be going up over the long term (assuming you don't blow up in between) -- you will always be long delta. You can get rekt if it chops and you get assigned at unfavorable prices several times in a row. It's not probable but it is possible.\n- Margining options is dangerous if you don't have an exit strategy. Keep in mind liquidity dries up when volatility is high and high volatility is very strongly correlated with market dips (meaning your puts will eat shit from delta, vega, and gamma). Also, liquidity in the options chain is significantly thinner than in the underlying.\n- Circuit breakers do hedge out some of your risk with ETFs, but I wouldn't rely on them to be your stop loss.\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n- You shouldn't be selling directional options if you don't have an opinion on direction AND volatility.
