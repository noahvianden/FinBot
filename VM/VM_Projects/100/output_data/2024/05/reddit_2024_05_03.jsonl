{"title": "Rate cuts, market up. No rate cuts, market up.", "selftext": "Three rate cuts were promised for this year. Market shot up. By now, it\u2019s obvious the three cuts won\u2019t happen this year.\n\nYesterday\u2019s Fed meeting was all about \u201chow many cuts this year\u201d. None were promised. Yet, the narrative pushed by the media was \u201cno rate hikes\u201d, as if that was ever on the table. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nOn the magnificent 7 earnings front: TSLA had the worst earnings in 12 years, missing everything. AMZN lowered guidance. AAPL iPhone sales dropped 10%. But it was all about an empty statement about maybe making cheap cars in 2025, which has no guarantee. And buyback, which was huge by AAPL. And META added a dividend in their last earnings, so forget everything else. All shot up big.\n\nWith inflation remaining steady, and debt reaching ATH, high rates, and layoffs, it feels like a disjointed pump. What are your thoughts?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for your feedback and great discussion!

So when J Pow said higher rates for longer, the market had already priced that in. Seemed like the market was more uncertain whether or not future rate hikes were on the table. So when J Pow confirmed we were at the peak of rate hikes, that was positive for the market. \n\nSecondly, Earnings overall have been just fine from the big tech companies. Yes Apple has declining revenue and IPhone sales are down but that is more an Apple specific problem then a sign of the economy. \n\nEveryone already knew Tesla earnings would be shite, they are a highly interest rate sensitive stock and will continue to struggle until interest rates are cut. \n\nAmazon had great earnings, all their different business segments are growing just fine and they barely guided revenue down, which they will most likely beat. \n\nMeta had the same deal as Amazon and smashed their earnings estimates and barely guided down on revenue. Market overreacted to potential Zuck overspending on AI. \n\nMicrosoft beat their estimates and had perfectly fine guidance.\n\nGoogle absolutely killed their earnings report and smashed all estimates. \n\nI feel like Nvidia will smash earnings as well with all the other Mag 7 companies talking about how much they\u2019re spending in AI.\n\nBottom line, earnings overall have been good.

Roses are widely appreciated for their delicate and pleasant fragrance, which is often associated with cleanliness, freshness, and natural beauty. The description suggests that the Guadi 3 emits a floral aroma that is likely to be soothing and generally well-received in most settings, making it the most universally acceptable choice.\n2. **MI300x**: Ranked second, the MI300x is described as having a smell reminiscent of\u00a0**farts**. While this is certainly not a traditionally pleasant scent, it may be less offensive to some people compared to the smell of rotten eggs. The decision to place it above the H100 is based on the general consensus that, while both are unpleasant, the smell of farts may be considered more tolerable or less intense than the smell of rotten eggs in certain contexts.\n3. **H100**: Placed last in the ranking, the H100 is said to have a\u00a0**rotten egg smell**, which is often caused by hydrogen sulfide, a compound known for its distinctive and highly offensive odor. This type of smell is commonly associated with decay and is generally considered one of the most disagreeable scents. It\u2019s likely to be perceived as more intrusive and unpleasant than the MI300x\u2019s odor, leading to its position at the bottom of the list.\n\nThe ranking is based on the assumption that the intensity and persistence of the odors are similar across all three products. It\u2019s also important to note that these assessments are made based on societal norms regarding scents and the descriptions provided.

I\u2019ll also use round numbers to make the math easy for you regards.\n\nIf $NVDA is at $900 and I think it will close somewhere around there by the end of the day, I can do four basic things. There\u2019s so many other strategies that could be used, but here\u2019s the basics:\n\nBuy a $950 put and sell a $925 put. (A)\nSell a $850 put and buy a $875 put. (B)\n\nBuy an $850 call and sell an $875 call. (C)\nSell an $925 call and buy an $950 call. (D)\n\nAll four of these are called vertical spreads because the options are the same expiration date, same type (call or put), and differ only in the strike price (one above the other, hence the name vertical). Each one has a $25 difference in strike price.\n\nI\u2019ll start with (C) because it\u2019s probably the easiest for crayon eaters to understand.\n\nGenerally you want to buy low and sell high if you\u2019re long a position. Or, conversely sell high and buy low if you\u2019re short.\n\nIf I buy the $850 call that means I\u2019m buying the stock at $850. Obviously that\u2019s a good deal because the stock is already at $900 and I think it will stay there. Since the stock is at $900 and I\u2019m buying it for $850, the intrinsic value of the $850 call is $50. But obviously someone is going to want me to pay them a premium for me getting that kind of a $50 off deal, and that premium gets added on based on a lot of things: how long until the option expires, the volatility of $NVDA, etc. That extra premium is what makes the $850 call cost more than $50.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo to offset that cost, I\u2019m going to sell someone my stock that I bought at $850. I will do this by selling them an $875 call. Just like the $850, the intrinsic value is $25 because whoever buys it from me can buy my stock that I sell them for $875 and sell it at $900. But they\u2019ll have to pay me a premium as well, so I\u2019ll get more than the $25 to just flip the stock. Since I\u2019m selling this option, I will be getting paid. I won\u2019t get paid as much as what I had to spend on the $850 call, but I will at least have something to offset my cost.\n\nThis difference in what I paid and what I get paid is not going to be very much. But, if I\u2019m willing to risk the $25 (that I could potentially lose if $NVDA drops to $850 and my call option becomes worthless), then that means it\u2019s like free cash. I\u2019m buying the stock for $850, selling it for $875 and only have to pay (hypothetically) $24.50 for the deal.\n\nThere is a certain type of person to whom this will appeal. Risking $2,500 to make $50 probably doesn\u2019t sound appealing. But if I\u2019m x% certain that it\u2019s going to close around $900, then I don\u2019t really think about it as \u201crisking $2,500\u201d so much as \u201crisking 100-x% that an event y will happen at time z.\u201d\n\nEither way, this is a debit spread because I\u2019m paying $24.50 for the deal hoping it will be worth $25 by the close.\n\nOn the other hand, with a strategy like (A) I\u2019m buying the higher put and selling the lower, and just collecting the premium difference between the two prices (maybe it\u2019s $0.35). If $NVDA explodes to the upside those puts I bought are going to lose value much faster than the ones I sold, so I could end up having to buy them back for the max difference of $25. But if it doesn\u2019t, then I just get to keep the $0.35 (x100) for selling the spread. This is why this is called a credit spread rather than a debit spread because I\u2019m not paying the $2500 up front (although your broker would almost certainly still hold it in the liability that it did blow up and you lost everything).\n\nThe other two strategies are similar, and which one you deploy depends on the implied volatility pricing that goes into calls vs. puts, which ones are the best deal, and the probability that the stock might actually move up or down away from $900.\n\nThis is an income strategy because it\u2019s not purely dependent on the direction that $NVDA goes in but will be profitable either way; it\u2019s very popular with stocks that are lower volatility because they\u2019re more predictable and don\u2019t move as much, but also you get less premium from it too.\n\nObviously it can go very wrong very fast if you\u2019re risking something like $25,000 to make $500 on a consistent basis, so risk management is key.\n\nSeveral good strategies for this usually begin about 45 days out and then close the position 20 days away from expiry.\n\nIt can also be deployed on a daily basis with SPY 0dte options which lose value very quickly later in the day. Usually you would want to close the position out after a p% gain rather than hold them to the end of the day, but if you don\u2019t get bothered by some of those sharp late day moves then you can hold it for the full premium, but statistically your risk goes up when you do.\n\nTLDR: There is no TLDR.

Lots of news dwell around QQQ every single day. Even world conflicts like breaking news on Israel-Iran will cause QQQ to pump up a lot or dump like crazy. Fed Speeches that happens during market hours could cause QQQ to spike up or dip so much just like Neel Kashkari (apparently he's speaking on Tuesday, 5/7 at 11:30am EST so that's one thing to add to a list of events). \n\nTake advantage of Jpow speeches on FOMC meetings. His next FOMC speech is on June 12. It's always at 2:30pm EST. I made $1.67k from his speech as you could see in my photo, but honestly, that would have been $14k+ if I held on longer while he's speaking. But, I'm used to just taking 20-30% profit and walking away. \n\nA lot of those profit days in the photo could have easily been $1k+, but like I said, I take 20-30% and just stop trading. Using those profits the next day, repeat, repeat, repeat. Today, I just gambled like a moron without thinking properly because of greed. No dramatic news for NVDA to cause it to go up. Lesson costed me 72% of my gains, leaving me with only $1.5k profit besides my account fund. \n\nSo yeah. I take a lot of time reading news and preparing for events. Check the US stock market economic calendar.
