{"title": "Elon Musk backtracks on Supercharger network halt, says more chargers coming", "selftext": "Last week Tesla's CEO fired nearly the entire 500-member Supercharger team. Tesla's partners are demanding answers, with competitors waiting in the wings.\n\nLeave it to Tesla CEO Elon Musk to add more chaos to a situation that he ostensibly created in the first place.\n\nIn a tweet on X early Friday morning, Musk addressed concerns many have had over his recent move to shrink down Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Supercharger team.\n\n\u201cJust to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, Musk also started a \u201cSupercharger Community\u201d on X, where members can discuss and share stories on the topic.\n\nWhether Musk\u2019s proclamation that Tesla is still heavily investing in the Supercharger is accurate or not is another story, but the industry, investors, and EV owners are seeking clarity and demanding answers.\n\nLast week Musk and Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network. In the aftermath of the initial layoffs, Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at \u201ca slower pace\u201d for new locations.\n\nAutomakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network, and incorporate Tesla\u2019s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.\n\nTesla was likely getting an earful from its NACS partners, questioning what they were getting exactly after signing deals to access the Supercharger network.\n\nIn addition, contractors and others working with Tesla on existing Supercharger projects were getting their emails bounced back with no feedback on what to do next. Tesla also apparently backed out of leases at four upcoming Supercharger sites in New York, per EV blog Electrek.\n\nCharging network provider EVgo told Yahoo Finance that it was \u201cactively engaged\u201d in the development of the NACS network and was adding more locations to take advantage of Tesla\u2019s move to backtrack its expansion.\n\nEVgo competitor Blink Charging is also poised to move on the opportunity, claiming potential Supercharger customers contacted Blink about future orders in the wake of Tesla\u2019s move.\n\nEven oil and gas stalwarts like BP are moving in on Tesla. With its BP Pulse charging network, the company said it \u201cis aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s top executive is even telling Tesla\u2019s jilted partners to give him a ring.\n\n\u201cIf there are stranded real estate partners who are looking for someone to call, they should feel free to pick up the phone and call me or look me up on LinkedIn,\u201d BP Pulse Americas CEO Sujay Sharma told Bloomberg.\n\nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-backtracks-on-supercharger-network-halt-says-more-chargers-coming-170947263.html", "id": "1covdpg", "created_utc": 1715362854.0, "score": 376, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "The point isn't whatever Elon's latest decision of the hour is, it is that he has no idea what he is doing, is probably high, and cannot be trusted.\u00a0", "score": 462, "replies": [{"body": "Some folks can become deranged after attaining obscene wealth.
