{"title": "Attempting An Earnings Play Marathon", "selftext": "Have you ever dreamed of taking your small portfolio to over multiple six figures in just one trading week? Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I\u2019m currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. \n\n\nI have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don\u2019t blow up. \n\nThe most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don\u2019t execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder \u201cwhy\u201d you didn\u2019t buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn\u2019t pull the trigger. \n\nI have made peace with the fact that I\u2019m going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them. \n\nEarnings Marathon\nFull Port Every Time - This is a Million Dollar Week!\n\nWeek 1:\nTesla - Calls\nMeta - Puts\nGoogle- Calls\n\nWeek 2:\nMSTR: Puts\nSMCI & AMD: Puts\nCarvana: Calls\nApple: Calls\n\nWeek 3:\nMonday after close / Tuesday before open\nPalantir, Disney: \n\nTuesday after close / Wednesday before open\nArista, Lyft, Uber, Shopify, Affirm, Toyota: \n\nWednesday after close / Thursday before open\nArm, AirB&B, Robinhood, Beyond Meat, Duolingo:\n\nThursday after close / Friday before open\nMara, Soundhound:\n\nThese are the companies reporting this week and i need to decide on Calls / Puts for the closest expiration date.\n\nMy Idea so far is to start with Palantir & Disney and play Calls on both splitting the port 50/50. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, let\u2019s get it!\n\n", "id": "1cjzdbf", "created_utc": 1714826281.0, "score": 179, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 6 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 358 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09712080657482147}, {"body": "Get a second job, loser.", "score": 172, "replies": [{"body": "For clarity, VM is telling you to start moonlighting behind a second dumpster.", "score": 30, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26829251646995544}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10545048862695694}, {"body": "Straight to the point.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13976849615573883}, {"body": "The king has spoken", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.052510712295770645}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17554818093776703}, {"body": "Wait 3 months.
