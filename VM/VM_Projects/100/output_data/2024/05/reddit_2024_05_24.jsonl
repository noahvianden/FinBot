You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1czgr5e", "created_utc": 1716543010.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "Nvidia split can\u2019t come soon enough.

Met coal is a crucial input into the production of steel, and there is no real alternative that can replace it at scale for a few decades (and certainly not during the time horizon I'm targeting).\n\nDisclaimer: Do your own research, coal stocks are risky, not a recommendation.\n\n## HCC Write-Ups\n\n- [January 20th, 2024 comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/19b8xon/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_jan_20_2024/kiyclgz/) on valuation and comparison to AMR\n- [February 24th update on Shanxi + some seasonal updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ayrgpy/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_feb_24_2024/krzk1tg/).\n- [February 26th, 2024 update](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b0edmp/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_feb_26_2024/ks9qtfw/) to valuation from January\n- [March 6th, 2024 commentary on longer term met coal demand](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1b7wi0e/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_mar_06_2024/ktoceo7/)\n- [April 27th, 2024 valuation update](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ceai7b/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_apr_27_2024/l1l3ms8/).\n- [May 4th, 2024 comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cjwedk/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_may_04_2024/l2qga3a/) (On Teck's steelmaking presentation about long term met coal forecasts.

All of them have run up a lot YTD; I'd think there will be a pullback at some point but could certainly go further over time - especially in the most optimistic scenario for AI. \n\nI shared this long letter summarizing the VST case earlier this year on here: https://www.legacyridgecapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LRCM-2023-Letter.pdf  Druckenmiller also owns VST and it is discussed in the most recent fund letter by Third Point.\n\nThird Point on Vistra from the fund's most recent letter (I did bold one part below; I think that's somewhat interesting w/the idea that big tech aggressively trying to secure power could possibly lead to pulling in other industries who suddenly may feel the need to compete) (https://assets.thirdpointlimited.com/f/166217/x/785ef96e1a/third-point-q1-2024-investor-letter_tpil.pdf)\n\nVistra\n\n\nVistra is one of the largest independent power producers (\u201cIPPs\u201d) and retail electricity\nproviders in the country. In 2023, Vistra\u2019s natural gas, nuclear and coal plants generated\nover 20% of electricity consumed in Texas.\nPage 3\n\nUnlike regulated utilities, where profits are determined by capital invested, Vistra operates\nin deregulated markets (primarily ERCOT and PJM), where they generate and sell electricity\nat market prices. Historically, Vistra has been valued at a steep discount to both the\nregulated utility sector and the broader market in part due to the challenging fundamentals\nof merchant power. Stagnant domestic electricity demand combined with an oversupply of\nnatural gas has made US electricity prices among the lowest in the world. Meanwhile,\nsignificant growth in subsidized renewable generation has created major intraday price\nvolatility in Vistra\u2019s core markets, with power prices sometimes going negative during\nperiods of abundant sunshine or wind. Bankruptcies, including Vistra\u2019s former parent\ncompany TXU in 2014, have become commonplace in the sector over the last decade.\nIn response to this challenging environment, we believe Vistra\u2019s capital allocation strategy\nhas been brilliant. The company shut down unprofitable coal plants to improve its carbon\nfootprint and mitigate oversupply. Given the market was valuing its remaining gas assets at\npennies on the dollar relative to the cost of new builds, management patiently invested in\nmaintaining the existing fleet and deployed excess cash flow into share purchases, reducing\nits share count by ~33% from 2018 to 2023 at an average purchase price of about 1/3 of\ncurrent trading levels.\n\nIn March of 2023, Vistra made its latest smart capital allocation move, acquiring the nuclear\ngeneration assets of Energy Harbor (yet another bankrupt IPP), which served as the catalyst\nfor Third Point acquiring shares. The timing of this deal was prescient, as nuclear is finally\nbeing recognized for its merits as the only carbon-free source of 24/7 power generation.\nUnfortunately, onerous regulatory requirements make it very difficult to build nuclear plants\neconomically outside of China. Vistra seems to have channeled Mark Twain and thought:\n\u201cbuy nuclear generation, they\u2019re not making it anymore\u201d.\nAfter our investment, the market started to focus on two trends that we think will have\nprofoundly positive impacts on Vistra\u2019s future value: increased penetration of intermittent\ngeneration (renewables), and an inflection in power demand from AI/data centers and\nelectric vehicles.\n\nPage 4\nWhile increased renewable generation is clearly a positive for reducing CO2 emissions, many\nsupporters of green energy are na\u00efve to the impacts of solar and wind on the reliability of\ngrids (lower) and volatility of electricity prices (higher). Price signals have become so\ndistorted that rather than building new dispatchable (gas) power generation, we are\nshuttering capacity. However, when the wind stops blowing or the sun stops shining, we are\nincreasingly reliant on huge amounts of dispatchable generation to turn on quickly, even\nthough it may have been losing money an hour prior. Counterintuitively, electricity\ngenerated by gas in Texas has grown 30% since 2016 despite a twenty-fold increase in solar\nand a three-fold increase in wind. Texas recently created a $10 billion fund to incentivize\nnew gas generation to strengthen the grid. We believe the only way to incentivize new\ncapacity is to improve the long-term profit outlook for dispatchable gas assets via market\nreforms or other legislation and expect this to benefit those like Vistra who already own\nexisting dispatchable generation.\n\nWe also believe US electricity demand is poised for significant growth for the first time in\ndecades, and Vistra\u2019s fleet of baseload power (both nuclear and natural gas) is uniquely\npositioned to benefit. As the AI arms race commences, McKinsey estimates new data center\nbuild could drive an incremental 800 TWh of global electricity demand by 2030, with 40%\nof this driven by Generative AI1. The US is expected to capture roughly half of this demand,\nas bargain-basement power prices make it the world\u2019s leading destination for new data\ncenters despite higher labor and real estate costs. We expect data centers to drive domestic\ndemand growth to accelerate 1-2% per annum over the next five years against a baseload\nsupply backdrop that continues to decline as coal is phased out. Rising electric vehicle\npenetration is subsequently expected to add an additional 1% to annual growth (Pacific Gas\n& Electric, who serves a region with over 20% EV penetration, highlights that every two new\nEVs is equivalent to a new household in terms of demand).\n\n1McKinsey, March 2024, \u201cImpact of data centers on US energy consumption\u201d\nPage 5\nBecause many data centers require 24/7 power (which cannot easily be provided by\nrenewables) and connection timelines for utility grids exceed three years in some cases,\nhyperscalers have shown growing interest in contracting directly with nuclear plants behind\nthe meter to ensure speedy, consistent access to electricity. **For example, Amazon recently\nsigned a 20-year agreement with nuclear operator Talen to buy power at a ~60% premium\nto market prices. Despite this premium, nuclear remains by far the cheapest direct source\nof clean energy for a hyperscaler; the estimated levelized cost of electricity for a renewables\nsystem fit to provide 24/7 power is an eyewatering $200 per MWh, roughly triple what\nAmazon will pay Talen2.**\n\nVistra is in the pole position to capitalize on these trends, and we expect the discount applied\nto their assets to continue to narrow as their business becomes increasingly essential to\nserving domestic power demand.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09006159752607346}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.036437392234802246}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I've been doubting to make a move into Oklo as well.\nBut the fact that they don't have anything yet, leaves me in doubt.\n\nCompetition is growing, and a lot is dependent on politics as well. \n\nFrom their own statement \"Oklo is pursuing an emerging market, with no commercial project operating, regulatory uncertainties; the potential need for financing\u00a0.\"\n\nSo I dno, I expect volatility.

This method of assembly is incompatible with Tesla's current production lines.  NGV is assembled in modules before final assembly, whereas Tesla's current vehicles are mostly unibody frames where items are continually added along a linear assembly line.\n\nTesla's Q1 '24 investor slide deck states on page 10:\n\n* *\"new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.\"*\n\nThis means use of the current megacasting architecture with stamped sides, and assembly along a linear line.  A vehicle designed around an unboxed process cannot be built on these existing lines.\n\n* Most likely, Tesla will be able to backport things like 48V electrical system, steer-by-wire, and the new \"0 Rare Earth\" motor, which were originally supposed to be in the NV91 product.\n\nTesla does not have time to develop and validate an entirely new non-NV91 vehicle ahead of the mid-2025 launch date for new products.

If a baby is in the 5th percentile (again, as an individual), then they are heavier than only 5 out of 100 babies. The same can be applied to IQ.

It took one missed quarter after the Bitcoin crash and large oversupply of gpus due to miners selling on eBay to send it -70% in weeks in 2018. This is not a threat anymore due to the fact it is a datacenter company nowadays and gaming segment is actually constantly declining. \n\nAnyways, Bought that fall and rode it into 2020 and got out before the last top which was pretty much based on supply chain issues that time around with TSMC. That crash was saved by the AI hype. Literally. But next crash has nothing new to hype. So the next one when the demand of datacenters have peaked and nvidia fundamentally plateau in demand vs supply constraints that\u2019s the one I am pondering. People can\u2019t seriously believe that these past quarters constitutes forward growth? It\u2019s a demand shock initially around the datacenters to finally make nvidia a big corp. But what people expect now is revenues in the trillions. Not even Walmart is close after peaking at 600B revenues. \n\nThe thing also is that TSMC is bipolar about their ability to supply chips and the supply chains were so weak in the pandemic, And TSMC is under constant threat of a Chinese invasion. \n\nPeople always mistake past events for future prophecy. \n\nThe demand is real but the growth is never forever!\n\nRight now the intrinsic value is about 750B and I totally agree with that. That\u2019s exactly what I few years ago expected it to become at this point when it was worth around 500B.\n\nAnyways the valuation is outlandish and fanboys with zero insight into nvidia has taken a great company to an extreme valuation with considerable threats to said valuation. Every single huge drop in nvidia has come on very small hurdles so it will be very interesting to see what pops it this time.\n\nMy own thesis is that nvidia will mature into more like the aeronautics sector is with huge backlogs.
