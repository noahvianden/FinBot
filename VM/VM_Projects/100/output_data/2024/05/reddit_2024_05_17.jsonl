You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1cu117s", "created_utc": 1715938209.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "Very impressed with the recent rally in $UI. +37% in the last month. (My cost basis is 116) The worst is over in the entire sector it looks like. Last quarter all its peers reported yet another QoQ sequential decline in sales, while UI posted 6% QoQ growth.\n\n---\n\nAlso, as I may have mentioned before, I track my portfolio (retirement + non-retirement) pretty closely, and simulate investing in the S&P 500 or QQQ for example (at the exact dates that I deposited funds). It's interesting because now I can quantify how much diversification (and active management of stocks) is costing (or helping) me in the short run. My portfolio is 30% ex-US indices and so long as those trail US markets, it will be very difficult for my relatively small individual weighted stocks to lift me above the S&P 500. I have roughly 30% of my portfolio in individual stocks last I checked. My Roth has a fairly big amount in a Target Retirement Date Fund (which is like 90% VT, 10% bonds, adding another hit).\n\nI'm taking a one-time difference (not annualized):\n\n- 2.8% penalty relative to the S&P 500 (total return) since inception. \n- 1.6% penalty for the NASDAQ (just price return though, so let's just call it 2.5% to account for dividends--my portfolio was much smaller initially so those early dividends hardly affect much). \n- 2.1% gain relative to 80% VTI / 20% VXUS (but again no dividends, so let's just say I'm beating it by 1%). \n- 5.4% gain relative to VT (no dividends)\n\nIs it worth it? I'm basically losing out on a one-time amount of about $2-3K (or one month of contributions) since inception in 2021 by not just doing 100% VOO, and in return my portfolio is diversified across the world and tilting smaller cap value stocks (which reduce overall correlation to S&P 500). I still think it is worth it. I was worried the cost would be much worse.  If I just went all in on VT (0 work), my current portfolio would be doing better by $6-7K (after accounting for dividends). VT would be a $9K penalty relative to S&P 500. That would probably have bothered me a lot more...

This is around the time that Elon was saying Tesla could drive a car all the way across the country internally right now. Many times he has said: we can do this right now, we're doing this right now, we have fleets of semis driving in convoys right now (nope), we will roll out updates soon, we're the best battery company in the world (nope), we will be able to dry-print anodes and cathodes (nope), we can cheaply produce cars with injection molding and this is the future (nope), the $40k uber-range Cybertruck will save on costs because it will be an exoskeleton, not a frame (nope)... etc. \n\nAround this time, Tesla was riding a high, Elon hit the valuation target bonus that gave him another huge stake of shares (around $52 billion worth at today's reduced TSLA valuation). Around this time, he announced he was buying Twitter at time when he already had a consent agreement with the government regarding his statements on Twitter for the Tesla private 420 Tweet. Elon said that his lawyers made him sell Tesla to buy Twitter because of his own consent-decree-bound Tweet. When Elon hit his target, he was repeating the statement that he was the first in to Tesla stock and he knew he would be the last out. Elon knew the implications of his buying Twitter tweet before he made it. \n\nI see it as a cynical pump-and-dump scheme with very weak plausible deniability. It's like when the CFO of Enron (now living in the middle of a giant Colorado ranch estate) got to keep his money (when all the other execs had their money clawed back) when he sold at the peak because he flaunted an affair with a stripper to his wife and a judge forced him to sell his Enron stock in the divorce. \n\nNow Elon is laying off divisions and saving far less money than Tesla will lose if shareholders vote to give Elon $50 billion. Elon's interests have shifted to AI, and he wants his companies to be private now that he has gotten in so much trouble with his statements about public companies. He did a good job at being the first to move an LLM to ASICs with Grok/global foundries and I think Elon's focus is squarely on AI now, which will continue to improve self-driving, but maybe not on the older hardware of model 3's, which is why he knows he is in trouble. He could easily be kicked out as a Tesla CEO eventually, to be CEO right now he had to make a voluntary consent decree, so he doesn't have the same rights and options of a normal citizen who hasn't entered into a binding legal agreement with the government in a bid to avoid prosecution. \n\nBut, there's certainly a point at which Tesla is a good buy. I would be tempted to buy if it dropped on Elon's departure on the hope that they could win back all the bitter talent they lost to competitors.  But right now Tesla has a high-growth valuation when growth is decreasing, so you need a potentially long duration before Tesla's FSD becomes real and successful. But, bigger is better for neural networks and I think Tesla will need new GPU/ASIC hardware to dramatically improve FSD.

I will probably be jumping back into it again on Monday depending on what I see, I had a lot of success with it in 2023 in a similar situation. I haven't seen anyone give this strategy a name before, but I usually refer to it as a long DTE \"diagonal strangle\". It is a very advanced strategy and definitely not for beginners, it requires active management.\n\nIt also requires being able to read the market's price action fairly well. It's a two part strategy and the first part is simple enough, but the second part requires some finesse and discretion. You need to be able to see on a chart when the market is very clearly stuck in a range.\n\nPART 1: \n\nI buy a long DTE (usually 120DTE) ITM call and ITM put on SPY or QQQ. The strikes are equidistant from ATM in an effort to not put on any specific directional bias. Without looking at where 80 delta lies on SPY right now, imagine buying a 120 DTE 500C and a 120 DTE 560P.\n\nIf the market goes up, the position doesn't really lose too much. It may lose a bit if volatility continues to fall. But with the VIX being historically low, there's a good chance volatility will rise at some point (i.e. I could see it happening during the debates/election). It will lose value over time due to theta, however, and that is where part 2 of this strategy makes up for things.\n\nIf the market goes down, volatility generally always goes up, and the position comes into a profit on its own without having to enact part 2. Close it out for a profit when it looks like VIX has peaked and you see buyers starting to return. You are capturing the increase in IV. Your put will be deep in profit and your call will be a loss. If you did things right, the put's profit will always be worth more than the call's loss.\n\nIf the VIX hasn't moved in 30 days since opening the position, I roll the position out. I close out the current one (which now has 90 DTE) and open a new one at 120 DTE.\n\nI do this because 90 DTE is around the time period where the theta curve on options begins to accelerate. It's relatively flat from 120-90 DTE, starts to accelerate from 90-60DTE, and after 60 DTE theta really begins to kick in.\n\nPART 2:\n\nSell low DTE (very low, like 1-2DTE) short strangles *against y*our existing long position. Effectively turning it into a \"diagonal strangle\" of sorts. You sell a call against your already ITM call, and you sell a put against your already ITM put. \n\nI do this on days where the market is very choppy (range bound), and QQQ/SPY hover around 0%. \n\nUsually I would sell the strangle at EOD (again, 1-2DTE), and would be looking to close it the *following morning* after an hour or two past market open. \n\nI avoid doing this on Fed days or days where important premarket data is getting dropped (CPI, PPI, etc.) and I avoid doing it on days where there is going to be market moving earnings news (e.g. JPM, WMT, NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG etc.). In other words, nothing major should be going on. You need to keep tabs on the market calendar to know what events are on the horizon and you need to know which earnings reports statistically move the entire market more than others.\n\nThe idea here is that you try to capture huge time decay overnight on days where there's less market moving news for a profit.\n\nIf the market doesn't move much by the next day like an hour or two past market open - you can usually capture around a 30% profit. You continue this process - capture 30% profit, wait until EOD again, if price is still range bound, sell the next short strangle. Repeat as long as all conditions are met: market is range bound, no big news/earnings the next day, etc.\n\nThe tricky thing is there isn't a set delta where it makes the most sense to do this - and you instead need to read the market's price action and see what range of prices it's been stuck trading inside of to make that assessment. Sometimes you'll sell a 20 delta strangle when it's stuck in a tight range, some days you'll probably need to sell 10-15 delta for a wider range.\n\nIf SPY/QQQ goes against you on the short strangle the next morning and tests one of your legs, close it out for a loss. Don't roll. When the market breaks out of a range it will continue until it reaches the next range. Wait until it hits the next range when it's stuck at an impasse (usually trading around 0% for extended periods of time), then sell the next short strangle at EOD.\n\nThis strategy requires a lot of management, but I had great success with it back in 2023 with good returns on SPY.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "thats awesome.   Thanks for sharing.   I like your strategy.   Its interesting.\n\nFor whats its worth,  I like to keep things relatively simple.  So hear me out what has worked for me so far.\n\nBuy at moment with low IV long put \n\nI think long put 300 days out was only 1300 or something.  Stay patient a bit and wait for IV to spike.   As soon as it spikes, start selling 10 to 15 days puts around 510 strike or 515.  The trick is keep managing the strikes while collecting enough premiums and staying OTM on puts you are selling.  Ideally keep selling the 500 strike since you have a hedge at 500.\n\nThere are so many ways this strategy can go but the trick is keep selling the puts until the protection of the long put expires worthless.   \n\nSo i have paid off my QQQ hedge in 2 months I think and I have about 153 days left in the hedge and plenty of times to sell more puts on QQQ\n\nON Spy,  the first time it worked flawlessly since the hedge I bought was in low IV environment.  The second time was not and I overpaid for the hedge.  Granted,  Im catching up on selling enough premium to pay off for the hedge.  \n\nSo the trick to this strategy is buy the hedge in low IV enviroment.   Wait until IV spikes and then start selling premiums.   Cant be done at same time, I think or at least Buy the hedge first in low IV and collect small premiums while waiting for IV to spike.\n\nWorking like a charm so far.  As soon as Im done paying off the hedge,  I will start opening more positions.   Think of it like a Bank collecting premiums with a collar matching exact same strike of premium you are selling.  you are 100% protected.    Hope this makes sense.    When the hedge of the Bank is paid off,  I will open a new Bank with a hedge", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6753626465797424}], "tickers": ["vix", "jpm", "nvda", "msft", "wmt", "aapl", "cpi"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33219489455223083}, {"body": "Zebras don\u2019t change their stripes overnight.
