{"title": "Target's earnings miss, sales fall as consumers buy fewer groceries and home goods ", "selftext": "Target on Wednesday posted a year-over-year sales decline and missed Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates, as consumers fatigued from high prices bought both fewer discretionary items and groceries. \n\nThe Minneapolis-based discounter\u2019s revenue was about in line with expectations. On a call with reporters, CEO Brian Cornell said the company\u2019s results reflect \u201ccontinued soft trends in discretionary categories.\u201d\n\nHe said the company wants to make sure it offers customers value and communicates that in a clear way, with moves like its relaunched loyalty program. Target also announced Monday it was cutting prices on thousands of everyday items, including milk, bread, paper towels and diapers.\n\nTarget stuck with its prior full-year forecast, saying it expects comparable sales will range from flat to up 2% and adjusted earnings per share will be $8.60 to $9.60. \n\nHere\u2019s what Target reported for the three-month period that ended May 4 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.03 vs. $2.06 expected\n\nRevenue: $24.53 billion vs. $24.52 billion expected\n\nIt marked the first time since November 2022 that Target missed earnings expectations. \n\nTarget\u2019s net income for the period fell by less than 1% to $942 million, or $2.03 per share, from $950 million, or $2.05 per share, in the year-ago quarter. \n\nTotal revenue declined about 3% from $25.32 billion in the prior year.\n\nLike other retailers, Target has tried to win over consumers who are not spending as freely on clothing, home goods or other discretionary items. The cheap chic retailer has been particularly hurt by the dynamic because it gets less of its sales from food than rival Walmart, which draws about 60% of its U.S. sales from groceries. That compares to roughly 20% at Target.\n\nInflation cooled slightly in April, but the consumer price index was still up 3.4% on a year-over-year basis. The key measure gauges how much goods and services cost at the cash register.\n\nTarget acknowledged that challenge with this week\u2019s price cuts. \n\nThe company is also competing with other discounters, including Walmart, Aldi and Lidl, that are chasing deal-hunting shoppers.\n\nWalmart, for example, has gained market share from higher-income shoppers and recently introduced a premium food brand with most items under $5. The company\u2019s CFO John David Rainey also said last week that customers are turning to its grocery aisles for cheaper meals because of the rising prices of fast food.\n\nTarget\u2019s sales challenges\n\nIn Target\u2019s first quarter, customer traffic, which includes online and stores, fell 1.9%. The average amount that customers spent on those visits dropped 1.9%, too.\n\nDigital sales grew 1.4%. It marked the first increase in digital sales in more than a year.\n\nComparable sales, also called same-store sales, tumbled 3.7%, as shoppers bought beauty items but less of other discretionary categories like apparel and home. That decline was in line with what analysts expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\nDiscretionary merchandise wasn\u2019t the only part of the store under pressure. Sales in frequency categories, food and beverage and beauty and household essentials, declined by low-single digits, Chief Growth Officer Christina Hennington said on a call with reporters.\n\nStill, Hennington said Target is seeing some encouraging trends compared to recent quarters. Sales of apparel improved by nearly 4 percentage points from the fiscal fourth quarter, as customers bought outfits for spring.\n\nShe said Target\u2019s limited-time collection with Diane Von Furstenberg drove millions of unique visits to the retailer\u2019s website each day of the launch week and lifted the size of customers\u2019 baskets by around 15% on average.\n\nOther unique items also drove spending, she said. They included its partnership with tennis and lifestyle brand Prince to sell pickleball gear and Taylor Swift\u2019s latest album, which Target capitalized on with in-store events and photo ops.\n\nShares of Target closed Tuesday at $155.78, bringing its market value to $72.07 billion. As of Tuesday\u2019s close, shares of Target are up about 9% so far this year, lagging the S&P 500\u2032s nearly 12% gains.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/target-tgt-q1-2024-earnings.html", "id": "1cxx28c", "created_utc": 1716374054.0, "score": 309, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "And this my friends is how inflation goes down", "score": 391, "replies": [{"body": "It's true.

{"title": "Amazon plans to give Alexa an AI overhaul \u2014 and a monthly subscription price ", "selftext": "Amazon is upgrading its decade-old Alexa voice assistant with generative artificial intelligence and plans to charge a monthly subscription fee to offset the cost of the technology, according to people with knowledge of Amazon\u2019s plans. \n\nThe Seattle-based tech and retail giant will launch a more conversational version of Alexa later this year, potentially positioning it to better compete with new generative AI-powered chatbots from companies including Google and OpenAI, according to two sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Amazon\u2019s subscription for Alexa will not be included in the $139 per year Prime offering, and Amazon has not yet nailed down the price point, one source said.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on its plans for Alexa. \n\nWhile Amazon wowed consumers with Alexa\u2019s voice-driven tasks in 2014, its capabilities could seem old-fashioned amid recent leaps in artificial intelligence. Last week, OpenAI announced GPT-4o, with the capability for two-way conversations that can go significantly deeper than Alexa. For example, it can translate conversations into different languages in real time. Google launched a similar generative-AI-powered voice feature for Gemini. \n\nSome interpreted last week\u2019s announcements as a threat to Alexa and Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant feature for iPhones. NYU professor Scott Galloway called the updates the \u201cAlexa and Siri killers\u201d on his recent podcast. Many people use Alexa and Siri for basic tasks, such as setting timers or alarms and announcing the weather.\n\nThe development of new AI chatbots in recent months has increased the pressure internally on a division that was once seen as a darling of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the sources \u2014 but has been subject to strict profit imperatives since his departure. \n\nThree former employees pointed to Bezos\u2019 early obsession with Alexa, describing it as the Amazon founder\u2019s passion project. Attention from Bezos resulted in more dollars and less pressure to make a return on those dollars immediately.\n\nThat changed when Andy Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, according to three sources. Jassy was charged with right-sizing Amazon\u2019s business during the pandemic, and Alexa became less of a priority internally, they said. Jassy has been privately underwhelmed with what modern-day Alexa is capable of, according to one person. The Alexa team worried they had invented an expensive alarm clock, weather machine and way to play Spotify music, one source said.  \n\nFor instance, Jassy, an avid sports fan, asked the voice-assistant the live score of a recent game, according to a person in the room, and was openly frustrated that Alexa didn\u2019t know an answer that was so easy to find online. \n\nWhen reached for comment, Amazon pointed to the company\u2019s annual shareholder letter released last month. In it, Jassy mentioned that the company was building a \u201csubstantial number of GenAI applications across every Amazon consumer business,\u201d adding that that included \u201can even more intelligent and capable Alexa.\u201d\n\nThe team is now tasked with turning Alexa into a relevant device that holds up amid the new AI competition, and one that justifies the resources and headcount Amazon has dedicated to it. It has undergone a massive reorganization, with much of the team shifting to the artificial general intelligence, or AGI, team, according to three sources. Others pointed to bloat within Alexa, a team of thousands of employees.\n\nAs of 2023, Amazon said it had sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices, giving the company a foothold with consumers. \n\nAlexa, were you too early?\n\nApple, Amazon and Google were early movers with their voice assistants, which did employ AI. But the current wave of advanced generative AI enables much more creative, human-sounding interactions. Apple is expected to unveil a more conversational Siri at its annual developers conference in June, according to the New York Times. \n\nThose who worked on the Alexa team describe it as a great idea that may have been too early, and that it\u2019s going to be hard to turn the ship around. \n\nThere\u2019s also the challenge of finding AI engineering talent, as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google recruit from the same pool of academics and tech talent. Plus, generative AI workloads are expensive thanks to the hardware and computing power required. One source estimated the cost of using generative AI in Alexa at 2 cents per query, and said a $20 price point was floated internally. Another suggested it would need to be in a single digit dollar amount, which would undercut other subscription offerings. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT charges $20 per month for its advanced models. \n\nStill, they point to Alexa\u2019s installed user base, with devices in hundreds of millions of homes, as an opportunity. Those who worked on Alexa say the fact that it\u2019s already in people\u2019s living rooms and kitchens makes the stakes higher, and mistakes more costly if Alexa doesn\u2019t understand a command or provides unreliable information. \n\nAmazon has been battling a perception that it\u2019s behind in artificial intelligence. While it offers multiple AI models on AWS, it does not have a leading large language model to unseat OpenAI, Google or Meta. Amazon spent $2.75 billion backing AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment in the company\u2019s three-decade history. Google also has an Anthropic investment and partnership.\n\nAmazon will use its own large language model, Titan, in the Alexa upgrade, according to a source.  \n\nBezos is among those who have voiced concern that Amazon is behind in AI, according to two sources familiar with him. Bezos is still \u201cvery involved\u201d in Amazon\u2019s AI efforts, CNBC reported last week, and has been sending Amazon executives emails wondering why certain AI startups are picking other cloud providers over AWS. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/amazon-plans-to-give-alexa-an-ai-overhaul-monthly-subscription-price.html", "id": "1cxzyrt", "created_utc": 1716383717.0, "score": 172, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "I would never pay even $1/mo for Alexa.", "score": 332, "replies": [{"body": "I wouldn't even have Alexa if they paid me.

NVDA margins are so high that almost any solution that is not NVDA is going to be a better deal. \nIt\u2019s also reasonable to think that big players like AAPL and GOOG want a piece of this cake too. It might take some time but they are for sure going to build chips for their needs. \n\nApple chips are not made for server but there was news that they are building racks of [M2 Ultra for LLM inference](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/). \n\nFor me, all signs are there to show NVDA is about to feel some pressure for those far margins. \n\nPosition: sold NVDA calls (c990 May 24), break even: NVDA $1015\n", "id": "1cxtq8n", "created_utc": 1716359679.0, "score": 101, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 165 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09847458451986313}, {"body": "you're risking $7M to make $185k?", "score": 89, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s a possibility but I doubt right after I\u2019m assigned NVDA will double.
