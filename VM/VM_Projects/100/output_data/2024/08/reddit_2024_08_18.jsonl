Early on in trading options I made some really great buys.  The problem was when it came time to sell the price looked good but I was seeing the mark between a wide bid ask spread.  In reality I would have to sell for less than the mark, if I even could.  Suddenly those buys weren't so great.  I lost a few grand early on this way.  Ever since, my #1 rule before considering trading an option is volume.  If it has low volume / wide spread I don't even bother looking any closer.  I have only traded SPY & QQQ ever since & am very happy.

One finds the most volatile stocks and recommends day trades before fluctuations of more than 50% occur in price in some stocks. Examples that were caught early were FFIE, ZAPP, and SERV (not ASTS unfortunately), while the other recommends trades at earnings call for a stock. Both algorithms, especially the earnings one, utilize multiple indicators and data points (including IV, option volume and others) to predict movements which people can use to their advantage while choosing contracts that expire the soonest. I managed to put together a community of 300 within a week. Even after much trial and error, I have only lost ~30 people to date.

{"title": "Bicycle Therapeutics (BCYC) is a tenbagger", "selftext": "**Introduction:**  \nBicycle Therapeutics is a UK-based pharma company working on precision-guided therapeutics that penetrate deep into tissues and target cancer cells. The company is currently valued at $1.55 billion and has a few drugs in the pipeline, that said we will only focus on \"BT8009\" also known as \"Zelenectide pevedotin\" because this is the crucial one.  \nPipeline: [https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/pipeline/pipeline/](https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/pipeline/pipeline/)  \nThe company has a strong balance sheet with $918m net cash if we subtract the debt.\n\n**Zelenectide Pevedotin formerly known as BT8009:**  \nThe drug is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) currently in phase 2/3. It targets the nektin-4 molecule that is overexpressed in cancer cells. The drug enters the cancer cell, binds to nektin-4 and releases the toxin that then kills the cell.\n\nThe company Seagen (now owned by Pfizer) developed the first ADC that made it to market called  \"Padcev\". Padcev made them almost $400m last quarter, this means this one drug will make them about $1.2 billion a year, which translates to $900m in net profits assuming a 75% profit margin.  \nIn a press release posted in May 2024 ( [https://investors.bicycletherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bicycle-therapeutics-present-pharmacokinetic-and-safety](https://investors.bicycletherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bicycle-therapeutics-present-pharmacokinetic-and-safety) ) Bicycle Therapeutics releases some study results that show that BT8009 is better than Padcev in many ways. This means that if this drug gets to market it will be able to directly compete with Padcev and any other cancer drug of this type.\n\n**The risk/reward:**  \nThe obvious risk is that there are some unknown sideeffects that come to light and the drug does not get approved and the stock tanks -60% in one day. The current failure rate of phase 3 cancer drugs is around 50%.  \nIf the drug gets approved the company is probably worth $15 billion or more, that translates to a $200+ share price.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEssentially its a coinflip: 50% chance i lose 60% of my investment or 50% chance i make 10 times my money. Thats a bet I take all day.\n\n*Disclosure: I am personally long the stock, my cost basis is around $22 per share.*", "id": "1ev29in", "created_utc": 1723960780.0, "score": 179, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04802499711513519}, {"body": "Someone just tell me when they test the drugs or whatever so I know what date to buy my calls for", "score": 227, "replies": [{"body": "The company will release results in 9-12 months if everything goes according to plan.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Morgan Freeman Narrator: \u00a0But of course it wouldn\u2019t go according to plan at all.", "score": 283, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05899115651845932}, {"body": "right on", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07385008782148361}, {"body": "\ud83e\udd23", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.011513307690620422}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.025894375517964363}, {"body": "Theta gang coming for u", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05671904236078262}, {"body": "Any update?
