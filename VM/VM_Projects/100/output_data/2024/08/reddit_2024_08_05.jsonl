{"title": "Monday.", "selftext": "Just made the title as simple as that because I don't want to generate hysteria for nobody.\n\nAnd to start off, I'm just clarifying I'm no specialist or veteran, I just want to engage some discussions.\n\nI wanna discuss about the impact of latest news and what might be in front of us for this week. I crave for more grounded, logical opinions rather than euphorical opinions from people who expect to multiply their holdings by xxxx for investing in NVDA, but this sub is about NVDA stock, and of course it is strongly biased.\n\nRealistically, we're likely going down on Monday, right?\n\nOf course we can't actually predict it. But, in the last few days, we have seen tons of discussions about the delay. Be it a rumour or real, it leads to concerns and affects people's sentiment. No official note from NVDA denying or clarifying it doesn't help as well.\n\nMany consider it's already priced in because some insiders likely knew about it and sold, but the only thing I can think is \"how?\". How could it be possibly already priced in when these news have only reached most ppl during the weekend. Most people only got to know about it on Friday and Saturday. If we add that to all the volatility and news that have been negatively affecting the whole market, it seems logical to me that we're gonna likely see a lot of sell offs, because it all induced lots of fear in people. It doesn't matter if you have faith in NVDA's future, a lot of ppl are very volatile and easily panic selling.\n\nNow, you might consider that it's a good thing if they panic sell because it means sale day for you, but I feel like if the selloffs are strong, we might finally cross that $100 line, and that might lead us even lower, to the mid-low $90s.\n\nAnyways, I'm no specialist and no stock market veteran, I'm just sharing my thoughts and would like to hear more logical opinions, not hopium, not copium and not people that can swear NVDA is going back to $60 by tomorrow. I would like to hear if I missed something, or if my thoughts are not going quite in the right direction. Specially because in another discussion, someone pointed out something I hadn't realized until then, which is: since I don't live in US, and actually live in a very underdeveloped country, it's considerably harder for me to measure people's sentiment as someone who's fairly new to stock market, and it's not something being talked nearly as much here.\n\nI just want to learn more, so I also don't mind the likely rain of downvotes this post might get because it goes against some ppl's expectations and opinions.", "id": "1ekcu8h", "created_utc": 1722825165.0, "score": 87, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "I have no thoughts on this but I just want to say we need more posts like this.

IE, traders are selling dollars to buy yen, that was their free carry trade we always knew would blow out, at some point.  Now other currencies that traders were short are strengthening and that will make people buy those foreign currencies and sell the dollar.  Why does this matter?  because a bunch of idiot hedge fund wanna be tv starts leveraged the yen trade to buy tech, mainly the mag 7.  They will have to sell it.

You only have to pay back $101,000 in Yen, but also the Yen has gone down 20% in value, meaning you only have to pay back $80,000 (in Yen). And people keep on adding for YEARS to these loans because it\u2019s getting cheaper and cheaper and free profits. \n\nNot to mention they are also using SOOO MUCH margin. So imagine this, they secure the 100k loan and get a 200k position, 100k margin in Nvidia.\n\nBut wait\u2026 Japan decides to raise rates which increases the value of the Yen while everyone else is cutting rates (or about to) which decreases the value of *said currency*\n\nSo Yen \ud83d\udcc8 everyone else \ud83d\udcc9, this makes paying off loans even more difficult and this doesn\u2019t include the margin call. \n\nSo now you have a 200k margin position on Nvidia, Nvidia is down 20%, so you\u2019re down $40,000, on your position and get margin called. (More selling pressure) \n\nNow you have to pay back an extra $40,000. Meaning your $100k of equity is now $60,000, and now bank of Japan is margin calling you because you only have 60k of the 100k owed, but also the Yen is up 10%, so you really owe 110,000 of Yen.\n\nThis is a super small example\u2026 it\u2019s not 100,000, people think it\u2019s 10trillion\u2026", "score": 241, "replies": [{"body": "What a great example", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04784480109810829}, {"body": "Great explanation !", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08708162605762482}, {"body": "^^^THIS.

{"title": "Crash Incoming.", "selftext": "I would love to share my findings on the indication of a probable yet most likely not as soon as expected, crash. I have looked at historical data, interests rates globally, and the VIX.\n\nThroughout history, mostly in the U.S a high peak in interests rates, ultimately conspire to a massive drop which is followed by a recession. You can see that in the charts. Please note that those crashes were not mainly caused by the spike of the rates, but it was also coupled by a somewhat of a black swan event. E.x 2019 spike in interest rates followed up by Covid. Or 2007 peak of interest followed by the housing crash after a cut in 2008-2009.\n\nThat alone isn't going to justify a crash. Japan has raised rates which if you follow the Japanese market that DOES NOT happen often. Most memorable moments where Japan raises interest and the U.S cuts is back in 2008 (housing crash). In addition, England has also cut rates which has not happened since Covid 2020...\n\n2024's Black Swan could very much be the A.I \"bubble\" or a potential War, which I'll get to later on.\n\n10% of the U.S stock market engages in a technique called the \"carry trade\". Which is a form of arbitrage where you take a loan out of a country that offers extremely low rates, in this case it was Japan's yen BEFORE the raise. Then you take an equivalent to lets say $1000 of yen and put it in either a safe yield/bond or the stock market. People started doing that much more with speculations of a rate cut happening in September (U.S FEDS).... which did not happen.\n\nInstead, Japan raised it's rates and the stock market crashed due to poor labor U.S data, taking us away from a confident cut, to a not so confident one anymore. Please keep in mind the $1000 that was taken from Japan most likely was not just invested as the prime amount, but more of on average $2000 due to leverage trading. A standard 1:2 is common and therefore people who have lost the initial $1000 (50% loss) most likely are now in debt to the raising interest to Bank of Japan. Hence the outstanding bear charts of the top 2 banks in Japan. Accumulating to a total today of a 20% loss in the stock market.\n\nThis would lead to tons of people to declare bankruptcy and sell off massively causing a crash (which it did on Friday)\n\nAnd no Japan can't just start printing money because their GDP to Debt ratio is at 260%, 9 Trillion Dollars...\n\nEconomics aside, the pressure and uncertainty of a potential war with I.S and Iran is on the table increasing uncertainty.\n\nWith all this in hand, it is hard when to predict a global crash, even though almost $3 trillion dollars were wiped out...\n\n[U.S Interest to Recession Charts](https://preview.redd.it/etw16xsfotgd1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d4f18313b0117adb97aa0273524180a317a9da3)\n\nThere's more images I want to add but can't...", "id": "1ekkelk", "created_utc": 1722853702.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 7 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 weeks | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02593732252717018}, {"body": "Good work, Sherlock.
