{"title": "r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Fundamentals Friday Aug 09, 2024", "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1enve7d", "created_utc": 1723195809.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Congratulations!!!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Wish WE could have Something Like an IRA in Germany.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Take the free healthcare man.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "True that.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0842408835887909}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22953353822231293}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.06344909965991974}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.023291202262043953}, {"body": "Those are good returns, typical Voo, vti, etc?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02813701331615448}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03652966022491455}, {"body": "Who the hell just bought a bunch of INTEL stock at 39.82 a share????\n\nOuch!!!", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "The dude that inherited the 700K didn't get the lesson !", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "He is doing inverse dollar cost averaging where you pay more than fair value over time.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2393091917037964}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29980534315109253}, {"body": "Bad trades, I'll guess:\n\n17:06:49\t$37.6547\t620    +  17:06:20\t$29.2843\t450", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39260193705558777}], "tickers": ["intc"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[Gotta love these TSM monthly revenue updates.](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024)\n\n\nI bet we see 3-handles by EoY.
