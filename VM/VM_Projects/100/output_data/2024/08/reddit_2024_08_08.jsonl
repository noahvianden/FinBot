The chart of META stock is being used to illustrate the point.\nThe chart shows the move up in META stock on earnings.\nThe chart shows that as of this writing, the stock is trading above the top band of the support/resistance zone.\nRSI on the chart shows that there is more room for the stock to run.\nThe resistance zone shown on the chart shows that if the stock runs from here, there is not far to go before selling may come in.\nCan companies monetize large capital expenditures on AI? This has been a key question for investors.\nMETA shows that it is successfully monetizing AI.\nMicrosoft Corp \nMSFT\n and Alphabet Inc Class C \nGOOG\n earnings showed that they are having difficulty monetizing AI.\nAmazon.com, Inc. \nAMZN\n and Apple Inc \nAAPL\n will report earnings after the close. Prudent investors should carefully watch and see if Amazon and Apple are able to monetize AI.\nAs a result of being able to successfully monetize AI, META reported strong earnings.  Here are the key points:\nEarnings were better than the consensus and whisper numbers.  Stocks move based on the difference between whisper numbers and the reported numbers. Whisper numbers are the numbers that analysts privately share with their best clients.  Whisper numbers are often different from the publicly available numbers published by the same analysts.\nRevenues were up 22%.\nEarnings were up 73%.\nMeta is angling to make Meta AI the most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\nNew AI based tools increased return on investment on advertisements by 22%.\nMeta is planning to spend $37B \u2013 $40B in capital expenditure this year vs. $35B \u2013 $40B prior.\nA capital spend of $37B means Meta is spending about 23% of its revenues on capital spend, most of which is on AI.\nAs full disclosure, META is in the ZYX Buy Core Model Portfolio from The Arora Report. \nPreviously Microsoft indicated that in spite of slowing Azure growth it would continue to spend heavily on AI.\nThe big beneficiary of all of this AI spend continues to be NVIDIA Corp \nNVDA\n. Nvidia has just added over $300B in market cap in one day.\nEarnings from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \nAMD\n show that AMD is also making inroads.\nOf note is that Arm Holdings PLC \u2013 ADR \nARM\n which controls about 99% of the CPU designs for mobile phones is now striving to become an AI company. ARM gave a tepid forecast. ARM stock is falling. Also, Qualcomm Inc \nQCOM\n gave a tepid forecast about smartphones.\nJobless claims are increasing, indicating that the jobs picture is beginning to weaken. Jobless claims came at 249K vs. 233K consensus.\nQ2 Productivity \u2013 Preliminary came at 2.3% vs. 1.6% consensus.\nUnit labor costs have dramatically improved. This is good news for lower inflation. Unit Labor Costs \u2013 Preliminary came at 0.9% vs. 1.7% consensus.\nEngland\n\nBank of England cut its interest rate to 5%. This is the first rate cut in over four years. England tends to precede the U.S.\n\nMiddle East\n\nIran has reportedly issued orders to strike Israel in retaliation for killing a Hamas leader on its soil.\n\nOn the prospect of a wider war, money is flowing into gold and oil.  \nMagnificent Seven Money Flows\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in AAPL, AMZN, META, MSFT, and NVDA.\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are neutral in GOOG.\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in Tesla Inc \nTSLA\n.\n\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust \nSPY\n and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 \nQQQ\n.\n\nMomo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks\n\nInvestors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust \nGLD\n. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust \nSLV\n. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF \nUSO\n.\n\nBitcoin\n\nIt appears that bitcoin whales used the strength generated by Trump's plan to drive Bitcoin to the moon to unload bitcoin to retail investors. \n\nProtection Band And What To Do Now\n\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.\n\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\n\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\n\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\n\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\n\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\n\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\n\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\n\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

We have been making lower highs and lower lows since it peaked at 140, and now we reached this \"golden price ratio\" zone. It went near to the bottom of it (92) and bounced up. Now we're going down again.\n\nIf the stock keeps holding in the 90s everytime it goes as low as $90, that's where the market \"wants\" to stay for now. Since we are less than 3 weeks away from the reports, a lot of investors should be accumulating for the ER by next week. Ideally, you would like to buy at the lowest price possible, the bottom of this golden pocket. That's not science, but it's how WS usually play this game.\n\n\"Confirming a bottom\" just means noticing the price is refusing to go down further than that for the moment. It's not an absolute bottom as if NVDA would never go bellow that, we're talking about the current moment. Essentially, the more you test the bottom, the more you \"confirm\" it is the bottom.\n\nAt no point I said \"suddenly go up\", I said consistently start to ramp up. And when I say more consistently, I don't mean a ramp up with no lows, I mean going up with less volatility and uncertainty than we have seen in the past few weeks, instead of peaking and then falling to a lower low right after. Which is what I would expect to see if we stay in that ideal price range for accumulating shares and not go bellow that before the ER.\n\nIt's just some market fundaments. Nothing is certain, trading in stock market is about dealing with probabilities, and this is what seems probable to me.\n\nI'm currently waiting for this bottom to \"confirm\" so I can have a better entry. If we go bellow 88, then I don't think it we reached the bottom before the earnings. If it keeps holding there (90s) for this week, even with \"everything\" going wrong, I would call it a bottom for now and buy it.\n\nSo that's why I want the 90s price range to be tested as much as possible before the earnings, ideally this week.
