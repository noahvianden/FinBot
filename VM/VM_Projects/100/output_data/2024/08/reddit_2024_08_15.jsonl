Basic data suggests strongly that for the survivors it actually turned into a boom time. Serfs were able to demand much more for their labor and were able in many cases to vastly improve their quality of life. Its not 100% correlated, but its probably the closest historical reference to what has happened. We had a lot of people die, but nowhere near those numbers.\n\nA big thing that happened then was that the powers that be tried a bunch of things to counteract that but for the most part it didnt work out for them. Inflation appears to have been high and I'm sure it was a terrible time, but in the end the average person who survived likely had a better share of the fruits of the labor. We are experiencing a similar event but so far the average people are falling into two camps. The ones who are getting ahead and the ones who are falling even further behind. Its likely that the ones falling behind wont catch up in large part because the ones getting ahead are not united with them against the folks at the top of the heap. Im not saying how it should play out just that so far it looks like this time around the have not crowd is once again getting the short end of the stick. \n\nOn the other hand when I was a kid I never imagined walking around with several hundred dollars of fragile tech in my pocket, but that is the norm now.

Can you imagine someone from the 1950s popping up and seeing us all having smart phones? How would they react? So in that sense we definitely have an improvement to our quality of life in at least that aspect. We have other issues that are negatives, but on the whole I think we are all richer, but some people are much much richer.

One major factor in economic growth is people. If your population shrinks its really hard to have real economic growth. You can hide that with inflation, but at the end of the day people and what they do is really the economy. \n\nEurope, Japan, China, and the US are all looking at serious demographic issues to various degrees. It boggles my mind that people are against immigration with the act of more people being in your economy will likely be more beneficial than not. There are diminishing returns of course, but it still more people with more supply and demand of labor. \n\nI dont think our economies are built for infinite growth. I think our expectations for the economy are for infinite growth and we get that growth through increasing efficiency, increasing population, or inflation. We dont want much inflation but we want some. We want increased efficiency but not so much that its too disruptive to society. We want population increases, but at a rate that doesnt disrupt our lives too much. \n\nIn the end individuals have an image that their slice of that pie will be bigger over time(think the American dream) and that the slice will grow faster than inflation. If individuals realize their slice is actually shrinking as the pie gets bigger they tend to be upset. Once they get upset either they figure out how to get more, or they make peace with it, or they thrash about because its not fair in their minds. They might be right. They might not. If they figure out how to get more through more work or better skills thats wonderful. If they make peace with it that sucks for them, but not end of the world for society usually. The problem is people thrashing about. If they have a valid issue it can be disruptive but resolved. If the issue isnt valid though that is where we have real trouble. What that thrashing about looks like varies but I think we all can all point at events and say that is thrashing about. Determining the validity of the claim is a political question and the answer rarely makes everyone happy so I will skip that part. \n\nThe major issue for the next 100 years or so is that population globally will likely peak and the decades before that and after it will almost certainly be full of a lot of people thrashing about. Much of that will be due to climate change and the impacts it has. Places get too hot for your way of life you suffer with it or you move. If your area floods you put up with it or you move. All that moving will generate frustration and anger on the part of the people moving and the people who have new neighbors. We all see at least some aspect of that happening already. Its already bringing out some ugly reactions. Bad actors are definitely riling up people about some aspects of it. In some places they go on and on about illegal immigrants. In others its about the mistreatment of immigrants. In others its racism or religious extremism. Some of it is cross international borders. In some places its internal. Try living somewhere that is pricing locals out of the market. Try living somewhere where you cant get affordable insurance for your house. \n\nMy guess is that a lot of companies are seeing a lot of these issues impact them in various ways and tbh they likely dont have answers for much of the problem. If I had to make a guess its going to have a huge impact on their revenues and on the value of many currencies and commodities over time. It might not look like it as it will all be in motion, but like the tide coming in it will happen. \n\nIf I could convince everyone of one thing it would be to show a little bit of consideration for everyone else around you. This is not going to be an easy thing for younger generations to deal with and it will be even worse if we convince them that thrashing about is the solution to the problems.

Id say NVDA for example will likely continue up. TSLA is probably overpriced. MSFT will go up long term. Googl might have issues. apple likely isn't as much a growth stock as it used to be. meta is still growing, but it will slow down before too much longer. Many of the smaller but still big tech are a mixed bag of potential and issues. \n\nHousing is overpriced due to throttled supply. Most homeowners are not willing to trade their low rate for higher rates due to the risks involved with a higher mortgage. When rates drop a bit supply will likely jump up dramatically. That will likely be when fed cuts about 150-200 basis points so we are still quite a ways off from that tipping point. Tack on the issues with insurance in many areas and you have people leaving those places and going elsewhere that is putting pressure on the already limited housing supply where they are going. For example I bet Florida house prices will drop over the next few decades, but further north in NC and TN it will be pressured by many FL folk moving there. CA will see similar issues, but I dont know where they are all moving towards. I live in NC and anecdotally Im seeing a huge influx of FL plates in the area year around now. They built around 50 homes a few hundred yards from my house and roughly half of them were bought by people from FL. Few of the homes were bought by locals. Beyond the FL crowd we got a mix of people from other states with few NC residents moving in there. I have friends in TN and they are seeing similar things in their area. Lots of new homes going up, but most of them being bought by folks from elsewhere. Not complaining about it. I'm observing its happening and its makes sense for it to continue to happen.\n\nUnemployment has trended up a bit, but not spiked and all of that is relative to where its been for the past few years. A bigger issue is that skilled labor is excessive in one place and absent in another due to the housing issues. People aren't going to bear that cost  and risk for a bit more pay. Businesses aren't willing to cover that cost for the most part and its becomes a chicken and the egg kind of situation. Rates come down enough, people move, critical skill shortages get filled, economy stops grinding on problems the rates are causing. It doesnt help that many of these skilled labor jobs are not super high skilled labor, but rather just critical for a smooth operation. Without them you cant spin up all the related jobs. As an example the local hospital has had several opening for higher end nursing. The jobs aren't being filled and they are trying to make do with temp nurses. Not enough nurses are willing to move here and these specific jobs are mid to late career type nursing jobs. The pay offered is fine in normal times, but if the nurse you need has to sell the house out of town and get a house here then they either need to come out ahead or the new job has to pay enough to make it sensible. right now that simply isnt the case. Sell your house for a profit, get the same exact amount of mortgage in the new place, pay more due to rate by several hundred dollars a month at a minimum and your 24 or 25 mortgage is now back to 30 years. I know because I used to work at the hospital and someone I know there literally had this discussion with someone a few months ago. The lady didnt take the job because moving was only going to net her perhaps another $100 a month if you dont factor in the rental truck, the hours of packing, and if you factor in getting the prices just right on both the sale and the purchase.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "googl", "inflation", "nvda", "msft", "meta", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": ">  That is what has happened.

{"title": "Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: \u2018You know what to do in the stock market\u2019", "selftext": "I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:\n\n* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).\n\n* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)\n\nHere's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:\n\n* \u201cI\u2019m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion \u2014 very very hard,\u201d said Schmidt, adding that he\u2019s a \u201cclose friend\u201d to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n* \u201cIf $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a stock recommendation.\u201d Schmidt didn\u2019t say if he owns Nvidia shares.\n\n* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google\u2019s lax work culture in the session.\n\n* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won\u2019t be the only winner in AI, but there aren\u2019t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can\u2019t spend as freely.\n\n* \u201cAt the moment, the gap between the frontier models \u2014 there are only three \u2014 and everyone else appears to be getting larger,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cSix months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\n* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company\u2019s CUDA programming language. He said AMD\u2019s software that translates Nvidia\u2019s CUDA code for its own chips \u201cdoesn\u2019t work yet.\u201d\n\n* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion.
