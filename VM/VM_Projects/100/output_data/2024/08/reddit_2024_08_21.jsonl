{"title": "Market Rally Has Only Just Begun", "selftext": "This post was [originally published](https://sam-weiss.com/market-rally-has-only-just-begun/) at [www.sam-weiss.com](http://www.sam-weiss.com](http://www.sam-weiss.com))\n\nYesterday morning, I published a reddit post entitled \u201cSharp, Short-Lived Sell-off Coming\u201d where I conclude that we\u2019re likely to see a good sized 3-4% pull-back on the NASDAQ-100 and a $10-$15 pull-back in NVDA. The reasons for that are pretty straight-forward.\u00a0\n\nFirst, the indices (QQQ/SPY/Dow) are all very overbought in the nearly vertical rally we\u2019ve seen since August 5. They\u2019ve all hit extremely overbought territory in the hourly RSI. In most cases, that tend\u2019s to precede a near-term sharp sell-off. Not always, but in the overwhelming majority of the cases. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll see. NVDA is also deeply overbought. The most we\u2019ve seen in 6-months in fact. You can read more about that in\u00a0yesterday's post.\n\nSecond, there\u2019s an identifiable trend in the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) that is very well established. The QQQ doesn\u2019t tend to trade sideways or linger after a correction. It almost always immediately rebounds and that rebound is generally very robust. In most cases, we see a good 10-15% rebound from the lows in the first 25-days after bottoming, a sharp pull-back and then another leg higher. So that trend is also in play. In just 12-13 trading days, the QQQ is already up 14.62%. That\u2019s an insane rally off the lows without even a small pull-back.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, those are the\u00a0main reasons why I expect we\u2019ll see a sharp pull-back fairly soon. We\u2019re talking before next week and definitely before NVDA earnings. In fact, I suspect NVDA will both pull-back and then go right back to its highs before it goes into its actual earnings date. We\u2019ll likely be higher as we head into earnings.\u00a0\n\n# Why Near-Term Forecast Are Important\n\nNow here\u2019s what I don\u2019t think came through in my post and what I\u2019d like to mention today. First off, you\u2019ll never ever hear me advocate trading any near-term move. Never hear me advocating shorting which I think is almost always a losing proposition. Just not worth it to ever short anything ever. The overall risk-reward imbalance is almost always to the upside. The market is up 66% of the time. So not smart to ever short anything. Especially not NVDA as that would be insane. We\u2019ll get into why later on. Suffice it to say, that wasn\u2019t the point of the forecast I published yesterday.\u00a0\n\nThe point is to feel secure in one\u2019s position when a sell-off does happen. For example, if we know the markets generally pull-back sharply after being overbought or after a 10-15% move off the lows and then that pull-back actually occurs as forecasted, we don\u2019t need to sit around and speculate (or be unsure) as to the reasons. If you understand the reasons for that pullback, then it provides security and confidence in your position.\u00a0\n\nFor example, right now we know that the coming pull-back is expect to be just a minor blip in an overall massive move higher that is likely developing and will develop in the coming months. It\u2019s also to give anyone on the sidelines a window in which to make an entry into the market if they weren\u2019t long to begin with.\u00a0\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s really important to highlight just how critical security in one\u2019s position really is. Reading through the NVDA-Stock Reddit page, I was surprised by the number of people who were almost shaken out of their position in NVDA all due to what was very obviously a regular correction. If you\u2019re able to understand the difference been real risk to the markets and a relatively benign correction, you\u2019re less likely to make emotionally driven or irrational decisions.\u00a0\n\nI had a few people mention to me in my inbox that they were almost shaken out of their position on\u00a0August 4-5 upon seeing the markets down 4% in overnight trading. NVDA pushed all the way down to $90 a share. But if you\u2019ve been through 30+ corrections over decades of trading, you start to get a real sense of what is a regular correction and what is a crash. It\u2019s usually told in the volume and the size of the selling pressure early on in the correction. A regular correction slowly develops and then escalates as we arrive at capitulation. A crash or bear market typically begins with very heavy selling at the outset. See how the Covid crash in 2020 developed and how the 2022 bear market began for example. In both cases, we saw extreme selling almost immediately. There are also a wide number of key technical indicators that reach extremes. We saw none of that here. We didn\u2019t even see a real distribution day. Not once in this past correction.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, the point here is that security is the point. The take away is to not get shaken if you see NVDA pull-back from $135 down to $120 or something. It\u2019s all nonsense. And that brings me to the main point of this article.\u00a0\n\n# The New Rally Has Only Begun\n\nWe\u2019ve only just begun a new rally in the stock market. The typical rally lasts 40-trading days on average. During this recently secular bull run that began in December 2022 or January 2023, the segmented rallies have been significantly longer than usual. We\u2019ve had rallies that lasted 90 sessions, 70-sessions and 103 sessions. The most recent rally only lasted 40 sessions which is the typical average between corrections. We\u2019re only at session 12 and we\u2019ve only moved up around 15%. You can expect the QQQ to rally a good 25-30% on this leg up. That\u2019s another $60 or from here. NVDA is likely to move higher with the QQQ. It\u2019s certainly not going to see market headwinds.\u00a0\n\nThat being said, one thing worth mentioning \u2014 and we\u2019ll cover this in a separate post as it bears some attention \u2014 there is the potential risk of this being a double-correction. In most cases, we get a correction, we get a bottom and the market simply sustains a v-recovery and we go on our merry way. That\u2019s the typical situation in most corrections. But there have been some instances where we go back down and retest the lows. That could happen here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely as we\u2019ve seen a very convincing and robust move off the lows. That tells me we\u2019re probably going to new highs. But anytime we get a near-term pull-back, we\u2019re going to have to do some analysis on the selling pressure and make a determination on whether it\u2019s a retest or just a minor blip. This upcoming pull-back we should see in the coming 1-7 days will give us a sense of that. But again, I think it\u2019s higher from here.", "id": "1exy8if", "created_utc": 1724267575.0, "score": 301, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "I can\u2019t believe I just followed someone named Dieselcock.", "score": 103, "replies": [{"body": "Welcome to the fan club", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32002148032188416}, {"body": "You are late to his party.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "*sausage party", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27259841561317444}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2040448784828186}, {"body": "I did the same thing \ud83d\ude02", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20949222147464752}, {"body": "Same here lol", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16212879121303558}, {"body": "Yeah it\u2019s become an old joke.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06086621806025505}, {"body": "what's in a name.....", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2984393835067749}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10274865478277206}, {"body": "Today when the market opened high, I thought \"Well, he can't be right all the time.\" \n\nFast forward a couple of hours - \"HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!\"", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "I saw this post yesterday and was skeptical.

We don\u2019t have all that many past historical events where the fed started cutting rates leading to a peak in the market.  \n\nAnd what\u2019s more, the last few times we\u2019ve seen that happen, there were a lot of other things happening in the world.  \n\nFor example, in the Greenspan era, we had the housing bubble and financial crisis.  The fed was forced to cut rates due to the Fanny/Freddy fiasco back in the summer of 2007 and that eventually lead to the Bear Stearns collapse and ultimately the financial crisis. \n\nThe fed was behind the curve back then and it was ultimately their own doing.  The underlying problems were taking place as they were raising rates.  \n\nThis current fed had very legitimate reason for raising rates in 2022 and have equally legitimate reasons to begin cutting.  \n\nThe point here is that those two markets don\u2019t quite match up.  \n\nWhat\u2019s more, there was a very big lag effect between when the fed began cutting rates in summer 2007 and when the market peaked in late 2008.  It was a good 4-6 months between those two things.  \n\nCertain segments of the market peaked in January 2008 ahead of the Bear Stearns collapse.  The fed began cutting rates in Aug-September 2007.  But remember, the fed was hawkish up until August 2007 when credit conditions began tightening.  I remember that period well.  It was one of my best trades ever.  I got super long a basket of different stocks (January options) across the board in Aug 2007 and it all paid off by Nov 2007.  \n\nBut really various segments in market were in okay shape throughout much of 2008 even. In August 2008 (a year after the fed began cutting), all of the big tech stocks like google and Apple were within a few percentage pints of their highs only a single month away from the financial crisis.  \n\nThe character of the Bernanke fed and that economic environment was very different than today.  The Bernanke fed went from hawkish to dovish in a single month driven by rapidly deteriorating financial conditions.  \n\nThe Powell fed has largely been very dovish and these upcoming rate cuts have been expected for nearly 6-8 months now.  The Powell fed is by no means \u201cforced\u201d like Bernanke had been.  \n\nIn 2007, it all happened very dramatically as the fed was forced to take action during a big market sell-off in August 2007.  \n\nAnd again, even in that situation, there was a big lag period between when the fed cut and when the market actually rolled over.  \n\nI make this point because I\u2019ve heard this whole thing before.  It\u2019s a known trend in the market.  \n\nThe last thing I\u2019ll say on this is that this bull market is brand new.  It only just started in January 2023.  It\u2019s not even 2-years old yet.  \n\nIn 2008, we were 5 years into the bull run before we peaked.  So even then I don\u2019t think this market environment really fits into that prior trend.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Would a bear market even be that bad?

A truck was stalled in the right lane, extending into the intersection. As my car pulled up to the light, it was red. The left turn signal turned green, and the car waited for the traffic in the left turning lane to pass, before pulling out into the left lane to pass the stalled truck, It started to move back into the right lane to get in front of the stalled vehicle but that would have put me partly in the intersection. But the straight ahead light was still red. I wasn't sure if the car was going to stop so I hit the brake. There was no oncoming traffic. It might have stopped in time but I wasn't 100% sure it was going to.\n\nGenerally, I think it works great, and I wish it was a little more aggressive on turns. The one thing it definitely needs  \nto improve on is to recognize when traffic is heavy and get into the turn lane earlier when needed.

{"title": "Getting SNOW puts for earnings, hear me out tho", "selftext": "Snowflake (SNOW) is expected to release earnings results for its second quarter today. Right now people are expecting the company to report quarterly earnings at 16 cents per share, down from 22 cents per share in the year-ago period (down 27.3%). Snowflake is projected to report quarterly revenue of $849.7 million. \n\nI've looked at what other analysts have said about the stock, and all the points are summarized below: \n\n* Baird analyst William Power maintained an Outperform rating and **dropped** the price target from $200 to $165 just yesterday on Aug 20. \n\n* Stifel analyst Brad Reback maintained a Buy rating and **dropped** the price target from $200 to $168 two days ago on Aug 19. \n\n* UBS analyst Karl Keirstead maintained a Neutral rating and **dropped** his price target from $171 to $155 not that long ago, also on Aug 19. \n\n* TD Cowen analyst J. Derrick Wood maintained a Buy rating and **dropped** his price target from $230 to $180, Aug 19. \n\n* Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow maintained an Equal-Weight rating and **dropped** the price target from $191 to $146, same day as above.\n\nSee a trend? These are all analysts with reportedly high accuracy with their price targets (all above 75%). While all these new price targes are above SNOW's current price of 138, it seems like people are not as excited about the company. [Even Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just sold Snowflake stock *today*](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/21/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-sold-snowflake/). Why is that? They've been invested in them since IPO in 2020. \n\nSNOW has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, which have hurt customer spending patterns. On top of that, GPU-related costs as Snowflake aggressively invests in AI are expected to have kept margins very low. Moreover, stiff competition from the likes of Databricks and increasing pricing pressure. There are also open source options for what SNOW has to provide, from the big cloud providers. SNOW does have a technical advantage, but other cloud providers have caught up. Why pay premium for SNOW if I can just manage my pipelines with another provider that provides better proximity and efficiency? \n\nI've read a lot of bullish stuff tho. Progress in LLM, new offerings, acquisitions, and partnerships. Stuff that longterm investors want to hear about. But you know what I think is going to happen? Expectations are set so low that they'll beat, but the stock will drop anyways. Right now SNOW is up today, giving puts a bit of a discount. I'm gonna grab 8/23 130p @ 5.60 each. This is a bit pricey for an earning play, so it's reasonable to also sell the 8/23 120p @ 2.28. If the stock does drop, it most likely won't drop further than 120. This means you can get the put spread for $332, with a max possible gain of 3x *if* the stock drops about 10% or so. Which is the average move up or down that SNOW has made in the past.
