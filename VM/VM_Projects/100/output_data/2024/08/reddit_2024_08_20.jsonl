But the best thing I ever did was go out on longer time frames like the 4hr and mark with horizontal lines where you see support or resistance. Then i also go to shorter time frames in intraday charts and see where price action hit for a high and low in PM and mark with a horizontal lines, then when the market opens i mark the high and low of the 9:30 and 9:45 candle( aka opening range breakout) you will see these levels are key. Also go in and identify  where price action is rejecting on the intraday time frames. This will help you enter on pullbacks or enter for the break to PM low. Some of these brokers really sucks for charting but Webull is excellent. It will take time to identify but you will get the hang of it. I never full port. If i enter before 10:30am on SPY it's for a very small position. I usually enter after 10:30am because i know which direction we're headed based on the price action and key support/resistance levels.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for sharing!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02902509830892086}, {"body": "Appreciate your sharing this.

That is slightly lower than the maximum provisional duty of 37.6% the Commission had set in July for companies that did not cooperate with the EU's anti-subsidy investigation.\n\nTesla was among the companies classed as cooperating with the EU investigation.\n\nThe Commission said it conducted an investigation, including sending a team to Tesla facilities in China, to verify what subsidies the firm had received.\n\nA Commission official said Brussels had concluded that Tesla receives less subsidies from China, compared to the Chinese EV producers Brussels had investigated.\n\nThe tariffs are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.\n\nThe Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, says the measure is needed to counter what it says are unfair subsidies.\n\nIt said on Tuesday the three companies it had sampled would each receive slightly lower provisional duties. For Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD\u00a0[002594](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SZSE-002594/), it said the rate was 17.0%, Geely (GEELY.UL) 19.3% and SAIC\u00a0[600104](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SSE-600104/)\u00a036.3%.\n\nIn July, the Commission set provisional duties of between 17.4% and 37.6% on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.
