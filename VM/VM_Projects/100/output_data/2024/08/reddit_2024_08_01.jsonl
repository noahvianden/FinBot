{"title": "CNBC: Meta\u2019s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off", "selftext": "This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question \"Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?\" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. \n\nFor easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.\n\nSource: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)\n\nFor investors who are skeptical of Meta\u2019s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.\n\nAfter the company\u2019s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta\u2019s core business.\n\n\u201cThe ways that it\u2019s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there\u2019s a lot of upside there**,\u201d Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. \u201cThose are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we\u2019re doing is going to improve that.\u201d\n\nMeta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google\u2019s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet\n said in its earnings report last week.\n\nMeanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.\n\nAs in previous quarters, Li said Meta\u2019s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company\u2019s \u201cimproved ad performance\u201d helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.\n\nZuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta\u2019s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.\n\n\u201cThey rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell: Overtime\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,\u201d said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.\n\nMeta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday\u2019s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.\n\nLike the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI \u2014 popularized by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u2014 will lead to big revenue gains in the future.\n\n\u2018Already seen a return\u2019 Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,\u201d Mahaney said.\n\nAngelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has \u201creally navigated some of the concerns and the storms\u201d from a couple years ago and is \u201c**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.\u201d\n\nZino noted that Meta\u2019s growth rates are \u201c**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.\u201d\n\n**Meta isn\u2019t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects \u201c**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.\u201d\n\nFor 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.\n\nLi says investors should think of Meta\u2019s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with \u201ccore AI\u201d helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that \u201chave translated into revenue gains.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn\u2019t \u201cexpect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in \u201924, but we do expect that they\u2019re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.\u201d", "id": "1eh89pb", "created_utc": 1722487975.0, "score": 269, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "The usual suspects are already making money.

As a disclaimer, I own NVDA and TSM (substantial positions and recently added more on the pullback), and will ride out any swings between now and late August when NVDA reports, which better be a really great report or it will tank, but it probably will be great or everyone will be scrambling to find out where the spend went. \n\nRight now, investors are obviously getting skeptical about AI cap ex, which will eventually result in lower mag 7 cap ex, which will be really bad for semis, but that's a second derivative effect and the arms race definitely isn't ending right now. I'll seriously shave my top-tier semi positions when these cap ex numbers start dropping in a meaningful way or when LLM training/inference ASICs start eating NVDA's lunch. As far as I know, AVGO (just added to a meaningful buy-and-hold position) and TSM are the way for a non-accredited investor to play the eventual ASICs wave, but NVDA could also come out with their own ASICs.  \n\nBut right now, the megacap CEOs are really excited about AI and they have the money to spend on it. They still have good cash flow and can still spend big if they want to. I think LLMs and other applications of transformers will continue to get better, they'll be faster, smaller models will be better, and context windows will be larger before the LLMs start spitting out hallucinations and functionally break. With the right training techniques, which are still evolving, the transformer that LLMs is based on can remarkably improve on really overdetermined data, which breaks what I used to know about signals analysis and training old-school neural networks.\n\nI think we are going through a routine low-volume summer pullback with hedge funds piling into the previously lagging R2K, which makes momentum plays swing like crazy. But, hedge funds will be back, and they'll long the same positions they shorted months earlier, and then they'll short them again. It's fine for investors to hold the feet of megacaps to the fire, but that just brings their PE multiples closer to normal (for a tech stock). \n\nOther position disclaimers:\n* Google (small LT buy-and-hold position, they are behind and will probably lose search market share but I won't bet against their data and proprietary tensor core iterations)\n\n*Microsoft (small long-held position)\n\n*Meta (no position due to longstanding antipathy plus I think they are behind with AI and the metaverse and they have more limited room to grow because 3.5 billion users is a lot, even if many of those are bots. I think they will outperform but won't be in the driver's seat. I still don't see how Zuck is going to monetize their open-source LLM models while Microsoft at least has a plan that may kick in when co-pilot improves and co-pilot subscriber numbers improve. I may be in the minority, but I think this will happen eventually, can't say when.

That ride is over.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "You're right that YoY growth is a really bad metric to value a high PE stock, as is comparing this quarter this year, vs the same quarter last year. For me to buy a stock with a high PE, it better have higher revenues and higher earnings every quarter and those numbers better have a strong correlation to each other and to EPS (those boxes are checked). I like to look at quarterly revenue and [EBDITA](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/ebitda). I have plugged in the numbers, and I would argue that these numbers are both statistically linear. The revenue numbers do a fit a parabolic fit better than a linear fit, hinting at slowing revenue growth. But, the parabolic fit will always be better than the linear fit, whether or not it has meaning, and quarterly earnings reports make for very sparse data. I'm expecting roughly linear but moderating revenue and EPS growth and will unload if there is a big surprise to the downside. With linear EPS growth for the next year out, earnings for the next year would be 2-3 times higher, making the forward PE, which ignores analyst estimates, very reasonable. Growth will probably moderate because of supply chain constraints and moderation in demand. But, Nvidia doesn't need a PE close between 20 and 30 a year out at these prices because high-growth market leaders always command a PE premium. \n\nBut, it's very plausible that revenue growth is slowing because TSM's production capacity is a bottleneck and it takes a long time to build new fabs, which TSM is doing. However, Nvidia has historically kept its margins very high when there is strong demand. I think the pertinent historical examples are the last bitcoin bubble pre-ASICs and Cisco around its nose-bleed peak with a PE over 200. During the crypt0 bubble Nvidia absolutely crushed it while reddit gamers had daily tantrums about Nvidia charging unfair prices for their GPUs. That lasted until ASICs made it unprofitable to mine with an all-purpose GPU, crypt0 started crashing and Nvidia crashed. I'm watching Mag 7 cap ex because Cisco collapsed roughly the month after its biggest customers (like Worldcom, AT&T, AOL, Qwest, and Sprint) started dramatically cutting their cap ex. The now bankrupt Worldcom was an outright criminal fraud that was buying Cisco routers to pretend that they were making money to pump their share prices. So I'm worried about demand, I'm worried about ASICs, respectively thinking about Cisco and the last crypt0 bubble. The main reason I bought more AVGO because its price is down and because OpenAI is building a new secret chip with Broadcom, which is almost certainly a new ASIC chip that will rely on Broadcom and TSM. Also, broadcom should benefit from its auto and manufacturing chips and cell phone sales will probably pick up if rates go down and it's a given that they will go down.\n\nBut, major risks are that the economy is definitely slowing by almost any metric and the Fed is always late with their rate moves, with their backward-looking data analysis, and what's bad for the economy is bad for everyone. Also, from now to October is historically a very bad time for semis and Wall Street knows it. Also, we know that if investors revolt on spend, CEOs like Zuck will dramatically cut back on cap ex, like he did after the Metaverse crash. I think if one megacap CEO cuts back on GPU spend, they all will, as I feel they are defensively spending to not get left behind, so the script can flip and growth can turn into misses in a hurry. Finally, I feel that most semi and software stocks are overvalued and catching AI tailwinds for no reason and this will hurt the few stocks with good performance, because hedge algos will work to keep correlated pairs of stocks correlated. The conflict between Iran and Israel could blow up in the near future. Also, the performance of bigger and bigger transformers could hit a wall, but I don't think there's evidence of that yet. I don't think humans are special and that there are intrinsic limits about what humans can do and future AI can't. However, better GPUs will someday be locked down even in the U.S., as a national security issue. \n\nBut, I have a long-term horizon, and the megacaps that are pumping money into NVDA haven't cut back on cap ex yet.

New generation will regain the performance leadership per core, that they will lose with Zen 5 in a week or 2. Server CPU, specially the one with E cores looks extremely competitive and the one with P cores is designed to close the gap to AMD CPU. If you watch reviews, last gen server CPU narrowed the gap to AMD, this one will narrow it even more or even close it. Then they have Gaundi 3 which will start generating revenue. Plus, most of the fab investment was done, they need to ramp up production. The way I see it, Q3 & Q4 will generate strong revenue in client segment & stagnating revenue in Server segment at worst. So say worst case scenario, 1B per quarter loss, they still have 11B cash. Once they ramp up 20A and 18A processes they increase efficiency and will be back in net profit from Q1-Q2, while still having at least 5-7B cash to burn. Debt is not that bad, they have 50B. TSMC has 30B. \n\nSo with all respect, I would like to understand what scenario would lead to Chapter 11?

I read the full review of 6780E server CPU, made with their 3nm process and personally I was shocked. It's a more specialized CPU and for the scenarios for which it was designed, it's quite competitive to AMD CPUs, both in term of performance and efficiency. And this was the version with 144 cores. They will also have a version with 288 cores in Q1 2025. And from what I read from reviews, Gaudi 3 is between current Nvidia solution and the one that they will launch soon, which makes it quite competitive if sold at the right price. Bottom line, they have to fail to execute for 6-7 consecutive quarters for them to go into default. I don't see how this can happen. Their 3nm is the equivalent to TSMC 4nm. If I understand well their strategy, they intend to always keep their internal projects on best nodes in house while selling capacity from their retired nodes to external customers. This will change drastically the dynamics of the fab revenue since this will very likely double their life, thus getting them on pair with TSMC for profitability. I think their strategy of splitting the fab and product development is a hedge against competition. If one product is not competitive enough, they scale down and sell the capacity.\n\nAs for lithography, this is all ASML machines and finetuning of transistor design.
