Copenhagen-type interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective, in that they are independent of physicists' personal beliefs and other arbitrary mental factors.[5]:\u200a85\u201390\u200a\n\nOver the years, there have been many objections to aspects of Copenhagen-type interpretations, including the discontinuous and stochastic nature of the \"observation\" or \"measurement\" process, the difficulty of defining what might count as a measuring device, and the seeming reliance upon classical physics in describing such devices.
