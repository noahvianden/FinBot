They were supposed to be shipping Blackwell in Q2(very limited) en mass in Q3 and entire Data Centers were supposed to be built with them in Q4.\n\nThey were projected to have 80B of revenue over the next 2 Quarters. Now, they're guiding for 32.5 and if their % keeps up, that'll be lower margin and a \\~33.5M quarter and that's not going to be good(they'll beat that, it's hypothetical).\n\nThis was mediocre earnings for a company trading at a \\~45 Forward PE and with their Growth. The Mag 7 stocks have had to not just beat, they've had to beat by a LOT or they dropped. This was especially true of NVDA.\n\nLong story short, you need to understand investing better than to look at analysts' expectations(Which are NOT traders' expectations, they were 32-34B) and say, \"Well, they beat top line, beat bottom line, sure, the actual money they made missed, but you can't call this a miss!\n\nNVDA is going to flounder for the next 2 Quarters. Blackwell is going to be what drives them back up. That's 3 Quarters from now.\n\nQ4 NVDA SHOULD get back to REAL meaningful beats, but they're not they're likely a quarter away from that and that's why the Stock isn't headed for 145-160 as projected, that's why it'll likely trade 115-130 with a low in the 105 range this next Quarter.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Let\u2019s get one thing straight first, my account is a LOT larger than yours (feel free to DM me your portfolio and I\u2019ll happily return the favor), as I\u2019ve been successfully in tech and investing in it for the last 9 years.\n\nSecondly, to claim that the \u201cwhisper\u201d numbers were required to be hit in order for the stock to climb, with it being 34B (that\u2019s legitimately not even true, look up what Stacy Rasgon has to say about this, it was 32B) is idiotic.\n\nFinally, I don\u2019t need to address any of your points because you fuck up immediately out of the gate by thinking their numbers point towards deceleration, when in fact it was literally just Blackwell\u2019s delay by 1 quarter being attributed to these amazing numbers.

An option with a little over 1 week DTE that pays $30 is about 10% below the stock price at a strike of $450. Around the start of 2022 Meta went from about 300 to about 220 in a little over 1 week.

I only added pepper on all sides today. I set the oven to 190F/90C and cooked the steak until 120F/48C. Thew it in the pen with some oil. Toasting the fatty side first, then the flat sides, then the round leftover side. I had it in approx 1 minute per side. I cooked the butter in a separate pot with some garlic until dark brown yesterday the butter burned a little in the pen. After searing, I re-added the thermometer to observe the temperature. It got up to 135F/57C after letting it rest for 10 mintes, basically perfect medium rare. So I have that process down for a 2 inch steak pretty good after only one try yesterday which wasnt perfect.\n\nResult: Dry brining definitely works. Steak is much tastier throughout. And where it was pure muscle, also more tender. I very slightly under salted it, which was ok, so it allowed me to add some extra on top after cutting it, which I like very much. The crust was not quite as good as yesterday in terms of crispiness. I probably should have waited for the oil to smoke before adding the steak. Maximum heat baby! The taste of the crust was practically indistinguishable from yesterday. So basing it in butter or having the butter prepared extra doesnt make a difference. At least not that I can taste it.\n\nThe only downside was, this second cut of the same piece of meat was tougher than the one yesterday. This one had a tendon down the middle, which the other one only had at the very edge. It was similar to the one yesterday in terms of juiciness. I definitely learned from yesterday how to eat it and I mopped up the juices as I ate the steak with each piece, so I didnt have a puddle left like yesterday.\n\nAs this was an experiment, I didnt go for the most expensive meat there is, it was ok but not good. Marbling was very light, so I didnt expect much anyway. It was a rumpsteak cut (I think.. its H\u00fcfte in German, translates to hip. Basically meat from the upper arse, where the tail is connected). It was definitely too lean for its tenderness.\n\nAnyway, with this, I can cook my next steak much better.
