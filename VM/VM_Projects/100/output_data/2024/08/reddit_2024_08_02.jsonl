{"title": "PSA: A company being great and doing well does not protect the stock from dropping massively. NVDA can fall 50%+ for NO REASON. You need to be prepared for that. ", "selftext": "I think the recent rally has attracted a lot of new investors who don't have enough years in the market to understand this, but I just want to be clear for everyone:\n\nYour money is not safe in NVDA short term. It doesn't matter how great the company is, how well it's doing, etc etc -- people always have reaons why they think their investment or chosen stock is awesome and so can only go up. That is not how stocks work.\n\nEven the absolute best companies like NVDA, routinely get routed on no news for no reason at all. This is because market movements, especially on shorter time horizons (and this can be a few years, not just a few months) -- they aren't really about fundamentals, or performance. Those things impact share price, but share price driven by our own animal spirits more than anything else.\n\nAnd human beings are fickle. our emotions are fickle. It's not manipulation. If people get scared of maybe AI not living up to the hype? boom, nvda down 50% even if it's doing the same or better revenue. People get afraid of a macro event or mass layoffs? boom, multiple compression and nvda down 50% even if the business is really strong.\n\nA company's performance does not prevent the stock from having horrible, HORRIBLE routs that keep you up at night. And they don't always go away in a few months. They can take years to blow over.\n\nIf you can't handle that, and please listen to me -- sell your nvda stock and just buy SPY. Buying stock in single companies, no matter how good the company, can be extremely volatile. You are most likely going to see, at some point in the next few years, your account down by 50% or more if you are primarily invested in this, or any other single stock. And if you hold through and DCA, you probably won't mind 10 years out.\n\nBut you need to be emotionally ready for huge routs, and you don't need to invest so much money that you can't whether those storms. They will come for NVDA, and the company's performance will NOT protect it from the tides of investor sentiment -- which are fickle and almost always turbulent.", "id": "1ei76nv", "created_utc": 1722596535.0, "score": 205, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 163, "comments": [{"body": "Basically what he is saying is to keep buying Nvidia because it can randomly go up 50% for no reason.", "score": 185, "replies": [{"body": "Just bought more because of this comment.

For the past 10 years working almost exclusively on various ML products in big tech companies (think meta, google, twitter). My job requires technical aptitude, so i'm not a marketing type and can see through the usual sales hype. I also understand the evolution of these types of products (s curve). At the same time my job also requires me to understand adoption cycles, how to commercialize technologies and to develop some sense for what markets are willing to pay for or not.\n\nAs far as how i got to the valuation. I took three different approaches and they all triangulated to $168 in next 12 months\n\n1. DCF model for the company using my growth assumptions based on what i've seen in the industry\n2. Estimating total AI spend and attributing how much of that will go to NVDA over the next 5 years. What i did here was list the top use cases for GPUs (beyond just LLMs) across 10 different sectors, to try to size the total spend in the AI market. I then broke that down as how i expect it to be allocated across the value chain from software costs, to operations, ML engineers, servers....etc and of course chips. I then further adjusted with assumptions on % market share that NVDA can capture within its segment of the value chain. This gives me potential total projected revenues that NVDA would earn that i then cross-refernced with 5yr revene projections from #1 above\n3. The last method is very crude but was more of a sanity check step, which is basically taking the total spend globally and calculating it as a percent of total global GDP just to see if it makes sense (i.e not too large) and it was indeed very reasonable in low single digit percentage.\n\nI have a low/high value but i don't believe in caveated forecasts, my philosophy is a forecast is one figure that encapsulates total risk.\n\nFinally i will say in a lot of my estimations i took a conservative approach where i estimated AI spend that would be paid for by cost savings alone, i didn't even factor too much innovation and new use cases unlocked that would open up new markets. I'm confident that those will come along but not in the next year.\n\nI'm fairly confident in my estimate, but keep in mind nothing is ever 100%. And a recession could drastically influence this as it would impact overall spend. Also histroically this stock has had 40% volatility regularly, even when it was in single digit dollars per share, and it will certainly continue to do so. As of right now i think it's extremely unlikely for it to drop below 80, but it is possible. If there is a miss the market will overreact, if there is geopolitical threat the market will overreact. The antitrust stuff i'm not worried about at all, these companies always navigate those issues with very minimal impact when looking at medium and long term.\n\nMy best guess is next earnings is going to be good, after that there might be 1 or maybe 2 earnings that might relatively dissapoint, and then up from there. This is based on the the timing i think it'll take for users to start showing the type of results they are getting from their AI related spend.

You need special leadership to have lots of SW engineer installed, lots of research (300 PhD) invested to in to technology/products which aren't your core business (HW gaming GPUs). \n\nNvidia's investment in CUDA, the AI platform, buying Mellanox has been funded by gaming. Gaming made Nvidia big and Jensen made a bet on it 30 years ago. But later he used gaming funding for another bet in accelerated computing. That needs conviction and strong leadership since Jensen was convinced of the idea upon founding but he had to convice every Nvidia employee that it's the right way to go with CUDA and use a lot resources for it despite having strong competition in gaming back then.\n\nYou have to understand that the DGX-1 system for ML with V100 is 7 years old now. The first GPU HPC with Nvidia was installed like \\~13 years ago. People think that Nvidia became \"suddenly\" successful but that is total BS. Nvidia has been on this track for a long time. While others try now to compete at the 24hrs race of AI, Nvidia is on the 24 years mission into the future. \n\nAnd Nvidia takes it's time, see Omniverse was presented actually 4 years ago:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o\\_XeGyg2NIo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_XeGyg2NIo)\n\nInstead of rushing it, Nvidia is slowly nurturing it just like they have done with the AI platform. Improving it every generation to make it as great as it is today. Likewise Nvidia is working with a lot of patient and focus on many solutions for years. Like their self driving system is 7 years in the making. Their robotics stuff isn't new at all. Don't expect any fast releases because Nvidia rather refines before they release but by the time they release, they will surprise and be without competition. The basic rule of Jensen here is to work on very hard problems nobody else tackles. Hard problems take time to solve but once solved you'll instantly become the market leader since you basically created the market yourself.\n\nAnd finally, Nvidia is the best at marketing. So many companies ignore how important marketing is. Jensen is the king at this and does the best job there is. He is also an engineer so he is unique in a way that he can combine marketing while also using a lot of tech speak but simplified. Many don't like him for that because he seems like the sales guy with the vacuum cleaner knocking on your door but the CEO must be the #1 promoter of a company and its' products. And as I said, nobody beats Jensen at that.\n\nTherefore, Nvidia's success isn't their current product line. No, they are just the results of leadership and company culture of the past decades. As long as these remain, the company will remain one of the best there is. For sure, there will be cycles in revenue as there have been in the past, the same for the stock but if you want to invest in future solutions then invest in Jensen and his team because Jensen is the only guy in the world, ready to bet a trillion dollar market cap on new ideas while cannabilizing his own products\\*.\n\n\\*his very own teaching:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn1EsFe7snQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn1EsFe7snQ)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This!

Everything that is says, does, and writes to you is based off of data models it was trained with. It's ability to code and answers are really just a collective input of data, largely from the internet. Dare I say, GPT and other AI are just a glorified \"Google\" engine. Instead of Googling, it pieces things together things you ask of it, whether it's to generate a picture, write a novel, or some code.\n\nGPT is not actually artificial intelligence, or sentient.

What's going to happen with this one is one of two things. The market's going to go through its correction, we're going to recover, we're going to make new all-time highs, bull scenario. If this goes bearish, recession, falling earnings, bad stuff. We're going to see weekly lower highs get set on the charts and then lower lows.

If that starts happening for the next few months, we could be in for a bad time.

{"title": "Intel heads for worst day on Wall Street in 50 years, falls to lowest in over a decade ", "selftext": "Intel shares plunged the most in 50 years on Friday, reaching a price not seen since 2013, after the chipmaker reported a big earnings miss and announced a massive restructuring.\n\nThe stock plummeted 27% to $21.22 as of late morning trading. It would be the second worst day ever for the shares, behind only a 31% drop in July 1974, which was three years after Intel\u2019s IPO. The company\u2019s market cap is now below $100 billion.\n\nThe dramatic selloff contributed to a 2.4% drop in the Nasdaq and pulled down global semiconductor stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. \u2014 known as TSMC \u2014 closed 4.6% lower in Taiwan, and Samsung was down more than 4% at the end of the session in South Korea. TSMC is the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of chips, while Samsung is the largest memory semiconductor firm globally.\n\nIntel\u2019s numbers were bad across the board.\n\nThe company swung to a $1.61 billion net loss after reporting net income of $1.48 billion in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents fell way short of the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, according to LSEG. Revenue also missed expectations.\n\nIntel said it won\u2019t pay its dividend in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 and lowered its forecast for full-year capital expenditures by over 20%. The company said it would lay off more than 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.\n\n\u201cThis is the most substantial restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago,\u201d Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told CNBC\u2019s Jon Fortt in an interview that aired on Friday. \u201cWe have laid out an audacious journey of rebuilding this company, and we\u2019re going to get that done.\u201d\n\nA decision to more rapidly produce Core Ultra PC chips that can handle artificial intelligence workloads contributed to the loss, Gelsinger said on a conference call with analysts. The company said pricing was more competitive than planned during the quarter, as AMD, Qualcomm and other companies have been working to take market share from Intel, which has fallen way behind its rivals in the AI battle.\n\nThe job cuts will mainly take place this year, Gelsinger wrote in a memo. It\u2019s the largest of any single job cut listed on Layoffs.fyi, an industry tracker that\u2019s been operating since March 2020.\n\nCompeting on merit\n\nAdding pressure to the chip sector is a report from The Information that AI chipmaker Nvidia is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation.\n\nThe DOJ is looking at complaints that the company allegedly abused its market dominance in AI, The Information reported.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company \u201cwins on merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making NVIDIA openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson added that Nvidia is \u201chappy to provide any information regulators need.\u201d\n\nCNBC has also reached out to the DOJ on the report.\n\nSamsung rival SK Hynix, which supplies U.S. giant Nvidia, also fell sharply to close more than 10% lower. The sell-off continued in Europe. Shares of ASML, which sells key tools required to make cutting-edge chips, declined along with STMicroelectronics and Infineon.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which includes major names in the sector, fell more than 4% on Friday after plummeting 6.5% a day earlier.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/intel-share-plunge-drags-down-global-chip-stocks-from-tsmc-to-samsung.html", "id": "1eifwxf", "created_utc": 1722619596.0, "score": 440, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "RIPIP Intel Kid - 700k bags to hold for another 50 years.

{"title": "Sahm Rule Signalling Recession", "selftext": "# Background\n\nThe Sahm Rule is a recession indicator introduced by macroeconomist Claudia Sahm in 2019.\u00a0It is designed to signal the early stages of a recession based on changes in the unemployment rate. Here are the key aspects of the Sahm Rule:\n\n1. Calculation: The rule compares the current three-month moving average of the U.S. unemployment rate to the lowest three-month moving average unemployment rate over the preceding 12 months.\n2. Threshold: A recession is signaled when the current three-month moving average unemployment rate exceeds the lowest three-month moving average of the past 12 months by 0.50 percentage points or more.\n3. Data source: The rule uses the unemployment rate (U3) data released monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n4. Smoothing effect: By using a three-month moving average, the rule aims to prevent overreacting to a single month's data.\n5. Historical accuracy: According to Sahm, the rule has never triggered outside of a recession since the 1970s.\n6. Real-time vs. current indicators: The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database provides both current and real-time Sahm Rule recession indicators.\n7. Origin: Sahm introduced this indicator in a policy proposal for The Hamilton Project, suggesting automatic stimulus payments to individuals when the rule signals a recession.\n8. Purpose: The rule is designed to identify the onset of a recession quickly, allowing for timely implementation of fiscal policies to combat economic downturns.\n9. Limitations: While historically accurate, the rule is an \"empirical regularity\" rather than a definitive proposition, and circumstances such as GDP growth and inflation levels could influence its effectiveness.\n\nThe Sahm Rule has gained recognition for its simplicity and effectiveness in identifying the early stages of recessions, making it a valuable tool for economists and policymakers\n\n# Current Sahm Rule\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y17obwqx8gd1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=5909a14eb9ae79c6dcf59e3add07536a03746836\n\nWith unemployment raised to 4.3%, in today's job report we are pass the 0.50 threshold in the Sahm Rule", "id": "1ei9497", "created_utc": 1722602657.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 4 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 year ago\n**Total Comments** | 571 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cso979/barrick_gold_gold_bull_case/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cujnts/petrodollar_recycling_into_gold_instead_of_us/) \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1678721308708191}, {"body": "Saw the post title and I thought Sahm rule was \u2018Stay At Home Mom\u2019 , interesting so they buy less on amazon recession incoming?", "score": 118, "replies": [{"body": "I also that this was going to be a mom related indicator\u2014disappointed.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Who do yall think is spending all the money on Amazon?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2794162333011627}, {"body": "They stay at home because they are laid off from their jobs.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4740288555622101}], "tickers": ["recession", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "German stock market is not doing bad and it's been in recession forever", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "liquidity is what drives markets. as long as fed keeps money sloshing in the system it has to go somewhere.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Isnt biden about to issue one last stimulus check before he goes?", "score": -12, "replies": [{"body": "Imagine if he did something truly stupid to reignite inflation like removing all taxes on social security.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Yeah he should bribe the voters with a gambling check before he leaves", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5047849416732788}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23919914662837982}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26992806792259216}, {"body": "Why don\u2019t they just change the definition of it like we did?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/white-house-definition-recession/", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.snopes.com/news/2024/06/19/biden-malfunctioning-june-2024/\n\n\nhttps://www.snopes.com/news/2024/06/19/biden-freeze-up-obama/\n\n\n\nhttps://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-invisible-chair-dday/", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Snopes.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19897733628749847}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15747486054897308}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.501499354839325}], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07334540039300919}, {"body": "SSSHHHHHH!

Travel was either slow (Train , bus, driving on dirt roads) or SUPER expensive to fly .\n\nMaybe you catch a show on friday / saturday night on tv or radio\n\nIn the summer you just sweat your balls off \n\nIf you're now middle class you probably have AC, more than one car, a TV that has almost an unlimited collection of tv shows and movies, phones.\n\nTBH I would be miserable even if I had money in the 1950s unless I was living in like NYC or LA or a large city with more entertainment options", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well, I, for one, would NEVER hope you get hit by a bus.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
