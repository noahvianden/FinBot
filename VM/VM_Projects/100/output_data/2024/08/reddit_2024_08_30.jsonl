The advisors are considering a full range of options, including splitting off and selling businesses, the person said.\n\nIntel shares rose more than 8% on the report in Friday morning trading.\n\n[Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/intel-is-said-to-explore-options-to-cope-with-historic-slump)\u00a0first reported that the company was working with its advisors to come up with strategic options.

CNBC previously reported that some advisors, including Morgan Stanley, were helping the company on activism defense.\n\nIntel remains on track to launch its next iteration of its laptop central processor, Lunar Lake, Gelsinger said at the appearance. But investors don\u2019t see a turnaround on the horizon, and have pushed the stock down almost 60% this year.\n\nThe once-dominant company has been trounced primarily by\u00a0Nvidia, which produces the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are are the heart of today\u2019s prominent AI models.\n\nAlongside a disastrous earnings report earlier this month, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 workers. The job cuts, part of a broader focus on slashing expenses, did little to assuage investor dismay. And while Gelsinger said Thursday that the company\u2019s foundry business had roughly a dozen interested customers, the buildout remains costly for Intel.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/intel-working-with-bankers-to-present-board-with-strategic-options.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/intel-working-with-bankers-to-present-board-with-strategic-options.html)", "id": "1f54n54", "created_utc": 1725048131.0, "score": 551, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "I don\u2019t think that consulting overpaid bankers is a good move for high end chip company.", "score": 726, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 262, "replies": [{"body": "Man I laughed so hard at this", "score": 52, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1373138427734375}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06037585437297821}, {"body": "The cash crunch is real.

Inflation has been settling down and their focus less on inflation and more on jobs. NFP is next Friday so probably the thing to watch. Also keep in mind Monday is a stock market holiday. Then also, today is end of August so prepare for some shenanigans for potential monthly rebalancing of stuff.\n\nAs for TSLA, today and next week max pain is $210. With the way current options are positioned, more than likely will end today there +/- $2.5. The wrench next week is a high amount of interest in the $215 and $220 calls. If there's positive momentum and call volume, those can act as a magnet and possibly drag the share price to those strikes. Then as time passes, those can decay and then end next week right back to $210 if they don't stay ITM. All depends on volume and macro sentiment since there's no Tesla catalyst until 10/2 deliveries, 10/10 robotaxi, then earnings.\n\nMedium term, max pain for the 9/20 opex is currently $200. That'll change as it gets closer. Also MM currently pricing in $20 move from now until then so basically expecting $185-225 from yesterday's close.\n\nSo how do I use this to sell calls and puts? There's no real huge TSLA catalysts, MM pricing in $12ish move next week or $196-220. Then since that's where all those call strikes are next week, selling the $230C+ should be \"safe\" since that's basically the priced in MM move from the high interest call strike.\n\nThen the $230C is around 7 delta or a 7% probability of happening. Going to the put side, that's about the same as the $185P. So since those are both outside what the MM is pricing in now and for the monthly opex, that's what I sell knowing I can always roll until things make sense.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Nice.
