I would say there is 3 levels of understanding, please try to go through them if you want to use leverage ETFs and don\u2019t listen to what people keep repeating without having fully understood what they\u2019re saying. There is too much monkey see monkey do for something that you need to build your own understanding on. Don\u2019t even take my word for it, but if you do want my suggestion (not financial advice) I\u2019ll offer one at the end \n\nLevel 1: if a stock goes up then 2x, 3x is even better so why not buy the leveraged version \n\nLevel 2: this is where you have the \u201cvolatility decay\u201d crowd comes in and perhaps well intentioned but cluelessly deriding these instruments as \u201cday trading only\u201d and making it seem like your investment is going to evaporate overnight. Most people get stuck here and never graduate \n\nLevel 3: The real truth about how these instruments perform. Thankfully there is a lot of great well researched and academic-like depth papers on the topic and a range of historic data and tools you can use to understand if these can be held long term, which yes they absolutely can and offer outsized returns. But also yes the risk of decay is high. \n\nThe biggest variables that determine your net levered performance are\n\n1) what leverage multiplier you go for\n2) when you buy \n3) the volatility of the underlying \n\nIf we take one of the worst and extreme examples \n\nIf you bought QQQ, a tech heavy index, at the top of the dotcom it would have recovered by now \n\nIf you bought QLD, which is 2x QQQ at the same exact time it would have recovered to slightly below QQQ today \n\nAnd if you bought TQQQ, which is 3x QQQ at the same time then it would still have not recovered till today\n\nSo yes the \u201cdecay\u201d is real. But there are also thousands of periods I can sample where you could hold any of those leveraged ETFs for months and years and come out way way ahead of the baseline, by a ridiculous measure. \n\nSo there is no inherent thing that says you can\u2019t hold those long term. The reality is nuanced, and the best teacher here is data. Again there is papers on the topic and you could do your own testing as well \n\nThe tl:dr is, on a long term basis, a 2x leverage on Spy and Nasdaq performed the best on the frontier when comparing 1x,2x,3x and 4x. I know there is also similar studies done on the Dow, Nikkei, Australian stock market and a couple others but I haven\u2019t looked into thosez\n\nFor most instruments with that level of volatility a 2x leverage is long term higher returns. But do not underestimate the psychological aspect of going through a 90% drawdown compared to a 45% drawdown tor example. So even if the return numbers on 2x work fine, the psychology aspect is another higher risk. It\u2019s easier to say you can stomach it and sit through it, it\u2019s a whole other thing seeing it happen and most people overestimate their confidence in being able to sit through that. Even when you position size, and put only what you can \u201cafford to lose\u201d a 90% drawdown WILL eat at you. \n\nAt 3x leverage avoid those for long term \n\nFinally, if a stock\u2019s weekly volatility within 2 standard deviations is in the order of 10%, know that you will eat a lot of shit even with 2x leverage\n\nTo make this all more relevant to the topic on hand, for most time periods and a long enough period if you bought and held NVDA vs NVDL the 2x leverage would have netted you orders of magnitude ahead.

{"title": "Stocks Pull-Back a bit as Expected", "selftext": "[This article was first published at Sam Weiss](https://sam-weiss.com/stocks-sell-off-as-expected/).    \n  \nAs I mentioned a few days ago in the article entitled, \u201c[Sharp Short-Lived Sell-Off Coming](https://sam-weiss.com/sharp-short-lived-sell-off-coming/),\u201d the market was trading at extremely overbought conditions and was due for a near-term pull-back. We\u2019re seeing that play-out right now. The two main reasons I expected we\u2019d see this pullback happen is:\n\n(1) the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) index had reached extremely overbought conditions only the hourly for an extended period of time and after a large percentage gain.\u00a0  \n  \nThat second part is key and didn\u2019t spend much time on that in the article I published a few days ago. So we\u2019ll talk about that here now. It\u2019s not enough for the QQQ to simply touch a 70-RSI or to even to become overbought for us to make a reasonable forecast. For there to be ANY predictive value to forecast a sell-off, you need to see extremes for an extended period of time and it must come after there has been a strong 8-12% move higher off the lows.\u00a0  \n  \nYou can easily see the QQQ reach overbought conditions right off the lows and it wouldn\u2019t be smart to forecast anything at that point. For example, the QQQ was trading at $423 two weeks ago when it was at its low. Suppose after it had rebounded up to $445, it reached overbought conditions. It would be incredibly unwise to forecast a pull-back when the market had only risen 4.96%. That\u2019s because the rally had barely just begun and not enough new money will have flowed back into the market at that point. There\u2019s a tendency for the QQQ to rally a good $50 off its lows before seeing any sort of pull-back when we\u2019re talking about forecasting the first pull-back.\u00a0\n\nTake a look at the QQQ chart below as an example. Notice the vertical lines I\u2019ve annotated on the chart. They outline every previous case going back the last 15-months where the QQQ pushed well above a 70-RSI. You can see just how predictable the hourly RSI really is as a forecasting tool so long as it is taken in conjunction with other conditions. It\u2019s not just guesswork here. There\u2019s a pretty well established trend. Notice the red lines\u00a0\n\nA few things you might notice are (1) once we\u2019ve rallied a fair amount of the lows, overbought becomes more and more predictable. You can forecast big pull-backs once the QQQ has gone on a big move to the upside. The RSI has less predictive value as a tool when we\u2019re coming off of the lows of a previous sell-off and more predictable as we\u2019ve risen quite a bit. In this case, I was confident in the forecast simply because the QQQ had rallied $62 from $423 up to $485. That\u2019s actually the biggest rally I\u2019ve seen in a straight line without a pull-back. And that makes sense as we\u2019ve just had the largest sell-off we\u2019ve seen since the bear market lows of December 2022. So a huge rally makes sense.\u00a0\n\nThe second big thing that everyone should notice is that the QQQ seldom peaks when we\u2019ve peaked on the RSI. There\u2019s usually a lag period where we get something called negative divergence. Don\u2019t want to get too technical here. But just know it\u2019s more likely to peak after a small lag period has taken place. For example, look at the may peak. We hit peak overbought conditions in mid-May but it wasn\u2019t until late-May that the QQQ sold-off.\u00a0\n\n(2) The second main reason is the table I posted in the article that outlines what typically follows after a correction.\u00a0\u00a0As I outlined in that table, what we usually see after a correction ends is the QQQ will rally roughly 10-15% during the first 25 trading days after bottoming. Well this time the QQQ managed to accomplish that feat in just 10-12 days. It did it in roughly half the required time. What\u2019s more, in virtually all of these post-correction rallies, we get a sharp-back before moving higher. And that\u2019s because that first surge off the lows leads to overbought conditions. The bottom-line is the QQQ just went up too far too fast relative to its typical historical trading behavior. So that lead me to believe we were due for a sell-off. That table is posted here below:\u00a0\n\nBut as I also stated\u00a0[yesterday](https://sam-weiss.com/market-rally-has-only-just-begun/), the market rally that began on August 5 is only just beginning. This sell-off is only a minor blip in a much larger new rally. Nothing I saw today changes that. We\u2019ll see what happens tomorrow. But as of now, this sell-off doesn\u2019t look like anything more than just a minor pull-back ahead of more upside. What\u2019s more, we may actually drawing very close to end of this pull-back. If we get anywhere near a 30-RSI, then that\u2019s the biggest red flag that the selling is over and we\u2019re likely headed higher. The QQQ right now is at a 38-RSI. So we\u2019re not quite there yet. But we\u2019re very close to that point. The meat of the sell-off is pretty much done. The QQQ is down $10 from its high. The typical QQQ pull-back is 3-4% from peak to trough. We\u2019re at 2.5% at the moment. Notice the circle on the chart below. That\u2019s what we\u2019re thinking in terms of the pull-back. At this point, it can bottom at any moment. It doesn\u2019t have to get down to oversold. It\u2019s far less predictable at this point. If it were to bottom right here at $473.81, that would be sufficient. That\u2019s $12 from the highs on the QQQ. It would feel shallow, but it\u2019s enough.\u00a0\n\n# Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nNow obviously what we\u2019re seeing in Nvidia is just mirroring what we\u2019re seeing in the broad market. Nvidia is directionally correlated with the market. The pull-back in NVDA at this point is less than I would have expected. By today we should have seen Nvidia (NVDA) hit $120 if we\u2019re going to see it fall to the $115\u2019s before earnings. Now I think that is unlikely as the QQQ pullback doesn\u2019t have much left in it. Now if the QQQ pull-back does go the way of 4% \u2014 which again is totally in-line with historical trends \u2014 then it\u2019s very possible NVDA could get down there. But at this point, I think earnings is acting like a gravity well and offer some degree of protection against this pull-back we\u2019re seeing in the QQQ.\u00a0\n\nAs to Nvidia (NVDA) technicals, the stock is not only no longer overbought, it is now nearing oversold conditions. It\u2019s not there yet, but it\u2019s getting very close to oversold conditions already. We closed at a 39.49-RSI on the hourly. Now NVDA does have a flare for the dramatic from time to time and might push down to a 20-RSI. We\u2019ve seen that happen seven (7) times in the past year. All seven instances preceded massive moves to the upside. And we\u2019re talking immediate rallies afterward. Could it happen here? Maybe. I think it\u2019s less likely due to the fact that we have earnings coming up next week. That will largely depend on how the QQQ trades tomorrow and Monday. But I do think Nvida does go back toward its highs by the time we arrive at earnings. Take a look at the NVDA chart below. Notice just how explosive oversold conditions are for Nvidia. Whenever NVDA gets down to oversold on the hourly, it explodes higher near-term.\u00a0\n\n# STOP TIMING THE MARKET!\n\nOne last thing I\u2019d like to stress is that none of this above should really be about trying to time the market. I see a lot of comments on Reddit and in my inbox of people using this as a tool to make timed trades. That is almost certainly a losing proposition. I\u2019ll explain why in a more detailed and dedicated page to\u00a0[investing basics](https://sam-weiss.com/investing-basics/). Don\u2019t write this off as some sort of empty adage. It\u2019s not empty words. Trying to trade and/or time NVDA is playing with lava-level fire.\u00a0\n\nNow are there opportunities to enhance returns a little by using a very small subset of capital to leverage oversold trades. Sure. But core-position wise, you should just be long the stock and don\u2019t think about it. There are ways to leverage and enhance your returns without getting screwed by being left on the sidelines. We\u2019ll get to that. If I were on the sidelines right now and wanted to get long NVDA, I would have bought half today minimum. Because at this point it could bottom at any moment. The QQQ has officially pulled back far enough for this to constitute an overbought pull-back by historical stands. 2.5% is on the small side, but it\u2019s technically sufficient. So the next 1% of downside in the market is a high-risk forecast.\u00a0\n\nRemember, the point of this post is to help provide security, confidence and knowledge. It\u2019s not really intended to trade on it. It\u2019s meant to give investors added visibility to their positions and helps explain why certain gyrations are occurring. Will post some thoughts either during or after tomorrow\u2019s trading session.

The RSI was in the 60\u2019s and can be pegged above 80 for a few days before reversing. Which can be seen on the 1D chart for some of these big moves this year.

They were cheap for a reason.\n\n**Main question**\u00a0- I was wondering if I can do a simulation of hypothetical scenario where I had simply invested in index, saving me enormous time in research. If so, please suggest tools/sites?\n\nNote that the amounts and time of entry/exit are not constant, so I can't use the simple lumpsum or periodic investing calculators that assume regular constant amounts and intervals.\n\nWith 50 stocks in my portfolio, I wonder if it is just mirroring the index, or generating any real alpha. Obviously, when I buy something, I am highly convinced of my reasonings. So, it's hard to part with what I feel are \"my gems\".

It usually occurs if there's a problem with the model, and as soon as that problem is found out, the model gets corrected and alpha vanishes - which is why CAPM keeps getting additional terms tacked onto it. The other time you might see some alpha is when someone has an unexpectedly good or bad quarter and then next quarter their performance regresses to the mean. *Every* stock, security, mutual fund and hedge fund, without exception, runs into this exact problem - that is to say, the fact that alpha is illusory at absolute best. At the end of the day, if you don't have a diversified portfolio, what you're really doing is putting some chips on red or black. For retail investors, Alpha is not predictable, it's not a better approach, it's not something you can reasonably chase in any meaningful way, and it may not actually exist at all, so you may as well not worry about it. For commercial investors, the only Alpha that genuinely exists is the insider trading that happens before some kind of announcement. But by the time *you* hear about it, it's already priced in.\n\nSecond, it doesn't quite seem like you have a diverse portfolio. It sounds like you have a few concentrations in specific industrial sectors, so your investment correlation is quite high, which may increase your beta and standard deviation outside of an optimal or near-optimal envelope. A properly constructed diverse portfolio would do something like this in terms of your risk profile: https://imgur.com/s695O9Q. Ideally, you will have a capital allocation line tangent to the efficient frontier and then you push or reduce your leverage depending on your appetite for risk. But you always want to be tangent to the efficient frontier, either by building a diverse portfolio yourself, or by just buying some ETF which does that for you.\n\nI would suggest that the aggregated legion of MIT math PhDs working for Vanguard and doing nothing but studying a few specific companies and are on the phone with their respective CFOs three times a week are better at assembling a  diverse and efficient portfolio than you or me.
