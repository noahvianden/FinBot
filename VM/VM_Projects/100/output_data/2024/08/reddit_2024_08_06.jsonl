The one for TSLA I'm watching is the 9/20 230C. As of now, there's 51654 contracts worth $675 each or $35M. With a delta of 30, that's associated with 1.55M shares or $310M. (The shorter dated ones can move just as many shares or more but for much less.)\n\nIf TSLA doesn't break $230 those slowly decay away and MM sells those 1.55M shares just for that strike. If TSLA goes past $230 and gets those ITM, then MM has to fully hedge those and increase their shares from 1.55M to 5.16M shares.\n\nThis is why anything with high options volume on a regular basis usually ends at nice round numbers. People buying and selling real shares for portfolios doesn't matter compared to how many shares MM has to hedge for options volume and interest.\n\nAs for the big moves, Say there's a lot of TSLA 230C. As long as we were above that, MM hedges all those calls with lots shares, people feel good with momentum so keep buying more shares and calls. Something bad happens like bad earnings or Japan blowing up and drops it below that 230C. Now MM doesn't have to hedge for those calls anymore, selling all those shares, dropping share price even more. Then momentum is to the downside and now people are selling their calls, buying puts (as evidenced by the elevated VIX) and now MM has to sell/short shares to hedge that way.\n\nThis isn't isolated to TSLA, and you can see the high interest levels on QQQ and SPY as well. Then combine that with the Japan carry trade with people borrowing and investing/speculating billions, you can see how much potential fuckery can happen to the up and down side.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Forgot options from the equation but you're right and thanks for the helpful analysis of TSLA specific options, I hadn't looked at the option chain myself.

Ants marched in disciplined lines, spiders crafted their intricate webs, and beetles polished their exoskeletons, preparing for another day. To the bugs, the world was a vast expanse of wonders and dangers, punctuated by the presence of the Lumbering Giants.  \n\nThe Lumbering Giants, known to humans as people, were both a mystery and a constant source of awe. From the bugs\u2019 vantage point, these colossal beings seemed like living mountains, their movements slow and deliberate, like tectonic plates shifting above. Most bugs couldn\u2019t decide if the Giants were gods or merely part of the natural order, like the wind or the sun.  \n\nGerald, a wise old beetle with a knack for storytelling, often gathered the young bugs around to share tales of the Giants. \u201cSome say they are eternal,\u201d he began. \u201cI have seen them every summer of my life, and they never seem to change.\u201d  \n\nFluffy, a daring young ant, stared up in awe. \u201cLook at the size of it! Do you think it knows we\u2019re here?\u201d \n\nBetsy, a pragmatic spider, scoffed. \u201cThey don\u2019t notice us any more than we notice the dirt beneath our feet.\u201d  \n\nAs the Giant knelt and extended a colossal hand, the bugs couldn\u2019t help but feel the weight of its presence. The Giant\u2019s fingers, each the size of a fallen branch, delicately plucked a leaf, revealing Bugville in all its glory. To the bugs, this simple act was akin to a divine revelation.\n\nThe elder bugs, who had witnessed the Giants\u2019 actions over the seasons, debated their nature. \u201cThey are eternal,\u201d one proclaimed. \u201cI have seen the same Giant every summer of my life. They never age, never falter.\u201d\n\nFluffy, ever curious, whispered, \u201cMaybe they live forever, like the points of light in the sky. Or maybe they just move so slowly compared to us.\u201d\n\nThe debate was interrupted as the Giant, having completed its inscrutable task, rose and lumbered away. In its wake, the ground bore the deep imprints of its footsteps. Soon, water collected in these shallow craters, and a small ecosystem began to flourish. Detritivores moved in, feeding on the organic matter stirred up by the Giant\u2019s presence. To the bugs, it seemed like a miracle\u2014a sudden oasis of life.\n\nGerald, reflecting on the encounter, gathered the young bugs once more. \u201cWe may never understand the Giants,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cTo us, they are like the wind or the sun. But maybe it is enough to know that we share this world with them, however briefly.\u201d\n\nThe young bugs nodded, their imaginations sparked by Gerald\u2019s words. Fluffy, ever the dreamer, wondered aloud, \u201cDo you think they ever look at us and wonder what we are?\u201d\n\nBetsy, spinning her web, smiled. \u201cPerhaps they do, Fluffy. Perhaps they do.\u201d\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows over Bugville, the bugs noticed something unusual. A Giant returned, carrying a large, cylindrical object. It placed the object on the ground and left. The bugs gathered around, curious.\n\nThe object began to hum and emit a soft, warm glow. The bugs felt an unfamiliar sense of calm wash over them. Fluffy marveled, \u201cThis must be another gift from the Giants! Look how it glows like the Moon, making our night bright and warm!\u201d\n\nGerald nodded slowly, his eyes reflecting the light. \u201cPerhaps it is, Fluffy. Perhaps it is.\u201d\n\nAs night fell, the bugs of Bugville settled into a peaceful slumber, bathed in the gentle glow of the Giant\u2019s mysterious gift. To them, it was a time of tranquility and wonder. Little did they know, the object was simply a human\u2019s forgotten flashlight, left behind and slowly losing its charge.\n\nBugville thrived in its newfound light, blissfully unaware of the impermanence of their miracle.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "that was heartwarming, I was expecting the Giant left behind some kind of RAID bug deathtrap for Bugville- the relief spread through me in an awesome wave.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "yeah i wanted to make people just a little nervous hah. im not gonna kill any bugs don\u2019t worry.\n\nalthough imagining what diatomaceous earth would do firsthand.. yikes", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4087267220020294}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.499027818441391}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34433045983314514}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11824533343315125}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.059367746114730835}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26778486371040344}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19500486552715302}, {"body": "Sold my Nike I bought when Tesla got called away at 240.\u00a0\n\nTook 2% loss but got my Tesla shares back.\u00a0", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1820851090138505570?s=46&t=mG-wx8ewMg03AyZIsmD4-g\n\nElon became streetfighter lawyer himself lmao", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "RICO act ? lol\n\n![gif](giphy|RMxqGPaXWey2I|downsized)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nMore and more delusional as this goes on.
