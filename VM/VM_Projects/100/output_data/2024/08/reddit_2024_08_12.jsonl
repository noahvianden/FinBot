Here's how they are used across different types of ML:\n\n* Deep Learning: These GPUs excel in training deep neural networks, which are fundamental to many areas of machine learning beyond LLMs, including image recognition, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.\n\n* Computer Vision: NVIDIA's flagship GPUs are commonly used for tasks like object detection, image classification, segmentation, and more. They are particularly valuable in applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and security systems.\n\n* Generative Models: They are also used to train generative models such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), which are applied in areas like image and video synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation.\n\n* Scientific Computing: These GPUs are employed in scientific research for simulations, modeling, and data analysis across disciplines like physics, chemistry, biology, and climate science.\n\n* Reinforcement Learning: NVIDIA's GPUs are often used to train agents in complex environments, such as those found in robotics, gaming, and finance, where the computational power is needed to handle the large amounts of data generated during simulations.\n\n* Natural Language Processing (NLP): Beyond LLMs, GPUs are used for a variety of NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, translation, and text summarization.\n\n* High-Performance Computing (HPC): In addition to ML, these GPUs are crucial for HPC tasks, where they accelerate workloads like molecular dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other simulations that require significant computational resources.\n\n* Data Analytics: These GPUs can also accelerate large-scale data processing tasks, enabling faster analysis and insights in fields like finance, marketing, and healthcare.\n\nIn summary, NVIDIA's flagship GPUs are powerful tools that support a wide array of machine learning and computational tasks beyond just LLMs, making them highly valuable across multiple industries and applications.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31622225046157837}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.49982255697250366}, {"body": "Amazon don't need AI.

AI might be useful to train a system initially, but probably wont be needed once the system is in production phase because at that point, it becomes more of a liability. \n\nSo what does this mean? It means that at some point, it will become cheap to run. In fact, once you take out the training and initial processing, it becomes like any other program... and you will be able to host your implementation pretty much anywhere. How much can you make from that?\n\nNot only that, but once the world sees one or two successful implementations, making new ones will become easier and easier because they will know exactly what tools they need and how to train it. Every single open source advocate will start making these \"mini\" trained AI's and you will be able to get them for free. You can already get all sorts of pre-trained AI modules for use in specific programs for free (for instance, stable diffusion).\n\nEventually you will be able to simply get one prepackaged for trivially cheap. Basically the same trajectory as early factory automation (a la industrial revolution) or early internet. Both were tremendous human advances, but who realized most of the money? Hard to say right? For instance, most of the early internet companies failed and the ones who hit it big, were not necessarily the ones doing the innovation rather it was the ones with best marketing, product placement and who got away with copying (at the time, IP rights were weak).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well inference also needs cloud compute (at least for the bigger models) but judging from the dropping prices for that there seems to be already a race to the bottom on for that? All these GPUs companies are hoarding just in case, no point in having them sit idly, so everyone and their dog are offering GPUs for rent while they figure out what they should use them for eventually? \n\nAnd once we get neural engine chips like Apple M3 in most phones and laptops models will run increasingly on the offline edge. No cloud compute needed.\n\nSo that leaves training the next gen GPT5 class models.
