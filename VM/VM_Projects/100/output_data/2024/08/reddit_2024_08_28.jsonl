Here\u2019s why:\n\n### **Benefits to Company Performance:**\n\n1. **Higher Profit Margins**: Improved yields mean that more functional chips are produced from each wafer, reducing the cost per chip. This directly contributes to higher profit margins, which is favorable for the company's financial performance.\n\n2. **Increased Supply**: With higher yields, NVIDIA can produce more units of their GPUs, which is particularly important during high-demand periods, such as the launch of a new product. Meeting or exceeding market demand helps maximize revenue and market share.\n\n3. **Better Product Quality**: Yield improvements often correlate with higher product reliability and performance consistency. This can lead to fewer defects, returns, or warranty claims, which not only saves costs but also enhances the company\u2019s reputation and customer satisfaction.\n\n4. **Stronger Market Position**: Successfully improving yields before release can give NVIDIA a competitive edge, allowing them to deliver more products at a lower cost or higher quality compared to competitors. This can reinforce their market leadership in sectors like gaming, AI, and data centers.\n\n5. **Positive Investor Sentiment**: If NVIDIA can demonstrate that they are efficiently managing production and improving yields before product release, it boosts investor confidence. This often leads to positive sentiment in the stock market, potentially driving up the stock price.\n\n6. **Smooth Product Launch**: Improved yields can help ensure that a product launch proceeds smoothly without supply shortages or quality issues. A successful launch strengthens brand reputation and supports continued sales momentum.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nWhen NVIDIA makes yield-improving changes to a mask before a product release, it usually leads to better overall company performance. The company benefits from higher profit margins, increased supply, better product quality, and stronger market positioning\u2014all of which are likely to have a positive impact on financial results and investor confidence.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Buy time", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09963306784629822}, {"body": "this is non sense, earlier the day, it's ANF, now NVDA. \nis this meme market afterall?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "ANF was even more of a joke honestly.

Investors want to see demand filled so we can see more confirmed sales roll in, not them failing desperately to make chips they sold for tons of profit a year ago lol.

Approximately 44.643 billion net profit after employees paid and all industry costs on their public earnings report document. This is both directly on nvidia and microsofts business website by the way. That's still a gap of about 350% scale up in profit that Nvidia has to hit to even break even with microsofts profit, again its a comparative thing, microsoft stock is worth less than nvidia but they made 3.5x more money. The reason nvidias price is so high is because investors expect that 350% profit to come soon, and then after another big growth but the issue is the H200 production chain is failing.\n\nNvidia next proposed board uses MU brand hb3me memory. MU literally is the first to make them and first to sell to Nvidia and nvidia signed a contract with them to buy every single chip they make MU has announced this contract and they will sell every single chip to nvidia up until 2025, nvidia already pre paid its a done and punlic deal, MU is unable to meet their demands, and buyers of Nvidia are still waiting in large quantities to get their next gen h200's because of the delay. Nvidia is still selling last generation tech the h100, which is where their current revenue is from and thats great even still. But Nvidia has already started pre selling these new h200 chips artificially inflating their revenue to massive amounts before they can even make them.... its a pre sale false sense of profit, if the production falls through, which it did, you'll see within a year the destruction of it if they do not find a solution soon, and we have yet to hear any concrete solutions for this problem. They are still making the h100s and selling those old tech for good profit which is nice, but the hype of the stock is not on last generation tech... It's the next gen. H200 is the product everyone wants to see actually being delivered faster since they already paid their money for them last year and still they havent been shipped, still deadlines get pushed back further and further, not a good look to maintain this scale of growth. H200s just started arriving in July, so they are making progress, but its still approximately 300% down from the demand, as per Nvidia announcement of the delay. So we know they have massive pre orders, and are unable to produce 3/4th of the boards THEY ALREADY SOLD, and its confirmed that the delay will likely go until 2025 UNLESS they make some sort of deal with Samsung or another company but they are having major issues with the restrictions over seas and the fact that Samsung memory is significantly less desirable so then theyd have to back track on their expected performance of the h200s and we could be looking at massive backlash from the buyers paying 100k per board if they preform 20% worse than they promised....", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "that\u2019s an essay to still just post wrong numbers, are you looking at last years report or something?

Samsung and others are still slacking behind. Nvidia cannot finish the H200s without the hb3me memory. Emphasis on the 3, they have plenty of other companies supplying hb2me for the old out dated h100s that are extremely inefficient, nvidia is still selling a lot of them, but a majority of everyone wants the h200s and they wanted them at the start of 2024 and they didnt deliver the first ones until July, and they were faulty, so now theres massive call backs and redesigning and now thats how we got another 3 month delay announced earlier this week lol. MU has announced that Nvidia requires upwards of 4x the memory that MU can produce to even BREAK EVEN with the boards that they Already Pre Sold.... soooo that's obviously an issue. Nvidia announced they are working with Samsung to try and work out a deal to make the hb3me chips they need but it isnt going well because samsung is a shit asian company that makes low budget low grade memory that degrades quickly and has statistically preformed close to 40% WORSE than MU american made chips. So then thay becomes another problem when nvidia pre sold all these h200 boards promising 40% power efficiency increase and then suddenly they are delayed, broken, and using lower class chips to finish them because they failed their promises... customers like Tesla have already recalled and tried to pull their funding back from Nvidia because of this, and Tesla is MASSIVE client for Nvidia, soon other companies will also withdraw and cut their losses if nvidia cant get their shit together soon. If they can, i wouldn't be surprised to see nvidia reaching 60bil revenue easily. But the facts are stacked against them right now.

{"title": "Are Small Accounts Doomed There's No Edge in This Market", "selftext": "The idea of starting with a small account, growing it into $100k+ port is the dream for most but it seems so unrealistic, doing this full-time past a hobby/for fun.\n\nThe capital needed to make enough profit to live-off means you already have substantial capital made elsewhere, not starting the race with a small portfolio. Am up 30% for the year, percentage wise is phenomenal, but it's not going to change my life in anyway. Then there's trade-offs to everything, every variable perfectly calculated by machines priced to perfection.\n\nThere's only a few strategies when used in certain environments have left in mind which may give *edge:*\n\n1. Diagonal spreads opened on day of earning's to capitalize on high IV, receive the most amount of premium, and buy longer dated calls 3-6m out which will be unaffected by IV crush. For example, S reported today so would open $26/$29 (8/30-12/20), capturing the higher than usual IV premium, long legs dodge IV crush, and can keep selling against while price moves in my direction. It's utilizing high IV but the trade-off is can only do this every 3 months.\n2. Selling covered calls when VIX spikes, most likely shares have tanked in price tremendously, buy shares and sell a far OTM covered call which will offer exceptional premium because VIX is high.\n3. Selling cash-secured put when VIX spikes, if price drops further you're getting an exceptional deal on shares and hefty premium to cover downside.\n\nIt's basically selling volatility, taking advantage of market event and going long. However, cannot for the life of me decipher any way to get ahead quickly. The time it would actually take would be better spent building a business, earning wealth elsewhere, then coming back to the market, which makes it much easier since need much less percentage gain to be meaningful return, and can utilize basic strategies keeping it ridiculously simple even just selling covered calls for a living.\n\nFrom my experience with other structures I found noticeable cons:\n\n* Neutral structures don't profit much, safe but small returns. Losses can be far more costly than the wins. Win 3, lose 1, back to square one.\n* LEAPS are a huge commitment, can go good for a year and next year wipe out all of your gains. Begs the question why not just buy shares eventually will get burned using such leverage.\n* Long calls/puts the price wont go to infinity, no need to overpay, this where spreads come into the picture. Diagonals, calendars, debt spreads are great for trading but have to be right about direction. There's no edge here it's just better way of taking bets, if you're good at predicting direction can do well but with a small portfolio again is it even worth trading?\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Maybe this is widely known but those getting rich off  small portfolio seems to only happen with luck, taking on so much risk things very well could've gone very wrong. So the more capital have to work with, the less ballsy plays need to take, and 1-2% suddenly becomes very lucrative returns. However, if you're at this point you're not going to be needing this money to live-off of like a job anyways.
