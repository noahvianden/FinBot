Here's why:\n\n1. **Opportunity Cost**: If your investments are returning over 20%, this is significantly higher than the typical mortgage interest rate, which might be around 3-6%. By paying off your house, you're essentially getting a guaranteed return equivalent to your mortgage interest rate, which is much lower than what your investments are yielding.\n2. **Compounding Returns**: The power of compound interest works more effectively with higher returns. By keeping your money invested in assets that generate 20% or more, you accelerate the growth of your wealth.\n3. **Leverage**: A mortgage is a form of leverage, allowing you to use borrowed money to invest elsewhere. If your investments are significantly outpacing your mortgage interest, it makes sense to maintain that leverage to grow your net worth faster.\n4. **Liquidity**: Investments are typically more liquid than home equity. If you pay off your house, that money is tied up in the property and not easily accessible without taking on new debt.\n\nHowever, this strategy assumes that your investments are relatively stable and can continue to deliver high returns. If there\u2019s significant risk associated with those investments, it might be safer to consider a balanced approach\u2014partially paying down your mortgage while also investing.\n\nThis approach is also contingent on other factors, such as your risk tolerance, the security of your income, and your long-term financial goals.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46629559993743896}, {"body": "Wow dude, calm down.

{"title": "ROTH IRA: All in on TESLA ", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/iwzq21zymfkd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=311c2c41cc913df1863fd39c03236c1ed7c0964c\n\n**I Believe in the MUSK**\n\n\u00a0\n\nI think Tesla is a highly undervalued play right now, especially in the AI sector.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Anecdotal Evidence**\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m starting with my own experience of traveling the world and seeing Teslas everywhere. I\u2019ve been to over 30 states and noticed their prevalence in each one. Beyond the U.S., I\u2019ve spotted Teslas in countries like Greece, Albania, the Philippines, Korea, and Germany. Even in some of the most remote parts of these countries, Teslas are present. To me, this shows the strength of the brand. Globally, people recognize Tesla as a leading car company, appreciating both its designs and the values it stands for.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Elon Hate**\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlongside this, there\u2019s the fact that Elon Musk\u2014loved and hated by many\u2014is the face of the company. Whether you like him or not, you can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s extremely well-known. And as they say, \u201cno press is bad press.\u201d Everyone knows Musk and the cars he represents. Some may argue that his polarizing nature could harm Tesla, but I believe that people ultimately buy good vehicles, and their feelings about the CEO won\u2019t stop Tesla\u2019s success. Look at other tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg or Tim Cook, who have faced severe public backlash, yet their companies have continued to grow. Public opinion can change; Zuckerberg, for example, is now seen sporting gold chains and Yeezy clothing. I believe something similar will happen with Musk. Eventually, the dislike for him will either fade or turn into admiration. Don\u2019t you want to be part of the Musky baby babe?\n\n\u00a0\n\n**2035 EV Mandates**\n\n\u00a0\n\nCurrently, 13 states have EV mandates for 2035 or earlier, and 45 states offer EV incentives. This means that people will have to switch to electric vehicles whether they like it or not. In these states alone, the population exceeds 60 million\u2014that\u2019s already 18% of our entire country set to go EV within the next decade, and this number will only grow as more states pass similar laws. Personally, I think people should choose EVs because they\u2019re a superior platform to ICE vehicles, not just because of mandates. Having visited several of these states, I can\u2019t stress enough how many Teslas I see on the road\u2014you can\u2019t drive for long without spotting one. They\u2019re everywhere.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Self-Driving**\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe all know Elon has repeatedly promised that self-driving technology would already be here, and I agree it\u2019s frustrating. No one really knows when it will arrive. However, no other company is operating at Tesla\u2019s level, and it\u2019s only a matter of time until they solve the self-driving puzzle. Tesla has over 5 million vehicles constantly running and recording data, with that number only growing. No other automaker is collecting this amount of real-time, global data. Watch current videos of Tesla\u2019s latest FSD (Full Self-Driving) version\u2014you\u2019ll be amazed at how close we are to success. A good YouTube channel to check out is AIDRIVR.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi**\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnce self-driving is perfected, RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi trucks will revolutionize the industry. We already know that ride-hailing is a massive business with high demand. RoboTaxis will be able to undercut the cost of human drivers so significantly that most people will choose them 9 out of 10 times. Plus, a new segment of the market will emerge\u2014people who start ride-hailing because of the reduced cost. We\u2019ve seen the success of companies like Waymo, which has a strong fanbase and continues to grow. Once Tesla nails self-driving and offers a superior service worldwide, it\u2019s poised to dominate. The same goes for semi-trucks\u2014companies will be eager to get their hands on them to comply with 2035 EV mandates, earn tax credits, and reduce costs by eliminating the need for human drivers and all associated expenses. Imagine a world where Optimus robots load a Tesla semi, which then drives itself across the country and is unloaded at another store\u2014completely automated. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re too far off from that reality.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Charging Infrastructure**\n\n\u00a0\n\nTesla has over 50,000 chargers worldwide, many of which are Superchargers. No other car company has this level of infrastructure and support. This is huge\u2014other companies, like Rivian, are already signing deals with Tesla to use their chargers. Companies will be forced to stay competitive in the EV market. Consumers want to drive long distances; the U.S., for example, is built on the highway system. People don\u2019t want to feel limited by their EVs, stuck within city limits, or forced to wait hours for their cars to charge. As people gradually switch to EVs, they\u2019ll demand the support that only Tesla can currently provide.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Optimus**\n\nOptimus is still in its early stages, but it signals that Tesla has completed the consumer car phase of its business. Now, they just need to keep producing the S, 3, X, Y models, and the Cybertruck, making them more affordable. With that under control, Tesla has the bandwidth to focus on new ventures\u2014where the real gains lie. Tesla can leverage the real-world AI they\u2019ve been training on driving data and apply it to Optimus. Every company is looking to reduce human labor and automate more tasks. Whether you like it or not, this shift is happening, and it\u2019s wise to get on board by owning some stock. Fast food, for example, has been gradually reducing human interaction with touch screens\u2014many people now rarely interact with a person. With advancements in AI, robots like Optimus will become a part of our daily lives, running factories and handling repetitive tasks. While this will impact the job market in the short term, people will need to adapt and learn new skills, just like with any major societal shift. I don\u2019t see widespread adoption happening anytime soon. I predict that by 2030, Optimus will be working in factories, but day-to-day use is likely at least a decade away. Still, in the long term, I believe it\u2019s inevitable.  Imagine a world where Optimus is your wife's bf and you can spend all day gambling on stocks as he takes care of her.\n\nEDIT\\*\\*\n\nforgot to add this cus im regarded\n\n**Energy Sector**\n\n  \nTesla's energy sector more than doubled its profits since the last quarter, it will continue to grow and eventually outpace the automotive sector. Many people think Teslas is just an automotive company not realizing it's only one piece of the pie and will continue to play less and less into the company's profits. Tesla will eventually be regarded as a name like Apple with many sectors encapsulated under the name. Self Driving, Robots, Energy, etc. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is just some bs I wrote up off my dome while slacking at work. My prediction is a 3 trillion market cap by 2030, we shall see.

Tesla is selling their vehicles for less than the sensors alone on those vehicles and teslas will eventually have non-geofences full self driving. The calculations are being done in real time by AI trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of real time driving footage from real people. Once completed a Tesla will be able to encounter any road, any situation, anywhere and solve it where as the other companies are focused on tiny areas just to get it working.

Not to say we won't have major issues to deal with, I could also see the mandates getting rolled back in certain states. \n\nThe goal of the electric car is to never have to think about charging it, eventually, everyone will change at home when they go to bed, so why would you want to go somewhere to fill up? The only time most people will be charging away from home will be over long distances which is what superchargers are for and eventually battery tech will improve, we already have comparable ranges to ICE vehicles. The new model 3 long range gets 363 which is more than my small Toyota.\n\n The 38% revenue from carbon credits is just from a recent quarter most likely because they have a backlog of them and this is a rough time for sales so they need to claim them in order to help prop up the business while theyre suffering. Tesla will survive long term.\n\n The vehicle sector of tesla is definetly the most prominent portion currently, but long term it will not be. That is why they market themselves as a technology company, they ened ot sell the cars to people first for them to want to purchase FSD eventually once it gets better. Having an EV will lead them down the road into Tesla energy by having battery walls installed or solar tiles on their roofs. The energy sector profits more than doubled last quarter for tesla, this is the beginning of the transition of profits into other sectors.\n\n Teslas are already cheap enough a new model 3 costs about the same as a toyota corolla, not to say 26k is cheap by any means. I definetly wouldnt buy one new but a lot of people would the F150 is the most popular vehicle in america and costs 45k+.

Honestly, I would be concerned if I see a chart like this considering the recent rally and the price rebounding from the lows of August 5th. \nTake a look at the following \nMETA it has cleared and price is above , area of consolidation it could break the 540 channel soonish\nNVDA , it has cleared above the 8, and the 21ema \nNFLX , it cleared above , same \nTSLA , same thing \nEven DELL is in a 6 day time period of consolidation but above the 8, and the 21 EMA \nAAPL , same story \nAMZN , same , etc \nSo, unless you think that MSFT is due to take off and clear above those EMA to catch up with the other tech stocks , I have a minor concern here.
