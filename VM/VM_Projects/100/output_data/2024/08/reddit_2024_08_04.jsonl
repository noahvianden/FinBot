Do you not read about specific places and choose where *you yourself* would like to go (God forbid reading a book), based on *your own* feelings, mood, expected experiences etc.?\n\nYou might as well open a random website and follow their every step for \u201dthe best holidays experience\u201d.\n\nUnless you have no personality and originality at all, it'll be boring as fuck.
