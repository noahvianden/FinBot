{"title": "Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robots", "selftext": "Ross Gerber, a longtime Tesla shareholder, has expressed concern about the company's performance, stating that the used-car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a \"quagmire,\" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.\n\nGerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. \"I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,\" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.\n\n\"It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,\" Gerber said. \"Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.\"\n\nDespite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. \"The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,\" Gerber remarked. \"Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house.\" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.\n\nSource: https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-investor-ross-gerber-says-234413902.html#:\\~:text=The%20shareholder%2C%20Ross%20Gerber%2C%20has,worth%20of%20his%20Tesla%20shares.", "id": "1f2jn76", "created_utc": 1724771782.0, "score": 457, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "Humanoid robots vs tasked designed robots is a horrible idea, it\u2019s like asking a computer to use a keyboard to communicate with another computer.", "score": 142, "replies": [{"body": "Dude's hoping for a breakthrough to come along so he can sell iRobot. \n\nHe wants everyone to have one in their homes, doing chores, helping grandma... and paying him a monthly service fee plus updates and maintenance, and probably thinks it's a better sell to promise a catch all product than specifically designed machines for specific purposes, because we already have those and Elon sucks at inventing a new wheel... while admittedly being really good at buying one and hiring smart people to hammer away for him.\n\nThe goal is also probably to go \"look at this human looking robot that can replace your factory floor.

{"title": "Intel board member quit after differences over chipmaker's revival plan", "selftext": "The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter.\n\nLip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to \"reprioritize various commitments\" and that he remained \"supportive of the company and its important work,\" in a regulatory filing on Thursday.\n\nThe former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations.\n\nOver time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. \n\nThe circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts.\n\nTan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report.\n\nIntel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders.\n\nFormer Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach.\n\nThis month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth.\n\nIntel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported.\n\nIntel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said.\n\nTo cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results.\n\nThe layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts.\n\nGelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022.\n\nTo Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago.\n\nTan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people.\n\nIntel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the \"only-the-paranoid-survive\" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.\n\nIntel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027.\n\nAn attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.\n\nWithout Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business.\n\nTan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said.\n\nIntel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers.\n\nhttps://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/intel-board-member-quit-after-differences-over-chipmakers-revival-plan/amp_articleshow/112843092.cms", "id": "1f2ji5j", "created_utc": 1724771447.0, "score": 407, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "Not a great article for shareholders.

Looking into Holographic DUV rather than going all in on EUV. This is what caused them to lose their market position. This was the result of bean counters hoping the cheaper process would be good enough, but while it worked the yield rates were too low causing it to become uneconomically viable and forcing intel to not shrink their chips for multiple generations to maintain economic viability.\n2. Some bug/oversight causing 13th & 14th gen chips to damage themselves slowly with overvoltage issues. They say they have it under control now with the new microcode update. Only time will tell if that is true.\n\nMistakes INVESTORS are worried about that we don't know the outcome of yet\n\n1. Massive investments into new fabs without a clear roadmap, clientele, etc who will use their contracting services. This makes their balance sheet look like shit and if they don't get some big clients this will be a gigantic waste of money.\n2. Their mistakes and anti-consumer approaches are degrading a core customer base in the server sector. AMD is also going after the server market more aggressively. This puts their long term market position in jeopardy.\n3. They are making a lot of long term bets on things like GPU's that are hemmoraging money. While I believe this is probably best for them in the long term; investors want their money this quarter and these types of plays are just not what they want to see.\n\nReasons to be optimistic\n\n1. Their current chips have honestly caught up to AMD. The 14th gen that aren't killing themselves match or exceed the top AMD chips in a wide variety of tasks. 7800X3D is overall best gaming GPU but after that there is a long list of great performance/$ cpu's from intel.\n2. The 9000 series from AMD is overall a bit of a dud. VERY little benefit over the 7000 series which a large part of the 14th gen already was beating. The 7800X3D still best for consumers and while most of the benefits for the 9000 series is for servers and heavey multi-threaded workloads the jump isn't particularly impressive and well below what we normally expect for a generational leap. If 15th generation even an average boost compared to 14th gen it's VERY likely intel takes a clear lead in the market.\n\nMy take. Intel is making multiple long term plays and people are getting super ancy because they have had 2 major mistakes in the last decade. These are really risky gambles with hundreds of billions of dollars and if even 1 of these turns out to be a complete failure it will be a huge issue for the company. By end of 2025 first service fabs will be online, battlemage gpu's will be out, and we will know if 15th gen is better than 9000 series or if they also stumble like AMD on this generational update.\n\nGiven the massive hits in their recent stock, there likely is a lot of upside potential IF they pull it off. The idea 'they are risk adverse' to me doesn't really track with their current heavy investment strategy. The culture might be 'risk adverse' but they are playing with fire here. Messing up and having another micro-code issue is something they CAN'T afford. AMD's messups are giving them an opportunity to regain their footing and we won't know how this plays out until probably end of next year.\n\nI expect the stock to go down or stay put until we see how these bets pay off and any investment in INTEL is just betting on this stuff working out. Only project that has me super worried for them is the contract fabs. It's REALLY not clear who they would be getting contract work from. Unless they get an Nvidia, Qualcomm, etc style client I honestly DON'T know how they can justify the cost and I just don't see any of those companies leaving TSMC in a serious capacity. There just aren't many customers in the world that can even use this service and stealing them from TSMC won't be easy.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "The 9000 series being better for enterprise/Linux is huge, its just going to lead to AMD taking more of intel enterprise marketshare which is where the real money is.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The 9000 series is better than 14th gen in those tasks, 9000 series though is meant to be compared to Intel 15th gen which will come out later this year.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "to add to your last point, there's Samsung who is the only viable second option.

Did this lead you to advocate for or against brexit?\n\nIt also would not be impossible to see fiscal integration in the Eurozone alone, but politically this would be very difficult to achieve and I am unsure what the effects would be for countries that are in the internal market but not the Eurozone. \n\nAlso, it is not even the German people who benefit, it is the German capitalist class. Getman trade surplus is explained by their high levels of inequality and transfers from the household sector to the business sector through various tax laws and other indirect transfers.\n\nGermany as a whole would likely be better off in an integrated EU where policy is coordinated. After all, true benefits of comparitive advantage only comes when trade distortions are removed.\n\nI think there is in general a very lackluster understanding of trade within the EU, which complicates the solution to this problem.
