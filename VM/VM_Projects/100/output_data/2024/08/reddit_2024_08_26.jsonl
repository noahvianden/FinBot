{"title": "Why Nvidia is undervalued", "selftext": "**Let me start with the conclusion (and that this isn't financial advice)**\n\n* My conservative price prediction for Nvidia is $164 in the next 12 months\n* Don't expect It a straight line rise, historic annual volatility for the stock is %45.37 (sample period 2010-01-01 to 2024-08-02 ) and this has been the case even when the stock traded in single digit prices.\n* I estimate topline revenue of \\~200b for CY2025 which is FY ending January 2026. This is approximately 0.2% of current total global GDP. This revenue estimate is more aggressive than Wall Street projections but i believe it'll be more accurate.\n\n**Why am i sharing this and who am I**\n\nI've been working in tech for the past 20 years, technical degree first and business school later. For the past 10 years working almost exclusively on various ML products in big tech companies (think meta, google, twitter). My job requires technical aptitude, so i'm not a marketing type and can see through the usual sales hype. I also understand the evolution of these types of products (s curve). At the same time my job also requires me to understand adoption cycles, how to commercialize technologies and to develop some sense for what markets are willing to pay for or not.\n\nI don't sell or do courses, lessons or ask you to sign up for anything. It's not my field and i have no interest in it either. I share for the intellectual challenge, to be helpful, and to leave a record of my predictions for accountability.\u00a0\n\nAs far as my valuation philosophy, i really don't care for P/Es and i think they are a very lazy and inaccurate way to try to understand how under or overvalued a stock is. If you've invested based on P/Es over the past decade you would have ended with slow growing stock that mostly went no where, and missed on all the opportunities that rapidly appreciate it. If you think people are overpaying for a stock, unless you have an insight that you think they don't, then consider that they might be overpaying for a reason, and no one is going to sell you a stock they think is valued at x for less.\u00a0\n\nI also don't bind any of my analysis on other psychological comforts like what size market cap a company is. All those are biased anchors. There are some herd-like convergence naturally on some of these things but none of them drive the value whatsoever. Consider that the total value of all the US stock market 50 years ago is now the same as a few of the biggest companies collective daily moves potentially. There is no rule that says a company needs to be capped at X market cap. Ultimately, the value of a company is the total area under the curve, the curve being the cumulative cash it can generate over time. There might be deviations here and there, there might be external market and macro effects that influence that, but ultimately things converge to cash generated and earnings.\n\nFinally, with respect to what's being done on Wall Street, and it serves its function, you have to understand that everything is a product of its context. The fact that an estimate comes from Wall Street is less indicative of the true value of a company and more indicative of just how Wall Street works. You have to consider the people who work in the industry, what's their background, what tools they use, what incentives they have .....etc . In the same manner that if you put something in a meet grinder you can predict what the output is going to look like, every industry has a systematic aspect to it that has a large impact on the output. This doesn't mean that the output is wrong, but it does mean that it is skewed and biased, and you have to contextualize against the bias to really make any use of it.\n\n**How did i come up with this estimate?**\n\nI took three different approaches and they all triangulated to $164 in next 12 months. I have a low/high value but i don't believe in caveated forecasts, my philosophy is a forecast is one figure that encapsulates total risk\n\n1. DCF model for the company using my growth assumptions based on my experience in the industry\n2. Estimating total AI spend and attributing how much of that will go to NVDA over the next 5 years. What i did here was list the top use cases for GPUs (beyond just LLMs) across 10 different sectors, to try to size the total spend in the AI market. I then broke that down as how i expect it to be allocated across the value chain from software costs, to operations, ML engineers, servers....etc and of course chips. I then further adjusted with assumptions on % market share that NVDA can capture within its segment of the value chain. This gives me potential total projected revenues that NVDA would earn that i then cross-referenced with the 5yr revenue projections from #1 above\n3. The last method is very crude but was more of a sanity check step, which is basically taking the total spend globally and calculating it as a percent of total global GDP just to see if it makes sense (i.e not too large) and it was indeed very reasonable in low single digit percentage.\n\nGenerally, the value driven from AI is going to come along 3 axes:\n\n* Productivity: Self explanatory but this is boosting the productivity of workers in various ways, the most obvious being LLMs like ChatGpt, Claude Sonnet, Opus, Lama...etc\n* Operations: The same thing that was previously done via programming or heuristic/rule based software, can be done using ML in a more cheaper to maintain and improve manner.\n* Quality/Innovation: Complete new innovations as a result from AI. Early on i expect these to come from AI as a tool facilitating discovery, in the future when we get closer to \"super AI\" it's the AI innovating.\n\nIn my estimation i took a conservative approach where i estimated AI spend that would be paid for by cost savings alone, i didn't even factor too much innovation and new use cases unlocked that would open up new markets. I'm confident that those will come along but maybe not in the next year, and frankly the possibilities are so wide and wild that i don't think i can estimate it with any reasonable confidence level so it's pointless to do so.\n\nI'm fairly confident in my estimate, but keep in mind nothing is ever 100%. And a recession could drastically influence this as it would impact overall spend. As of right now i think it's extremely unlikely for it to drop below 80 (P.S this analysis was before the recent market correction), but it is possible. If there is a miss the market will overreact, if there is geopolitical threat the market will overreact. The antitrust stuff i'm not worried about at all, these companies always navigate those issues with very minimal impact when looking at medium and long term. In a way, the risks for NVIDIA are the risks of the market in general, not a lot specific to the company itself. Regarding China and Taiwan, i recognize this as a risk factor but i will say this, i'm not the most savvy political thinker but i think if China wanted to invade Taiwan they would have already. I also don't think it's the US keeping them \"in check\" frankly as much as it is their own regional politics and alliances.\n\nNvidia is the strongest in the space, it's the most differentiated, best managed, best supply chain, best vendors, and best sales channels. What they have is years ahead of anyone else with nothing in immediate sight (next 2 years at the very least) changing. They are also recognizing the value of creating an ecosystem and tightly integrated full compliment of hardware<>software for an unbeatable proposition. Other generic manufacturers aren't close, and typical tech companies who have a use for it are only creating narrow hardware very specific to what they do.\n\n**What will happen on earnings day?**\n\nI don't know. My best guess is next earnings is going to be good, after that there might be 1 or maybe 2 earnings that might relatively disappoint, and then up from there. This is based on the the timing i think it'll take for users to start showing the type of results they are getting from their AI related spend. They won't be fully baked in time but will be directionally clear enough to give reassurance. That said, playing earnings is a gamble. You never know who is holding what and how they will react and what information they have, it could go up it could go down.\n\n**Why this bullish and how did you justify this?**\n\nThis all has to do with what AI is about and can do. There is a lot of misunderstanding and and misrepresentation. Just because something appreciates rapidly does not mean it's a bubble, it could be or not, you have to look at the reason of it appreciating. A penny stock getting shilled by a celebrity? Very likely a bubble. A company coming out saying they've tripled their earnings? Not a bubble. Anyways let's talk about AI a bit.\n\n\\~AI Performance Vectors\\~\n\nAI itself is not new, it's user-friendly and usable AI that is new. AI as a concept has been around since the 50s (Professor Marvin Miskey was one of the pioneers in the field, i've also been fortunate enough to sit in a class of his when he was still with us and teaching). The pivotal point in my opinion was around 2016, which is when a new paradigm of computing first became a reality, when the final piece of the puzzle was put in place (GPUs). In my estimation, AI was enabled piece by piece in the following order\n\n1. The algorithms and concepts of machine learning and its various subfields (1950s till today, advancing over time)\n2. Training Data (2000 was the early innings of being able to curate large training data sets, 2010s is when it really picked up)\n3. Compute power (2016 GPUs)\n\nThat's all AI is, data, algorithms and compute power. I first used ChatGPT model (1) around 2018. The model was incomprehensible and i would say had no utility whatsoever. It was really more like a proof of concept. It had none of the level of reasoning that current day LLMs do, and the output was comparable perhaps to a pre-schooler, which is to say very basic in logic, full of grammatical, spelling and syntax errors. Now consider that GPT-3 in around 2023 was what blew everyone's mind away, in a short period of 5 years the improvement went from a pre-schooler to what is roughly the comprehension and ability of a high school grad or even bachelors college candidate.\n\nSuch improvements are not minor step changes, that are order of magnitude (10x) improvements stacked on top of each other. It's hard to comprehend how something like this scales. Not only this, this rate of progress, as of today is still fairly predictable, as in there are no limitations in sight for the next 4-6 years that that would hinder this rate of progress. At this rate, it's highly likely that 2-4 years from now these models will have the reasoning ability and general proficiency and competence of a top level PhD candidate from the best schools on earth. In mere seconds it'll give you what a PhD could do in a month. I'm almost certain of this because of the various improvement vectors and their yet untapped range. For example:\n\n* Compute (probably the biggest vector)\n   * Net compute power will likely increase 20x between now and then (i define net computer as the combination of the increase in raw GPU power as well as improvement in algo efficiency)\n* Data\n   * Most LLMs are currently trained on internet data, a lot of that can be low quality. There is work in progress to create custom high quality data sets (think articles from PhD students, inventors....etc)\n   * There is research and experiments on filling data gaps using extrapolation to increase the density of data\n   * Deeper learning cycles. To give an example, if you as a human are learning a text book you tend to digest chapter by chapter and progress as you build your knowledge. Machine Learning as more akin to skimming the book end to end in layers, which each layer adding more knowledge. There are ongoing experiments to optimize the level of learning considering both approaches.\n* Algorithms\n   * Algos currently operate in a general manner and have almost zero information about the context. Imagine being able to tie in several sources from your work, your role, goals...etc and have that aid the answers\n   * More integrated across applications beyond just access to a web browser\u00a0\n   * Improvements in memory management\n\nThe rate of progress is so rapid, to the point that the benchmark tests that are often though of is highly difficult and would take years to pass are being blown out in months with constant need to reset the standard. These are different benchmarks that have to do with problem solving, reasoning ...etc, think of them as tasks and problem sets that you ask the AI to solve and you compare the AI score to human ability levels.\n\n**\\~AI Applications\\~**\n\nTo make this a bit more fun, and demonstrate the \"AI is not just ChatGPT\", here are a couple of examples. In this\u00a0[paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_genkin.pdf)(2022) researches built an audio classifier that can processes the built in computer microphone of an online game opponent's microphone, and based on the electronic noise from the machine use that noise to know where they were on a Counter-Strike map.\u00a0\n\nAnother\u00a0[example](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002176)\u00a0is playing the Pink Floyd song \"Another Brick in the Wall\" to an experiment subject who has electrodes snickered to their scalp, and using only the electric activity data from the brain while its hearing the song they were able to reconstruct the song in an audio files. The song isn't 100% the same but very close and certainly identifiable.\u00a0\n\nThere are so many more examples and applications of different flavors i just happen to be into music and audio in my free time and these two i find fascinating. But my recommendation if you wish to know what's going on in the field is to forget Wall Street articles and read papers like these. Not every experiment is going to be a commercial successes, but these will help widen your perspective on the activity in the space. In any case imagine that there is a world of information out there which can be accessed if you only had the right interface. Just like there is data flying around in the air that is captured by a wifi card and a computer.\n\n**\\~Pace and Incentives\\~**\n\nI made the comparison earlier to pre-school, high school and PhD level performance. I didn't even mention that to \"incubate\" PhD level performance from one single person you need \\~ 26 years, and the amount of people who have the ability to perform this task are limited. Imagine that you can spin up this level of performance by instantiating a process of an AI agent with one line? This is exactly why unlike many other technologies, industry and not academia is the driving force behind AI research, the returns are just too large to not pursue. Let's take a look at this data for example (From\u00a0\"AI Index Report 2024\"):\n\n* in 2022: Industry produced\u00a032 significant machine learning models, while academia produced only\u00a03.\u00a0\n* In 2023: Industry produced\u00a051 significant machine learning models, while academia produced\u00a015. There were\u00a0an additional 21 models\u00a0resulting from collaborations between industry and academia which represented a new high for such partnerships.\n\n**Use Cases and Applications:**\n\nI quote some studies here and there but i mostly wanted to list to show the breadth of applications of AI. There are many more i haven't listed. But my point in this is not to enumerate every single possibility, but rather show the potential of possibility. The possibility of a path to 3,4 even 5 trillion market cap and where such spend could potentially come from.\n\nGeneral Task Productivity\n\n* Assisted software developers to complete programming tasks around 55% faster (Peng et al., 2023)\n* Access to a generative AI assistant allowed customer support agents to resolve 14% more issues per hour (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023)\n* General error reduction compared to human driven tasks within set categories\n\nFinance and Insurance\n\n* Fraud\n* Price optimization\u00a0\n\nHealthcare:\n\n* Drug discovery\u00a0and simulating drug interactions and efficacy\n* Radio imaging diagnosis\n* Personalized medicine\n\nOperations and Supply Chain:\n\n* Predictive maintenance\n* Resource allocation\n\nEnvironmental:\n\n* Energy optimization and management\n\nSecurity:\n\n* Enhancing cybersecurity measures through real-time threat detection and response.\n* Physical security monitoring and response\n\nAccessibility:\n\n* Improving accessibility for individuals with disabilities through AI-powered tools like voice recognition and text-to-speech\n\nCreative Industries:\n\n* AI in content creation, music composition, and visual arts.\n\nEducation:\n\n* Personalized learning experiences, AI tutors, and intelligent content delivery.\n\nTransportation:\n\n* Advancements in autonomous vehicles and optimized traffic management systems.", "id": "1f1cu94", "created_utc": 1724637174.0, "score": 185, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "Tldr\n\n\n#BULLISH", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you very much.

Anyway we already know that the bulk of Nvidia's revenues come from a handful of major customers i.e. the hyperscalers.\n\n> Saying the market size is limited by the cash flow of their customers is like saying the economy transactions are limited to printed paper and deposits\n\nNot \"printed paper and deposits\", the cash flows are also not paper cash.

Nvidia and their customers are extremely profitable, but yeah in order to keep revenues increasing beyond a certain point, someone will have to take on debt.

I think this is what a lot of people are betting on. But, there is limited evidence of it so far.\n\nHere's another very important thing to mention - Chip spend is for the building out of infrastructure. The spend grew rapidly due to the ramp up in AI efforts. But the chip spend doesn't need to accelerate forever. Even if the annual chip sales stall at $100B/year, AI capacity will still be increasing as more chips get deployed.

Contrary to your self-proclaimed expertise, you don't seem to have any financial knowledge at all.\n\nYou wrote a long essay essentially saying \"AI is cool, it's definitely the future, and so NVidia will moon\".\n\nEven assuming that is 100% true (and I've heard this very recently with Web3 and government-mandated EVs), I don't see any reason to take on Concentration Risk on a single stock. If AI is the future, the AI companies like Meta and Google will do very well. The web services companies like Amazon and Microsoft will do very well (these requests need to go somewhere). The companies selling you phones and computers to access AI will do very well. The banks with AI to reduce lending risks will do very well. The companies building productivity tools will do very well (Salesforce, Adobe).\n\nIn other words, if you truly believe \"AI\" is what you claim it will be, a broad index fund will still capture a large amount of gains, without the Concentration Risk. If the picture you're painting turns out to be true, somebody invested in QQQ or S&P 500 will continue to see >15% CAGR for the next decade, which is plenty enough to make most investors happy.\n\nThis isn't even true for previous hypes. If EVs turned out to be the future, only the EV companies will reap the benefits, not the rest of the market. If Web3 was to replace Web2, then owning Meta stocks wouldn't have done you much good.\n\nAnd there is always Concentration Risk, no matter how good the company. Production might not scale after a certain point. Look at how everyone is begging for new planes and Airbus can't take advantage because they can't build planes fast enough. Look at how NVidia themselves couldn't fill shelves for months during the Bitcoin mining hype. Or large companies may decide to build their own vertically integrated stacks. Sure, hardware performance may not match NVidia's. But anyone who's used an iPhone knows the power of vertically integrated products, meaning the end result can vastly outperform even superior hardware. Or all of NVidia's employees could lose motivation to improve after becoming millionaires. Or Jensen could be in a car accident or be discovered to be best friends with Jeff Epstein. Or China can invade Taiwan. Point is, you never know when you put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nLet me reiterate, I'm not trying to argue with you whether \"AI is the future\" or whether \"NVidia will moon because AI is the future\".

Quarter century later it's 2.5x higher, which means nearly zero actual growth after adjusting for inflation.\n\nIntel's revenue was 33.7B in 2000 and $54.2B in 2023, up 60% while cumulative inflation for the same period is 82.7%, so it's actually down in real terms.\n\n>The real AI demand isn't even here yet. \n\nYou could tell the same about networking at the dotcom boom era. Internet usage has exploded, but the demand for networking equipment didn't. How do you know that Nvidia isn't in the same position as Cisco in 2000?\n\n> Just to give you an idea, Nvidia has signed a contract in 2023 with Indian company:\n\n>60 billion contract for Nvidia with one company from last year.\n\nWhile Reliance Industries is by no means a small company, it's highly unlikely that the deal is anywhere close to $60B. Their revenue is around $120b/year, but the overwhelming majority of that comes from pumping oil and gas, their digital services division only generates $6.8B/year in income, and most of that comes from being the India's largest telecom company rather than selling cloud computing or AI services, so, unless they're betting a decade worth of their income on competing against Amazon, Microsoft and Google, and growing their AI cloud from scratch, they aren't going to purchase $60B worth of GPUs.\n\n>You're looking at like 500+ ChatGPTs needed to be trained and maintained at some point. The AI spend so far is a joke compared to that.\n\nChatGPT's training from scratch only cost OpenAI $100M. Fine tuning an LLM for a domain is orders of magnitude cheaper, and even if every S&P 500 company did train a whole new ChatGPT for them, it would only mean $50B in expenses or about five months' worth of Nvidia's revenue at the moment.

{"title": "Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why", "selftext": "It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.\n\nMorgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a \u201ccontinued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences\u201d for EVs.\n\nTSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.\n\nSince the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,\u201d they wrote.\n\nDespite Tesla\u2019s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).\n\nEarlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThese new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.\n\nIn June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles \"heavily benefit from unfair subsidies\" and present a \"threat of economic injury\" to European EV producers.", "id": "1f1hou9", "created_utc": 1724654664.0, "score": 161, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "I thought Tesla wasn't a car maker, though, but a tech company.\n\n>due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets\n\nAh.", "score": 81, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Yep.

But hey, gotta date and cars matter for that in some circles. I know zero women who have an opinion on Elon musk, but I know several liberal women who drive Teslas. Doesn\u2019t affect the TAM in any meaningful way.\n\nI should hope that when you say \u201cgo F yourself\u201d and you have \u201cF you\u201d money, you would spend it using the legal system to harass the people you told to go eff themselves. \u00a0I would and I often fantasize about using the legal system against the people on my list.\n\nAs for dating dem or repub, well, it sounds like you and these women are firmly rooted in a two party system - which is why it will always be a two party system. \u00a0I\u2019m not convinced that everything hinges on politics outside of the coastal areas of which you speak and unfortunately for the rest of us, that area seems to think they are the gold standard and all else exist at their pleasure. The rest of the world does want the best car. \u00a0Again, not impacting the TAM much.\n\nI hope you know that in today\u2019s political climate social liberal/fiscal conservative has turned into socially vocal liberal/conservative voter. Places like Reddit and (elected?) mods ban one party and not the other for the exact same things, it\u2019s a bias that amplifies one party\u2019s ideologies and silences the other. This is not unique to Reddit. What I mean to say is, I understand why people might think that many, many people are dropping from Tesla\u2019s total addressable market, but I\u2019d wager people have just figured out that if you sound remotely non-liberal, you\u2019ll get either banned by a (elected?) moderator or instantly downvoted if someone quaffs even a thimble of non-liberal speak. Similarly, if you are not anti-Elon you will be called a fanboy or a simp and downvoted - that is fact on the Reddit of today.\n\nI know that you know that coastal liberals are a small fraction of the human population of driving age and with the means/desire to purchase an EV. \u00a0You probably also know that coastal liberals are a subset of liberals and hardly indicative of the feeling of all of the liberals - the coastal are just the most vocal and receive the most press (aren\u2019t the \u201cnews\u201d organizations located on coasts and owned by\u2026liberals?)\n\nOn those lines, certain groups love to scream about controversies. Isn\u2019t it the reaction to a statement that determines whether it is a controversy? I mean, the group receiving the statement and allowing words to hurt them and then repeating them while looking for validation of how wrong it was, that\u2019s the controversy. Do you really not think that Elon calling Biden a damp sock puppet had serious consequences from liberal leaders and news outlets? Not so damp now, eh?\n\nIf EVs were more feasible in terms of range, charging, and price, demand would not be dropping. If demand were not dropping, sales would not drop. \u00a0See above sock puppet comment for why the decrease in demand for teslas is reported as being due to Elon and regurgitated throughout the corners of the internet as gospel.\n\nI\u2019m a hardcore liberal bleeding my heart out for the environment, but because I want to date liberal women and because I don\u2019t like the CEO, I will buy an inferior car.\n\nNot even an American car. To me, that\u2019s the hardest part to swallow. People who advocate for that party but then buy foreign.\n\nThe elaboration helps, but the logic of bleeding for the environment and touting liberal ideals while buying an, by your own admonition, inferior foreign car, is, as stated sarcastically earlier and again now, stellar.\n\nBTW, calling someone the wrong name is a power move.

{"title": "Still meaningful alpha left in NVIDIA?", "selftext": "Nvidia Thesis ($200 PT by Dec-2025, 53% Gross, 38% IRR)\n\nP.S.: Not financial advice, just my quick read-through of fundamentals\n\nNvidia is the world\u2019s largest chip company, spearheading the global AI revolution. It holds a dominant\u00a098% market share\u00a0in Data Center GPUs.\nLast fiscal year, Nvidia generated $60 billion in revenue, with ~80% coming from its Data Center segment. This year, revenue is expected to double to $120B, with ~$105B coming from Data Centers.\nI believe there\u2019s a\u00a0~50% upside\u00a0in the stock by the end of 2025, translating to a 38% IRR. The current street estimates for Nvidia\u2019s Data Center revenue in 2025 and 2026 stand at $150B and $170B, respectively. However, I find these projections conservative. My analysis points to\u00a0$200B in 2026 Data Center revenue, translating to ~$5 EPS in CY2026. Applying a 40x NTM PE (Nvidia\u2019s typical trading multiple) yields a $200 price target by the end of 2025.\nKey Reasons for My Bullish Thesis:\n1. We are in the early stages of the AI Arms Race.\n    * Hyperscalers have spent $200B on capex over the last two years, with plans to spend $700B over the next 2.5 years\u2014much of it allocated to AI and GPUs.\n    * Microsoft currently operates 192 data centers and plans to scale to 900 by 2028. If Microsoft is this aggressive, other hyperscalers are likely to pursue similar aggressive expansion plans.\n    * Large Language Model (LLM) capacity is doubling every six months. For instance, Claude 3\u2019s context window (now 200K tokens) is projected to increase to 1 million tokens by next year. Such improvements necessitate hyper-demand growth for powerful GPUs that can serve both training and inferencing. There isn't any chip, apart from NVIDIA's Blackwell, that can meet this demand.\n2. Supply Chain Insights:\u00a0Have been looking into supply chain data, and all data points reflect\n    * TSMC\u2019s CoWoS production, crucial for Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell architecture, is set to grow from 15,000 units/month in 2023 to 40,000 by late 2024\u2014a ~3x increase.\n    * Applied Materials has revised its HBM packaging revenue forecast from 4x to 6x growth this year.\n    * SK Hynix and Samsung are reallocating 20% of their DRAM production to HBM3e.\n    * AMD\u2019s CEO estimates the AI chip market will be worth $400 billion by 2027; Intel's CEO puts the number at $1 trillion by 2030\n3. Blackwell Product Roadmap:\n    * Nvidia is transitioning from a 2-year to a 1-year product cycle. The B100 and GB200 chips will ship later this year, with the B200 expected in early 2025. This is one of the most aggressive product roadmaps in industry's history. In my estimate, NVIDIA could sell 60,000 units of GB200 systems with $2M per unit price, driving $120B in annual revenue in 2025 from GB200 alone.", "id": "1f1ywwc", "created_utc": 1724705428.0, "score": 123, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "NVDA a $5.5 trillion company in 15 months?

Even if capex spending stopped growing next year, Nvidia is looking at $150b per year revenue with 75% margins. Not bad. Btw, this is already being priced in by Wall Street. This year the forecast is 100% year on year growth, dropping to 50% next year, then 15% in 2026. No one is expecting perpetual hyper growth. On the flip side, any growth above expectations would be a tailwind for Nvidia. \n\n2. Big tech are able to afford massive capex on AI because they are insanely profitable. Cutting capex would just go to their bottom line, resulting in a higher dividend, more stock buy backs, or more investment. Not bad either.\n\nPeople keep making circular arguments about Nvidia when their time would be better spent reading the financial statements of the involved principals.

Until that point, people will continue to pay to get access to the next level. We've barely seen 1 hardware generation so far, and to suggest the nth limit is at 2nd or 3rd generation is... very likely incorrect.\n\n\nModel collapse theory isn't even strong as synthetic data is already useful (for distillation at worst, self-play at best).\n\n\nMy thesis for NVDA is very simple:\n\nMachine learning/accelerated computing (ML/AC) is extraordinarily powerful, more so than anyone thought for the preceding decades before chatGPT (the Alexnet surprise was met with criticism of the dataset well before acceptance of the methods, and that is already over a decade ago).\n\n\nML/AC outcomes are directly associated to scale - nothing exciting happens at small scales, everything we will ever want is behind scale-walls (read Suttons The Bitter Lesson).\n\n\nML/AC infrastructure at SOTA scales is an extraordinarily hard problem from every angle: processing/design, heat, energy, networking, manufacturing, assembly, etc.\n\n\nThose who wish to leverage the capabilities of ML/AC and DO NOT want to deal with the infrastructure problem vastly outnumber those who would welcome the challenge (basically only Mag7 will consider it), and the markets those who DO NOT  want to deal with it are trying to address are essentially infinite - can't list and count markets that don't exist and could never exist without the new technological capabilities ML/AC unlocks.\n\n\nAnd NVDA has owned this moment not due to luck - at least not due to luck to the extent that those who call them lucky believe; Jensen et al have been squarely focused on this no later than alexnet - and they used this conviction to spend serious man-hours/resources developing for 0-billion dollar markets. (Cuda, omniverse, isaac lab, drive sim, etc.)\n\n\n\nSo when you consider the tangential opportunities this next-gen ML/AC is growing towards - we can just choose robotics as one example - you have all these firms competing at the edge to be the first with the best solution (drop-in blue-collar replacements) as the TAM of these applications is on the order of 100B-T, NVDA is the only viable option, with all others requiring further efforts on the end-user that are irrelevant to their problem. (Theres a reason pretty much every newly minted robotics firm is using NVDA robotics platforms).\n\n\nThis is exactly why Google still buys so much NVDA - they are squeezed by their end-users who demand the platforms NVDA has developed as the maturity of the platforms is directly related to the rate of progress they can make. If Google had the same ecosystem around their TPUs I would not be nearly as singularly bullish on NVDA as I am.\n\n\n\nNVDA is so far ahead here that even their competitor (AMD) isn't competing with them - look at the earnings growth deltas between these two over the last 2 years - it is an empircal truth (the best kind of truth in ML/AC). And for AMD to seriously compete, they would need to operate in a manner antithetical to how they operate (read: they'd need to spend billions on software development that their earnings cannot support). The reason AMD wins most console bids is the same reason they don't have the ecosystem - they are a bargain option for those willing to do more software leg work.\n\n\nAnd there are a lot more opportunities than LLMs and Robots - just try and count them.\n\n\n\nIf matrix math is really the secret sauce here, the winner in the chip space will be whoever has the most plush red-carpet all the way to the end-users.

Several disengagements and interventions.  \"It fails every time now\" on hairpin turns leading to multiple head-on collision scenarios. For context, the car has previously completed this drive with relative ease on previous versions of V12. Kind of scary how much it regressed from 12.3.6/12.4.3 (and 12.4.3 was dog shit already). Not even mentioning the fact that it kept its turn signals on almost continuously throughout the drive as that doesn't pertain to actual driving controls.\n\nThis is a very complex scenario that doesn't represent average daily driving, but it showcases the lack of FSD's ability to adapt that people have been experiencing with 12.5.x builds. This kind of regressive shit makes me worry for this vision only approach to FSD. We expected to see greater performance due to a massive increase in dataset and training compute. So far, with 2 attempts since the original wide release of end-to-end neural nets with 12.3.x, FSD has shown significant regression while still not offering enhanced capability (ASS/banish/Highway/Cybertruck, etc.). \n\nI personally want the update to 12.5.x as I'm stuck on 12.4.3 on super old firmware (2024.15.15) so I'll take it just to get the UI/comfort updates but the lack of real progress and enhancements is concerning.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "!!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07568707317113876}, {"body": "I'm reassured by the fact it did handle this scenario correctly in previous builds so it's technically within HW3 and FSD's capabilities\u00a0", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48563626408576965}, {"body": "It's concerning, but it's also clear that these release versions are not trained and optimized for these scenarios. \n\nSo a new release might seem to be a \"regression\" but it could only be a regression on unmarked, single-lane, \"two-way\" roads with hairpins, blind corners, and steep elevation.\n\nI wouldn't use these tests as a standard benchmark for FSD point releases.

Otherwise, it's a roll of the dice if each new training run will retain previously positive behaviours. \n\nThe approach has to be able to build on itself. Clearly, they aren't using that approach (maybe they've discovered it doesn't work that way) yet and like Elon said, has resulted in Tesla focussing too much on edge cases and not enough on \"regular\" driving. Combined with the need to emulate HW4 optimizations in software for HW3, there may end up being a massive amount of legacy (non HW4) cars that just cannot achieve FSD. \n\nI really hope I'm wrong, but I'm through making excuses for FSD not improving over time and working the way Tesla and the simps say it will.
