A company's moat is their ability to maintain competitive advantages under adverse market conditions. A famous example of this is KO - the company's brand image and the closely guarded formula of Coca Cola mean that it would be extremely difficult to push them out of their market niche.\n\nMSFT has arguably the best moat in the world. EVERYONE uses Windows, it's so prevalent that the downside of not being compatible with it is too hard to ignore. Whatever happens to the market, MSFT will rebound. However, it did crash in 1999 when the dot com bubble burst. It took 15 years to recover, and there's no guarantee it won't happen again. It's highly unlikely, but it would be the worst case scenario.\n\nThe other thing to consider is that tech is a hot sector at the moment due to AI gains, which MSFT is heavily invested in. That means it's the most volatile industry you could invest in. Short term gains will be bigger, but so will losses.\n\nYour approach will also depend on your time frame. If you're a long-term investor, you could invest now and reasonably expect the stock to have beaten inflation by the end of 2025. In my opinion, the potential recession is BS. The economy was too good for too long and it fucked with recession indicators like the Sahm Rule, which caused mass panic.\n\nI'd love to explain more but I'll try not to make this comment take up a whole page. The short version is that if we do end up in a recession, tech will drop like a rock. However, as long as you don't sell it'll also shoot up like a rocket when the recovery happens. The safest approach would be to sell MSFT and wait for the Fed to make a rate cut in September, then see how the economy reacts. If it recovers, you missed out on some gains but avoided any risk.

We're not going from 2.8% in July to -X% anytime soon, as regards in reddit forums seem to think.\n\nThere's a difference between a slowing economy and a recession. A slowing economy is exactly what the fed wanted to engineer, and is all we're seeing here. Just because the market is pricing in some small % chance of a recession does not mean it will happen, or is imminent.\n\nThe VIX is basically already at it's non-black-swan typical high. Look at the 12 year chart on the VIX and tell me how often it stays above 30 (it's intraday high on Friday) for more than a week or so. Covid, a black swan event, is really the only exception, and it sustained 30ish a bit during the sharpest QT cycle we've seen since the 1980s back in 2022. We're not in a black swan event, and we're not in a QT cycle. When the VIX drops, there will be a squeeze.\n\nUnlike the large correction we saw in 2022, Credit Default Swaps are barely moving. Hell, they're lower than they were in April. Smart money is not concerned with this current aberration.\n\nThe S&P, on average, sees three 5% and one 10% correction per year. The 10% correction is obviously inclusive of one of the 5% corrections. We saw one 5% correction in April, and a second one in August here. This correction is now just a smidgen bigger than the April event, another 'end time' event according to redditors, that saw a ferocious recovery....when? When the VIX crushed back down.\n\nOpinion:\n\nIf Thursday's payroll report comes in stronger than expected, or even in line, we'll see a huge squeeze in the market, just like last Wednesday. Bulls flipped to bears and calls flipped to puts so drastically, yet frivolously, that the slightest hint of good news will cause a squeeze.....puts are just a compressed spring right now. AMD having decent earnings last Wednesday caused NVDA to surge, and the entire market squeezed as a result given it's massive weight in indices. That's how slight the good news has to be for this correction to be old news.\n\nIf Thursday's payroll report comes in soft, we could see another leg down towards....what? A completely natural 10% correction.\n\nThere's absolutely no current impetus for a larger pullback than 10%. We're not going into a QT cycle, GDP is healthy, there's no black swan events on the horizon.
