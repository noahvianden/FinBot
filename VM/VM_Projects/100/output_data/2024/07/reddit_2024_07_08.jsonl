When you're doing that it doesn't matter what you buy, for as long as you're choosing good stocks or ETFs and Nvidia is definitely a good stock for the long run. Even if the price crashes right now and it loses 50% of it's value I believe it will eventually grow back up because the company is legit and not some coin with no value behind it. \n\nIf you're putting a lot of money in then you probably won't like the risk. In that case you would like to diversify your portfolio in which case you'd be better off with buying a bit of nvidia, a bit of meta, a bit of bitcoin, a bit of mastercard, a bit of sp500 and so on, since those are different types of stocks and some ETFs and that way your money is protetected from a crash in 1 industry. Meaning if the tech sector crashes and you lose money on nvidia and smci, then the market(sp500) might still be doing good overall and also your money in meta, mastercard, coke, bitcoin and so on is probably still gonna be growing. If crypto crashes then the other investments are safe.\n\nSo, if you're making a small initial investment(what is small is obviously dependent on your financial situation but let's say 500$) and you're going to contribute with 100$ every month then for the first couple of months it won't hurt if you only buy nvidia. If you're investing 100k then put whatever amount of money you want to make sure is 99.9% safe in the long run into Etfs and whatever percentage of money you're willing to put on a bigger risk for potential bigger rewards you can use to buy singular stocks, resources, crypto.\n\nHope I helped(I'm not a complete specialist but you probably know that since this is reddit)", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "What are some other good stocks you see doing good in long run?

{"title": "Boeing to plead guilty to criminal fraud charge stemming from 737 Max crashes ", "selftext": "Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud charge tied to the fatal 737 Max crashes, the Justice Department said Sunday, months after U.S. prosecutors said the aerospace giant violated a 2021 settlement that shielded it from prosecution.\n\nUnder the deal, Boeing agreed to pay a $243.6 million fine. An independent compliance monitor would also be installed to oversee compliance at Boeing for three years during a probationary period. Boeing would also have to invest at least $455 million in compliance and safety programs, according to a U.S. prosecutors\u2019 court filing late Sunday. The plea deal requires the approval of a federal judge to take effect.\n\nBoeing also agreed for the board of directors to meet with crash victims\u2019 family members, under the agreement.\n\nThe plea deal offer forced Boeing to decide between a guilty plea and the attached terms, or going to trial, just as the company was seeking to turn a corner in its manufacturing and safety crises, pick a new CEO and acquire its fuselage maker, Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nThe guilty plea would brand the planemaker a felon and could complicate its ability to sell products to the U.S. government. About 32% of Boeing\u2019s nearly $78 billion in revenue last year came from its defense, space and security unit.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to the memorialization and approval of specific terms,\u201d Boeing said in a statement.\n\nIn May, the Justice Department said Boeing had violated the 2021 agreement. Under that deferred prosecution agreement, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion, including an original $243.6 million criminal fine, compensation to airlines and a $500 million fund for victims\u2019 family members.\n\nThat 2021 settlement was set to expire two days after a door panel blew out of a nearly new 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5. While there were no serious injuries, the accident created a fresh safety crisis for Boeing.\n\nThe U.S. accused Boeing of conspiracy to defraud the government by misleading regulators about its inclusion of a flight-control system on the Max that was later implicated in the two Max crashes \u2014 a Lion Air flight in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. All 346 people on board the flights were killed.\n\nU.S. prosecutors had told victims\u2019 family members on June 30 that they planned to seek a guilty plea from Boeing, a plan family attorneys called \u201ca sweetheart deal.\u201d\n\nPaul Cassell, a lawyer for victims\u2019 family members, said he plans to ask the federal judge on the case to reject the deal and \u201csimply set the matter for a public trial, so that all the facts surrounding the case will be aired in a fair and open forum before a jury.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/08/boeing-to-plead-guilty-to-criminal-fraud-charge-stemming-from-737-max-crashes.html", "id": "1dy5jf3", "created_utc": 1720434545.0, "score": 684, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "244+455 million? 699 together, that's it?
