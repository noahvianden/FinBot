What i can tell you is this.\n\nWe are in the the pre-game warm up of a 9 inning double header. The elites smell blood in the water. And you can thank China and Russia for this gamesmanship. China is doing AI, therefore, US must do AI. Who knows what the hell Europe is doing. They'll just wait for the US to do what needs to be done I guess but I digress.\n\nThe elites know that there is something here. What do I mean. Robotics is not next year on a mass scale per se but all of this pre-game work will lead to robotics. Elon knows this. Amazon knows this. Bill Gates knows this. Everyone knows this. There have been movies about this for decades such as Terminator. Kidding kidding. But seriously, humanoid robots are on the table. But it's more than that.\n\nIt's automation and cognitive tasks that can now be automated too. Many white collar cognitive jobs will be shaken. Later, blue-collar cognitive labor will be shaken.\n\nThink about human history. Cheap labor that can 24/7 and doesn't need health insurance is too rich pass up.\n\nThere will be railroad track after railroad track laid down until there is a robust economy behind it.\n\nEvery household will have a humanoid robot doing laundry and cooking 3 meals a day in some near future.\n\nThe promise is JUST TOO GOOD to pass up.\n\nThe people telling you that 100 million dollar training to 1 billion dollar training is coming and then on to 10 and 100. Why? Because all of those robots and all of those capabilities of automation will be delivered by these cloud companies.\n\nAmazon just hired I think it was 750,000 robots for its factories.\n\nAnd the reason why you know that for Nvidia it has just begun is because those things aren't here YET. There is still compute, more models that need to be trained and scaled. More throughput is a huge issue meaning, there is more demand BY FAR than supply of AI throughput.\n\nSome people think WingStop and Chipotle are great investments and you know a 3000 forward PE is justifiable. Others, way smarter than I, can see into the future. The future is AI and breakthroughs will gain at a greater pace because a little 10 billion investment produced so much return.\n\nWe are still on GPT-4 and in words of Sam Altman - it sucks (not really that but you get my point). Something more profound and useful is coming.\n\nUntil I have a damned Jetson's robot in my house cleaning up after me and my kids I will then, and only then, start to believe we have enough GPU'S and accelerated compute.", "id": "1dyu0as", "created_utc": 1720500971.0, "score": 156, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "Yep, this is the big picture that most people don\u2019t understand. \n\nGuys and gals, the nerds are in the AI labs with line of sight to super-intelligence.

And more powerful, faster processors. This is where NVidia is the hub in an ever expanding wheel with various technologies as the wheels spokes. Will there be a time where other companies catch up to NVidia? That\u2019s possible only if NVidia fails to continue to innovate. No one sees that happening any time soon.
