OP believes Tesla is overvalued but being the novice that he is, the only way he can do that is by comparing a legacy OEM with stagnant revenue to a company that plans to create automated driving, the largest battery storage systems in the world, has the largest and most sophisticated supercharging network in the world, robotics, and by far the most profitable EV automaker in the world. When other auto companies are losing billions selling a few thousand EV's but Tesla is earning billions, you should ask yourself how did that happen.\n\nThe two largest reasons why people are betting on Tesla is FSD/Optimus. By all means, if you don't think Tesla will achieve either of those, yes, Tesla is incredibly overvalued. If you do believe Tesla can, then that's why Tesla is being priced the way it is. I'll be honest, the only reason I've been investing and still holding onto Tesla for the past decade is because the guy makes reusable space rockets that has billion dollar contracts with NASA and a Starlink system that generates $7 billion per year in revenue. I have faith that this same guy will accomplish great things for Tesla as well. And I'm willing to take the risk for that in hopes of higher returns.
