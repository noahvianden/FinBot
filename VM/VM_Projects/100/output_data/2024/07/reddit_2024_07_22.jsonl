It extends far beyond financial credit and can affect almost every aspect of a citizen's life, including travel, employment, and even the ability to buy certain goods.\n\nRegarding re-education programs, the comparison to American prisons isn't quite equivalent. The scale and purpose of China's re-education camps, especially those targeting specific ethnic and religious groups, raise significant human rights concerns.\n\nAs for the East Turkestan Liberation Organization (ETLO), while it's true that they are linked to terrorism, the issue is broader than just dealing with terrorists. There are reports and credible evidence suggesting that the Chinese government\u2019s actions in Xinjiang go beyond counter-terrorism and involve widespread human rights abuses against Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.\n\nAddressing terrorism is necessary for any country, but it should not justify human rights violations.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">can affect almost every aspect of a citizen\u2019s life including travel, employment, and even the ability buy certain goods\n\nYou can\u2019t get credit cards and loans to purchase cars or house with poor credit report.\n\nCertain employers run credit reports of potential employees and can deny them jobs based on poor credit reports \n\nUtilities run credit checks and can deny service based on poor reporting\n\nPeople on no fly lists are banned from forms of travel\n\nformer convicts and felons are denied rights to vote and guns including discriminated from jobs and housing.\n\nBackground checks and credit reports are often done together and it sounds just like the alleged social credit score which had combined both criminal and credit report into one.\n\nThe allegations and exaggeration of Chinese social credit score are also found to be mostly untrue as most cities and provinces aren\u2019t even using said system.\n\nAs for the Uygur camp allegations, initial reports that the state dept also quote came from pro-war anti China think tank and a very questionable \u201cSinologist\u201d named Adrian Zenz whose pervious work was in Evangelical Christian theology.  \n\nAs for the double standards of American attitude toward Muslims plight, we are totally fine with supporting the killing of Muslim children including infants in NICU but it\u2019s wrong for the Chinese to \u201creeducated\u201d terrorists in China.  You know why the whole Uyghur camp just suddenly dropped off government narratives?  We can\u2019t be supplying bombs that are actually killing Muslims while still saying we are supporting Muslims that are allegedly being tortured by Chinese camps.\n\nIf America actually cared about Muslims, we wouldn\u2019t be giving 500lb and 2000lb bombs to Israel so they can raze Gaza of the the planet", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your detailed response. You bring up some important points, and I\u2019d like to address them.\n\nWhile the U.S. credit system and background checks have significant consequences, the Chinese social credit system is more pervasive and directly controlled by the state, impacting even small everyday actions, like buying train tickets or getting a loan, based on behavior that might not be financial in nature. It's the breadth and depth of surveillance and control that is concerning.\n\nRegarding the Uighur camps, it's true that reports can be influenced by various sources, but multiple independent investigations, satellite images, and testimonies have provided evidence of widespread human rights abuses. It's crucial to critically evaluate all sources, but dismissing concerns outright because of the origins of initial reports might overlook real issues.\n\nOn the point of American double standards, there's definitely valid criticism about U.S. foreign policy, especially in the Middle East. Supporting military actions that result in civilian casualties is indeed contradictory if we claim to care about human rights. However, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.
