Let me give you some concrete examples that demonstrate Apple\u2019s actual care about privacy:\n\n1. App Tracking Transparency: This feature significantly fucked up Facebook\u2019s cross-device monetization model for several years, as it requires apps to obtain user permission before tracking their data across other apps and websites.\n\n2. On-Device AI/ML Processing: Features like Face ID, Photos analysis, and Siri operate directly on the device, ensuring that private data remains on the user\u2019s device and is not shared with Apple.\n\n3. End-to-End Encryption and Private Keys: This is why I don\u2019t believe Apple can unlock devices for governments, even if requested. Apple\u2019s encryption policies ensure that only the users have access to their data.\n\nThese are just three examples that come to mind immediately. Additionally, Apple\u2019s business model focuses on selling premium devices, unlike companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Netflix, which heavily rely on advertising as a core part of their business.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while Apple does sell iAds for Apple developers, it\u2019s a relatively small business. From my understanding in the industry, iAds can\u2019t compete with other major players and is more of a checkbox to keep developers satisfied.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I guess this all depends on the word \"pretends\". If your perception is that I believe Apple is focusing on privacy for profit and not moral reasons, then yes I believe they are pretending.\n\nJust for transparency, I work in privacy at Meta and my closest colleague is a former Apple privacy lead. I really have no tie to Meta emotionally, I am pretty close to leaving frankly speaking, but the narratives around privacy are infuriating enough for me to clarify.\n\nJust like any field, there are the issues that appeal to the masses due to simplicity and issues that actually matter to the experts. Most of the privacy work Apple does is very light, easily marketable, and is very appealing to the masses.   \n  \n- App tracking transparency is 100% not a real privacy play, this was evident before I ever joined Meta. ATT coincided with Apple's ads business, AI work, and increased competition from Chinese competitors. ATT is a way for Apple to maintain a monopoly on iPhone user data. User data is still being heavily tracked, just by Apple instead of other apps.\n\n- On-device processing is another idea that sounds really nice in theory, and does offer some protection, but is not viewed as real comprehensive privacy work. Face ID, photos analysis, and siri operate on device because they can. There is no need for those to run off-device, so by running them on-device apple can tout \"privacy\". Every single thing that you do on your iphone that are not those three things are processed off-device and captured and fed into ML models for the use of selling more iphones and iAds. This also isn't groundbreaking and is standard industry practice, most Quest data is kept on-device for example. Keeping 1% of data on-device and then sending 99% off-device to profit off of while touting privacy is a bit misleading.\n\n- Encryption in transit is standard industry practice so I will assume that you are referring to device locking + E2E iMessages. Most apps that are strictly messenger apps are E2E encrypted, because there's no reason not to. Messenger isn't E2E encrypted because it is connected to a social media platform that grants access to a wide range of users (Facebook). Some of those users are children or potential targets of scams. If you E2E encrypt messenger then you can't have youth protection features or anti-scam features while offering access to billions of users via Facebook. The same applies to Instagram but not to Whatsapp, which is E2E encrypted for that reason. I can't think of a single device that isn't E2E encrypted though. This isn't unique to Apple. Apple just advertises it. \n\nSo what is real privacy work? Purpose limitation, limiting the use of data based on heavy audits. A comprehensive privacy program audited internally by hand, by scans (that are audited by 3rd parties or the government), and that the program itself is also audited by a third party and the government (This is what Meta does following the FTC consent order). Boards of third party entities responsible for vetting overall privacy programs. Privacy red teams. Collaboration with universities for privacy audits. Apple doesn't talk about these things because they don't do the majority of them. They also aren't \"sexy\" like ATT is or on-device processing.\n\nSo my point is that most of Apple's privacy talk isn't unique or important or significant. But it is appealing to users and as such improves their sales and strategic positioning.
