{"title": "Tesla will rally on the 8/8 Robotaxi reveal", "selftext": "[Position: a single $265 Call 3/25](https://imgur.com/a/6YExxsL)\n\nDespite this month's insane rally, I think Tesla is undervalued due to their insurmountable lead in real-world data collection for Full-Self Driving (FSD) training.\n\nTheir only competitor is Waymo, but Waymo's advantages are limited and can be easily copied by Tesla. Here is Waymo's approach to self-driving:\n\n* Taxis are limited to geo-fenced regions with high-resolution maps\n* If the taxi is stuck, a human driver will remotely take over with no indication to the passenger.\n* Dependent on very expensive sensors (i.e. lidar and radar)\n\nComparison of Fleet Size and Mileage:\n\n* Tesla fleet: 4,000,000  -- Waymo: 600\n* Miles driven: Tesla: >1.3 Billion -- Waymo: ~10-20 million\n\nWaymo does 50,000 paid trips per week in cities, but the growth potential of their AI is limited due to the relatively small, homogeneous training set. In my opinion, their main accomplishment is the illusion of proficiency created by these \"silent\" human interventions.\n\nWhen Tesla releases their robotaxi, they will be able to adopt all of Waymo's advantages, even the silent takeovers. Couple this with their insurmountable lead in training data (Over 1 billion hours of FSD data in all driving conditions/environments), and I think they will rapidly outshine Waymo.\n\nIn particular, I think the impact of the silent human takeovers cannot be overstated.  Tesla could easily adopt this and achieve essentially perfect self-driving overnight.  It will impress the general public and make the share price go up.\n\nI am eager to hear what you fucking idiots think.\n\nFor some background, I have used FSD daily for the last year and am massively impressed by its rate of improvement.  I bought the call option after I realized that most of the public thinks FSD is a fraud, impossible, or uninteresting.\n\nI am already at 460% return but I intend to hold until expiration.\n\n\nEDIT: If there's any smart people reading this, tell me what you think of the recent talent departure.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-ai-director-leaving-company-after-4-month-sabbatical-2022-07-13/\n\nEDIT2: lol its delayed to october", "id": "1e02f97", "created_utc": 1720634512.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 47 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e02f97/tesla_will_rally_on_the_88_robotaxi_reveal/) \n**Account Age** | 11 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39375004172325134}, {"body": "Why hasn\u2019t tesla yet to obtain permission to do any self driving taxi service in any US city ?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "No, it is smoke and mirror", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.06063792109489441}, {"body": "Their robotaxi is still in development.

Any major auto can retrofit their lineup to add cheap cameras to bumpers and B pillars and be collecting billions of miles of data within a couple years. If a company like Hyundai/Toyota/VW retrofitted their lineup and sold 10-20M of those cars then within 2 years they would be collecting hundreds of billions of miles of data annually. The models themselves aren't the secret sauce as ML models are quickly commoditized. This is a much simpler approach then all the other competitors are taking so it will be easier for them to dumb down their hardware and retrain end to end models based on camera data.\n\nIf autonomous vehicles are truly as lucrative as Tesla investors think there will be tons of competitors copying their approach if it works.

And they don't have a lot of new manufacturing capacity in the pipeline to expand quickly. Mexico has been delayed indefinitely. It will take them years as well to ramp additional capacity to expand production significantly. The best they can do is sell more FSD subscriptions to existing customers and increase take rate on existing manufacturing capacity. I don't think that's enough to run away with anything.\n\nCompetitors don't need to build a data center. They can pay for time on existing cloud computing platforms with any of the massive cloud players (Amazon, Microsoft, Google). Two of which have top tier expertise in autonomous driving and are training their own systems (Google Waymo, Amazon Zoox).The biggest initial hurdle would be retrofitting manufacturing to integrate COTS cameras into their existing lineup of vehicles. That isn't a huge lift. So they could be collecting the data quite quickly if Tesla's approach is proven to work. If say Hyundai/Kia took 1 year to update manufacturing lines and they sell 7.5M vehicles per year then within 2 years they could have 7.5M vehicles collecting data and if the average vehicle is driven 13,000 miles per year that's 100B miles collected within 2 years.
