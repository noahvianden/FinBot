Think about it. The US relies on the strength of the US dollar to maintain financial hegemony over the world.\u00a0 Powell waiting to cut until after ECB and BOE and other central banks cut first is that it will keep interest rates on the US dollar higher than other fiat currencies, keeping demand for US dollars high and allowing the US to maintain financial hegemony over the world. Once the other central banks go into crisis and are forced to cut drastically, that will give the fed all the freedom in the world to cut rates.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation", "cpi"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Could you elaborate on that perhaps? Why credit spreads and 2yr-yields, specifically? Seems a bit random to be honest.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "there are other indicators you could look at, but these 2 metrics show some important things\n\ncredit spreads are the difference between interest rates between more risky bonds and less risky bonds. obviously you would expect to see the riskier bonds to have higher interest rates than less risky bonds. when times are good, the difference between these interest rates is not very much and stays pretty flat. when things are going wrong, and everyone is strapped for cash, people become much more risk averse and thus begin demanding a much higher interest rate for lending money to riskier bonds. so when you see the interest rate for these riskier bonds start rising quickly, and the spread blowing out, it marks a sentiment shift and behavior shift among bond investors. \n\n[https://www.longtermtrends.net/bond-yield-credit-spreads/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/bond-yield-credit-spreads/) this shows a chart of spreads between corporate bonds and treasury bonds. obviously the corporate bonds are riskier than treasury bonds. you can see from this chart that the spread has actually been decreasing as of late, so that means there is lots of money being lent to corporations, buying those bonds. well, if corporate bonds are being bought up, that means these corporate bond issuers are flush with liquidity. do you think a corporation is going to go under and go bankrupt when its flush with money? i don't think so... so when you see credit spreads flat or dropping, its generally a bullish sign for the stock markets. when you see credit spreads start to widen and blow out, it means corporations are experiencing liquidity issues and that is bearish for stocks.\n\n  \nfor 2 yr yield - its been a thing for a while that investors look at 2 yr yield and when the yield/interest rate starts dropping, its a sign that lots and lots of money is moving into 2 yr treasuries. this is done ahead of a FED rate cutting cycle. understanding that the FED cuts rates when the economy is in trouble and needs to be put on life support, that's generally a bad sign for the health of stocks if things are so bad that the FED needs to cut interest rates to support. also, if the FED is going to be printing money to buy bonds, you would want to be owning those bonds ahead of the FED buying. nobody has firepower like the FED with their money printer. so you want to be owning those assets before the FED starts buying as that firehose of money the FED will be buying with will send the price of those bonds skyrocketing.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

However, bond *issuers* don't receive liquidity every time their bonds are traded. They already got the cash when they issued those bonds. It's investors who hold these bonds that receive money when those bonds are traded. If spreads go up, it thus means that investors will have to be paid more to be willing to assume those risks (or, conversely, it's getting more expensive for bond holders to get the risk out of their books). At any rate, we're talking market liquidity here, not corporate liquidity.

Am I wrong?* - market liquidity and corporate liquidity kind of go hand in hand i guess. for those of us that are not Apple corporation or corporate bond investors, we don't really care about any of this. all we care about is if corporations can raise cash when they need cash, as a general sign of the health of overall markets. if interest rates on corporate bonds are low, its because there are so many people lined up around the block waiting to buy corporate bonds that they dont have to offer very high interest rates. this is a sign that corporations are not in any sort of liquidity troubles. \n\nwhen we see corporate bond interest rates rising, it means that even while corporations desperately need money, nobody is lending to them. so they have to raise the interest rate a little and see if there are any takers. if not, they have to raise interest rates a little more. and a little more and a little more, until someone is willing to take the risk to lend them money. this signals that people are not very confident in corporations ability to pay them back. at the same time, higher interest rates mean its more expensive for corporations to pay them back, so its more of a drag on the cash flow of the company moving forward. its kind of a double whammy. so the moral of the story here is that rising corporate bond interest rates is a signal of very very bad things to come.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
