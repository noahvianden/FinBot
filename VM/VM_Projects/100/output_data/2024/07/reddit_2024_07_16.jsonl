{"title": "NuScale ($SMR) - World\u2019s Most Obvious Connection Goes Unnoticed (DD?)", "selftext": "Okay listen up, Regards. This is not financial advice, it's actually the easiest DD that I think I\u2019ve ever seen and I keep waiting for someone else to see what I see and post about it (because I\u2019m a lurker, not a poster. But above all I\u2019m here for sweet tendies). I\u2019ve invested in this company on and off since c. 2018 and recently have seen a big uptick in interest thanks to our GOAT friend AI. For whatever reason, even with this increased interest, I continue to add to my positions waiting and waiting for someone to make the connection\u2026 But in the words of the Great Bill O\u2019Reilly \u201cFuck it, we\u2019ll do it live!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\\*\\*Key Point/ Secret Sauce First, Disclaimer, TLDR, additional comments/DD, sources at end\\*\\*\n\n**Key Point/ Secret Sauce:**\n\nWe\u2019re all (sorry NVDA bears) on the same page about AI. AI is here to stay, it\u2019s a god send, and it prints money. AI also, though, absolutely sucks down energy. Like as much as small nations\u2026 \\[1\\]\n\nMore and more people are realizing the energy consumption issue AI faces. Whether that be Altman \\[2\\] (starting his own nuclear power company cough cough), Goldman Sachs \\[3\\], WEF \\[4\\], Yale \\[5\\]\u2026 etc. And more and more the answer is looking to be nuclear power.\u00a0\n\nSMRs are both the leading tech for nuclear power moving forward that much is clear (you\u2019ll have to just do the research on that one yourself). And the leader in this leading tech is NuScale (guys they have the guh damn ticker $SMR even). With all eyes moving towards nuclear, $SMR has begun to slowly come more and more into favor.\u00a0\n\nIMO, though, $SMR should be the **~ONLY~** nuclear power play. To be fair this is entirely predicated, also, on $NVDA continuing to be the biggest player in tech/AI. Partially because of the dollar amounts involved with SMRs. NuScale previously was expecting a fully operational plant/campus to cost \\~$3b. This cost would later balloon to \\~$9b, of which the government would help with about 50%. At worst let\u2019s say the first round cost $10b and no government funding. This has always been the largest hurdle to nuclear power plant development, upfront costs.\n\nIf an AI company like NVDA decided that they wanted to move from making chips exclusively, to designing/building/implementing entire AI infrastructure hubs (so called AI factories) \\[6\\] then perhaps they would be interested in upstream M&A of power suppliers for said factories. IF a company like NVDA wanted to do this, then they could in theory buy all of SMR (current market cap \\~$1.4b) and float the $10b for first campus development for a total of $11b invested! But at that scale, what\u2019s $12b? We could easily see SMR get scooped up at a healthy premium from here. $MTTR, for example, recently acquired as an AI software play at +120% valuation in April.\n\nThis seems like a huge amount until you look at 1. The cash and equivalents that NVDA has ($31b at EOQ 04/30/24 and generating more FCF than they know what to do with or \\~$15b LAST QT), 2. The level of investments being made into the AI space already (often in the $10b+), and 3. The secret sauce kicker that no one has mentioned - Oregon (fucking) State University. Go Beavs!\n\nHOW HAS NO ONE ELSE PUT THIS TOGETHER!? NuScale is based in Corvallis, OR with OSU. The SMR was invented in 2007 at OSU by NuScale. JENSEN HUANG GRADUATED FROM OSU and has been active in the school and community more so than ever before. This man was on campus in April for AI Week! Jensen (and his wife) personally donated $50m towards the development of a new \u201cCollaborative Innovation Complex.\u201d\n\nLook I have no additional information here, only the publicly available fact that Jensen Huang went to, and continues to be involved with, Oregon State University. Jensen Huang (and the AI field at large) also has a major energy issue. NuScale has deep roots to OSU also, including almost 25 years of history (aka NuScale\u2019s entire history). I have no secret knowledge or reason to believe that these two parties have met or talked at all. However, look at this picture of Jensen with all of the OSU big wigs, there for at least an entire day if not multiple days, and tell me that not once did someone mention NuScale to him\u2026 JENSEN HUANG MUST KNOW ABOUT NUSCALE AND MUST KNOW IT IS THE ANSWER TO HIS LOOMING PROBLEM.\n\n[ Jensen Huang at OSU \\[7\\]](https://preview.redd.it/o3qxj69h4wcd1.png?width=1047&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf9b3ba801d18b57c3a219ca09afd05d03087de)\n\n**DISCLAIMER** - Positions - 1000 SMR shares, 40 x SMR Calls (12/19/25) K = $15 bought at various times, 100 x SMR Calls (11/15/24) K = 20, 125 x SMR Calls (08/02/24) K = $20 bought 07/15/24 (after that Friday bump even because I still love it at 16). Told all my family and friends the connection and that I planned on posting this a week ago so they could buy if they wanted (not sure if anyone did or did not). I do not know about your financial position, goals, timeline, etc so this is not advice or a recommendation. I don\u2019t know shit about ass here, y\u2019all.\u00a0\n\n**TLDR:** Jensen Huang was raised in Oregon, graduated from Oregon State University, has near infinite money, needs near infinite power for AI. SMR was raised in Oregon, from Oregon State University, needs near infinite money, has near infinite power for AI. SMR to at least $100,000,000,000,000/share (jk I personally have a PT of $22)\n\n**Bonus Comments/ DD:**\n\nIt\u2019s important to also note that the primary issue with developing nuclear power plants since the 1970s has really been upfront costs. A new AP1000 (700MWe) cost, call it, $5b and a new SMR complex of 8-12 (616MWe - 924MWe) reactors would cost, call it, $10b. However, being NuScale\u2019s first proof of concept means the costs are inflated on the front end for R&D/regulatory/etc. Plus NuScale has the added benefit of being able to produce a site with only 1-2 reactors which would (presumably) cost approx 1/10 the cost moving forward. According to Scientific America, by 2027 NVIDIA\u2019s 1.5m shipped chips would be consuming 85.4 TWe (THAT\u2019S 85,400,000 MWe). \\[8\\]\n\nSecond, it is worth noting the massive overlap in cutting edge AI providers and sustainability. The leading companies like Meta ($7.4b) \\[9\\], Google ($16b) \\[10\\], Amazon ($12.6b) \\[11\\], Apple ($4.7b) \\[12\\], Microsoft ($10b+) \\[13\\] all have stated greenhouse gas/energy goals. Many of these companies have specifically commented on these goals and their relation to the AI rollout. The listed dollar amounts are over various timeframes but are all massive regardless and dollars already allocated towards this goal. Microsoft (printing AI money second only to $NVDA) has a stated goal of being carbon NEGATIVE by the end of the decade. \\[14\\] Seriously, what\u2019s 10 or even 20 billion to one of these companies at this point?\n\nThird, something everyone somehow also missed was the ADVANCE Act passing. According to the US Office Of Nuclear Energy, the goals specifically include Microreactors, HALEU (being tested to further enhance SMRs),investing in america, and the aim to \u201caccelerate new reactor deployments in the United States!\u201d This bill shows that the feds also see not only the looming power crisis from AI but the potential for SMR technology specifically. \\[15\\] Pst there\u2019s only one company that currently has SMR designs approved by the DOE. \\[16\\] They literally just need someone to float the funding to start off the dawn of the new nuclear age.\n\nFourth, and this one is just harder speculation\u2026 when interest rates drop (futures market pricing that in September now) there could (should?) be a wave of M&A that comes with it. And if not M&A, then it at least becomes more likely that someone would be willing to finance an operation like this!\n\nFifth and final, $SMR has a decent short interest at \\~19% according to FinViz \\[17\\]. There are \\~150 other companies between $300m - $2b market cap and SI over 15% so pretty high but not like that one stock in 2020\u2026\u00a0\n\nOfficially, by the way, NuScale is \u201cheadquartered\u201d in Portland, Oregon\u2026 But, that is mostly admin staff. Research, design, and engineering are largely done in Corvallis because OSU has a world class nuclear engineering program. \\[18\\]\n\nSources:\n\n1.

Online 1964, Shutdown 3.5 years later in 1968 due to major design issues.\n\nHowever, it had already been deemed uneconomical as a power plant just due to staffing cost alone.\n\nFor the record the USA built 17 commercial nuclear power plants in the 1960's - 1970's which would be considered SMR sized today.   All of them were shut down decades ago as they were not economical to operate against the large nuclear power plants built at the same time (I am unsure of the details for the rest of the world; but, understand that the same pattern followed in other countries unless there were unique locations where building larger plants did not make any sense).\n\n By the end of the 1970's it was known that the concept of SMRs were dead unless it was for some kind of geologically isolated area where they only needed a small power plant and transmission line construction was impractical.\n\nIf you double the size of a nuclear power plant it only takes about 40% more materials and in many cases the plant staff size does not even change.  At some point the staffing size does increase modestly.\n\nAs for the failed NuScale Idoho plant.  6 SMR reactors of 77 MWe output was the claimed plans (462 MWe).  What is interesting is that only the 50 MWe version was licensed by the NRC and there was an expectation that the NRC would quickly license the 77 MWe version which they thought could be done during the early site preparation period: Utah Utilities & NuScale was well into the \"Pre-License review\" of the 77 MWe design and had received good feedback. But the License application was never submitted after they received the construction quote and the pre-licnese review was terminated.\n\nThe quote came in at about $9.5 Billion to construct, with an estimated $1 Billion+ inflation adjustment during the construction period.\n\nIn reality this would have been about the same price to build a single Westinghouse AP-1000 (about 1150 MWe) and the staffing for the plant would have been about the same.\n\nAs for the $55 raising to $89 per MWhr for electricity cost.  That was after $4 Billion from the US government for SMR development grants - so the real cost rose to well over $100 per MWhr (where a single unit AP-1000 could be built for significantly less than half of that).\n\nNote on AP-1000 construction cost:   Yes a lot more was spent at VC Summer and Voglte. But the USA (and Europe with the EPR) had not built nuclear power plants in so long that no contractors and very few workers understood how to build them - and also a number of suppliers shipped fake certified components and materials to site that could not be used - or had to be tore out and replaced.  Massive cost and schedule delays, and lots of lessons learned.    The Idaho NuScale project used the same contractors to quote that had learned their lessons with the Vogtle AP-1000s which is why they could quote so much better (and if those contractors are used before they forget - the next USA nuclear plant will be built much cheaper and much more closer to schedule than Vogtle 3 & 4).\n\nBy the way China built 4 AP-1000's with an average construction time of about 6 years.  They had a delay and cost overrun on their 1st one as they were not used to working with the Westinghouse design - but once they understood it - no noticeable delays or cost overruns (and Chinese construction standards and contractors for nuclear are just as good - if not better - than their western counterparts.  No shortcuts, no fake materials, and the workers understand high quality nuclear construction standards and practices).  I did a consulting job for one of the Chines AP-1000 plants; and was impressed.\n\nChina is now building 6 more AP-1000s (they have a licensed copy) and at least 2 other countries are starting construction on AP-1000s- and at least 15 more AP-1000s are in the planning stage worldwide.\n overall plant must be identical for each plant.  Never going to happen as each nuclear power plant site must be designed for \"worst case\" LOCAL earthquakes, flooding, storms, etc.  No one wants to pay for a plant that is designed to handle all the worst case conditions that exist somewhere in the world.  It would be massively overbuilt and expensive.\n\n.", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "I'm gonna wait for someone to read this and comment.
