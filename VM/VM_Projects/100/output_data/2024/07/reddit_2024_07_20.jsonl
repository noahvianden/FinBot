Short version, nobody can answer this \"right\" without a crystal ball. The best way for laymen to invest is to try and learn as much as you can about a stock, make an informed decision and then ride it out. The market is a tool to transfer money from the poor/middle class to the rich, but it's also a tool to transfer money from the inpatient to the patient. I'd just buy if you think it's going to 180 or 150 or you think it's going up. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou're good dude. I think people are just a little... I guess \"protective,\" of NVDA and you have a lot of people who come in here, start spouting nonsense about how it's like the Dot Com bubble, and then speculate it's going to fall. \n\n  \nMy advise? I'd buy now. You don't know when it's going to go up, you're trying to time the market and that's a bad idea. If you believe NVDA will grow, that it's fundamentals will continue to drive the stock price up, you buy. \n\nYou could fuck around, wait it out, put a buy order in at 110 and hope, but...what if it goes up to 122 on Monday and then never gets below 120 again?\n\n  \nI personally thought it'd trade between \\~110 and 130 after the split and until the next earnings...and then it went up to nearly 141 and it never really traded below 115.\n\n  \nThis is a decision you have to make and be comfortable with. So sure, you can wait, you can put the buy order in at a certain limit...or you can just buy it now and then DO NOT watch the stock every day. This NVDA daily thread, it's not healthy for investors. I wasn't on here in 2022 when the stock went from nearly 34 a share to 12 a share. I'd have probably sold if I'm being honest, but I held. \n\n  \nI also set a buy order for SMCI at 700 when it was dropping. Just 100 shares, I was just kinda toying with the idea of day trading with some money, but IIRC, it got down to like 701 and the buy order never went through, the stock then shot back up shortly thereafter to 950 and I missed out. Conversely, I DID buy AVGO at 1440 or something and then sold it shortly thereafter at 1740. This was only 20 shares, but it was a nice little 4000 profit.\n\n  \n-Here's the take away from my LITTLE dabbling in day trading. I'm not informed enough to do it, it's too stressful and I shouldn't. \n\n  \nSo nobody can give you the \"right\" answer without knowing the future. It could go down to 90 a share even with good earnings due to geopolitical events. There could be a black swan event. \n\nBut there's a reason everyone is raising their price targets on NVDA and it's not because they're just taking a shot in the dark.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for elaborating this much on the topic I appreciate it a lot!

Then stick to it!\n\nI don't know if you saw my comments on your post over there, but in my opinion, AMZN will either find support at this level and try to break over 190 again in a week or two, or drop to around 174 before pushing towards 190 again in a few weeks time (timeline is nothing more than a guess). \n\nI think there's strong support on both the Nasdaq at 19500 (current 19700) and AMZN at 174 (current 183). If you can hold down to those levels you could argue that tech will be primed to move higher again. But I'd be wary of the fact there is clear struggle to break $190 and if you get close to that, the intraday action around that level will determine if it is going to reclaim that as a support to move higher, or be rejected at $190 again to fall back into this channel it's in currently.\n\nIt's all down to your risk profile and how much you're willing to lose, both on paper and realised, before they expire. You could be down 50% by the time AMZN finds real support. If that is acceptable loss, then ride it out and close if it goes beyond that. \n\nMaybe look at selling some 200 strike calls to cover?

Basically, if there are a whole bunch of people/institutions betting that AMZN will go up, we'll see it in a DB that is > 0.\n\nConversely, if we see that DB < 0, we lack upside speculation (which is what you want), and this suggests lower prices as people speculate with puts.\n\nThe graphic at the link above is interactive.  When you hover over prices, you get a value:\n\nValues > 0 are considered bullish  \nValues < 0 are considered bearish\n\nThere are 3 components here:\n\n1. Blue DB:  this is an oscillator that is designed to rail -1 to +1.  It is comprised of the following two components:\n2. Net Delta LHP Pct:  The LHP, or \"left hand plane\", that area below spot price, has a moneyness associated with it.  Here, calls are ITM (in the money) and puts are OTM (out of the money).  OTM puts are speculative to the downside; the ITM calls were placed long ago when AMZN was in an uptrend.\n3. Net Delta RHP Pct:  The RHP, or \"right hand plane\", is that area ABOVE spot price, and it too has a moneyness associated with it.  Here, calls are OTM (speculative) and puts are ITM (deltas are growing and these holders are most likely positive.\n\nValues above DB > 0 mean that OTM calls outnumber the ITM put deltas.  This is good for price expansion.  \nValues below DB < 0 mean that OTM puts outnumber the ITM call deltas.  This is good for price contraction.\n\nIf you hover over that link, yep, I can see where you got screwed if you placed your trades after July 16.  July 16 EOD (end of day) was the last day DB was = 1, and both the RHP and LHP were still call dominated.\n\nJuly 17th EOD would have been your signal to exit.  Yes, this would have sucked.  That's trading.  Know your exits BEFORE you enter the trade.\n\nJuly 18th EOD was a continuation day down.  You're really hating life, and moreso, you're adding to a falling position where DB (downside put speculation is growing), and you're screwed.  Dealers are SELLING AMZN to hedge flat, and you have no support.\n\nPrice stabilized yesterday on July 19th and bounced.  Too little, too late.  The DB value is now -1, meaning, it's constituents are < 0.  Puts are controlling the stock.  Period.\n\nI need to post this - will continue in the adjoining message....", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Continuing the previous message.\n\nSo, NOW what do you do?\n\nLet's look out on the horizon.\n\nHere's the link again to save you from scrolling back.\n\n[http://charts.gammaedge.us/8dfa138b/AMZN\\_-1\\_8dfa138b\\_db\\_history\\_daily\\_07\\_20\\_2024\\_00\\_46\\_51.html](http://charts.gammaedge.us/8dfa138b/AMZN_-1_8dfa138b_db_history_daily_07_20_2024_00_46_51.html)\n\nAs you hover, you see the dotted lines extend to the NEXT expiry:  July 26.\n\nRed line < 0.  LHP < 0.  This means that in the LHP, which contains ITM calls and OTM puts, the puts outnumber the deltas of the ITM call deltas.  They are in control.\n\nGreen line almost railed near -1:  This means that for the next week, in the RHP, which contains the ITM put delta and the OTM call delta, there is little OTM call delta to offset to the puts.  There is no upside speculation to speak of, and more importantly, charm in the overhead is very heavy and is pushing the complex down.\n\nAs the complex gets weighed down by ITM puts (as well as OTM puts), charm continues to grow in the overhead and this charm is NEGATIVE DELTA.  This means our book gets shorter, the Dealer's book gets longer, and to hedge flat, they SELL those deltas back to 0.  There is downward pressure on AMZN for the next week>\n\n(timeframe matters - you're dealing with options that have finite lifetime).\n\nYour TL;DR is that for the next week, life is going to suck for you, given Friday's structure.  It can chance, AND IT WILL, but it's going to take something other than the current structure to save your tail.\n\nWhat about all that data to the right?  Glad you asked.\n\nThe data to the right in that figure shows the positioning into August 2, August 9th, and finally August 16th.\n\nThe next two weeks do not look great from today (but we have no clue if price will go any direction - all we can do is read the structure that is in front of us TODAY).\n\nAugust 2 has a DB < 0\n\nAugust 9th has a DB that is < 0,  We note that we do see, at the current price level, some speculative calls that create the upward-moving green line > 0, and that will grow in delta in that week, so there is a ray of sunshine.\n\nThe monthly on August 16 jumps, which is good.\n\nAMZN could continue to fall.  Where it goes is a different analysis.  Luckily, with options, your risk is defined, but with a zillion calls, you may blow your account by next month.\n\nNote again:  I have no clue what AMZN is going to do and this may all be irrelevant.  I use this info - no need for you to do so.  This being said, I would have have never done what you did because I manage risk and you have to yet learn this.  Most learn this by blowing their account - hopefully things work out in your favor before you get a margin call or go broke.\n\nLearn how things work dude.  Take your time.

For all of the massive gains posted on WSB , I realize now many if not most are from blind luck. Buying and holding wild long term calls in one or maybe a few companies & benefiting from a ride up. Ofc luck vs skill is a nuanced debate. My point is there are not a lot of strategic bets and systems of trading for most of the WSB gains I've seen, I realized it correlates strongly to buy and hold on call options of a few stocks that the person rode to the $$$. \n\nIt's not repeatable as a strategy IMO , it's throwing a dart at a dartboard and hoping it hits a \ud83c\udfaf \n\n  \nNothing wrong with this but I don't think it's repeatable or consistent and I think there are many people with the same \"strategy\" who ended up much less fortunate when they selected the wrong calls expiration, companies etc. \n\n  \nAs for Nvidia I bought puts at 120 back in June , they were too short I lost  the. All, I rebought many more at 135 and sold at 95, I'm happy with the trade. All indicators and statistics available showed the stock was massively overbought even compared to big tech stocks which themselves as a sector tend to be very overbought. I spent hours upon hours breaking down the companies financials earnings and comparing them with other big cap tech companies all the ratios etc and I can without a doubt say that all indicators show Nvidia was and maybe still is overbought. \n\n  \nMaybe you are right and they bounce back but that's a risk I wouldnt take. Although if you still held the year end calls I think you probably have a solid chance to make money but I have no idea how reliable the earnings will be to increase the price after a big chunk of late adopters to Nvidia lost a bunch of money. \n\n  \nTbh in interested in your thinking / basis for NVIDIA going past it's all time highs? \n\n  \nDo you think this pattern will repeat endlessly? It already became the biggest company in the world with a 3 trillion valuation, does it go to 5 trillion? 10? \n\nAnd if so why / how., if it's based on the earnings being good I'm not sure how much higher it can go. It's all opinions I could be dead wrong but the thing that pushed me over the edge was seeing Jensen huang sell the legally allowable limit of stock to a total of over 600Million at the moment. \n\nWhat goes up ,.must ...

Had to liquidate them to settle my divorce, but that's a different story.\n\nI've paper handed so much profit on NVDA on the run-up because I too thought it had run up too far, too fast. I almost bought 10 $90 calls for $60 when it was at $85 before earnings. It ran to $1200 before they would have expired. Literally missed out on $250,000 in profits because I was too scared. \n\nSo, my more recent strategy has been to buy deep ITM calls. When NVDA hit $110, I bought 30 Jan 2025 $120 Calls. As soon as it hit $135, I knew it was too far and too much in the short-term, so I sold 30-day OTM calls against it. Ended up looking like a genius.
