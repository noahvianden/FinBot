The only way they can \"influence\" the Bitcoin network is by digitally signing valid Bitcoin transactions to be added into the blockchain, or by participating in mining.\n\nAny other type of unimportant \"influence\" you want to talk about on its USD trading price are completely irrelevant and short term thinking. The people who own all the Bitcoin do not get to change the rules to benefit themselves, the rules are applied to everyone fairly, to me, to you, to the banks and governments. \n\n>You missed the human greed aspect that fueled the growth and institutional taken over.\n\nTo pretend like greed isn't a real thing is hilarious. One of the many amazing traits about Bitcoin is that it is the only thing that we have that turns greed into a positive force that helps other people. Billionaires being greedy and buying as much Bitcoin as they can helps all of the smaller holders as well by increasing the value of the Bitcoin they hold. Through incentives everyone can mutually benefit. In a fully Bitcoin economy, you will spend sats on things that provide real value to your life, if you don't find anything you really need worth your money you simply can save it and prices will continue to fall to the marginal cost of production like the natural state of the freemarket would be. You can be a little richer every year doing literally nothing, this is how we make like prosperous for 8+ billion people.\n\n>What you want is more money, which aligns with your response\n\nI don't want \"more\" money. Bitcoin is a proof of work system. You only get what you work for, no one gets Bitcoin for free. The difference between Bitcoin and fiat money is that I get to KEEP my money that I worked hard for. I work hard for my money, I don't have to gamble it on real estate or stocks or whatever over financialized market product you want to point to in order to keep the wealth I rightfully earned.\n\nYou made a large USD profit in a short amount of time, congrats, most real Bitcoiners would have thought that was a big win at some point early on in their journey too, it definitely used to matter to me. When it takes millions of shitty government pieces of paper to buy 1.0 Bitcoin in the next couple decades, will you be as happy with yourself you decided to \"take profits\"?\n\nBitcoin is the money.

Last earnings, there's been numerous posts on WSB, stating how CVNA's profit margins smell like fraud because Carvana claims they make $5000+ per car, while pretty much any other used car seller in the country ain't able to do the same. (WSB post for reference from a dude claiming to have worked in auto sales for years: [I\u2019M CALLING BS (Carvana)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cj986j/im_calling_bs_carvana/))\n\nPutting fraud and Carvana in the same sentence, should not come off as a wild dream, given that the father, Ernest Garcia II, of the current Carvana CEO, Ernest Garcia III, pled guilty to a felony bank fraud charge back in the 90s. It's literally one of the first things that pop up once you google his name.\n\nIn the past month, CVNA went up 40% from $100 to $140, for no apparent reason. Meanwhile father Garcia continuously sold his CVNA position. He held 1,177,500 shares on 2024/17/06, and was down to 187,500 shares on 7/09/2024.
