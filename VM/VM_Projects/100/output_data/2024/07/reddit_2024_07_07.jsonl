I figured it would sky rocket because the product was so good. Sure other iPhone clones came out but Apple remained supreme and it sold better. If Nividia stays this course sure other chips will come out but companies will use nvidia more. The difference is people can\u2019t go to nvidia stores play with the chips and understand what they do. I believe a lot of retail investors [dumb money] are getting confused back and forth by reports of other companies like AMD INTEL ARM getting in race. That\u2019s why sometimes I look at the news backwards. :Google news on nvidia. \nYou\u2019ll see reports nvidia will hit 3 trillion by 2025. Then it hits it by June. People get scared by news and pull back. I believe a huge indicator of the market is that people don\u2019t see nvidia getting bigger because it hit 3 trillion and 4 seems like sci-fi. \nSo this is what I see that calms me down - Apple is sky rocketing. My guess is people are selling nvidia getting profit and buying Apple. Apple earnings are coming 8/1 and the iPhone supercycle is  predicted in September. So Apple stock won\u2019t slow down until October and then may pick up again during holiday shopping. I think Apple will hit 4 trillion before 2025 and nvidia will follow. \nWarren buffet said don\u2019t buy a stock in a company you don\u2019t understand. Apparently apple understands nvidia.
