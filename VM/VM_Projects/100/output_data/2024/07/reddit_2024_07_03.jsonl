It is determined by the price others are willing to pay for it, which is determined by how likely it is to go in-the-money before it expires, and how far in-the-money it is likely to go. (In-the-money basically means the stock price is higher than the strike price, which is the price you would have to pay for the shares if you exercised the option. How far in-the-money it is is how much money you would make exercising the option.) These are determined by how far in-the-money it is already (the delta); the stock's expected volatility (also known as implied volatility or IV or vega) (higher IV results in a higher options price because it's more likely that the stock price will increase before the expiration); and how long it is before the option expires (the theta) (because if it expires sooner, it's less likely for the stock price to exceed the strike price before expiration).\nThere are two ways to make money from buying stock options: either the stock price rises far enough above the strike price to compensate for the premium you paid for the option, or you sell the option to someone else for a higher premium than you paid.\nFor more information, visit r/options. \nBasically, buy a call option if you think the stock price will rise far enough above the strike price to compensate for the premium before the option expires, and buy a put option if you think the stock price will fall far enough below the strike price to compensate for the premium.

{"title": "$DIS Disney is at a once in a decade buying opportunity", "selftext": "This is the weekly chart for $DIS. Each candle represents one week of trading and the chart goes back to 2010.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wqkuxf0ldad1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=33e19b58c9f5fa193d355ad551aca96a5061c85c\n\n$DIS has been in a clear uptrend for more than a decade, until the 2022 bear market showed up, inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. \n\nThe dark green line is the 80-week moving average. Which represents the average weekly closing price of the last 80 weeks.   \nWhenever this moving average is trending up, the equity in question is in an uptrend and vice versa.\n\nNotice how the moving average trended down for nearly two years between 2022 and 2024.\n\nSince the beginning of the year it flattened and has actually been slowly curling up.\n\nOnce price breaks above this moving average and comes back to it, it's called a breakout and backtest setup.\n\nThis is an incredibly bullish setup with high odds of success. It gives buyers one final chance of entering after the first major breakout.\n\nNow I want you to take a closer look at the volume. Notice how weekly volume has actually been declining as the price has been dropping throughout the last 3 months. This is exactly what you want to see. You want to see sellers less and less interested as the price drops and then you want to see volume expand once buyers are back in and price is trending higher.\n\nENTRY :  \nNow, let's talk about timing the entry. Let's take a look at the zoomed-in portion in pink.  \nYou will notice that $DIS has a tendency to form a bull flag / bull penant / wedge structure and as soon as price breaks above the resistance level of this structure the stock rallies for several weeks.\n\nRight now we are in the middle of a 3rd one of these structures that hasn't broken out yet. The objective entry would be on the first breakout of this structure if you're looking to trade this aggressively.\n\nPersonally. I'm quite happy with the 80-week backtest and I don't want to wait for the breakout so I can buy it here while it's cheap..\n\nTARGET :  \nIf the stock simply retraces back to the middle of its long-term uptrending channel. That would translate to a rally upwards of $160 by the end of next year.\n\nThe December 2025 $120 leap call options are trading at $7.3. That means if the $160 target is realized by the end of 2025, those options will net $40 in profit. a 550% gain in 18 months.  \nIf the price target is realized earlier, those options will net even higher profit. And if $DIS exceeds this price target, again those gains would be much higher.  \nI like the Dec 2025 $120 calls because the far out expiration drastically reduces this risk of theta decay, and gives this setup plenty of time to realize the price target.\n\nKeep in mind that the full-measured move from this consolidation pattern actually puts $DIS at $150 by the end of this year. Which can return an excess of 2000% given how cheap the call options currently are. Just beware of the risk if you're trading this year's Dec expirations.\n\nGood luck regards.\n\n", "id": "1duqpbi", "created_utc": 1720044469.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 307 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qsk34m/woof_woof_this_dog_is_about_bark_up_a_tree_a_big/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u446bu/long_amd_my_next_potential_10x_amd_trade/) \n**Account Age** | 8 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4480462372303009}, {"body": ">inflation and the mini recession wrecked the stock market and $DIS in particular. \n\nI think their shitty movies and changing bosses every 5 minutes might have something to do with it", "score": 252, "replies": [{"body": "And having no new IP just changing skins on the same tired franchise.\n\nIm in shares.", "score": 42, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2810971736907959}, {"body": "and spending hundreds of millions on tv shows that don\u2019t generate revenue", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3135388493537903}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "You do know Disney has zero clue they are making shit movies?", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Their Q1 Earnings Report actually hinted they were like \"*hey guys we suck shit but don't worry, we're going to be good now!!!*\" and............  fuckin' lmao at what they came up with\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndg6n2ijkead1.png?width=1395&format=png&auto=webp&s=75bfe97096592f9c98c27866c760cd916b9f1f0c", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38449227809906006}, {"body": "That\u2019s cuz they have to be careful now so they won\u2019t make anymore outdated cultural depictions and get sued.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38797643780708313}, {"body": "Shitty movies can still make tons of money.
