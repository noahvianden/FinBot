The S&P500 was up over 90% in a bit over a year, since the pandemic low back in March 2020.\n\n\n\n|Company name|How it was described|Ticker|% change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Alteryx|Big Data Analytics|AYX|-39%|\n|Boston Omaha|Berkshire Hathaway 2.0|BOMN|6%|\n|Beyond meat|Plant-based meat|BYND|-95%|\n|Desktop Metals|3D Printing|DM|-95%|\n|ContextLogic|Discount e-commerce|WISH|-98%|\n|Fiverr|Online freelance marketplace|FVRR|-90%|\n|Global-E|Software for internatiocal e-commerce|GLBE|-38%|\n|Jumia|E-commerce in Africa|JMIA|-47%|\n|Lemonade|Next-gen insurance|LMND|-74%|\n|Upstart|Credit scores 2.0|UPST|-76%|\n|Latch|Hardware/software for property management|LTCH|-97%|\n|Nano-X Imaging|Bring medical imaging to the world|NNOX|-71%|\n|Origin Materials|Carbon negative plastic|ORGN|-85%|\n|Open Door|Real estate iBuying|OPEN|-82%|\n|Sofi Technologies|Digital financial services|SOFI|-50%|\n|Redfin|Real Estate 2.0 & iBuying|RDFN|-86%|\n|Ozon|e-Commerce in Russia|Ozon|Delisted|\n|Virgin Galactic|Space tourism|SPCE|-99%|\n|Twist Biosciences|DNA on demand|TWST|-56%|\n|YETI|High-quality outdoor gear|YETI|-57%|\n|||**Average**|**-70%**|\n|||**S&P500**|**28%**|\n\n\n\nThe table shows the performance of these \u201ctop 20 stocks that have 50x potential\u201d and as you can see, the average decline was a **staggering 70%,** compared to the **S&P500\u2019s gain of 28%** over the same period. Not only that, but **all of the 20 stocks underperformed the index.**\n\nThe reality is, that it is easy to look like a genius in a bull market. Positive sentiment drives stock prices up, and it hides the underlying weaknesses. The fear of missing out adds more fuel to the fire. But also, there was fuel in the form of stimulus checks.\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t last forever and market conditions change. When that happens, risky investments and poor strategies are exposed, and those following the crowd without doing their homework, eventually learn a harsh lesson, as we\u2019ll see in this perfect example.\n\nThe dramatic decline in these stocks serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of following the crowd in investing. Despite the initial optimism and promising potential, the reality has been a harsh lesson in the importance of thorough research.

Customers will inevitably look to move to other providers. If not simply for better security, for the purposes of demonstrating the strength of their security to their end clients (who know nothing about the true ins and outs of cybersecurity). CRWD has become a household name now for being a failure. For a similar example, Boeing (a company with a formerly incredible reputation) is now known as a failure in the eyes of the public. Imagine CRWD, which was unknown to the average citizen until today, now being known as a colossal failure.\n\n**Failed Public Response and CEO\u2019s Lack of Remorse** The public response from CrowdStrike has been an absolute disaster. Instead of taking full responsibility, their statements have been riddled with excuses and deflections. The CEO has failed to show any genuine remorse for the mistake, demonstrating a lack of accountability and understanding of the gravity of the situation. This kind of leadership is unacceptable and only adds insult to injury for their customers who are already suffering from the fallout.\n\n**Competitive Landscape** Competitors like Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) offer similar services without the tarnished reputation and fear of failure. They will undoubtedly learn from CrowdStrike's mistake, ensuring they do not repeat it. This gives them a significant edge in the market.\n\n**Political Risk** With the next US government (likely Trump 2024) already hesitant around tech in general, CrowdStrike is in a precarious position. A single tweet from Trump could tank this stock, exacerbating the already significant damage.\n\n**Customer Backlash** In the coming weeks, customers will be demanding compensation for billions lost in revenue due to CrowdStrike\u2019s outage. Fixing the damage will cost time and money for individual customers, and CrowdStrike may be liable or required to contribute to these costs.\n\n**Potential Fallout with Major Partners** Microsoft (MSFT) may move away from involving CrowdStrike in future defense of their systems. MSFT has its own security offerings and the issue originated from their OS. To protect their own reputation and stock price, MSFT would be smart to limit any connection to CrowdStrike.\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\n**Black Swan Perspective** Nassim Taleb\u2019s concept of a \"Black Swan\" event highlights the profound impact of rare and unpredictable events. For a cybersecurity company like CrowdStrike, the recent outage represents such an event. The fragility of their trust and reliability has been exposed, showing that even a small error can lead to catastrophic consequences. The cybersecurity industry is built on the foundation of preventing and mitigating risks. A company like CrowdStrike, which fails to uphold these principles, demonstrates an inherent fragility. The outage is not just a technical failure but a breach of trust that cannot be easily repaired.\n\n**Similar Company: SolarWinds** A notable example of a similar company that suffered a major breach is SolarWinds. In December 2020, SolarWinds experienced a significant security breach when their Orion software was compromised, leading to one of the most sophisticated and wide-reaching cyberattacks in history. The breach affected numerous government agencies and private companies, severely damaging SolarWinds' reputation. On December 11, 2020, SolarWinds was trading at $24.83, but by September 23, 2023, it had plummeted to $7.68. The majority of the damage was done reputationally immediately. Despite efforts to recover, SolarWinds has faced substantial backlash, legal challenges, and a loss of trust among its customers. This incident serves as a cautionary tale for CrowdStrike, showing how a single event can have long-term detrimental effects on a cybersecurity firm.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s recent outage has revealed deep flaws in their reliability and trustworthiness. With competitors like Palo Alto Networks standing ready to capitalize on this failure, and potential political and customer backlash looming, CrowdStrike\u2019s future looks bleak. Their customers, partners, and investors should consider this incident a major red flag, and avoid investing in a company with such compromised integrity and performance.", "id": "1e76uwn", "created_utc": 1721403829.0, "score": 604, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 weeks | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So...

Literally every company is trying this.\n\nYou know what's great for searching documents? Search engines. That's solid and well understood computer science, and you can run an Elasticsearch server for a few hundred dollars a year, and the engineer working on it will cost $200k/year less then an ML engineer building a novel LLM with RAG.\n\nI use LLMs all the time, but outside of ChatGPT, they all kind of suck. Building a server rack for tens of thousands of dollars that will let you run an LLM that has 1/10th the capability of GPT-4o that costs a few cents per query is just a massive waste of money", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.624184250831604}, {"body": "you described palantir's business model", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23180507123470306}], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Reversal from what?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11178417503833771}, {"body": "As long as they are beholden to TSMC to survive, let alone thrive, nothing they say really changes anything because they'll remain production limited for the foreseeable future.

They weren't competing with Apple for fab access when designing Blackwell because Apple is already fully on next node (3nm). \n\nApple is still TSMC's largest and most important client by far. So long as Apple pays the lockout premiums which they seem perfectly fine doing, they will likely continue to get preferential treatment / earlier exclusivity from TSMC while Nvidia competes with AMD and Qualcomm for fab time on the previous node. \n\nTSMC does not care about Nvidia's success, they care about extracting as much profit as possible, and that path is currently Apple focused for their latest tech.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It takes 4-5 years to build out fab capacity, there is zero chance NVidia could have started building fabs from back then to support $100bn+ in product this year.
