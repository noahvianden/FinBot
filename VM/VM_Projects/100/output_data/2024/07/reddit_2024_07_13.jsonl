{"title": "GME is going to go down", "selftext": "Guys, hear me out. It makes no sense why GME is up. GME is gonna tank, and here's why. First off, their financials are looking sketchy as hell \u2013 revenue's down, losses up, it's a mess. Plus, the hype from the whole meme stock craze is dying out. People aren't as hyped as they were back in the day. \n\nThen there's the competition. Amazon and digital downloads are eating their lunch. GameStop's trying to pivot, but it feels like too little, too late. And don't even get me started on management \u2013 it's like they're throwing darts at a board and hoping something sticks.\n\nEconomic factors like inflation and interest rates are another nail in the coffin. People are tightening their belts, and gaming isn't exactly a necessity. Oh, and if they start issuing more shares to raise capital, say goodbye to whatever value is left in the stock.\n\nAnalysts aren't loving GME either \u2013 more downgrades could send this thing spiraling. And let's be real, if they can't keep up with tech trends like cloud gaming, they're toast.\n\nTL;DR: GME's glory days are behind it. The financials are bad, the hype is gone, competition is fierce, and the future looks bleak.

My portfolio includes other holdings that provide a buffer against market volatility.\n\n-Market Volatility:\n\n\nMicron operates in a cyclical industry, subject to market fluctuations. However, their strong financials and strategic positioning provide resilience against downturns.\n\n-Geopolitical Risks:\n\n\nAs a global company, Micron faces geopolitical risks.

This is a long-term play with the potential for significant upside as market trends and technological advancements drive demand for memory and storage solutions.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 To the moon we go! \ud83c\udf15\ud83d\ude80\n\n#DiamondHands #MU \n\nDisclaimer: \n\nThis is not financial advice.

Because memory is a commodity, the memory business is actually tough for three reasons:\n1. Prices for DRAM and NAND are deflationary in nature. Good for consumers; tough business for MU/Samsung/Hynix when they need to spend through Capex cycles while facing deflationary cycles. Micron has yet to reach peak gross margin like it did back in the 2018 cycle\n2. The cost basis (pay to play) for DRAM is now going require EUV. See point 1 on gross margins\n3. Semi cap (maybe not now because multiples are so high) are just higher quality companies in terms of gross margin, FCF, & product differentiation of not having to deal with commodity pricing. I hold the portfolio of LAM, KLA, ASML. Never selling. \n\nThe X factor maybe High Bandwidth Memory. I have since left the semi industry, but if you are long Micron you really have to believe HBM is going to be such a differentiated product that it can generate 60% gross margins and sustain those gross margin through the \u201cwinter cycles\u201d\n\nKudos to Micron management though. Having seen them weather 2016, 2020 downturns, they are in much better financial shape in FCF and balance sheet than before.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s the commodity pricing reason and not having any ability to control cycles is the reason I\u2019m no longer a share holder.
