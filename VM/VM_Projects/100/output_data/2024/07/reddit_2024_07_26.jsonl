Here is what we know. There was a HARD rejection at 107. Meaning, that is a major buy signal for several players. In fact I was waiting for that drop to go to 7% and the recovery was so fast at about 6.8% that I never had the chance. So, there is that. \n\nFor me a settlement at 104.75 or below can mean a 90 - 97 multiple week objective. Most people with the technicals don't mix in the sentiment. Here's my take. Microsoft should improve on AI return in a major way. The key factor here is throughput. Microsoft said on the previous call that there is more demand than supply i.e. and I know this for a fact there isn't enough throughput to deliver to people so that they will pay for it. \n\nWith 4o there is throughput now and that can scale enterprise use cases by a factor of 4x's. So you know I am not talking out of my ass let me explain. \n\nGPT 4 use cases and product development had a token limit of 20k. Now, the ads will say 30+ k but realistically it was about 20k. With newer models of gpt 4 that is now \\~80k. So when we will telling partners we couldn't scale the product with more users now we can. \n\n4o only amplifies that further. \n\nPoint is, Microsoft should, in this quarter, post an impressive AI return result that is much more than 7%. I would hope it is 10% plus if not a 15% increase. \n\nThis not only bodes well for Microsoft but puts a serious dent in the argument that AI doesn't do anything or doesn't earn revenues.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recovery", "msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "exactly.

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "1ecjuu9", "created_utc": 1721986211.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "Starting to get pretty trigger happy on Google as it keeps falling.

Tesla could reproduce what xAI is today for far cheaper, but what xAI is today is effectively useless with no clear path to usefulness.\n\n**If the relevant technologies useful for Tesla described were ever to exist, Tesla could trivially reproduce or acquire competition**\n\n1. If you have an Optimus with baby-AGI, it's by necessity going to be running local models, and the evidence we have thus far (AKA the history of computing) is that once models reach that scale, everyone has them running on their desktops/phones anyway & such technology is quite reproducible by many companies (conversely, such 'amazing technology' wouldn't be viable if it needed massive datacenter support, as then it couldn't scale).\n\n2. And if multiple companies are reproducing this technology, Tesla by then could trivially spin up its own subsidiary, which competes with Musk's side-hustle, for far cheaper. Alternatively, if baby-AGI hits consumer-device scale, Tesla should just buy one of the 100 companies seriously pursuing it at that point, most likely for less than 5 billion of today's money.\n\n**xAI is a nonviable business:**\n\n1. xAI is not an industry leader. If Tesla does acquire a company in the space, there should be basic due diligence to ensure the company's finances are used efficiently, and there is seemingly no evidence here.\n\n2. xAI would be a drain on Tesla's finances w/ no clear horizon to profitability. Who's going to keep pumping money into it for the next decade? How is that a positive for Tesla, which has predominantly benefitted by externalizing the cost of R&D onto the rest of the industry & focusing on efficient production?\n\n3. xAI has no real monetization / B2B angle to scale. Other businesses aren't going to rely on Elon/xAI over mature FAANG offerings, e.g. Microsoft, Meta, and Google are monetizing their AI work, and that's infinite money to fuel further R&D, scale... \n\n4. There is no upside? I don't think AGI-ish technology will have a 'winner'. We're in a world where subject matter experts think FOSS LLMs are only trailing proprietary by 1-2y and this technology will run on consumer hardware (not datacenters) within a decade.

AI hardware improves by leaps-and-bounds yearly & old hardware loses significant value, so to compete they need serious funding; their datacenter today will be outdated by next year, and what they have today isn't impressive (and it's unclear what they hope to achieve that other companies wouldn't).

{"title": "Chip Stocks Are Bottoming, Including $NVDA.", "selftext": "[$SMH Index](https://preview.redd.it/z0kvqxplrved1.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2a54e1542a799449622a66a7fa5db97052c6e7a)\n\nJust a quick preface, if you don't like technical analysis then skip this one. It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts.

Mastering emotions like fear and greed, hope and pessimism to view things clearly. This takes a lot of inner work.\n\nOther stuff I\u2019ve found useful:\n\n- Set a stop loss at 20% for whatever option you bought. If you get stopped out, go home for the day. \n\nIf your account is $1,000 and you put 20% ($200) of capital in play, your risk is $40. That\u2019s recoverable. \n\n- Set a target to lock in gains. Move your stop up as you keep winning. Don\u2019t chase if you get stopped out, thinking you can buy back in. Just take your win. \n\n- Best intraday indicator for trading SPY is watching the vol ETFs (UVXY, SVXY). Compare the price action in those to the price action in SPY. You\u2019ll notice patterns in the behavior. \n\nWhat you want to look for is if vol is holding a firm level even as SPY is rising \u2014 this means a surprise is probably lurking. \n\nIf SPY is declining (like on a midday dip) and vol isn\u2019t really spiking or breaking new highs, it\u2019s more likely a buyable dip. \n\n- I prefer OTM options with two week\u2019s duration. Anything shorter gives me a heart attack. They\u2019ll retain enough value if spot price moves against you that you can at least roll into something else. \n\n- Options around 20-delta will have the most explosive potential. This is because *speed* (the second derivative of delta) tends to peak around this level. \n\n- Know the market trend. Right now the market is not strong.  Even up days are marked by weak closes.
