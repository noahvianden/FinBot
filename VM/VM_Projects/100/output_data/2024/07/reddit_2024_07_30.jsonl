{"title": "Bloomberg: Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound", "selftext": "Intel Corp. plans to eliminate thousands of jobs to reduce costs and fund an ambitious effort to rebound from an earnings slump and market share losses.\n\nThe workforce reduction may be announced as early as this week, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s plans, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. Intel, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings Thursday, has about 110,000 employees, excluding workers at units that are being spun out.\n\nChief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is spending heavily on research and development aimed at improving Intel\u2019s technology and helping it return to prominence in the semiconductor industry. The company\u2019s once-dominant position eroded under Gelsinger\u2019s predecessors as rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., have caught up and taken market share. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIntel shares rose about 1% in late trading, reaching as high as $31.11, on the news.\n\nOther chipmakers led by Nvidia Corp. have sprinted ahead in the development of lucrative semiconductors tailored for demanding artificial intelligence-related tasks. Intel is also coming to grips with uneven demand for chips that run laptops and desktop computers, its main business.\n\nGelsinger, betting that Intel can improve its technology, embarked on a plan to build factories to manufacture semiconductors for other chipmakers. Last week, Intel hired Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron Technology Inc. as chief global operations officer, putting him in charge of the company\u2019s overall manufacturing efforts.\n\nIntel reduced its workforce about 5% in 2023 to 124,800 by year\u2019s end after announcing job cuts beginning in October 2022. It also has slowed spending in other areas. The company expected those cost reductions would save as much as $10 billion by 2025.\n\nAnalysts project that Intel will report that second-quarter revenue was flat, compared with a year earlier. Growth will pick up modestly in the second half of 2024, and total sales will increase 3% to $55.7 billion for the full year, according to Wall Street estimates. That would be the first annual revenue increase since 2021.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/intel-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs-to-reduce-costs-fund-turnaround", "id": "1eg872p", "created_utc": 1722382253.0, "score": 630, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "Didn't they just get billions from the government to create jobs in America?

{"title": "An NVDA Price History Lesson.", "selftext": "TL;DR: Looking at the chart in this post, NVDA is showing similar patterns in price action between last qtr and this qtr. Despite being on a bearish downtrend, it may not be completely dead as we head into earnings on Aug. 28 based on the previous qtr's price action. There's more nuance than that in the post. Learn to read idk.\n\n*^(This post is purely observational/technical, no fundamentals, so take that as you will.)*\n\n\u201cHistory Doesn't Repeat Itself, but It Often Rhymes\u201d \u2013 **Mark Twain**.\n\nCringe quote aside, I wanted to make this post to prove a point that NVDA bulls are freaking out for nothing (...yet) and to explain a little bit of what has happened in the past regarding NVDA's price action before earnings and to give some insight for what could occur from here up until their earnings report is released on Aug. 28, 2024. For that we'll have to go *back to the past*, all the way to... four months ago.\n\nWe all know NVDA has had an insane year with a 125% gain YTD, but it hasn't gotten here by going up in a straight line (even though it may feel like it) and people already seem to be forgetting what happened leading up to their Q1 earnings in May, so please allow me to remind you. March 8th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others. NVDA closed the previous day(3/7) at $92.66, then opened 3/8 at $95.14(+2.67%). As the morning progressed, euphoria was high, and eventually NVDA pumped to $97.40 at it's peak(now a 5.1% increase from prev close). What occurred almost immediately after was an intense fall from grace as the stock price fell all the way down to $86.51 within two hours of it reaching its peak (-11.2% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. Two weeks later on 3/25 we were already testing the high again at $96.77 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**).\n\nThen came April. WW3 was FOR SURE happening between Iran and Israel, chips were losing momentum, and earnings were disappointing ^(()\\*^(calls on VIX)\\*). People were starting to wonder if NVDA's earnings were actually going to be as amazing as everyone had hoped. Worst to come, (NV)D-day (i'm *really* sorry) was just around the corner. April 19, 2024: SMCI's earnings report is approaching, and in previous quarters they would usually release preliminary earnings ahead of the actual report... but this time they opted not to. Panic. \"Their report must be horrible\", \"AI doesn't make money\", so on, so forth. NVDA dropped in sympathy from $84.66 prev close to $75.61 at its trough intra-day(-10.6%). **This was the bottom of this quarter.**\n\n***$97.40 to $75.61 from peak to trough in just 42 days. a -22.3% correction, all occurring within Q1.***\n\nFast forward to this quarter. Coming off of a blowout earnings, euphoria was once again fueling everyone and their Uber driver to buy NVDA stock. We took this sucker from $102.03 post earnings to it's peak at $140.76. June 20th, 2024 was both a glorious day for some NVestors (sorry) and horrifying for others... wait hold on. This seems familiar. On this day NVDA fell from it's peak at $140.76 to $129.52(-8% intra-day). **This was the first top for this quarter**. *Three\\** weeks later on 7/11 we were already testing the high again at $136.15 before once again trickling down(**second top of the quarter**). This quarter's bottom so far is sitting at $106.30 that occurred last Thursday 7/25 before deep V'ing back up to to being \\~$112 which was basically flat on the day.\n\n***$140.76 to $106.30 from peak to trough in just 35 days. a -24.4% correction, all occurring within Q2... so far.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axdtcsdb4mfd1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b7a76b2898dc2009d104ae2c5d3692096328e7\n\nIf it isn't obvious these events intra-quarter are practically parallels, but there are some differences of course.\n\nThis quarter we have:\n\n* 100% Priced in rate cut in September, whereas before it was more speculative on when we'd get a cut, if at all.\n* With that\\^, small caps are being rotated into.\n* The Election getting closer and historic events occurring leading up to the election(Trump shot, Kamala Replacing Biden, etc.)\n* Both Presidential Nominees/Administrations commenting on the geopolitical climate between Taiwan and China.\n* Nancy Bought.\n* NVDA at historically low volume as I've laid out in this post from 7/17 if you want to read: [NVDA's volume in the past 2 days have been at a near 2.5 year low with the exception of July 3, 2023. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e51wcl/nvdas_volume_in_the_past_2_days_have_been_at_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* Arguably stronger NVDA selloffs within this quarter; the 6/20 and 7/11 dates mentioned were both deep, aggressive selloffs sitting at -8% and -6.6% intra-day changes respectively whereas on 3/25 that sell off started off more slowly.\n* Jensen making Uninformative Sells of 240,000 shares starting in June and continuing to every other day in July.\n* AI fatigue now that everyone on Wall Street had their eyes on NVDA for the entire first half of the year.\n\nThis weeks mega-cap tech earnings also aren't accounted for yet and could absolutely affect NVDA negatively or positively, so we will have to wait and see on that one.\n\nAll that being said, nothing is guaranteed of course. This time it could be different and we could continue gapping down here and not even recover for quite some time, but I'm just trying to outline that we aren't *too* deep in the trenches yet. There needs to be more evidence of further selloffs before we have to give up hope that NVDA could ever recover before August earnings, but based on just this year's price action alone we're at a tipping point of either breaking down past a point of no return on NVDA or, similarly to last quarter, we've already seen the bottom for this quarter and we begin the gap up leading into NVDA earnings on 8/28. This week is an absolutely ***crucial*** moment for NVDA's trajectory leading into earnings.\n\nMy Copium: NVDA 10 contracts of 9/20 140c, avg cost: $6.75 currently $2.55, -$4,195 return.\n\nEdit: NVDA made a new bottom today 7/30/24 at $102.54. The updated difference from peak to trough for this qtr is now $140.76 to $102.54, -27.2% difference. Looking less good now, but still holding.\n\nEdit 2: New bottom in AH at $100.01 lol. $140.76 to $100.01, -28.95% difference", "id": "1efof3p", "created_utc": 1722329264.0, "score": 318, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 5 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 801 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If I know anything about investing (which I don't) I know for sure that 7/11 is a great deal.... buy there for sure!\n\nEDIT: Go all in on 7/11!

Would be huge in my overall portfolio, though. (And the ability to do something like this is recent. But MSFT I believe in for a decade+?)\n\n- game store and writing when IV high bc shares are cheap and it\u2019s sometimes volatile. \n\n- QQQ or SPY, though I don\u2019t usually hold those \u2026 maybe it\u2019s time now my portfolio has grown? Idk. Also to write CC against. \n\n- how viable is PMCC? If I set my LEAPS up as a debit spread, essentially? This confuses me, as I usually hold them bc I think there is huge upside. But also, would buy ATM or ITM as a capital efficient share proxy. \n\nLess appealing is screening IV each each week/month and acquiring to sell against\u2026seems\u2026\n\nLast question!
