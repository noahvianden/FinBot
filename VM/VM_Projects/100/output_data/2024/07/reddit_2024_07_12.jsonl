{"title": "The case for Intel from a former bear", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am long from $35 a share; this is my view on $INTC.\n\nI know r/stocks sees a lot of Intel posts, but none of the ones I've seen really describe the Intel story or, frankly, misunderstand the semiconductor industry entirely.\n\nA little background: I was an Intel bear from 2018 to 2024. The reason to have been bearish on the worst semiconductor stock over the past 10 years has been pretty obvious. Intel messed up their manufacturing; they had a 2-3 year lead over TSMC on node technology for over 20 years. But a series of mistakes, 10nm (now Intel 7), and messed-up 7nm (now Intel 4) led to a huge gap with their fabless competition. This allowed Nvidia and AMD, who design chips using software (Cadence and Synopsys) that follow design IP rules set by TSMC, to produce and package the chips.\n\nIntel turned a lead into a 2-year gap. The previous CEO, in 2020, bought TSMC capacity at 3nm to hedge the possibility that Intel would fail again and to allow their products to be more competitive until the foundry side caught up.\n\nThis has led to where we are today. Intel Foundry has low utilization due to outsourcing for next year and is producing uneconomic products, leading to a cash burn. While Intel products for the past 4 years have sold uncompetitive chips.\n\nBut investing is about the future; you are buying today and not the past. So what is coming that will change the story?\n\nLet's deal with the product side of the business first. Right now, the vast majority of Intel products are uncompetitive, which leads to lower volume and lower ASPs. That is changing come the end of this year. Intel products will have Lunar Lake (TSMC 3nm) ultra-low power mobile CPU, and Arrow Lake (TSMC 3nm) desktop and mobile CPU. By all accounts, these products will be extremely competitive and are actually on a superior node to AMD (TSMC 4nm). As the volume of these products ramps up in Q4, Intel ASPs and volume will slowly rise.\n\nIntel also has data center CPUs coming into volume this year: Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids using the Intel 3 node. These products close the gap with AMD in the data center but do not surpass them.\nNext year, Intel products will have Panther Lake (Intel 18A) low-power mobile CPU and Clearwater Forest (Intel 18A) Data Center CPU, which should jump ahead of AMD. There's also a data center GPU, Falcon Shores, but there\u2019s little information on it, so I'm not going to speculate.\n\nSome of you might be asking how I compare TSMC 3nm, Intel 3, Intel 18A, etc. To keep it simple, Intel uses PPA (power, performance, and area) to name its nodes in comparison to TSMC. In general, you should think of nodes as having two factors: density and PPA. TSMC has a comfortable density lead, which helps generally in lower power, and higher PPA is generally better for HPC chips (CPUs). Intel 3 has been documented to have a lower density than TSMC 3nm but a similar PPA. Intel intends to catch up with density on Intel 18A next year to TSMC 3nm and have a lead with PPA vs TSMC 2nm/3nm node.\n\nNow to Intel Foundry's business. Intel Foundry is losing money due to the vast majority of their production being uncompetitive nodes and having much lower volume than in the past since Intel is outsourcing some production to TSMC. Sometime next year, Intel Foundry will begin to see a shift to Intel 18A. This comes with a 3x higher selling price per wafer vs. current nodes. Incremental volume will return to Intel Foundry as Intel shifts back to Intel Foundry from TSMC. Just as Intel products will slowly start to see rising ASPs at the end of this year, you can expect Intel Foundry to slowly climb out of the hole. Each quarter next year, as Intel 18A ramps up will lead to lower losses. Intel also wants external customers and has some booked, with Microsoft being the largest single customer. Intel Foundry is competing against TSMC, whose similar node to 18A is their 2nm. TSMC 2nm will ramp up at the end of 2025 and won\u2019t have real products until sometime in 2026. This gives Intel a nice window to demonstrate to potential customers that 18A is competitive and has good yields. For a follow-on node of 14A using ASML High NA. Intel does not expect to be #1 Foundry by volume, nor do they have to be with its current valuation.\n\nUltimately the biggest downside is Intel messes up 18A. Then I would sell, and buy $AMD. I think over the next 3 years. Intel can be north of $100 a share. The semiconductor industry operates with a large lag, Intel's current results are being driven by decisions made in early 2021.

I am long on INTC with a cost basis of $30.77.\n\n**Correct Points**\n\n1. Intel's past manufacturing missteps, particularly with their 10nm and 7nm processes, have been well-documented and led to a significant loss of their competitive edge.\n2. Intel's decision to use TSMC for some of its manufacturing needs to mitigate risks associated with its process delays is accurate. This was a strategic move to stay competitive in the short term.\n3. The challenges faced by Intel\u2019s foundry business due to lower utilization and production of uneconomic nodes are real. The shift to Intel 18A and the potential improvement in the foundry business, as Intel moves back from TSMC to its fabs, is also significant.\n4. The anticipation that Intel 18A will be competitive against TSMC's 2nm node is a reasonable projection based on Intel\u2019s current roadmap and industry expectations.\n\n**Points Requiring Correction or Clarification**\n\n1. While it is true that Intel\u2019s recent products have been less competitive, the statement that \u201cthe vast majority of Intel products are uncompetitive\u201d is an exaggeration. Intel still maintains competitiveness in several market segments, especially where software optimization and overall ecosystem support play significant roles.\n2. The expectation that new products will ramp up quickly and significantly increase ASPs (Average Selling Prices) and volumes might be overly optimistic. Market adoption can be slower, and competitive responses from AMD and others could impact this growth.\n3. The timeline for Intel 18A\u2019s ramp-up is ambitious. While Intel aims for aggressive timelines, the complexity of semiconductor manufacturing means delays are always a risk, as seen with past nodes.\n4. OP suggests that Intel\u2019s foundry business will see a smooth recovery with Intel 18A. However, capturing significant external foundry customers is challenging, and Intel will face strong competition from TSMC and Samsung, who have well-established foundry businesses and customer bases.\n5. The claim that Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids will close the gap with AMD is somewhat speculative. AMD\u2019s EPYC processors have a strong foothold in the data center market, and Intel will need more than just competitive nodes; they will need to demonstrate superior performance, efficiency, and value to regain lost market share.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "1) Fair, some of that comment is node intel is using to compete. In the data center, sapphire rapids and emerald rapids are inferior outside of very specific workloads. Intel is only able to sell them due to pricing. Meteor Lake is a mixed bag, but generally only sells due to AMD's inability to get enough volume or design wins. Raptor Lake is competitive in performance but at the cost of power consumption.\n\n2/3/4) I hope I didn't come off as if 18A will hook up like a hockey stick. It's going to be a slow ramp in 2H 2025 into 2026. But each quarter should see an improvement. \n\n5) Serve the home has a very nice review of Sierra Forest\n\nhttps://www.servethehome.com/intel-xeon-6-6700e-sierra-forest-shatters-xeon-expectations/6/\n\nI also know they are shipping in volume, I know someone at a data center who is installing them.", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Intel has Microsoft, Broadcom, and Mediatek as 18A customers.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "And a generational contract to make all ARM chips.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27421653270721436}, {"body": "source for that?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1508355289697647}], "tickers": ["intc", "msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["recovery", "intc", "intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "So much hopium and assumptions. Yeah your hypothesis works if all the assumptions work out perfectly. If only you knew all the problems Intel are facing from an actual insider....\n\n  \nEdit: Folks asked for my piece. \n\nLet me start by stating the obvious. I'm an anonymous bloke on the internet - don't believe what I say. Take it as one of the many inputs if you want. I'll be generalizing a few points - no details, I'm sorry.\n\n1) Foundry play - I might or might not be part of the IAO program to enable this. It's an ambitious bet by Pat and he gets credit for it. Intel cannot survive doing business as usual. Problem is this behemoth of a ship is not nimble enough to make it happen quickly and cheaply. The program is bogged down by everyone trying to build an empire within itself and others refusing change. Processes, operations and even the ERP systems are being completely revamped right now - but instead of a laser focus on making foundry happen, a ton of bells and whistles are thrown in because folks needed to justify their job. Net result? Fabs are delayed. The much-touted advanced packaging factories' construction has slowed because there is no demand on the horizon. The pelican cannot fly. This is a huge bet with large capex which is hyper risky. Build it, and they will come mantra might not work out.\n\n2) Product lines - I appreciate OP putting together a good list of upcoming products. Lunar lake looked extremely promising and competitive. Others are still up in the air - and also competing against latest gen of competitors launching soon. It's not going to be win after win like expected. But this is a /stocks, not /hardware. So let's talk about margins. Intel's margins are BAD. Intel knows it, and they've done a ton in the past couple years to cut costs. Company is still too bloated. It can afford to cut 50% support functions (HR, IT etc) and still operate well. You can't compete with TSMC and others on cost if you're running like it's the 1980s. I've got examples of teams with 10x the headcount supporting similar activities compared to their closest competitor. You don't have to believe me on this and skip this entire paragraph. Which brings me to culture.\n\n3) Culture - Intel does employee reduction activities every couple years. Yes many companies do that but not in that scale. Intel hires, and fires in rapid cycles. It has driven down morale so much, many people are dying to take the \"package\" and leave. The folks left behind are 20yr veterans who has nowhere else to go. If you have friends in Intel, talk to them, see if I am lying. Intel today resembles a marketing/sales company rather than an engineering ones. Leaders tout promises and generate excitement in public appearances - problem is many of them didn't materialize. Jensen for all his showboating, backs it up with results. Lisa only gives facts and doesn't speculate sales. If you don't already see this - you have blue running in your blood. Kudos.\n\n4) AI wave - Gaudi what?\n\nBottom line - a better product doesn't equate to market share growth or profitability. Just ask AMD of their experience in the past.\n\n  \nI could write an entire book about many other topics but you get the gist. I do care about Intel. I have skin in the game. But the current version of it, will take more than a few good products to fix. So that $100 target - I hope will be true but I won't hold my breath. Intel's problems take more than 3 years to fix. In Intel's own words, don't expect foundry to be profitable until 2030 - so I'm not sure how to get to $100 at 2027.\n\nSomeone will probably write a piece to refute my points - just know I won't reply further to this.

This goes into the weeds a little bit \n\n\nIn general, I don\u2019t know when the market will take Intel seriously. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Intel fell after next quarter's results, but I do believe next year is when Intel will take off. Intel is catching up with current data center CPUs. Intel released Emerald Rapids last December and Granite Rapids/Sierra Forest this quarter. Next year, they will release Clearwater Forest and Diamond Rapids. This is an impressive pace in the CPU world compared to AMD.\n\nClearwater Forest next year will use \u2018Darkmont\u2019 cores, an upgrade of the \u2018E\u2019 core in Lunar Lake. We know \u2018Skymont\u2019 in Lunar Lake achieves a 30-40% IPC increase compared to the same architecture in a Sierra Forest CPU. \u2018Darkmont\u2019 should be even better, considering it's on 18A versus Intel 3. This should outperform AMD in power-efficient, high-core workloads. We don\u2019t know as much about Diamond Rapids, but it will also be on 18A and is expected to perform well.\n\nI think Lunar Lake will be the best lower-power chip with its already-announced performance. If you extrapolate, Arrow Lake should surpass AMD, but it's not guaranteed. Lunar Lake is a strong competitor to AMD Zen 5 in mobile. Panther Lake next year should extend the lead, considering AMD will not be launching a new CPU architecture until 2026.\n\nIntel also has strong technology in packaging, such as EMIB and Foveros, which is a good introduction to customers. I don\u2019t think Intel will secure major external orders on 18A, as orders are already placed on TSMC 2nm. However, if 18A performs well next year and in 2026, Intel will be able to attract prime customers for 14A. According to their roadmap, 14A will be ahead of TSMC A16. Intel's planned volume, however, falls far short of TSMC's, so this is not a short $TSM post. Intel merely needs to break even or be slightly profitable in the foundry business for a $100 price target.\n\nIntel is also leading the UXL foundation to establish an open software language as an alternative to CUDA. Their oneAPI has been in development for a few years. If UXL succeeds, it will be a valuable marketing tool. Intel, AMD, Google, and Broadcom are also in the UEC group to offer an open alternative to Nvidia's InfiniBand for scaling up and scaling out data center GPUs. Personally, I have no insight into whether these groups will succeed, or if Falcon Shores late next year will be competitive against AMD or Nvidia. However, I do know that nothing is priced in, so it\u2019s all upside if they deliver.\n\nI must caveat that if 18A encounters issues, Arrow Lake underperforms, and the roadmap is delayed, then Pat is a liar, and I would not touch the stock.
