{"title": "Amazon passed Google as 4th largest in S&P 500", "selftext": "\u201cAmazon stock was rising on Tuesday, just enough to maintain its place as the S&P 500\u2019s fourth-largest company by market value after overtaking Alphabet on Monday. It may owe Oracle a little bit of a thank you.\n\nShares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday\u2019s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet\u2019s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon\u2019s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet\u2019s at Monday\u2019s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nAmazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it\u2019s also focused on \u201cbalancing expenditures with revenue growth,\u201d according to BofA analyst Justin Post.\n\nThere was also good news from Oracle\u2019s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft\u2019s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. \u201cOracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,\u201d he writes.\n\nRight now investors will just settle for gains.\u201d\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/how-amazon-stock-passed-alphabet-as-4th-largest-in-s-p-500-with-an-assist-from-oracle/ar-AA1qkrii", "id": "1fduwrf", "created_utc": 1726007610.0, "score": 576, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "Warren Buffett used to say he likes to buy businesses that are strong enough that they could be run by a ham sandwich, because sooner or later they will be.\n\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, Sundar Pichai is that ham sandwich.", "score": 439, "replies": [{"body": "This is so funny to me because reddit measures the CEO based on the short term stock performance.

Europe is facing an \"existential challenge\" due to slowing growth and productivity compared to the US, coupled with new geopolitical and technological pressures.\n\n2. Without major reforms, Europe risks being unable to finance its social model and achieve its ambitions in areas like climate, defense, and technology leadership.\n\n3. Three main areas for action are identified:\n\n   a) Closing the innovation gap, especially in advanced technologies\n   b) Developing a joint plan for decarbonization and competitiveness \n   c) Increasing security and reducing dependencies on other nations\n\n4. Key barriers holding Europe back include:\n   \n   a) Lack of focus and clear priorities\n   b) Inefficient use of common resources\n   c) Poor coordination between national and EU-level policies\n\n5. The report calls for a new industrial strategy to overcome these barriers, including:\n\n   a) Streamlining regulations and the Single Market\n   b) Better coordinating defense and innovation spending\n   c) Reforming decision-making processes to enable faster, more coordinated action\n\n6. Significant public investment will be needed alongside private sector funding. Increasing productivity is seen as key to creating fiscal space for this.\n\n7. Draghi argues Europe must act decisively now, as procrastination has only led to slower growth without preserving consensus. He calls for democratic debate on priorities and trade-offs.\n\n8. The report expresses confidence that the scale of shared challenges will compel European nations to unify and enact bold reforms.\n\nThe overall message is that Europe faces major structural challenges but has the potential to overcome them through coordinated action and reform at the EU level.
