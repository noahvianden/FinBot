It helps small caps/growth companies. One way it could help is access for small caps to try and scale into AI investment through debt.\n\n2025 I'm shooting to the low end, depending on the election outcomes we will either be experiencing a battle on tech, or a battle in tariffs. The later we all know how that works with one of the candidates. \n\n2030 I'm sticking with a $10T market cap, so roughly $400 a share. I expect more, but this has been my base case since 2018. Funny thing, I expected $1T this year, which is partly true lol", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Realistic? Who would have believed NVDA would have hit the equivalent of 1400 a share in 2024 when it was 50 a share in 2019?\n\nThe right way to ask this question is: what are NVDA's markets between now and 2030?\n\n1. Data center -- I see this growth slowing down after Blackwell. My main reason being the process improvement for Rubin seems marginal, and Blackwell is already reticle limited. I would be proved wrong should Nvidia's AI-driven chip design result in significant performance improvements per watt and area. I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia starts driving costs down here also.\n2. Games -- not gonna grow much. Once everyone upgrades to the 5xxx series, it'll slow down a lot IMO.\n3. Networking -- this is really data center and this part should grow. But likely less than $20B by 2030.\n4. Automotive -- reliable AI driving will come, and basically needs the autonomous agent level of AI (see [https://www.perplexity.ai/page/openai-s-5-steps-to-agi-STzklF5SSQ6JOiBTaV.cfA](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/openai-s-5-steps-to-agi-STzklF5SSQ6JOiBTaV.cfA) ) to handle all of the little details that are not trainable.  The global 4 wheel market is estimated to be about $4T in 2030, so if AI is 10% of the cost, that's a $400B market.\n\nNew markets:\n\n5. Robotics -- this can start with just the problem solving level of AI, but eventually you want autonomous level as well. The market here is essentially unlimited. $10T I do not think is unreasonable. So, that's $1T of revenue just for the AI components (again assuming a 10% breakdown.) Maybe it takes longer to get there. So $2T in 2030? 200B for Nvidia then.\n\n6. AI in the cloud -- I think Nvidia won't get into this as it's far more profitable to sell a $X cost part for $4X than to use that to build their own data centers. They'll still build one datacenter for their own use, of course, and that's deductible as a business expense as well. (So your autonomous agents run on someone else's hardware in the cloud, and that's what continues to drive data center purchases -- as more people want to use agents, hardware to support them increases.)\n\n7. New unknown market -- I have no idea. I'll assume none.\n\nSo we're looking at roughly $700B in sales in 2030, which is a roughly 6x increase. So, my 2030 prediction for NVDA is 6\\*125 = 750 a share, and a $20T market cap.\n\n2024, 2025? Who the fuck knows. I sure don't. I'd guess that the Nov '24 earnings will again beat estimates but not as much as analysts want, and the price will remain roughly where it is now (125-150.) 2025 no point in guessing, I have no idea.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "2024: $135 || 2025: $175 || 2026: $235", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4167812764644623}, {"body": "As opposed to non realistic predictions?

There was a methodology team that was worldwide, the SoC team was partly in Austin and partly in India, the floating-point cache was done in Colorado, the core execution front end was in Austin, the Arm front end was in Sunnyvale, and we had good technical leaders. I was in daily communication for a while with Suzanne Plummer and Steve Hale, who kind of built the front end of the Zen core, and the Colorado team. It was really good people. Mike Clark's a great architect, so we had a lot of fun, and success. Success has a lot of authors - failure has one. So that was a success. Then some teams stepped up - we moved Excavator to the Boston team, where they took over finishing the design and the physical stuff, Harry Fair and his guys did a great job on that. So there were some fairly stressful organizational changes that we did, going through that. The team all came together, so I think there was a lot of camaraderie in it.
