The transformer model architecture which revolutionized machine translation and language modeling would not be published until 2017. The AlexNet paper which was just about the first paper to leverage (Nvidia) GPUs to scale up image recognition did not come out until 2012. In 2012, this paper revolutionized the field by training a convolutional neural network (quite possibly the largest in the world at the time) on just two commercial grade Nvidia GTX 580 gaming GPUs.  \nDoes he mention machine learning at all in 2011? No.\n\nBut go to roughly 30 minutes, and Jensen tells us exactly why Nvidia is successful today. He talks about GeforceFX and the invention of programmable shaders. Nvidia developed the first domain specific language (Cg; circa 2004) for building programmable shaders. Before Cg was invented, shaders were incredibly hard to program. Games like DOOM3 had to have specialized code paths for different GPUs and I believe the shaders themselves had to be written in a low level assembly-like language.\n\nCg not only simplified the creation of shaders, but it also locked in gamedevs for several years into Nvidia's ecosystem. Furthermore, researchers at universities were able to hack it to use GPUs for general purpose computing. Just a few years later, Nvidia would release CUDA which is even better for getting GPUs to do general purpose computing.\n\nSo the general idea is NVIDIA did not develop CUDA out of altruistic motives, nor did it do it to revolutionize machine learning. The goal was the same goal as with Cg and development of programmable shaders. It was to expand the GPU market into\u00a0**general purpose computing**. In 2004 the biggest driver of Nvidia GPUs was Doom 3 and Half-life 2. In 2024, gaming represents less than 10% of Nvidia's sales!\n\nNvidia continues to do this.

There's no point in bringing up Ageia PhysX when it hasn't existed for 2 decades now, especially since it was bespoke to the Ageia PPU.

And Maya supported GPU accelerated PhysX. \n\n>Fine, I was incorrect about Blender but You complain that Blender needed AMD to add OpenCL support and your own link shows NVIDIA needed to contribute support for their own APIs.\n\nExcept AMD didn't add openCL support to Cycles, and I didn't say they did. I said they had to pay to get the Cycles openCL backend rewritten to support their cards. That happened because of how broken their openCL drivers were and they apparently found it easier to make some software compatible with their drivers than fix their implementation of openCL. The re-written split kernel openCL backend was released in 2015 with Blender 2.75. So the only reliable way to use Cycles with openCL for 4 years was with Nvidia cards, which ran better on the CUDA backend anyway. Optix doesn't even have anything to do with the fact that Nvidia was the only company putting any effort into offering OpenCL as a viable platform. I'm not even blaming AMD for offering a broken feature and claiming they supported it, but pointing out how Nvidia was de facto the only company putting effort into supporting openCL, and the 2nd best option was a distant second, so your insistence that openCL went down because of nvidia doing some underhanded things is absurd. \n\n>And yes khronos is a consortium.

OpenCL 3 has conformant devices from most of the major manufacturers, except AMD.

Here's what chat gpt said when I pasted the question.... ->\n\nAbsolutely, I can provide some thoughts on those questions:\n\n### 1. **Was Jensen Huang a visionary for investing in CUDA, or simply lucky?**\nHuang's decision to invest in CUDA back in 2007 was far from guaranteed success. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) required a huge amount of foresight because, at the time, GPUs were primarily used for graphics processing. Huang and Nvidia bet on the future of parallel computing, recognizing that GPUs could be repurposed for a wide range of computing tasks, particularly in scientific, machine learning, and AI fields. This decision to push CUDA, despite slow adoption, shows strategic foresight.\n\nWhat prevented others from doing something similar was likely a combination of risk tolerance, a lack of vision for GPU usage outside of gaming, and perhaps the failure to see the potential for parallel computing to become so widespread. Many companies are hesitant to invest heavily in something that doesn\u2019t promise short-term returns, which Nvidia was willing to do.\n\n### 2. **If you are invested in Nvidia, how much do you consider Hwang's foresight a valuable \"x-factor\"?**\nIf I were an Nvidia investor, I would place significant weight on Huang's foresight as an \"x-factor.\" His ability to anticipate market trends, like the rise of AI, data centers, and GPU-accelerated computing, has positioned Nvidia as a leader in several emerging fields. The value here isn't just in technological innovation but in consistently understanding the next big computing wave, as Nvidia's dominance in AI shows.\n\nHuang\u2019s track record of driving Nvidia through multiple technology cycles\u2014graphics, parallel computing, AI\u2014suggests that his leadership and vision are crucial to the company\u2019s long-term value. For many investors, his strategic foresight may be seen as priceless, and likely a major reason behind Nvidia\u2019s market premium.\n\n### 3. **If you don\u2019t like Nvidia, how much of that is due to Huang?**\nFor those skeptical of Nvidia, Huang\u2019s aggressive and ambitious strategy may be seen as a risk. While his success with CUDA, AI, and GPU leadership is undeniable, critics may point to potential overreach in his broader ambitions. Nvidia has seen some regulatory scrutiny, especially around its acquisition attempts (like ARM), and this could be seen as a reflection of Huang\u2019s risk-taking behavior. Critics might argue that Nvidia has focused too much on diversifying into multiple sectors, which could dilute its focus and stretch resources.\n\nMistakes might include underestimating competition from companies like AMD in the gaming and consumer space or failing to bring the ARM acquisition to fruition, which could have been a game-changing move for the company. Another potential criticism could be that Nvidia\u2019s products are premium-priced, which sometimes alienates broader markets.\n\n### 4. **What about Huang\u2019s other projects (Omniverse, Isaac, self-driving)?**\nHuang has certainly diversified Nvidia\u2019s portfolio. Projects like Omniverse (for 3D design and simulations), Isaac (robotics), and Nvidia's self-driving platform demonstrate his ambition to position Nvidia at the forefront of multiple revolutionary industries. These are all cutting-edge fields, and if successful, they could provide Nvidia with additional revenue streams that further solidify its leadership in tech.\n\nHowever, the risk of overstretching is real. These projects demand immense resources, and the market for them is still maturing. For example, while self-driving cars are promising, widespread adoption has been slower than many expected. The Omniverse could become a big player in virtual worlds and digital twins, but it's not guaranteed. Critics might say that Huang is spreading the company too thin across too many unproven areas, which could detract from Nvidia's core strengths in GPUs and AI.\n\nThat said, Huang has proven to have a knack for placing strategic bets, and if even a couple of these projects succeed, Nvidia could continue its dominant trajectory. Whether these ventures become big winners or overreach will depend largely on market timing and execution.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, Jensen Huang\u2019s mix of foresight and risk-taking has undeniably shaped Nvidia\u2019s success. While luck may play a role in any business venture, Huang\u2019s consistent ability to stay ahead of technological trends has solidified Nvidia\u2019s position.

They already tried impeaching him twice; accusing him of being a Russian asset (ironically, by using Russian assets to fabricate the evidence); banning voters from voting for him; raiding his house; charging him with a multitude of politically-motivated lawfare months before an election; literally trying that lawfare again after the Supreme Court ruled in his favor; spreading 8-years worth of slime and lies via the mainstream media; banning him from social media; defending any points that support his claim to the presidency by lying to the populace (ie the Hunter laptop and Biden\u2019s daughter\u2019s notebook\u2014literally lied to us via top CIA/FBI officials and spread through the media); and potentially plotted or allowed the assassination attempt. So yes, if he does get into office, the attacks will not stop. And one such new attack may be the unleashing of the sludge within the financial markets to crash upon him. Although this may be inevitable and not particularly the fault of either party\u2014rather just a feature of our monetary system\u2014they do have the ability to kick the can down the road or unleash the beast. I do think it is feasible for them to thwart him with a massive, potentially-worldwide financial crisis, similar to how they either unleashed covid upon him, or at least played it against him as best they could (listening to any leftist, you\u2019d think covid originated and exclusively affected only Trump\u2019s USA). \n- If I am not mistaken, something like 70% of USA housing is locked in to 3% rates.  This will be the last domino to fall, and a very tough one at that. People will defend their mortgage to their past breath. They will forgo their school loans, credit card bills, and car payments, and even utilities well before they are willing to forfeit their mortgages. And even then, mass housing defaults are likely to incur some sort of artificial protections from state and federal governments, thus making it that much harder for housing to come down, and thus making the \u201ccrash\u201d not even close to being as bad as 2008.  Ultimately, 2008 was bad because people lost their homes.  Short of that, no recession or crash is really that bad. So some people lose a portion of their unrealized gains. Whooptydo. They just have to wait longer to recover. Not a big deal. But people who have to find a place for their cats and dogs and wife and 3 kids, yeah, that\u2019s really bad. \n- On that same note, there is another sizeable portion of housing that is at risk of default (which is good news for cash-gang). Lots of AirBnbs and flippers out there may be at a loss.  Hopefully they have to sell en masse and thus bring down housing.\n- Lots of online institutions are seeing the crash coming. Usually markets move opposite of what the populace thinks (or so it seems to me). \n- Yellen says she sees no red signs.

{"title": "AI is dead", "selftext": "TL;DR: AI training is leading to dumber AI, which means AI progress is far behind what idiot finance AI bros expected with their valuations. However, smart people will continue investing into AI development because the bubble supercharged understanding of AI and infrastructure for AI development\n\n\nI\u2019m a physician. 2 years ago, I looked at chat gpt and was pretty sure that mfer was going to take my job. This thing was outperforming everyone in conceptualizing cases and cutting through to weeds to make intricate diagnoses. \n\nI was obsessed with AI over the past 2 years and I used it for a whole host of uses, even going as far as starting an AI company to help doctors with AI tools. \n\nOutside of my direct work, I was using AI to write various publications I needed, most regularly, recommendation letters. I fed chat gpt my writing samples and tinkered with it to create highly personalized, extremely nuanced samples. At the time, I could have it write a completely made up narrative for a rec letter that tied in values brought up in a students personal statement and used coded language typical of rec letters while delivering it in my unique voice. It was incredible and it saved me so much time.\n\nFast forward to today. The AI tools I developed for physicians no longer work because the AI is no longer capable of thinking in subtle or nuanced ways. All the outputs are generic bullshit with no thought. The writing has gone in the same exact direction, and now I can barely use it to put together an outline for a rec letter. \n\nLook across the AI world and you\u2019ll see the problem: AI has become too generic. There\u2019s a distinct writing style that it refuses to stray from. There\u2019s a distinct art style that it refuses to change. 2 years ago, I could ask for an impressionist painting, and I\u2019d be impressed. Now it\u2019s just the same 3d render crap all over the internet. \n\nI\u2019m not an expert in the fundamentals of AI, but from my understanding, the speed of AI training has skyrocketed and AI benchmarks are better than ever. I have no idea what that shit means, but as a formerly heavy user of AI tools, I\u2019m not seeing that in the end product. What I\u2019m seeing is basically schizophrenia; profound intellectual limitations brought on by an overwhelming amount of information that can\u2019t be cleaned up. \n\nNow I\u2019m not saying there aren\u2019t other AI systems that are smart, but the AI boom was essentially set off by chat gpt and chat gpt wrapper companies. Many Companies not directly running on chat gpt were using insights developed by Open AI to guide their AI development. That means most AI are likely having the same issue of polluted training that\u2019s getting harder and harder to clean up.  \n\nAll that being said, AI developers are in a great place. They learned a lot of great lessons and they had a chance to build out massive infrastructure and data centers. They will likely have to move several steps back in their AI development before they can move forward again, but it\u2019ll be far easier and faster than the first time around\n\nOf course, Wall Street doesn\u2019t give a shit about lessons learned, they care about money earned. The expectation was basically that most humans would be jobless vagrants by the end of next year, and they would be on their mega yachts earning of companies pretty much completely automated off AI. Every layoff was seen as a step towards that goal, and they could barely keep their dystopian dreams in their pants, throwing out giant green boners at every layoff announcement. \n\nNow AI is sputtering and companies are about to make an about face, completely destroying the narrative.\n\nYou see, the jobs reports paint an extremely clear picture for us- hiring is at a low, but firings and unemployment are steady. Basically everyone has a hiring freeze until interest rates go down and they can invest in expansions or refinance loans. This is a different story than \u201chiring are down, firings are up, all jobs to the AI\u201d\n\nSo where does this leave us? Pretty much in a similar place to the dot com bubble. The idiots are about to think AI is a useless gimmick just like they thought the internet would be a useless gimmick when pets.com sold for a billion times more than it would ever be worth. When the bubble bursts, the smart people will continue working and the economy will be rebuilt with human/AI collaboration at the core of most workflows within a decade. \n\nIn the mid term, All stocks will likely retreat over the next month or two, with a possible crash among AI heavy tech stocks. Once the economy is confirmed to not have crashed, the market will likely have a quick recovery into a steady bull market though the end of November into January. \n\nOver the following year, governmental policy will determine how well the economy expands and what sectors benefit the most. In 3-4 years, we\u2019ll have a rotation back into AI fields as the tech matured and gains actual, functional adoption.\n\nThat\u2019s my theory at least, wtf do I know, I\u2019m just a Wendy\u2019s cashier ranting at some drunk regards.
