{"title": "Is Private Equity a bubble? ", "selftext": "I came across this white paper from this guy. I really liked it. He talked about PE industry went from 500 billion to 8 trillion in 20 years mainly because of their \u201efinancial engineering\u201c similar to that of mortgage securities in 08. \n\nHe claimed unwinding in imminent and only a matter of time when. \n\nWhat do you think? I myself have seen one too many people obsess about this profession recently, especially ex investment bankers. \n\n One of the point I really liked from the paper was, PE firms care short term returns but the owner of a business actually cares long term. PE owners have no trouble firing people and raising prices but the owner on the other had do care about jobs pf the people etc. I have heard buffet shit about PE too in the past, saying they are dishonest. \n\nNow am having confirmation bias or is there a real interesting story underneath?! Plus all the PE firms are at all times high, Ik that doesn\u2019t mean anything but how long can a thing stay bullish?! Forever?! \n\n**Edit: Holy dear jesus, this blew up.

Then, they asked for all my key metrics. Then they made the offer. A few phone calls to negotiated the details. Then, the due diligence process was a breeze. Then we signed. On the closing day I was sitting there refreshing my bank's page to see when the wire comes in.\n\nIt was taking forever, so I called them. They were like \"oh, yeah, I forgot to ask Mike to sign off on the wire, hold on, I think I saw him leaving for lunch let me grab him now\". Like it's nothing to them.\n\nThen an hour or so later the wire came in. And my low five digit account balance changed to seven digit balance after a refresh of a page.\n\nThen the panic set it. So I started another business literally a week later (which a few years later I sold for seven fig to a competitor of the guys that bought this one. Different niche, so non-compete didn't apply but similar business model.) Six months later I started another business, which I still have 15 years later.\n\nIt was a fun ride. But I was a regard and didn't invest the money, so I pretty much live off of my current business ventures now instead of having several mil in s&p500 and being semi-retired, if I just weren't a moron.\n\nBut back then the market was in this giant sideways mode, so I just didn't believe it would grow in the time horizon for which I planned. I was wrong on both counts. The market eventually started to grow, and time horizons of young people are way too short to be realistic.\n\nThe moral of the story is don't be a regard and invest.

This money has to go somewhere to grow. However, **public stock markets** just aren't big enough to handle all this cash. If too much money floods the public market, prices would go crazy due to simple supply and demand (more money chasing the same number of stocks). It's like if everyone in a huge city wanted to buy just one house\u2014prices would skyrocket.\n\nSo, these big money players needed an alternative. That's where **private markets** come in, specifically **Private Equity (PE)** and **Venture Capital (VC)**:\n\n- **VC** is for startups or early-stage companies. They fund high-risk, high-reward businesses hoping to strike it big.\n\n- **PE** buys out more mature companies, often aiming to restructure and make them more profitable.\n\n### Why the PE & VC industry exploded:\n\nPE and VC offer access to these private markets, and institutions were eager to jump in because public markets alone couldn't absorb all their money. The PE industry, in particular, has ballooned from managing $500 billion to a whopping $8 trillion in 20 years. This explosion is simply because ***PE firms*** managed to convince big institutions to pour in cash to them by selling them the promise of high returns.\n\n### The problem\n\nIn **VC**, things are looking rough. A lot of opportunists jumped into VC, promising big returns but actually delivering poor or even negative results. However, **VC firms** still made money off management fees, while investors were left holding the bag with bad returns. Even if **PE** is facing the same destiny, the **bubble burst** is simply people getting bad returns.\n### What\u2019s the \"unwinding\"?\n\nI think you have misunderstood the \"Unwinding\". It isn't a bubble burst, it just means that eventually, investors and the public will catch on to the fact that PE/VC firms may not have been as good at delivering returns as promised. The issue is that many of these firms have found ways to **make themselves rich** through **management fees** (taking a cut from the funds they manage) and **carried interest** (taking a chunk of profits, but not suffering equally from losses). The risk is heavily one-sided\u2014investors take most of it, while the fund managers make money regardless of the results.\n\n\nAnd remember - who have funds the investors from the beginning? It's common people like you and me \u2013 either through pensions funds, taxes, HNWI (who in their turn often have made money from being exited by PE). So it's ordinary people who are left holding the bag when this is all said and done.\nTLDR/ELI5, The world has created a lot of money supple & wealth, and we need places to invest it, but there isn't enough public stocks for it. People in Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) have made money on the shared wealth we have created in society regardless of the fund returns and people are finally taking about it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

The industry\u2019s size-growing from $500 billion to $8 trillion in 20 years-has been driven by financial engineering as you said, debt-financed buyouts (LBOs), and structured financial products akin to mortgage-backed securities (MBS), such as SLABS (Student Loan Asset Backed Securities), CLOs (Collateralized Loan Obligations), and CMBS (Commercial MBS), which all contributed to the 2008 crisis.

{"title": "Why I believe Palantir ($PLTR) Will Continue to Explode", "selftext": "This post is going to highlight the reasons I believe PLTR has the potential to keep its current momentum by focusing on some financials. I've been watching this company for a few years now and they continue to impress me. I know a lot of people will say the buy opportunity has passed given the stock is up 165.71% the past year, but I think you're incredibly wrong.\n\nBefore we get started, here is my position.\n\n[Yahoo Finance Portfolio Tracker](https://preview.redd.it/oy4ixcbrweqd1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fda51980201096fffe0bc1a6475bb8bca39f34f)\n\nFirstly, we are going to view some financials from 12/31/2020 - 12/31/2023. Then we will dive into the two most recent quarters.\n\n**Income Statement**\u00a0- (All numbers in millions) Year Ending 12/31\n\n**2020           2021          2022         2023**\n\nRevenue - $1,092.67 , $1,541.88 , $1,905.87 , $2,225.01\n\nCost of Rev. - $352.55 , $339.40 , $408.54 , $431.11\n\nGross Profit - $740.13 , $1,202.49 , $1,479.32 , $1,793.91\n\nNet Income - $(1,166.39) , $(520.38) , $(373.71) , $209.83\n\nTo summarize the income statement data in a chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ui7ytao3fqd1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bac253bc37c9f7ed0910ad2cc736ff4e5c488a\n\nFor the income statement, I'd like to highlight the growth in revenue and gross profit compared to cost of revenue for all 4 years.\n\n**Balance Sheet -**\u00a0(All numbers in millions)\n\n**2020            2021         2022          2023**\n\nTotal CA -      $2,257.43 , $2,863.26 , $3,041.58 , $4,138.62\n\nTotal LTA -     $433.08 ,   $384.20 ,     $419.67 ,     $383.81\n\nTotal Assets - $2,690.51 , $3,247.46 , $3,461.25 , $4,522.43\n\nTotal CL -       $603.82 , $660.07 , $587.94 , $746.02\n\nTotal LTL -      $564.13 , $296.36 , $230.87 , $215.44\n\nTotal Liab. -    $1,167.95 , $956.43 , $818.81, $961.46\n\n(I apologize for the messy data. Could not get excel tables to copy on reddit properly.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4tzb59t3fqd1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc55504810a7a695cc52d996e950d81cd10473d9\n\nPLTR has a very healthy balance sheet. Total Asset growth on an annual basis, AVERAGES 16.52% growth compared to Total Liabilities.\n\nThe most recent quarters have been awesome for Palantir. Now we will take a look at them and go over some key points.\n\n**Q1 2024:**\n\n* GAAP Net Income of $106 million representing a 17% margin. (6th consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability).\n* Revenue growth of\u00a0**21% YoY**, 4% QoQ of $634 million.\n* US commercial revenue grew\u00a0**40% YoY**, 14% QoQ to $150 million.\n* US commercial customer count grew\u00a0**69% YoY**, 19% QoQ to 262 customers.\n* Total commercial revenue grew\u00a0**27% YoY**, 5% QoQ to $299 million.\n* Total government revenue grew 16% YoY and 3% QoQ to $335 million.\n\nThe commercial growth in my opinion has been the biggest catalyst for Palantir. There has always been a big question if they will be able to expand their operations outside of government contracts, well they sure can. I believe this is mainly due to AIP bootcamps that Palantir introduced late 2023.\n\n**Q2 2024:**\n\n* GAAP Net Income of $134 million, representing a 20% margin.\n* Revenue growth of 27% YoY, 7% QoQ to $678 million.\n* US commercial revenue growth of 55% YoY, 6% QoQ to $678 million.\n* **US commercial customer count grew 83% YoY and 13% QoQ to 295 customers.**\n* Total commercial revenue growth of 33% YoY, 3% QoQ to $307 million.\n* Total government revenue growth of 23% YoY, 11% QoQ to $371 million.\n\nAs you can see, commercial revenue growth is increasing at a ridiculous rate especially in the US. The same can be said for net income.\u00a0**Net income for Q1 and Q2 in 2024 totals $240 million. Net income for the entire year of 2023 was $210 million.**\n\nData is the future. Palantir continues to expand their partnerships to leverage their position in the data market.\n\n[Source: Acumen Research and Consulting](https://preview.redd.it/0avmookb5fqd1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=34f8860a9ac58d6ad6af4064cd6e931a3899b848)\n\nSummary - Palantir is in a position to dominate the data analytics market for years to come. They have been able to gain a large portion of commercial business over the last couple of years, while simultaneously expanding their government business. While their revenue grows, they are able to keep a low-cost structure meaning more net income. The same can be seen with their total assets vs total liabilities. As they continue to partner with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle, they will simply continue to grow. At a current price of **$37.59**, I believe they are a buy and will be continue to be for years to come.\n\nMy prediction - $PLTR will be at a minimum price of $100 on 9/22/26.\n\nNOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.", "id": "1fn2tq4", "created_utc": 1727036968.0, "score": 196, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 day ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fn1c62/why_i_believe_palantir_pltr_will_continue_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fn2tq4/why_i_believe_palantir_pltr_will_continue_to/) \n**Account Age** | 5 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.481600284576416}, {"body": "That's it lads, the beacons are lit.
