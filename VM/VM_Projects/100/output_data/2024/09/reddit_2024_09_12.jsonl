Votes on extensions are ongoing, so additional locations may be added in the weeks to come.*\n\n*The value meal offers a McDouble or McChicken sandwich, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink for $5.*\n\n*Owners will also be offering local promotions in the weeks and months to come, in addition to the value bundle, the company said. Deals will also be available in McDonald\u2019s app.*\n\n*\u201cTogether with our franchisees, we\u2019re committed to keeping our prices as affordable as possible, which is why we\u2019re doubling down with even more ways to save,\u201d McDonald\u2019s U.S. President Joe Erlinger said in a statement about the meal\u2019s extension into December.*\n\n*The restaurant sector focused on value this summer, as companies including McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and even Starbucks attempted to lure consumers in with discounted offerings. Diners have pulled back on their restaurant spending after years of persistent inflation.*\n\n*After McDonald\u2019s posted declining second-quarter same-store sales in July, executives told restaurant operators and analysts the company would focus on how to recapture consumers with deals, as they pushed for an extension of the $5 value meal. The offer ran through the end of August, after 93% of restaurants had agreed to keep it on the menu following its initial four-week run in June and July.*\n\n*In a memo to the U.S. system obtained by CNBC after the July earnings report, Erlinger said McDonald\u2019s struggled to sell diners on affordability in the most recent quarter, adding that he expects \u201cindustry and competitive challenges\u201d to continue throughout the year. Erlinger encouraged operators to look ahead to building momentum for next year, adding that \u201cchanneling a long-term mindset is crucial\u201d to the company\u2019s success.*\n\n*\u201cReversing the narrative and re-establishing our position as the leader on value and affordability is possible, but it cannot be done overnight,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cIt will happen through sustained and coordinated actions that show the customer we\u2019re on their side.\u201d*\n\n*The $5 meal trial performed well among low-income consumers, and sentiment around the company\u2019s value had started to improve, Erlinger said in the July memo.*", "id": "1ff05du", "created_utc": 1726140234.0, "score": 231, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "Its a trap, they just want to lure customers back then slowly raise the prices again.", "score": 239, "replies": [{"body": "I mean I stopped going, they got the 5 dollar deal and now I go again. \n\n\nThey go back to only having app based deals?
