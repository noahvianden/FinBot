{"title": "A friendly reminder: Invest for long-term", "selftext": "\nWho would have known 10 years ago that Nvidia would have a 2 trillion market cap? Nobody. Who would have known 20 years ago that Microsoft would have a 3 trillion market cap? Nobody. A general rule of thumb: tech companies will grow in market value in future. Say 5 trillion or 10 trillion, but **that takes time**. Usually many years. This is what long term investing really is. You are investing in a company which has good applications (from their products or services) in prospects and expects to grow in future. Growth takes time, and there are downs, but only for short-term. \n\nWhen is the right time to buy nvidia? Now, or in a more apt sense, when you are able to. Don\u2019t gamble because the house always wins, meaning you will lose in day trading or something similar to that. Long term investing is where you will thank yourself in years to come.
