And as soon as OpenAI or some other tech company does a pants-shittingly scary demo of advanced AI tech, it'll roar back up. (It seems like OpenAI may show off 'Strawberry' this fall, which would be a good next chance for NVDA to run up again)\n\nSecond - people are freaked out by jobs. The jobs data was revised down by almost 1M. That's a lot. But the economy at that time was just fine. And unemployment is at 4.3%, which is a little low by historic standards (5% has been the norm). What has happened is that people have stopped hiring and are not giving out as high raises, which is a good thing if you want inflation to come down. \n\nThird - people are freaked out by a lack of spending. A lot of top brands have said that they expect spending to be down in the coming quarters as consumers \"pull back\". They're pulling back because these brands have been ruthlessly fucking the consumer over and over with their pricing power. But that has come to an end. I would expect large corporate brands to do much worse as people shift their habits. McDonald's costs $15 and the Chinese place down the street costs $12 for much better food? Guess what, people are going to the Chinese place. But all these local restaurants don't report their earnings, so it looks like this money has disappeared when it's just been reallocated away from corporate brands.\n\nSo, it looks bad, but it's really just neutral.
