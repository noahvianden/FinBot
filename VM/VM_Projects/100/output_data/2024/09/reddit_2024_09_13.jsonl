Had things gone the other way, would you be pissed that SpaceX shit the bed and could possibly lose their contract?\n\nOpen competition is in everyone's best interest. Single-sourcing anything before either company has proven its capabilities to meet contractual benchmarks is foolish. In the case of the ISS de-orbit, SpaceX is the only company with the capability, so the government went with that. \n\nIRA does include hybrids but due to the battery size requirements, there are literally only a couple that are able to take advantage of half the tax credit amount compared to the huge number of pure EVs that are able to realize the full benefit. This directly incentivizes the purchase of a pure EV. It also benefitted Tesla in that it is pretty much the only manufacturer that uses USA-made batteries for their powertrains. This is why so many of their vehicles qualify for the tax credit. The trope about being designed to help union auto workers is lazy and just untrue. Tesla is the most American auto maker in the world and it realizes the most benefit from the IRA out of all the American automakers while being a non-union shop.\n\nRegarding NACS, if it weren't for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill that sought to create a North American Charging Standard, Tesla would have had no reason to make the Tesla connector backwards compatible with the protocols used by CCS (not the connector itself, but the ISO 15188 communication standard). So yes, without this legislation, the old Tesla connector and standard would not have been adopted as NACS.\n\n>Elon's companies have benefited from government contracts because of the quality and sole existence of their products, not because they are propped up by the US government.\n\nIsn't this the way it should be? The product should shine through on its own merits.  If it doesn't, Tesla would be in Boeing's shoes right now. As far as I'm aware, the playing field has been remarkably level for Elon's companies in general.\n\nElon's victim complex is just fucking frustrating to see given how much of his businesses' products have been successful with both government and the public.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "So for the next ISS contract, what companies should the government contract with?

When the contracts were awarded, there was incentive to dual-source in case one didn't work out. Again, if SpaceX had failed with Dragon and Boeing succeeded, Boeing could have gobbled up the resultant business of that contract.  Remember, this was a fixed price contract (although Boeing received more). Boeing didn't deliver and was way over budget. They fucked themselves while SpaceX differentiated themselves with success and cost effectiveness. Had SpaceX failed and Boeing succeeded, would people be saying Boeing failed because they cost more? Of course not, the end result would have been a crew resupply vehicle that worked regardless. Going forward, I totally agree that SpaceX should get the contracts, but back when the competition for new a new crew vehicle was started, no one knew the outcome. \n\nSpaceX emerged from a level field of competition...as it should be. Reusability of their technology and lower per launch costs demonstrated by Falcon9 meant they were given less than Boeing which used an expendable launch vehicle.

His assertion that the government is constantly pressing on the scales to favour the competition just isn't true and it just screams of sour grapes when something doesn't go his way.

{"title": "OpenAI Released a New Model GPT-o1 That Only Allows 35 Messages Per Week Because It Thinks - It Also Hasn't Been Trained With All Data", "selftext": "Ladies and Gentleman there cannot be a larger buy signal than this. The fact that this model requires so much power it has to be limited to 35 messages per week is incredible. I am driving this one point because it is a clear throughput situation. \n\nAlso, the information cutoff is October 2023 which tells me this isn't the new massive model they are releasing. So, what does this all mean? \n\nIt means they released a new capability which uses much more compute but isn't technically perhaps their new monster model that is trained on trillions of parameters. If this was a new model I would expect the cutoff date to be much more recent. At least 3-6 months would have made more sense. Now, there is time between training and cutoff time but I don't think they've been sitting with a model that has been trained for over a year ago. A newer, more recent model must be sitting there for use but can't. \n\nWhat this all suggest to me is that they are currently massively GPU constrained at the moment and waiting desperately for Blackwell. What you would expect is massively more throughput for GPT-o1 and you eventually have to expect a newer more massive model that is fundamentally better at the core. \n\nJoanne Jang from OpenAI tweeted this. \n\n>\"There's a lot of o1 hype on my feed, so I'm worried that it might be setting the wrong expectations. what o1 is: the first reasoning model that shines in really hard tasks, and it'll only get better. (I'm personally psyched about the model's potential & trajectory!) what o1 isn't (yet!): a miracle model that does everything better than previous models. you might be disappointed if this is your expectation for today's launch\u2014but we're working to get there!\"\n\nOpenAI also said they are adding additional tools later. \n\nSo in effect, they released a new engineering marvel with model actionability/capabilities i.e. thinking - in preparation for adding a massively more capable model + new thinking capability later. It's going to be a 1, 2 punch that I don't think the world is ready for. \n\nThe 35 messages per week is a throughput drop I could not have imagined. This is what Jensen was talking about that people are getting emotional. \n\nThe amount of GPU spend from the new AGI race that is about to ensue is going to be insane. \n\nPositions - Super Long Nvidia with a position in ARM, AVGO and Microsoft", "id": "1ffog0r", "created_utc": 1726210324.0, "score": 107, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 11 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 3468 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1237470731139183}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/nfbu5wgrelod1.jpeg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f03efa9e6e76fc28d8d35c2b2e6686c05b02e91\n\nStill can\u2019t get this right", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "They literally called this model strawberry \ud83e\udd23", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11255873739719391}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/hcc3w5spdbpd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5042657bb650d78b0af6acc871bb57d5749f2c5\n\nAsk it what the maximum amount of r's the word strawberry contains.
