Here\u2019s why:\n\n### 1. **Increased Demand for Selling Options**:\n   If many people are selling cash-secured puts or covered calls on the same stock, the supply of these options increases. When more people are offering to sell options, but demand (from buyers) remains the same, premiums tend to decrease. This is because more sellers competing for the same number of buyers can drive prices down.\n\n### 2. **Lower Implied Volatility (IV)**:\n   The premiums for options are partly based on **implied volatility (IV)**\u2014which reflects the market\u2019s expectation of future price movement. If the stock becomes heavily traded by people employing relatively safe strategies (like the wheel), implied volatility may decrease. Lower implied volatility signals reduced uncertainty or risk, which in turn lowers the price of the options, i.e., lower premiums.\n\n### 3. **Efficient Market Response**:\n   The options market tends to adjust to new information and trading activity. If a stock becomes widely recognized as a good candidate for the wheel strategy, market makers will adjust option pricing accordingly, balancing out the risk and reward. This can lead to less favorable conditions for sellers over time as the premiums become more \u201cefficient.\u201d\n\n### 4. **More Stable Price Movements**:\n   The wheel strategy is often used on stocks with relatively stable prices. If more people start using this strategy on a stock, it could result in fewer large price swings because the strategy typically involves selling options close to the current price. Fewer price swings can lead to lower volatility, which in turn lowers premiums.\n\n### 5. **Crowded Trades**:\n   Popular stocks for options trading (like SPY, AAPL, TSLA) tend to see a lot of activity, and while liquidity is high, premiums can become lower because the pricing becomes more competitive and efficient. If a less popular stock becomes \u201cdiscovered\u201d and starts seeing heavy options trading, it could suffer from the same problem, where the potential for high premiums diminishes as it becomes a crowded trade.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYes, if more people start using a stock for the wheel strategy, it could lead to lower premiums due to increased supply, reduced implied volatility, and more efficient pricing. While liquidity might improve, this would potentially reduce the attractiveness of that stock for options sellers over time.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "OK, makes sense.
