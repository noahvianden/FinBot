If there was competition, then Nvidia would lose share and trust me, companies like Google, Amazon and others would \"happily announce\" all the billions they make with renting their AI HW to customers because that would immediately be seen as positive for the stock value.\n\nThe only competitors we can measure are AMD and Intel. Nvidia is growing faster than both of them combined. It doesnt' matter that AMD has 100% YoY growth on AI GPUs if Nvidia makes more in 1/8 of a quarter there then AMD hopes to do this year and that's with good old Hopper. Blackwell next year will be even more dire for competition. That means, Nvidia grows at their supply capacity increase rate while AMD and Intel don't. TSMC would happily take away some supply from Nvidia and move it to competitors to not become as much dependent on 1 AI HW customer.\n\nA very good indication is that AMD has spoken highly of guidance in AI beginning of the year when Nvidia has had higher lead times. But Nvidia worked of the lead times and H200 beats MI300 on price/performance easily. So what happens is that for 2 quarters (just as H200 ramped in Q2) Lisa Su now is looking for crumbles to increase 2024 guidance by $500m while Nvidia looks to make more than $100b this year. If that trend continues then AMD's DC revenue in 2-3 years will be a rounding error of Nvidia's and we're talking here of EPYC and MI combined!\n\nAMD fans cried that Blackwell delay is AMD's opportunity and meanwhile benchmarks show that the strongest competition for Blackwell is H200/GH200, not MI series by AMD. The memory upgrade of MI325X will not offset the compute + SW combination issue. Nvidia will cannabalize their own products to leapfrog all competition. Nvidia's largest enemy is the supply chain.\n\nJensen's task has never been to make the most valuable stock but to make the most innovative and problem solving company. He is no stock market CEO but an engineer at heart and genius at marketing. For years, Wallstreet makes a fool of themselves for not understanding how Jensen is playing with them.\n\n3T, 6T or whatever doesn't matter. As a longterm investor (since 2016), I'm invested here for decades. I might not even really sell Nvidia at all and do it the Buffet way. People discuss if Nvidia should be 1T, 3T or 6T while they completely missing the point that Nvidia works on becoming the first $1 trillion annual revenue company in the next decade. Back in 2022, 6 months before ChatGPT, Nvidia showed the $1t TAM with all product lines combined as outlook for the next \"years\" since no timelines was shown. But nowadays, the CEO talks about trillions for DC HW only. That TAM back then in 2022 was only 1/3 of AI DC HW, there were other interesting data points and it was pre-ChatGPT.  As an investor, I remember such things and I re-evaluate that in context of what has developed since then. Back then the TAM seemed a bit crazy but 2.5 years later I can see it shaping more and more.\n\nBack then CEO expected an impact by LLM and he even hinted at ChatGPT in the earnings call prior to the release of ChatGPT. I read that earnings call very carefully because it was fall 2022 and Nvidia dropped to the bottom at -70% from ATH 2021.

{"title": "8 reason to YOLO $NIO today", "selftext": "Alright, guys. Consider this a follow-up to my last NIO post. I bought some Nio call earlier and its printing, I\u2019m selling off some of my other holdings to ride this trend when the market opens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxiodau6fvrd1.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=3159fc1099c782241a38b2018765a9c94eab7255\n\nIt might sound crazy, but hear me out\u2014here are 8 reasons why I\u2019m YOLO-ing into NIO right now:\n\n**Fed cutting rates** \u2013 The Fed\u2019s already cutting, and they\u2019re likely to drop another 0.50 at the next meeting with inflation coming down (real or fake numbers, who cares). The golden rule: *Don\u2019t fight the Fed*\u2014when they cut, the market goes up.\n\n**China stimulus** \u2013 The Chinese government is throwing out stimulus like crazy. Look at their index\u2014stocks are limit-up every day. This bull run won\u2019t be short because China\u2019s economy is so messed up, they *need* this boost like nana blessing. And the 3 trillion yuan aid package hasn\u2019t even fully kicked in yet, use your imagination bro.\n\n**Chinese economy recovery** \u2013 Like I said, this isn\u2019t a short-term bull. It\u2019ll probably last a year or two. China\u2019s economy will improve, their purchasing power will go up. I\u2019ve seen posts from Chinese forums\u2014some people are making crazy money, like 600k RMB in a day, others upgrading their cars. This will keep happening before the next crash.\n\n**Chinese stocks are dirt cheap** \u2013 Everything is on the floor. Check your charts and you\u2019ll see how ridiculous the prices are right now.\n\n**NIO is even cheaper** \u2013 NIO is way down compared to other big Chinese stocks. It\u2019s been shorted and tanked for so long that even a 50% jump from last month\u2019s price is still a bargain. And let me remind you, despite being a loss-making company, NIO\u2019s sales are beating BMW, Benz, and Audi combined in China.\n\n**NIO just got new funding from Anhui state** \u2013 The last time Anhui invested in NIO (April 2020), the stock shot up from $2 to $60 in a year. This time, even if it just doubles from $6 to $12, it\u2019s a piece of cake. [https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3280434/unit-chinese-ev-maker-nio-gets-us471-million-fresh-funding-new-models](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3280434/unit-chinese-ev-maker-nio-gets-us471-million-fresh-funding-new-models)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rg906zosfvrd1.png?width=1835&format=png&auto=webp&s=44ed8692cd07ecf9284499d91ba068552d23f8cb\n\n**NIO\u2019s next two earnings are going to be huge** \u2013 They just launched a sub-brand called 0nvo, and rumor has it they've already got close to 60k units booked for the 0nvo L60. The CEO promised all orders placed this year will be delivered by Chinese New Year, which means the next two earnings reports should look pretty sweet.\n\n**A turning point is coming** \u2013 If 0nvo\u2019s sales continue to pop off, and NIO maintains their current numbers, they\u2019ll scale production and cut costs. They\u2019re also planning to launch a mini car brand next year. If all three brands take off, NIO could finally turn a profit. Remember how Tesla skyrocketed once it became profitable? That\u2019s the kind of potential we\u2019re talking about here.\n\n------- Adding another reason here -------\n\n**Strong reversal pattern** - Read the self-explanatory screen shot below, $10 is doable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5w47bzucawrd1.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc3b04db0ce14f133b98013a70a30e6c5e2b0265", "id": "1fsn403", "created_utc": 1727669539.0, "score": 304, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 162, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 year ago\n**Total Comments** | 32 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/njg9rpd6r0sd1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ab033c6bf8fd43d660ed225c4e274dbb21931e7\n\nHey guys did I do this right\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15918657183647156}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13774970173835754}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/19o8hfes6wrd1.jpeg?width=2556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4849345b2dee318943f95a873120e58345da5f31\n\nAll in and agree with all your reasons.
