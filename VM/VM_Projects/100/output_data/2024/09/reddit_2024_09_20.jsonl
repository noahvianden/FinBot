The vast majority of Qualcomm\u2019s business comes from selling smartphone processors, 5G wireless chips, and licensing mobile technology. There isn\u2019t much synergy with Intel\u2019s core x86 PC and server processor business, which has been losing significant market share to\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices\u00a0in recent years.\n\n>Intel\u2019s PC chips have already been eclipsed by in-house offerings from\u00a0Apple\u00a0and others, which draw on designs from\u00a0Arm Holdings. On the data center side, New Street Research estimates that AMD\u2019s x86 server processor business will reach 40% market share by year-end, up from less than 5% four years ago. Those gains have come at the expense of Intel, making it that much less attractive to Qualcomm, or any other suitor.\n\n>A merger won\u2019t fix Intel\u2019s biggest problem, its foundry, or chip manufacturing business. For Intel Foundry to succeed, the company needs a flagship U.S. customer like Apple, AMD, or\u00a0Nvidia. While Intel has\u00a0announced\u00a0smaller deals, including one with Amazon Web Services last week, they\u2019re not large enough to matter.
