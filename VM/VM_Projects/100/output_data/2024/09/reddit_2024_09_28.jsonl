The company\u2019s global express shipping business could see less disruption, as it is less reliant on ocean freight compared to UPS.\n\t\u2022\tEast Coast Dependence: However, for ground and freight services, FedEx still has a considerable reliance on East Coast ports.

With less emphasis on air freight, UPS could experience greater disruptions in its logistics chains.\n\t\u2022\tGlobal Sourcing and Flexibility: However, UPS has a robust global logistics network, and it could use West Coast ports to reroute shipments, although congestion and capacity limitations might still affect them.\n\nWhich Stands to Benefit or Do Worse?\n\n\t\u2022\tPotential Advantage for FedEx: If the strike is prolonged and ground shipping via East Coast ports becomes difficult, FedEx\u2019s stronger reliance on air freight could give it an edge in handling express shipments, limiting the impact on its operations. This flexibility might position FedEx to weather the strike better than UPS.\n\t\u2022\tHigher Risk for UPS: UPS\u2019s higher dependence on ocean freight and ground logistics could make it more vulnerable to port delays, especially if cargo needs to be rerouted to already congested West Coast ports.
