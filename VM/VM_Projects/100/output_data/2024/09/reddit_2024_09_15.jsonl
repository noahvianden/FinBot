{"title": "Apple the new healthtech giant?", "selftext": "\nThis week they launched the Hearing Aid feature, which lets AirPods essentially double up as listening devices plus hearing aids; at a fraction of conventional aids.

A successful product would mean a durable revenue stream in an increasingly comprehensive wearables portfolio for years to come. Bonus points, it's Apple's first real consumer product innovation in years.\n\nYet, the stock closed nearly flat on Monday (its launch event day); and I would attribute most of the week's gain to broader cycles rather than anything directly related to the company's fundamentals.

{"title": "Why November fed rate decision is more important than Sept", "selftext": "Since Sept federal rate decision is already priced into the market and the 0.5% rate cut seems improbable, the major kicker will be the November rate decision. If Fed decides to hold it depending on election results (though Powell keeps saying he is an apolitical decision maker and he pretty much lying there) and the rate are held steady instead of a cut, I expect a deep dip in the market. Hence I have short term calls on SPY that expire September and ling term puts that expire December. \n\nNow you might ask why would fed hold it steady in November - my calc says we have not stabilized inflation and job market will remain strong due to holiday season with seasonal labor increase and extensive spending during the holiday season. There will be no metric that will help Fed lean towards the 0.75% to 1.25% rate cut expected for all of 2024. It will be a debacle. The next rate cut is in 2025 folks. \n\nI would really like to be told why I am wrong.
