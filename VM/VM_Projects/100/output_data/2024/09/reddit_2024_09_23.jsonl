NVDA is a great \"you know it will do well next year and with late season earnings allows for a post election bounce as it consolidates further\" play. \n\nIt may also just break higher out of the wedge, which will probly frustrate people who think that means it will go to the moon instead of step by step with pull backs get to new ATHs.\n\nTL;DR The longer it stays subdued, the more rapid the climb past ATHs will be.
