", "selftext": "(Reposting because the original post had good discussion going on but mods deleted it for \"self-promotion\" which was strange. I assume that was for mentioning a popular podcast. Hopefully, this post stays.)\n\nHere is the chart of PE ratio - [https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) . Even looking at only the past 15 years, 29.5 is very high and is only below the COVID highs - but the COVID high is artificial because the earnings dropped like a rock due to lockdowns. The only other time 29+ was reached was before the 2000 and 2008 crashes.\n\nHere is another website with forward PE estimate - [https://www.gurufocus.com/economic\\_indicators/6061/sp-500-pe-ratio-with-forward-estimate](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/6061/sp-500-pe-ratio-with-forward-estimate) . This says a different story - forward PE estimate is apparently at 22 for 2025! I assume this means they expect earnings to bump up by 30-40%! That's the only way PE can go from 29 to 22 afaik (well unless the stock price goes down).\n\nI was looking around a bit regarding this and came across something called Shiller PE ratio - [https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) - \"Price earnings ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years, known as the Cyclically Adjusted PE Ratio (CAPE Ratio), Shiller PE Ratio, or PE 10\". This also looks similar to PE ratio and seems to peak just before every recession, but I don't understand it fully (for comparison with normal PE - [https://www.gurufocus.com/economic\\_indicators/57/sp-500-pe-ratio](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/57/sp-500-pe-ratio) ).

So companies are making almost double of you, but your investment is 10x higher. So the ratio of invested money compared to earnings is much higher, leading to higher P/E.\n\nThe assumption doesn't match empirical reality. People who make more money tend to proportionally spend more as well. Beyond discretionary purchases (status becomes more important as necessities are covered) they also live in more expensive neighborhoods, pay more for exclusive schools for their kids, etc.\n\nFurthermore, this hypothesis doesn't match the recorded history of valuations. According to that logic, we should see a straightforward increase in average P/E ratios from 1880 to the present. This is not reflected in P/E or any other proxy like Tobin's Q. [Until the 2000s it resembled a sine wave](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio).\n\nThis also ignores the impact of inflation upon the perceived value of money. Your analogy only makes sense if both scenarios happen simultaneously. [If you earned $10k a year in 1950, you were significantly wealthier than someone making $100k in the present](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1950). Inflation also impacts business expenses and savings depending on the FFR.\n\n> As of 93% of stock being owned by 10% - sure, what was in the past? 93% of stock being owned by 1%?\n\nNo. It's a myth that stock investment was exclusively reserved for the rich. Like all market trends, it has ebbs and flows depending on how the public viewed it. It becomes popular when people assume passive investing is guaranteed profit (i.e. the 1920s, the 1990s, post-2015) and unpopular when the market is volatile or bad (i.e, the 1930s, 1970s-1980s). The public becomes enthusiastically interested in investment when they can envision the market as a bank on steroids.\n\n> People are investing much more than they used to\n\nYes, and it has nothing to do with wealth. It's about risk-free returns in other assets being poor for decades, which has shifted liquidity into risk assets for better yield.

Only after the necessities are met, you start saving.  \nSo people getting out of poverty increases profits, people getting wealthier after their necessities are met are increasing valuations.  \nSince there were two world wars, people in 1880-1980 were mostly getting out of poverty.

You are conflating nominal increases in the money supply (i.e. inflation) with real added value. [The personal savings rate has tanked over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT), therefore currently people have *less* money to invest in the market than ever before. Most of the population in the lower 60% have their equity tied up in their homes. Meanwhile the rich invest it in assets other than stocks, making it illiquid.\n\n> So people getting out of poverty increases profits, people getting wealthier after their necessities are met are increasing valuations.\n\nAgain, not reflected in the evidence. The 1950s are regarded as the halcyon days of American economic prosperity, yet the S&P's aggregate valuation didn't break the mean until 1959. In fact, the market exhibited consistently higher P/E multiples *during the Great Depression*. Again, this is all displayed in the chart.\n\nWhy did this happen? Because during times of economic prosperity, earnings growth outstrips price growth. People spend when they're optimistic about the future and believe standards of living will continue to improve. I often see people on this subreddit fail to grasp this basic point, so they cite P/E ratios in the past as evidence that past business environments were inefficient. \n\n> Since there were two world wars, people in 1880-1980 were mostly getting out of poverty.
