{"title": "NVDA fake news", "selftext": "Just wanted to share a few examples of fake news around Nvidia that took place in the last 1-2 weeks\n\n* Bearish analysts misrepresenting the facts from earnings call, including blackwell delays\n* Subpeona from the DOJ\n* Nancy Pelosi selling her shaes\n\nAnd one of the latest making the rounds is this chart, it was getting shared heavily around LinkedIn and other networks last week. it shows a large drop in ChatGPT usage. This comes from non other than Goldman Sachs, which have been putting out contradictory reports with bearish vs bullish bias at different points, i'm guessing to take counter positions and trade along.\n\nThe issue is that this isn't even accurate. OpenAI changed the site from chat(dot)openai(dot)com to chatgpt(dot)com around that time and Goldman Sachs missed adjusting for that. I don't know if it was intentional or not. FYI usage is up to 2.6 billion in August, a large increase, not a decrease\n\nIn any case, there is clearly attempts at attacking the company and putting downwards pressure on the stock price, again i'm guessing most likely to get in at lower valuations.\n\nDisclosure: I have a long position in NVDA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vw4qy1orjgnd1.jpg?width=592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b3df885dacc1ffdfc958d251e0a2466b01cef10", "id": "1fbi5d7", "created_utc": 1725745822.0, "score": 151, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "US media has become nothing more than annoying pop-up ads these days.
