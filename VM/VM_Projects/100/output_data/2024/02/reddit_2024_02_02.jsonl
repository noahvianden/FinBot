That was one of the most bullish A.I. conference calls we've heard. META will only get more profitable. \n\n> Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. One for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, I believe you'd shifted FAIR out of Reality Labs and into the Family of Apps. Can you just talk about some of the benefits there of moving that group as you pursue general intelligence? And then Susan, can you just walk us through your thought process on adding a dividend to your capital returns at this stage beyond the share repurchases? Thank you.\n\n> Mark Zuckerberg: I can talk to the first one. Yes. The whole reason why we moved FAIR is basically to be closer to the GenAI group. They're both research groups. The GenAI group basically builds our Llama launch vehicles and products, but also conducts a fair amount of research, too, especially things that are going to be coming into the upcoming versions of Llama. \n\n> FAIR is focused on more foundational work and longer-term work. So it's, I'd say, more things that might be a couple of years out to 10-plus years out. And as we -- I guess, here's one way to think about it.\n\n> A lot of last year and the work that we're doing with Llama 3 is basically making sure that we can scale our efforts to really produce state-of-the-art models. But once we get past that, there's a lot more kind of different research that I think we're going to be doing that's going to take our foundation models in potentially different directions than other players in the industry are going to go in because we're focused on specific vision for what we're building. \n\n> So it's really important as we think about what's going to be in Llama 5 or 6 or 7 and what cognitive abilities we want in there and what modalities we want to build into future multimodal versions of the models, we need to be doing that work in advance and to research those things.\n\n> And it helps to -- and even though FAIR and GenAI will continue to be two kind of\nseparate groups on different time horizons, I think to have some level of alignment\nbetween -- on the vision of what we're building between the two of them, so that\nway, the FAIR team can have in mind, hey, if we research this, then maybe it can\nintercept Llama 6 or something.\n\n> Then that, I think, is just going to be more helpful for increasing the ambition and\nfocus of all of the work that we do. It's one of the reasons why I talked about, we\ndid open-ended research in AI for a while. But having a clear product target with\nthese AI agents, I think, is really going to help focus the work and give us a feedback\nloop that's going to increase the productivity and output that we get dramatically.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Not reading all that", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1721024215221405}], "tickers": ["meta"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1709677129983902}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14063850045204163}, {"body": "I bought at 90 and sold 110 that was my plan and I was happy it worked out.

Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.\n\nApple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer\u2019s conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d during the presentation, preferring the more academic term \u201cmachine learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,\u201d Cook said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/tim-cook-teases-apple-ai-announcement-later-this-year.html", "id": "1agtkhe", "created_utc": 1706842931.0, "score": 397, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "It is absolutely crazy to me how useless Siri has become over the years.

Naturally, founder-CEOS place their allies on the board so they can maintain control of their company. No founder is going to put strangers on the board for the sake of independence and risk getting kicked out of their own company.\n\nCompanies with dual class shares, e.g. Zuck at Meta, have an even bigger problem with board independence because founders like Zuck can single-handedly elect whoever they want to the board with no opposition because he has >50% voting power.\n\nMeta's board is all hand-picked by Zuckerberg and has members such as:\n\n* Sheryl Sandberg, Zuck's former right-hand woman and COO at Meta\n* Peggy Alford, CFO of Zuck's charity\n* Marc Andreessen, Zuck's VC partner for Meta since its start-up days\n* Andrew Houston, CEO of Dropbox and well-known friend of Zuck\n\n[Alford, Andreessen, and Houston are all on the Compensation Committee at Meta.](https://investor.fb.com/leadership-and-governance/compensation-and-governance-committee-charter/default.aspx)\n\nIn addition, [Techcrunch details how shareholders have tried to oust Zuck several times but couldn't because the board, which is filled with Zuck's friends, protected him.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/drew-houston-facebook-board/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADzdmIu45rQibjWQb08wpHli28Ey31hueVtMsrpRZcxptueipumJ4vCruNZlxP8dnHApFrU8t200XR0skTvh5lBhCqK6Zqr2S13d0v6NMorhojFUuVz382e8jTsKceGOS9UwPhthRhdY4eiJM7MYDqSZXonUP0cAkNO-sf_1AvpI)\n\n2)\n\nWilliam Savitt, has played a leading role in high-stakes corporate governance and merger-and-acquisitions litigation in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the same court and judge as Elon's compensation ruling) and in courts around the country.

The court considered both his 21% percent stake, and his \u201cability to exercise outsized influence in the board room\u201d due to his close personal ties to the directors and his \u201csuperstar CEO\u201d status.

That, too, was tainted, because \u2013 McCormick concluded \u2013 the proxy statement delivered to shareholders contained material misrepresentations and omissions.  It described Tesla\u2019s compensation committee as independent when in fact the members had close personal ties to Musk, and it did not accurately describe the manner in which his pay package was set \u2013 again, with Musk himself proposing it and the board largely acquiescing.

It appears that the case in your linked letter was consolidated with another case(s?), and the most recent action I could find was that [on 2023-05-10 Facebook's motion to dismiss was denied in a bench ruling](https://www.dandodiary.com/2023/05/articles/shareholders-derivative-litigation/court-denies-dismissal-motion-in-facebook-user-data-privacy-derivative-suit/). I have been unable to find an accompanying opinion.\n\nSince the first lawsuit is the only one with final opinions, that'll be what I talk about from here on out.\n\nSkipping past a bunch of stuff not related to board independence, in that lawsuit, the judge states that of the nine members of the Board of Directors, he assumes that Zuckerberg, Andreesen, and Sandberg were not independent. Of the remaining directors:\n\n- Zients: the plaintiff basically didn't argue that they were not independent\n- Chenault: No facts pled that undermine independence\n- Hastings: The pled facts are insufficient to support a finding of a lack of independence or a finding that Hastings faces a substantial likelihood of liability\n- Thiel: Similar finding as for Hastings\n- Bowles: Similar finding as for Hastings\n- Desmond-Hellman: questionable as to whether she is independent of Zuckerberg, but because 5/9 board members were not shown to lack independence there is no need to analyze further\n\nThe Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed this analysis. The plaintiffs apparently conceded on appeal that Zients and Chenault were independent, while defendants did not argue that Zuckergerg, Andreesen, or Sandberg could be independent. Of the remaining directors, the plaintiffs conceded on appeal that none of them had a personal interest in the reclassification or faced a substantial likelihood of liability, which left the question of whether they were independent of Zuckerberg. The Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Chancery that the pled facts were insufficient to support finding that Hastings, Thiel, or Bowles lacked independence from Zuckerberg.\n\nBecause a majority of the board was found to be independent of Zuckerberg for this transaction, the lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nSo while someone did sue, at least at a first glance it's not obvious to me that the courts failed to enforce the law. The law had certain pleading requirements and the plaintiff appears to have failed to meet them.\n\nIf you disagree with the findings of the court in this case, why?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[Here\u2019s another ongoing lawsuit against Meta for their lack of board independence.](https://theshareholdercommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Stamped-Complaint-FINAL-10.3.22.pdf) The lack of board independence is highlighted on pg 11/12, #31.\n\nSo Andreeson was determined as not independent but is still somehow on [Meta\u2019s Compensation Committee](https://investor.fb.com/leadership-and-governance/compensation-and-governance-committee-charter/default.aspx).

The independence-related claims appear to be along the lines of that the board of directors are required to prioritize the interests of stockholders with respect to all their holdings *including non-Facebook holdings*, rather than prioritize the interests of stockholders with respect to just their Facebook holdings.\n\nIt's a unique argument, and I'm curious to see how it plays out, but I think it's somewhat distinct from the independence arguments in *Tornetta* and *<long case name here>* because it isn't about independence *from Musk/Zuckerberg*.\n\n> So why is it fine for Meta but not for Tesla?\n\nI don't think it's necessarily \"fine\" for Meta; I think it may more have been that the issue never really came up in the case:\n\n- That Andreessen is not independent of Zuckerberg is an assumption, not an \"official\" finding. Granted, I wouldn't be too surprised if this assumption were carried over to a hypothetical official decision, especially given Facebook's lack of dispute on appeal.\n- There may be different definitions at play. Delaware courts can and do take situation-specific behavior into account when determining independence, so a director may be independent \"in general\" but lack independence for a specific action\n- Even if Andreessen was \"officially\" found to not be independent of Zuckerberg, the Compensation Committee and whether Andreessen is improperly a member wasn't before the court. I'm not sure the Court has the ability to \"pull in\" issues that the plaintiff doesn't directly raise, especially if those involve third parties.\n- If I'm reading the linked law correctly, that law is basically stating \"listing exchanges must have these rules at a minimum\", so violation of those rules would technically be \"just\" violating the exchange's listing requirements, rather than breaking the law. I'm not entirely sure what the mechanism would be for enforcing these rules, and even then I guess it arguably wouldn't be enforcing the law.\n\nThere's probably be other things but those are just what comes to mind off the top of my head.\n\n(Fun fact: It appears the decision misspells Andreessen's name 3 different times with 1 \"s\" instead of 2. Only found this out when I was trying to find \"Andreesen\" and it only showed up 3 times)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[It's a law suit.](https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-instagram-zuckerberg-corporate-responsibility-def515648ab912ae776047ba3b210e82) The lawsuit states that board directors are required to own 750k in Meta Stock which interferes with independence. It's a clear violation of the rule that compensation committee members should not own too much of the company's stock if at all to maintain independence per 240.10C-1(b)(4)(v). Andreessen owns \\~20M in Meta stock.\n\nEither way, it's undeniable that Andreessen is not independent. And as I detailed in my post, neither is Andrew Houston who is literally Zuckerberg's known good friend. Both are on the Compensation Committee. It's a direct violation of *240.10C-1(b)(4)(i) Each member of the compensation committee must be a member of the board of directors of the listed issuer, and must otherwise be independent.* People have been pointing to Zuck's low pay compared to Elon. In this case, that's a massive conflict of interest as low CEO pay is good for the stock and Andreessen owns 20M in Meta stock.\n\nThe issue as I laid out is that this law is not being enforced. We can't depend on lawsuits because they can get dismissed or dragged out because of corporations' endless resources . Therefore its up to the legal system to enact their duty and enforce these laws. It's not just Meta and Tesla. We can do this same exercise of identifying violations of board independence at many other corporations.\n\nThat's why I'm arguing that this is the fault of the legal system for not enforcing the law to force corporations to abide and therefore this ruling is unfairly applying the law discriminately. Several lawsuits have been brought against Meta and we clearly see non-independent directors on their Compensation Committee with no repercussions.

The initial link was to the complaint, and the article you just linked is for the motion for dismissal.

The lawsuit claims the directors are not independent from making decisions *that are beneficial to the company but harmful to shareholders' non-company holdings*. I think it's not unreasonable to claim that that is probably not a standard definition of independence, since the plaintiffs are not claiming that the Board isn't acting in the company's best interests. At a minimum, it's not the same kind of independence as was an issue in *Tornetta*.\n\n> It's a clear violation of the rule that compensation committee members should not own too much of the company's stock if at all to maintain independence per 240.10C-1(b)(4)(v).\n\nI'm not sure I agree with your reading of that rule. That rule appears to be talking about consultants/advisors/etc. to the compensation committee, not the compensation committee itself. In addition, the rule doesn't seem to say that owning too much stock is bad; it states that stock ownership should be considered, no more, no less. And if anything, shouldn't owning stock make directors *more* aligned with the company, since they would theoretically be motivated to take actions that would benefit shareholders, including them?\n\n> In this case, that's a massive conflict of interest as low CEO pay is good for the stock and Andreessen owns 20M in Meta stock.\n\nAt least by traditional standards, isn't \"good for the stock\" basically what is expected? The Board should be making decisions which are good for shareholders, and improving the stock price is pretty much the quintessential example of something that's good for shareholders?\n\n> We can't depend on lawsuits because they can get dismissed or dragged out because of corporations' endless resources . Therefore it's up to the legal system to enact their duty and enforce these laws.\n\nI'm not sure why the first sentence wouldn't still apply to the second sentence. It's not like \"the legal system\" can punish a company without risking a lawsuit.\n\nIn addition, we need to ask whether the legal system *can* enforce those laws without initial third-party action. Courts obviously can't initiate a case on their own and a generally restricted from Pershing issues not properly brought before them, and I don't know whether the laws allow for the government to bring a suit on its own.\n\nAnd again, I think the entire page you're referencing is describing minimum rules *for stock exchanges*, so even if we assume a company is violating the rules that might be something that needs to be taken up with the exchanges, rather than treated as a \"normal\" violation of the law. That being said, I'm not going to claim that such a law doesn't exist; I just don't think it's the one you linked.\n\n> Several lawsuits have been brought against Meta and we clearly see non-independent directors on their Compensation Committee with no repercussions.\n\nAgain, the big question is what grounds the lawsuits were brought under and whether a non-independent Compensation Committee is relevant for those lawsuits.\n\nFor example, Tornetta didn't sue under (possibly hypothetical?) laws prohibiting non-independent members of the Compensation Committee; he sued for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste, and the requested remedy was related to that. Everything about the Compensation Committee was evidence for/against those counts and how they are handled under Delaware law, rather than being a breach of law in and of itself. In fact, I don't actually think the judge said non-independent Compensation Committee members anre outright illegal either, just that it results in a specific conclusion for one of the tests under Delaware law.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">I'm not sure I agree with your reading of that rule.\n\nI think our differences lie in our interpretations of the rule. So instead of 240.10C-1(b)(4)(v), then lets look at 240.10C-1(b)(1)(ii). This is much more open-ended which is why I picked (b)(4)(v). Andreessen already fails (B), but the lawsuit contends with (A) Source of Compensation. Board members are compensated with [annual equity grants ranging from 300-375k/year](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680123000050/meta-20230414.htm#id8aff64984c64035b3e93501af472b14_40). Chump change for some, but not necessarily for all board members. This is a common practice among all corporations. Stock-based comp is always going to cause issues with independence.\n\nI would also argue that a board director who owns a significant amount of the company's stock would be compensated by rises in the stock. [A substantial equity ownership is likely to impair a director's ability to act independently.](https://www.loeb.com/en/insights/publications/2009/06/the-case-against-stock-ownership-requirements-fo__) Tbf 20M of Meta stock is probably not \"substantial\" to Andreessen because he's a billionaire. However, the requirement for directors to own 750K+ could be substantial to the other members. The issue is that the existence of the rule itself is questionable.\n\n>shouldn't owning stock make directors more aligned with the company, since they would theoretically be motivated to take actions that would benefit shareholders, including them?\n\nYes, but that still makes you non-independent per the rule above. \n\n>In addition, we need to ask whether the legal system can enforce those laws without initial third-party action.\n\n[That is what the SEC is for.](https://www.sec.gov/page/litigation)\n\n>whether a non-independent Compensation Committee is relevant for those lawsuits...he sued for breach of fiduciary duty\n\nThis breach was a result of the lack of disclosure of non-independent directors on the Compensation Committee. This issue with independence is detailed thoroughly in the Post-Trial Opinion.\n\nSo we've established that Andreessen and Houston are non-independent. They are on the Compensation Committee. That is is a violation. I think we agree on that. I think we also agree that there are several other corporations outside of Meta and Tesla with similar violations.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Do you agree the fault should lie with the law enforcement when the law hasn't been enforced or does it still lie with Tesla in this case? Regardless of how the law can be enforced, it has to be enforced. Negligence of law enforcement is also a crime.\n2. If your answer is Tesla above, then if the SEC/legal system failed to take action against other corporations going forward to enforce the law based on this precedent, wouldn't that be considered an unfair discriminate application of the law?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "> I think our differences lie in our interpretations of the rule. So instead of 240.10C-1(b)(4)(v), then lets look at 240.10C-1(b)(1)(ii).\n\nI think our differences in opinion might be a bit broader than the specific subrule. As I read it, the entirety of 240.10C-1 imposes requirements on *stock exchanges/associations*, not companies themselves. It's basically stating \"stock exchanges/associates must implement rules with the following minimum requirements\". As a result, I'm not confident individual companies *can* violate the rule in the legal sense, as it isn't directed at them.\n\nAn analogy might be a law that requires all bars to institute a rule prohibiting people under 21 from the premises, rather than the law directly prohibiting people under 21 from entering a bar. In principle, you get a similar effect, but there can be differences in enforcement. A bar that does not institute such a rule would run afoul of the first law, while the second one would mean a person under 21 who enters a bar would be prosecuted. I'm not sure who would be prosecuted if the bar instituted a rule following the first law, but a person under 21 entered anyways, whether through deception, negligence, or something else.\n\nThis reading appears to be supported by the SEC. From [document describing the final rule that was adopted](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2012/33-9330.pdf) (emphasis added):\n\n> Section 10C requires the Commission to adopt rules directing the **national securities exchanges and national securities associations** to prohibit the listing of any equity security of an issuer that is not in compliance with Section 10C\u2019s compensation committee and compensation adviser requirements\n\nIn addition, the SEC decided that each exchange can make its own determination as to what constitutes independence as long as it meets the minimum legal requirements.\n\nAs an example, the Nasdaq (where TSLA and META are listed, I think?) corporate governance requirements can be found [here](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules/nasdaq-5600-series). Nasdaq appears to require compensation committees to be entirely made up of at least two Independent Directors (with a possible exception), where an Independent Director is:\n\n> a person other than an Executive Officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\n\nThat feels... kind of broad? I'm not really sure how and where one would go about disputing this determination as well. [It appears there's a process for Nasdaq to enforce its rules](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/rulebook/nasdaq/rules/Nasdaq%205800%20Series), but it's not immediately clear whether there's a mechanism for a third party, private or public, to either start the process or enforce the rules separately.\n\n> A substantial equity ownership is likely to impair a director's ability to act independently.\n\nThis was an interesting article to read. Thanks for linking it! It brought up some edge cases I hadn't considered.\n\nThat being said, I still don't think there's a rule that automatically makes a director non-independent if they own stock. For example, the Nasdaq rules state \"Because Nasdaq does not believe that ownership of Company stock by itself would preclude a board finding of independence, it is not included in the aforementioned objective factors.\" At least according to Nasdaq, there would need to be something else in addition to stock ownership that would prevent a finding of independence.\n\n> That is what the SEC is for.\n\nI admittedly didn't think of the SEC when I originally replied, but that's because I was thinking about *Delaware's* laws since it seems the type of lawsuit involving the Delaware courts generally (always?) invoke Delaware's laws rather than federal laws. I don't think the SEC has jurisdiction over state laws, and I'm not sure it can enforce exchanges' rules for them either.\n\n> This breach was a result of the lack of disclosure of non-independent directors on the Compensation Committee. This issue with independence is detailed thoroughly in the Post-Trial Opinion.\n\nYes, I generally agree. But they key here is that the *breach itself* is the illegal act; the lack of independence is evidence towards supporting that a breach occurred, but is not in and of itself illegal. For example, if the board had fully disclosed the Compensation Committee/Board's potential/actual conflicts of interest and all details on the negotiation to the shareholders before the vote, and if Tornetta had failed to show the compensation plan was unfair, then the decision would have been that there was no breach of fiduciary duty *even though* the board was not independent, and so Musk would have kept his compensation.\n\n> That is is a violation. I think we agree on that.\n\nI think it's reasonable to consider Andreessen's presence on the compensation committee suspicious at the very least. No idea about Houston or other corporations, since I haven't read as much on them.\n\n> Do you agree the fault should lie with the law enforcement when the law hasn't been enforced or does it still lie with Tesla in this case?\n\nI'm not sure if there's any fault for law enforcement because as I described above I'm not sure what they *can* enforce, especially with respect to the types of claims here.\n\nBased on the decision I think it's reasonable to think that Tesla and/or Musk screwed up.\n\n> Regardless of how the law can be enforced, it has to be enforced. Negligence of law enforcement is also a crime.\n\nThese are two related but distinct statements. The first statement is generally incorrect given the long-standing (albeit controversial) existence of prosecutorial discretion. The second feels too general; I'd like to see specific citations before agreeing/disagreeing.\n\n> If your answer is Tesla above, then if the SEC/legal system failed to take action against other corporations going forward to enforce the law based on this precedent, wouldn't that be considered an unfair discriminate application of the law?\n\nI don't think that's necessarily the case. At least to me, unfair/discriminatory application of the law is usually associated with the government putting its thumb on the scale, e.g., by choosing what cases to bring/dismiss. This is because the government as an entity is (supposedly) required to be fair, but in this kind of case it's third parties that are taking action and there's no general legal requirement that arbitrary third parties act fair when suing or for the government to try to \"balance the scales\", so to speak.\n\nSo even if you assume everyone is breaking the law, the government not bringing cases against anyone is arguably \"fair\" - everyone is breaking the law, but the government is treating everyone equally by not taking action. On the other hand, you, me, and a bajillion other people can pull a ticker out of a hat and (assuming for the sake of example that we all win) sue that entity into oblivion; it's not fair, but it's perfectly legal (and questionably moral, the best kind of perfectly legal!).

I've seen this firsthand through my decade of work experience in consulting and finance which include dealing with senior management at large corporations as well as studying at a top MBA program.\n\nOn that premise, it's an open secret there is no board independence. When this proposal was sent through, all of the institutional investors like Vanguard and all the hedge funds/banks already knew that. They passed it anyways because it was a fair deal in their eyes. So technically there was no disclosure, but everyone that matters already knew. Nobody cares if a retail investor with 500 shares didn't know.\n\nThis brings me to the 10 mph over the speed limit example. If the law wasn't properly enforced, then the fault is on the law enforcement. There was no disclosure, because the law wasn't enforced properly to demand proper disclosure to pass proposals for the past 100 years. The fact that this was singled out is extremely irregular. Like how only you would be singled out and get a ticket for driving 10 mph over while everyone else has been doing the same thing forever.\n\nTesla will now just create a new comparative compensation package, walk through all the bullshit procedures, attach all the proper disclosures, and it will likely just get passed again.

And I agree with you on that an engaged and motivated board is important. The law recognizes this, gives great liberty on selecting the board and allows dependent members. When a company takes on more and more shareholders and especially if they go public the company, the board are held to higher standards. Auditing, disclosures fiduciary duty etc. The contract of capitalism, people can bankroll your idea and make you succeed and in order for this to work some set of rules have to apply, rules forged over a century through trial and error. Tesla's board ultimately answers to the shareholders but they are also bound by fiduciary duty. While the first is on a voting basis the second is a protection to all investors regardless of their share.\n\n\nMe, the judge,\u00a0 even Tesla and I would suggest you as well agree that there are different grades to dependency that can be considered. Just to point to Teslas stated view in this case, Elon is the most dependent (in case of the compensation package an adversary) Kimbal then the rest of the board. Tesla drew the line at Kimbal so he was never part of the compensation Committee or discussions regarding this package. I think you are on the same side as Tesla. The judge thinks differently and thus argues that some sort of disclosure would have to have been in place.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd this is the point of contention the right of shareholders, not the will of the shareholders. These are guaranteed and not voted on.\n\n\nSo the analogy I was making equates the non-independent board to driving over the limit. It opens you up for getting stopped more often , but you are willing to take the risk as you think and know cops never give a ticket. When you are stopped the cop notices something (seat belts / required disclosures) that he can give you a ticket for and fines you.\u00a0\n\n\nThe deciding factor here will be whether you have seatbelt on or not, of course you can argue you wouldn't have gotten a fine if the cop stopped someone else, or of they didn't stop (some) people were driving over the limit.\u00a0\n\n\nBack to the discussion, you are entirely correct that many of other companies' boards are stacked with kids, spouses,\u00a0 friends of majority shareholders.

I am not so bullish on the deal going through though as you are due to a much different shareholder composition today than in 2018.

They should have been enforcing the law then. Why is it an issue now if not for some personal vendetta (this is another argument)?
