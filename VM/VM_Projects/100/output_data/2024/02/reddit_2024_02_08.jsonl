{"title": "Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription", "selftext": "Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.\n\nGoogle also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.\n\nGoogle\u2019s rebrand and app offerings underline the company\u2019s commitment to pursuing \u2014 and investing heavily in \u2014 AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firm\u2019s commitment to AI during the company\u2019s Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user\u2019s behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is \u201ca lot of execution ahead.\u201d Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini changes are a first step to \u201cbuilding a true AI assistant,\u201d Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.\n\nGoogle on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Google\u2019s most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the company\u2019s paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. There\u2019s also a two-month free trial available.\n\nThursday\u2019s rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but they\u2019re restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.\n\nThe Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Google\u2019s former name for the \u201cpackaged AI agents\u201d within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.\n\nGoogle One subscribers who pay for the AI \u200b\u200bsubscription will also have access to Gemini\u2019s assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users\u2019 content in Gmail, Docs and Drive. For example, if you were responding to a long email thread, suggested responses would eventually take in context from both earlier messages in the thread and potentially relevant files in Google Drive.\n\nAs for the reason for the broad name change? Google\u2019s Hsiao told reporters Wednesday that it\u2019s about helping users understand that they\u2019re interacting directly with the AI \u200b\u200bmodels that underpin the chatbot.\n\n\u201cBard [was] the way to talk to our cutting-edge models, and Gemini is our cutting-edge models,\u201d Hsiao said.\n\nEventually, AI agents could potentially schedule a group hangout by scanning everyone\u2019s calendar to make sure there are no conflicts, book travel and activities, buy presents for loved ones or perform a specific job function such as outbound sales. Currently, though, the tools, including Gemini, are largely limited to tasks such as summarizing, generating to-do lists or helping to write code.\n\n\u201cWe will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard,\u201d Pichai said on the Jan. 30 earnings call, speaking about Google Assistant and Search. That \u201callows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow-through for users even more.\u201d\n\nSource: www.cnbc.com/2024/02/08/google-gemini-ai-launches-in-new-app-subscription.html", "id": "1alyebr", "created_utc": 1707406479.0, "score": 512, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "I have no idea how this will play out but Gemini is a WAY better name than barf, err, Bard.", "score": 470, "replies": [{"body": "I wonder if the company Gemini, currently going through bankruptcy, is going to object.", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "I think you mean Genesis, Gemini is fine.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s right, Gemini isn\u2019t going bankrupt though.

{"title": "Bloomberg - Arm CEO Says AI Boom Just Beginning After Record-Setting Rally, \"AI is not in any way, shape or form a hype cycle.\"", "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arm-soars-expansion-markets-buoys-211305491.html\n\nArm Holdings Plc shares surged as much as 64% on Thursday after artificial intelligence spending helped bolster the chip designer\u2019s forecast. And the company\u2019s chief executive officer said the remarkable opportunity presented by AI is still in its early stages.\n\n**\u201cAI is not in any way, shape or form a hype cycle,\u201d Rene Haas said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we\u2019re only at the beginning.\u201d**\n\nThe remarks followed a blockbuster earnings report Thursday, when Arm projected revenue of $850 million to $900 million for the March quarter. That far surpassed analysts\u2019 projections of $778 million. Earnings will be roughly 30 cents, excluding some items, well ahead of Wall Street\u2019s 21-cent estimate.\n\nArm\u2019s technology is going into an ever-widening array of products, from phones to cars to appliances. The scramble to add AI technology promises to accelerate that expansion, Haas said. In some cases, electronics makers don\u2019t yet know how they\u2019ll fully harness AI \u2014 they just want to make sure they have enough computing capacity to handle whatever is coming.\n\nArm once concentrated on technology for smartphones, but now that market accounts for about a third of sales. Phones today also contain more of the company\u2019s technology per device, helping lift the royalties that manufacturers pay to Arm.\n\n\u201cThis is the result of strategies that were put in place a number of years ago that are coming to fruition,\u201d Haas said in the interview. \u201cA lot of folks didn\u2019t really understand the company well and where we fit in: But we\u2019re in a Tesla vehicle, a Ford F-150, we are in a smart camera, a Samsung TV, the smart appliances.\u201d\n\nArm\u2019s bullish outlook, delivered late Wednesday, helped send the shares on their biggest intraday rally since an initial public offering last September. The stock traded as high as $126.59, adding tens of billions of dollars to Arm\u2019s market valuation.\n\nAnother tailwind: The company\u2019s customers are shifting to a new version of its technology called V9, which carries twice the royalty rate of its predecessors. They\u2019re also using more Arm computing cores per device \u2014 more than 100 in Microsoft Corp.\u2019s new server chips, for example \u2014 which amplifies royalties. Arm is also gaining market share from rival technology in the data-center and automotive markets, executives said.\n\nArm now expects sales of $3.16 billion to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2024, which runs through March. That\u2019s up from a previous range that topped out at $3.08 billion.\n\nRevenue grew 14% to $824 million in the fiscal third quarter. Excluding some items, profit was 29 cents a share. Wall Street had predicted revenue of $760 million and earnings of 25 cents a share.\n\nArm\u2019s joint venture in China was a \u201cnice positive surprise\u201d as well, according to Chief Financial Officer Jason Child. It contributed 25% of total revenue.\n\nArm has an unusual role in the semiconductor industry. It licenses the fundamental set of instructions that software uses to communicate with chips. The company also provides so-called design blocks that companies such as Qualcomm Inc. use to build their products.\n\nUnder Haas, Arm has been moving toward providing more complete layouts that can be taken directly to the manufacturing stage. That shift makes it more useful to some customers, such as cloud computing companies like Amazon.com Inc., but also more of a rival to some traditional clients, like Qualcomm.\n\nCambridge, England-based Arm is still 90%-owned by SoftBank Group Corp., which acquired the business in 2016 for $32 billion. An IPO in 2023 raised $4.9 billion, marking the biggest debut on a US exchange in 2023.\n\n\nArm\u2019s licensing sales rose 18% to $354 million last quarter, and royalty revenue gained 11% to $470 million.\n\nArm\u2019s customer list spans the technology industry. Apple Inc. uses its instruction set for the processors that power the iPhone and Mac computers. Amazon relies on Arm designs for its Graviton server processors for data centers. And Qualcomm and MediaTek Inc. are major users of Arm\u2019s blueprints for smartphone processors.", "id": "1am61h3", "created_utc": 1707425811.0, "score": 419, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "If it was in any way shape or form a \u201chype cycle\u201d, would he let us know?", "score": 235, "replies": [{"body": "Nvidia let investors know in 2018 that crypto was likely a short term hype cycle", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "I still think if the covid pumped market and free handout of money wasn\u2019t a thing, crypto *would* have been a short term hype cycle.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I mean, it kinda was anyways.

{"title": "Let me tell you why AI will not stop", "selftext": "  \n\nFrom someone that actually has a job that deals with designing and implementing tech solutions at fortune 500 companies, let me explain why AI is moving so fast and why there is a technical arms race happening that will continue to push the AI market to the moon. And no, I am not some low-level developer that sits behind an IDE all day that has no idea what is really going on with their business partners. I am working with executives on technical strategy and direction, the big league shit. \n\nImagine you are an insurance carrier. You compete with a dozen other companies for business with each of you trying to eek out market share by beating competitors prices. You all need to have the same things (for the most part) claims examiners, sales people, service departments, etc so you all settle around the same price. Now imagine you are the first one to implement an AI capable of replacing 5% of your workforce. All the sudden your overhead goes down substantially (yes 5% is a huge operating cost total), and you can price your insurance lower than everyone else without sacrificing productivity or quality. You now have a huge market advantage over all the other companies because you can undercut them without hitting your bottom line. On top of it all, you are the first one to get data about your AI to train your AI. Now you have a snowball effect of your AI improving itself. I personally think 5% is an easily achievable phase 1 number and imagine you will see 90% of some departments (like service) gone within 10 years.\n\nThis creates an environment where the upfront cost is irrelevant. You will fork out any amount to be the first to the line because they payout in the log run is exponentially more than the cost. Even if you are not first you cannot be anywhere near the back of pact or you will be left behind. I am seeing some of the most tight ass companies open not only their wallets, but also throw their security guidelines and legal teams out the damn window to sign contracts. Every executive has some AI in their top 3 goals this year. \n\nSo how do you capitalize on this? Buy NVDA, MSFT, AMD, GOOG because they will run for the foreseeable future. Also recommend Salesforce (CRM) as an outlier people have not really caught onto yet. Companies are not going to have time to stand up their own platform to integrate with whatever AI reigns supreme. They will leverage whatever platform they have that can support it. CRM is in 80% of the Fortune 500 companies and they are building a bring your own AI model in addition to flushing out their own so they are in a position to win no matter what company actually wins the AI war.\n\nTLDR \u2013 We all know AI is going to replace jobs and be a huge market. What most of you don\u2019t know is that the first companies that do it right, will have a dominant position in their sector. This means they will burn cash to be the first ones with a working AI.

The more you spend time here you sorta get a feel for who's talking out of their ass or copying others and who might have a good idea of the market situation.\n\nGenerally fundamentals and reports only go so far.

They get paid royalties for their IP. They aren't really a competitor to NVIDIA but NVIDIA tried to buy them out because their business model is different and it would save NVIDIA money not to pay royalties. That alone shows they have value. Now it's about revenue and all that stuff. To me, I just know if \"AI\" is thrown around on their earnings call or something promising about them moving into the AI space is mentioned, people will throw money at it.

The current AI transformer technology runs really well on GPUs (the graphics cards nvidia sells for computer games) and the performance is scalable meaning the more chips you buy the better result you'll get. Sure Nvidia aren't the only people who have ever made a GPU but they have always been the best at it and now the demand has sky rocketed they have the first mover advantage. Try and look at how much governments are investing in these things, they are saying stuff like GPUs are going to be as important as roads and AI is going to be as impactful as the steam engine, which I agree with but I appreciate its been heard about stuff a million times and most people are numb to it, but whether it's true or not: governments believe it. Combine this with some of the outrageous/true claims Nvidia have made regarding their own use of AI. They say stuff like it is really hard to come up with a new chip, like they have to run servers non stop for months but apparently AI speeds this up by 80%. They have worked closely with all the big AI companies from the get go on the transformer technology (the stuff that makes it scalable on GPUs) so that makes them first movers on AI usage in factories and production lines as well as first movers on the supply/sales of the highest end GPUs. So combine double first mover advantage with what I think is one of the coolest CEOs to ever exist and you have a hyper-unicorn.
