{"title": "Key Fed inflation measure rose 0.4% in January as expected, up 2.8% from a year ago", "selftext": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/pce-inflation-january-2023-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/29/pce-inflation-january-2023-.html)\n\nInflation rose in line with expectations in January, according to an important gauge the Federal Reserve uses as it deliberates cutting interest rates.\r  \n\r  \nThe personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy costs increased 0.4% for the month and 2.8% from a year ago, as expected according to the Dow Jones consensus estimates.\r  \n\r  \nHeadline PCE, including the volatile food and energy categories, increased 0.3% monthly and 2.4% on a 12-month basis, compared with respective estimates for 0.3% and 2.4%, according to the numbers released Thursday by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis.\r  \n\r  \nThe moves came amid an unexpected jump in personal income, which rose 1%, well above the forecast for 0.3%. Spending decreased 0.1% versus the estimate for a 0.2% gain.\r  \n\r  \nJanuary\u2019s price rises reflected an ongoing shift to services over goods as the economy normalizes from the Covid pandemic disruptions.\r  \n\r  \nServices prices increased 0.6% on the month while goods fell 0.2%; on a 12-month basis, services rose 3.9% and goods were down 0.5%. Within those categories, food prices accelerated 0.5%, offset by a 1.4% slide in energy. On a year-over-year basis, food was up 1.4% while energy fell 4.9%.\r  \n\r  \nBoth the headline and core measures remain ahead of the Fed\u2019s goal for 2% annual inflation. While the Fed officially uses the headline measure, policymakers tend to pay more attention to core as a better indication of where long-term trends are heading.\r  \n\r  \nWall Street reacted little to the news, with stock market futures up slightly and Treasury yields slightly higher. Futures markets where traders bet on the direction of interest rates also indicated little movement, with pricing tilted toward the Fed\u2019s first rate cut coming in June.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOverall, \\[the report\\] is meeting the expectations, and some of the worst fears in the market weren\u2019t met,\u201d said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cThe key is we\u2019re not seeing the broad nature of increases that we had been more fearful of.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThursday\u2019s BEA report also showed that consumers are continuing to dip into savings as prices stay elevated. The personal savings rate was 3.8% on the month, slightly higher than December but off a full percentage point from where it was as recently as June 2023.\r  \n\r  \nIn other economic news, a Labor Department report showed that companies are still reluctant to lay off workers.\r  \n\r  \nInitial jobless claims totaled 215,000 for the week ended Feb. 24, up 13,000 from the previous period and more than the 210,000 Dow Jones estimate but still largely in keeping with recent trends. However, continuing claims, which run a week behind, rose to just above 1.9 million, a gain of 45,000 and higher than the FactSet estimate for 1.88 million.\r  \n\r  \nThe reports come as central bank officials mull the future of monetary policy following 11 interest rate increases totaling 5.25 percentage points. Running from March 2022 to July 2023, the hikes came as the Fed battled inflation that peaked at a more than 40-year high in mid-2022.\r  \n\r  \nOfficials have said in recent days that they expect to begin reversing the increases at some point this year. However, the timing and extent of the policy easing is uncertain as recent data has indicated that inflation could be more stubborn than expected.\r  \n\r  \nJanuary\u2019s consumer price index data raised fears of persistently high inflation, though many economists saw the rise as impacted by seasonal factors and shelter increases unlikely to persist.\r  \n\r  \nWhile the CPI is used as an input to the PCE, Fed officials focus more on the latter as it adjusts for substitutions consumers make for goods and services as prices fall. Where the CPI is viewed as a simpler price measure, the PCE is viewed as more representative of what people are actually buying", "id": "1b31nk9", "created_utc": 1709217037.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 136, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "$ESTC is going to disappoint on earnings", "selftext": "Elastic is reporting earnings AH today, and I believe they are going to heavily disappoint and dump.\n\nPositions(Will add more right before close):\n\n3x ESTC 3/15/24 130 P  \n4x ESTC 3/15/24 125 P  \n5x ESTC3/15/24 120 P  \n\n\nFor those who don't know, Elastic and Snowflake are used for similar purposes, I'll let chatgpt summarize it:  \n\n\n>Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse solution designed for storage and analytics, offering a powerful SQL engine for handling structured and semi-structured data. It scales compute and storage independently, allowing for flexible and efficient data processing.  \n>  \n>Elasticsearch, part of the Elastic Stack, is a search and analytics engine optimized for searching, analyzing, and visualizing large volumes of data in near real-time. It's particularly strong in search scenarios, log and event data analysis, and providing insights across large datasets.\n\nNow, we all remember what happened to SNOW this earnings - they beat expectations, but they were still not profitable (non-GAAP does not count). Additionally, their future guidance was low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo4jfled2llc1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf65bc653a51e5aecaae467e7fa2051d52f89aa5\n\nWe've seen what happens to other tech companies that are focused on growth and report poor guidance this earnings season like DDOG, ANET. Additionally, Elastic is **not yet profitable**. They crash. Hard.  \n\n\n# Why do I know Elastic is going to disappoint on guidance?\n\n**Tl;dr I don't know, but I think its very likely**  \n Snowflake and Elastic are competing in similar spaces. Additionally, there is also databricks, a private company that competes in this space as well and has been gaining market share.  \nAs a software engineer, I've seen lots of companies recently start focusing on optimizing spending on cloud, internal tools recently, which would include stuff like datadog, elasticsearch(for logging), AWS etc..  \n\n\nWhile elastic is easy to use, there is  simply too much competition and cost cutting going on for them to have good guidance. I cannot see a reason why companies like DDOG, PANW, SNOW would give lower guidance and expect ESTC to have good guidance, given that they are in highly related spaces.  \n\n\n# Options Chain\n\nAfter the SNOW crash, I decided to take a look at the options chain for ESTC, as options chain data is sometimes helpful in predicting earnings(You can check these messages on WSB discord)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mzib45v3llc1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d9ad3b749f298e6761b524f7fca0b9ed88fa83\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/649t459x3llc1.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=d926133d97726de6adf4db330670a8d2f27da317\n\n[EXPE crashed after earnings too.](https://preview.redd.it/mntcm6dh4llc1.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=c051689f675582cc53dc509dd17432ae4b6e2da8)\n\nNow, the options chain for SNOW was only slightly bearish, maybe around 55% bearish vs 45%. However, I saw this massive order block on ESTC for around **2 million USD** in PUTS that are OTM, and expire soon. This means that someone is betting a huge amount of money that a drop will happen soon, that is significant enough to breakeven on these contracts.   \n\n\n2 million dollars on OTM puts that expire soon is extremely rare on non-etfs/mag7, and although we cant confirm its the same trader, the sizing, timing and repeated buys make it highly likely\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37egeocq3llc1.png?width=2535&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbc5f51255b1905b8d87f817c75512a71efd23cf\n\nNow, this put buy was NOT BTC so it was someone opening a position, because we can see that the OI has stayed on the options chain till today. This means that whoever is in their position is holding it over earnings. They haven't closed out their position yet, and if they do before market close I will update this post.  \n\n\nTL;DR   \n\n\nESTC will disappoint on guidance, similar to SNOW.
