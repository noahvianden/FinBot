I\u2019ve been DCA\u2019ing pretty consistently since 2017, so my per unit costs across the board look pretty damn good and can survive a sharp downturn that I\u2019m well aware could be bad. Tech isn\u2019t going anywhere though. While I need to diversify more (I\u2019ve at least been building up my VOO position, but that\u2019s very tech exposed itself of course), my core philosophy around these positions is that I\u2019m going to be very happy in 203X that I held onto them through what is certain to continue to be a decade of uncertainty. So much shit will fly about tech, there will probably be an alarming dip in the near future, followed by \u201cis this the death of tech?\u201d headlines. Those headlines will come, be ready because that\u2019s your giant buy signal. \n\nI want to invest in real estate beyond the home I own and live in, but shoot I don\u2019t gotta tell y\u2019all about rates and prices like you don\u2019t already know. I think restaurants and hospitality and the like might be ones to look at, probably some IPOs. With grocery prices so high, we\u2019ve found for our small family that getting takeout and modest sit down restaurants, while still rough on the budget, we are actually paying less of a premium on it (on a \u201ccost vs cost\u201d basis) than before inflation. I feel like we keep hearing the line \u201cthe numbers don\u2019t reflect how people *feel* about the economy\u201d. And I totally get why, everyone is feeling the squeeze. But you go to restaurants, and while I\u2019m a city guy living between a minor, and shall we say \u201cmid major\u201d metro area, restaurants are absolutely HOPPING right now. Everywhere we go. \n\nEven if people are beat down and crushed at their jobs, it makes them even less likely to want to go home and prepare a meal. Then there\u2019s no solace in running up a $250 grocery bill. Instead maybe you go meet a friend at your favorite spot for happy hour, have a couple drinks and an entree and it doesn\u2019t feel all that bad spending $25-$30. Conventional wisdom says people would tighten their belts in a recession and stop going out to eat. But through what has now been years of recession hand wringing and inflation recovery, people have continued to spend through it all while being very vocal about the pinch they are feeling in their budget. While filling 2 carts full of groceries and spending $500 while deal shopping is the most economical way to do it, not everyone can do that right now. Fewer will be able to manage that in a recession. A recession will also bring back more \u201cbang for your buck\u201d deals, enticing people too low on money for a grocery budget into an expensive cycle of fast food. \n\nSo while I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as \u201cdefensive\u201d exactly, I think this is a sector I\u2019ll be researching this week and maybe identifying some opportunities. Could be a play that goes against the grain of conventional wisdom a bit. Idk I\u2019m still kicking myself for being a Chipotle addict and missing the boat on it, and maybe it\u2019s made me feel like it\u2019s a pretty maxed out sector.

The Prosumer. I don't know how much revenue they get from wanna be YouTubers, but I'm guessing it's a surprising amount. So many aspiring artists that aren't really making any money right now are subscribing to Adobe services, and how much would the stock be damaged if half that business completely dried up?\n\nI haven't looked at the financials and don't know what kind of percentages we're talking about, so I don't know if one should be really alarmed or not.\n\nBut, make no mistake, there will be some app, a one word app, that becomes mega popular for photo/video generation and editing. A free app that shows ads of stuff in between videos and pictures that it's rendering for you on the fly. Fully capable of editing and everything else.\n\nAdobe of course will have something that's basically as good as, but eventually many of the \"prosumers\" that find themselves using the free app that all their friends and family are using, they will slowly start cancelling their subscriptions, and it's just going to be a thing of the past.\n\nAdobe will have the professional side of the business for considerably longer.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think you're referring to Canva and Adobe Express?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4215075671672821}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7825562953948975}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5442046523094177}, {"body": "Sorry, but you're very wrong.

Their key products have been attached to a subscription system to such and effective level, they no longer have to sell individual licences for their products, and, thanks to digital distribution models, have a licence to print money.\n\nAt a lower level, Adobe is not the only option for pixel-based 2-2.5D image manipulation and not the only option for Vector-based 2-2.5D image manipulation and creation, plus, publishing.\n\nSo, we go to tertiary education levels and ask the simple question 'Is there a preponderance of focus for universities, colleges and to **only** teach/train/educate Adobe products'?\n\nAnd if there is, I think there are some companies out there who offer (almost) the exact same product for sell money, such as 'Affinity' who offer the 3 key product 'types' AND they offer these products at NO SUBSCRIPTION.\n\nIf I were a company such as 'Affinity' and, if I were an investor of Adobe...I would like to know whether educators and trainers have been 'persuaded' to push Adobe products, over other products?\n\nIt should surely be more important to train and educate people in the skills of image creation and manipulation, rather than just tell people something contracted and reductive like 'just learn photoshop'.\n\nThe term 'photo-shopped' is also used across news networks and is even used to describe the psychological impact on the young with models in advertising being 'photo-shopped', and therefore CAN contribute in a negative emotional way. Again, not trying to debate the issue, just making a point about the companies' key product being the name of a verb, if you see my point.\n\nIN MY HUMBLE OPINION;\n\n\\-There is NO REASON for Adobe to charge the amount they do for the products they offer. They are vastly overpriced, for what they offer.\n\n\\-There is NO REASON for Adobe to bundle their products into one subscription model.\n\n\\-There is NO REASON for news corporations to attribute image manipulation software into a verb which is also the name of a product, as it is (in essence) free advertising.\n\n\\-There is NO REASON for Universities and Colleges (educational or vocational) to push Adobe products over other company offerings.\n\n\\-There is NO REASON for Adobe to not only combine their products into ONE bundle, but, create a series of application overlap(s) wherein features which have NO NEED to NOT be included in one package (Post processing and LUT tables being an easy example). They have therefore made their products DELIBERATELY 'gimped' unless you purchase/subscribe to another product. Another way to understand this point will be they will put 99% of a product into one product, but the 1% that is *essential* to your workflow, exists in *another product*, that is (surprise-surprise) bundled into a higher subscription model.\n\n\\-There is NO REASON why certain image manipulation patents they hold ([https://patents.justia.com/assignee/adobe-inc](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/adobe-inc)) can try and PUSH for FAR TOO MUCH CONTROL over the digital image manipulation and IT ASSET SYSTEMS to be held and guarded so strongly.\n\nThey have created a system to bombard people into this system from education, which has followed them into employment, and, even night/evening classes too.\n\nMay I finish my harsh words with the following:\n\nANY NEGATIVE DOWNGRADING OF ADOBE STOCK IS LONG OVERDUE.\n\nAny 'fall of Adobe' will be followed by 'Autodesk', because the two companies are just as guilty of the same failings, and, again: THIS IS DELIBERATE.\n\n\\-Nickle'n'diming people for the last 30 years, with an 'undeserved' company value.\n\n\\-An industry guilty of capitulation.\n\n\\-An education system party to letting corporations control learning, for unclear reasons, without question by governments and industry regulators & unions.\n\nThese all need breaking up, and, to offer a simple analogy: \n\nYou want to buy a cup of coffee, and, the restaurant has somehow convinced everyone that not only are they the only ones who should be allowed to sell a particular recipe of food, but that you have to pay for everything on the menu, when you just want a cup of coffee, and, you have to pay for it on a subscription model...for a minimum period of time, so, you end up paying for food that you have to eat, whether you ordered it or not.\n\nThis is madness, and it needs to end.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12054457515478134}, {"body": "Still up 55% yoy", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1546747237443924}, {"body": "Not sure whats happening but they purchased a really shitty application that I've used, Workfront.

So in heat of exchange Elon called him Pedo guy. He also retracted that tweet and also was brought to Defamation lawsuit about it and he got cleared in US court. Maybe if the brittish guy would be more open about help from others and not being a child to tell Elon to sodomize himself with the submarine. WHOOOO CARES? Two guys clutches and exchange mean tweets and then gets over it.\n\n>Claiming to support free speech while being one of the greatest dangers to it on Twitter?\n\nAgree to disagree? He is liberating free speech and with twitter files showing how bad the left/socialists agenda and narrative is. Your opinion may vary. Only great things from when Elon paid 44 B dollars to liberate free speech. It's truly a gift for mankind for someone to help free speech on the internet. Also, every countrys law has to be obeyed sadly otherwize [](http://x.com) will be banned from that region of the world. You seem very biased here. What previous owners did with twitter was bad.\n\n>Being a terrible father?\n\nI don't know. Seems to be great with the kids he has around him. One kid in question is woke and rebellish and hate her father. Nothing horrendous really here. Sad of course but label him a terrible father is a bit much. He seems great with the kids he has with him from time to time. He probably is our times greatest visionary and entreprenur and it comes with a price of working many hours every day. He also have kids with several womans and no it is not the norm. But being a billionaire and a great entrepreneur and big visionary aint the norm either. As long the kid have good time with their parents and taken care of and having great time with his dad once they see each other I see nothing wrong. Small price to pay in the grand scheme of things.\n\n>Having absolutely zero grip on reality?\n\nSo once again we have to agree to disagree here. Tell me who has more grip on reality then Elon? His track records speeks for that he indeed has more understanding of reality then most. Who has better grip on reality then Elon? Mara? Biden? Trudeau? Socialists? Commies? Pooh Bear in china? Who? Putin?\n\n>Taking credit for \"creating\" companies he bought and being \"self-made\" when he absolutely,\u00a0*indisputably*\u00a0isn't?\n\nTell me you know nothing about running businesses without telling me you know about bizniz. Also, study Elons Past and what he has endured with every company and what he has performed and maybe you will change your perception about this specific topic.\n\n>The list goes on and on.\n\nGreat, do tell more about him.
