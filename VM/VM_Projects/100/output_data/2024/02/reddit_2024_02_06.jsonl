{"title": "Snap plunges 25% on revenue miss and light guidance, as Middle East conflict creates \u2018headwind\u2019", "selftext": "Snap reported revenue that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates on Tuesday and issued a forecast that came in a bit below Wall Street expectations. The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did:\n\nEarnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.\n\nRevenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.\n\nGlobal Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\nAverage revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\n\nSnap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.\n\nFor the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel.\n\n\u201cWhile we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4,\u201d Snap said in a letter to investors.\n\nGrowth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.\n\nDaily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.\n\nEarlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and \u201creduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.\u201d In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.\n\nSnap\u2019s net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.\n\nSnap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an \u201cinternal forecast\u201d for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of \u201cthe unpredictable nature of war,\u201d referring to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nSnap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.\n\nSnap\u2019s growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.\n\nSnap and Pinterest are \u201cmuch smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. \u201cIn this environment, the big are getting bigger,\u201d\n\nLast week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Lawmakers grilled the executives, accusing them of failing to properly safeguard their respective platforms from child predators, among other concerns.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/06/snap-earnings-q4-2023.html", "id": "1akkww1", "created_utc": 1707254213.0, "score": 467, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "snap always plunges on earnings. what a shitty stock", "score": 393, "replies": [{"body": "They used to go first and cause a selloff in GOOG and META, nice of them to go last now.", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "But I mean.

More importantly, it will be integrated into the work force and reduce overall labor costs for thousands of companies when this technology is adoptable. \n\nLet\u2019s face it.

It could be the script from Windows Vista press junket, or maybe the Blackberry Torch or any of a hundred other fads du jour.\n\nIf you want to know how much the future will progress in 5 years, there's an easy trick.  Go back 5 years in the past and observe the delta.  But do it with a sober, rational, critical think view.  Not a fanboy hype one.  \n\nThink of what we and the world were doing 5 years ago compared to now.  I'll tell you.  We were waiting for a very incrementally different camera lens on the iPhone.  People were claiming Apple is secretly developing a car.  People were using Netflix and bitching about it.  Netflix was fudging the numbers by obstructing sun numbers and pushing through price increases,  People were being ripped off on concert tickets.  An insane game host turned politician was pushing daily disinformation sourced from Russia propaganda farms, and he was being challenged by his septuagenarian institutional opposite.  Conservatives were trying to ban books and content creators for being w-one.  Nvidia stock had split because it rose so much.  Crypto was being hyped but nobody could articulate a real use for it.  Boeing executives were lying and failing to make safe planes.  News media was doing superficial stories for clicks.  Autocorrect was faulty.  Siri was a crapshoot. China was both a world power to fear, and yet a basket case that might submarine the economy.  Putin was invading neighbors, most of the world was just letting him, and he was killing his opponents.\n\nOk, now zoom back to the present day and be honest, truly honest: how much has changed in 5 years?  That's how much change you can expect to see by 2029.  \n\nDo the same delta check on a 10 year window.  Surprise, we were watching (checks notes) Netflix, fanboys were way too excited about their iPhones.  Phones needed to be charged every day.  GTA was the biggest video game, PlayStation was edging out Xbox for desirability.  Movie studios were relying on too many sequels.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Colbert and Seth brought us our news parodies.  Social media was a time suck of superficial and self-indulgent junk.  China and Russia were threats.  Middle East was unstable.  And so on.
