THIS IS A SPECULATIVE PLAY.   \n\n   You can\u2019t deny with inflation (CPI GDP) interest rate pauses and stock ATHs and the fact that at the top of the market anyone speculating a correction is called \u201can idiot\u201d makes a pretty compelling narrative that would could likely see a 20%30% or more correction.   But that\u2019s for another post.  \n\n   Got a 4K tax return. Im beyond comfortable financially. Rather than investing all at ATHs or put in my high yield- I\u2019m considering putting half into that lottery play on my gut feeling.   I\u2019m thinking of placing a \u201cif I\u2019m right i want to 5x my cash\u201d play. But don\u2019t wanna spend more than 2k on premium because I realize the likely hood of it not working out is high.   I am familiar with options although I primarily sell options against my long portfolio. So IV delta and theta are my main Greeks. I\u2019ve never looked into buying for large price swings.  \n\n     My half assed plan: buy Sept quarterly SPY Puts (9/20/2024. Low enough theta and time to be wrong. And roll out every month or so if the market keeps climbing.  However, I\u2019m not sure what strike I would chose. Something at the 20-30% which would be around 350 currently?  Or a slightly out of the money (490 ish) so it will end deep in the money.   More or less\u2026. One close to the money or 4-5 at that 30% mark.  Which would be more profitable? I know it depends on Volatility, and timing. I\u2019m just saying in general.    \n\n   If you wanted to put a 2k speculative play on a correction, what stock and strikes would you choose?    \n\n   Again, I\u2019m aware it\u2019s high risk and unlikely.

Let\u2019s take AI where it is now. Right now, in its simple form, I can have it complete 8 hours of research in 20 minutes. Yes, I have to review it and edit it and clean it up to be useful, but in the most infantile, publically available version of AI, I can save myself at a minimum 7 hours of work for a single project. Now that alone is great, but it also lets me scale. I get paid $250 an hour to do that, but now, i have an easily repeatable process that I can have 10 $25 an hour desk jockeys complete and I just have to review it. That\u2019s a practical function right now that I can easily implement. I don\u2019t do it because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m convincing the dinosaurs at my job to make me redundant, but eventually, this is going to be a thing. Microsoft copilot will take time to train staff on, but once it\u2019s fully rolled out, every workforce that uses Microsoft office suite for most of their day can be cut, at a minimum, in half. So at a minimum, you can downsize staff and reduce level of training and barrier to skill entry. \n\nNow let\u2019s project where AI will be in a few years. One step will be simplifying complex systems. You want to interact with a complicated accounting system or electronic health record? Right now, it\u2019s a tedious navigation that takes more time than it needs to. AI can make navigating that system seamless. You want to code, but don\u2019t have time to learn a language? You can discuss the architecture with an AI and have it write you a program based on that. Your training levels diminish, and your daily workflow becomes way easier. \n\nNow far off, Sam Altman 7 trillion dollar venture in the future, AI can develop itself, and can solve extremely complex problems. Who needs a large hadron collider when an AI can solve incredibly complex projections within seconds? Gene editing is a total nightmare, but with AI to analyze the entire genome and epigenome, you can point select changes to cure disease without causing issues.
