{"title": "Elon is bailing and so should you", "selftext": "I purchased my first Tesla shares in 2016, right after the announcement event for the Model 3. It was my first investment in something other than an index fund, but after the presentation that evening I couldn't NOT pull the trigger. It was the most optimistic I've ever been about a company. I continued buying more shares every month during all of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Even though I could barely afford it, a big part of every paycheck during those years went to increasing my stake in Tesla. Over time, I built up what was (for me) an absolutely massive position.\n\nThat obviously turned out to be the right move. By 2021, my initial investment had 30x'd, so I cashed out a small portion to buy a Model 3, the same vehicle I had fallen in love with all those years earlier. The cost of the car was tiny compared to the money I had made owning the stock, and the plan was to hold onto the rest until I retired. Then in November 2021, Elon started selling. It feels silly to say this, but I have to admit I felt a bit betrayed. Up until that point, his motto had always been \"first in, last out.\" While that clearly wasn't true anymore, I decided to hang tight.\n\nFuck me, that was a dumb decision. Elon perfectly timed the all time pico top of this thing. Ever since, it's been lower highs and lower lows, year after year, with no end in sight. I could put up with the twitter drama and cringey edgelord shit, but the most recent earnings call was the last straw. I've been listening to those calls for years, and you can tell in his voice Elon is OVER this company. These days, he's obviously more interested in railing against \"illegals\" and poopsocking Diablo than he is about clean energy or even space. He's sure as shit not sleeping on that factory floor ever again. My prediction is he steps down as CEO in the next 12 months.\n\nSo yeah, I'm out. It was a fun ride, but this is where I get off.

From watching many Cybertruck interviews on YouTube, it is clear to me that Tesla's managers, such as Lars Moravy and Franz von Holzhausen, are much more enthusiastic about Tesla than Musk is.

Forthcoming NGV (next-gen vehicle) platform that should enable a $25,000 product and take Tesla's volume sales to the 8-figure level in the long run\n3. FSD Beta 12.  Tesla has finally moved the FSD software stack to an end-to-end Neural Net.  This, combined with enormous amounts of AI training compute being installed this year, may finally place FSD on a path to being a generally monetizable product. \n4. Tesla Bot.  General purpose, inexpensive, and mass produced robots could have enormous impact on the manual labor economy.\n5. AI training as a service.  This is another potential revenue stream should the long odds Dojo project succeed and Tesla has spare compute. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Much of this is a gamble on the efforts of Tesla as an organization**.
