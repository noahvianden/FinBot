I will throw another one out there. \n\nI like to sell put credit spreads about 4.5% out of the money on the SPY (you could explore SPX too, as it is taxed better and you don't get early assignment). \n\nMy rules are as follows.\n\n\\- Sell 2 strike wide put credit spreads on the SPY. \n\n\\- The short should be at least 4.5% away from the current stock price. You can select the short based on delta too (most people do). \n\n\\- I need to receive at least $0.18 credit (typically average around $0.21. There will be times when you have many trades on (like up to 10), and there will be times when you are just in cash. \n\n\\- I look no further than 45 days out of this trade. Sometimes I get 20 DTE, and sometimes you get 45 DTE. Just depends on what the market is giving you. \n\n\\- Once I open the trade I put a standing order to close at $0.03 debit. Typically takes about 23 days to close. \n\n\\- If by the close of any one day the SPY touches the short strike I close the trade for a loss. I don't get tricky. Just close and take the loss. \n\n\\- As I said above you can have up to 10 trades on at any one point. It is important to take trades whenever you can have them. Tho, I never duplicate strike prices, nor do I duplicate expire dates. With this rule you almost always never have more than 10 trades, and maybe average 3-4 trades at any given time. \n\n\\- You will have periods of pretty big draw downs. So be thoughtful in how you size this trade. I typically increase trade size like once a year. This is not something you should try to compound quickly. \n\nHere are some example real trades from last year. \n\n[https://cs.clabs.io/D0p6z8sC](https://cs.clabs.io/D0p6z8sC)\n\nI have been placing this trade for 10+ years now.

I have few questions here - When you say that you have 10 trades but different strikes and DTE are thy for the same stock ticker? For example in your case SPY. Also, can you give some example of draw down and how do you approach it?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yep. Same ticker. I always trade SPY. Tho if I were just starting out I would explore SPX now. SPX is better tax wises and you don't have early assignment risk.  \n\n\nMy last biggest draw down was Feb or March when covid hit. It was maybe a 40% draw down. Took almost the rest of the year to recover.  Last year in 2023 I had 2 losses in Oct and Nov. They were small draw downs so it just impacted yearly performance but still ended the year with a healthy profit (30% if I remember correctly). Had I not had those two losses in 2023 I might have had a 50% return for the year or something. \n\nThe key to draw downs is not sizing up too fast. So when you have draw downs hopefully you are drawing down from profits. Of course if you get unlucky and have a draw down within a few months of starting you might have to put more capital in and restart. There is a luck factor when starting. I have had years where I got a 100% return, I have had years where I have lost 20%, and many years making 30%. So the 100% years will offset the bad years. I think when I did the math last time this strategy has something like a 40% CAGR, but it has been a bit since I ran the numbers. \n\nI size my trades by putting 8-12% of my planned capital into any one trade. If I do this on months with no losses I should have a 10% return for the month. If you have lost it typically wipes out the month and likely a few months wort of profits. \n\nYou can try to roll a trade or something to protect from a loss. I have hard and fast rules. If the short strike touches by the end of any day I close the trade and take the loss.   \n\n\nBack to trade sizing. What I do every month. 25% percent of my profits goes to buying SPY stock for buy and hold. 25% of my profits go into my bank account for hookers and blow :) (mean paying my bills :) ). 50% stays in the broker account to offset draw downs and support future lot size increases. I consider the SPY gains, and dividends as part of my over all gains.

{"title": "AI is The Mother of All Bubbles", "selftext": "We are all here to make money right?  I want money so I can be rich in 10 years and live comfortably. Then leave it to my kids so they will be OK.\n\nSo I care about money today and also what it is worth in 10 years, 20 years so forth.\n\nThat, right there, is the problem with investing in AI.  It can make me rich today and tomorrow.  But in 10 years or less it could render money worthless.  If tech keeps improving exponentially like this, the only things that will have value in the future will be raw materials and robots.  Not investments, portfolios, gains or money itself.\n\nYou could make 20mil on NVIDIA today but wind up no better off.  When money is worthless you can't be rich.  And 20mil is not enough to have your own robot army to hold your own against the tech billionaires and trillionaires.\n\nThink it through long term guys, to you seriously want to invest in the end of money?  Lets get rich off something else so we can atleast enjoy it.\n\nEdit: Some people dont seem to understand what robots are.  When you control vast numbers of robots, that do everything for free, you don't need anyone, for anything.  If you want raw materials you can just take them.  It's feudalism.  So money will be worthless.  There is no value chain in the AI future.  The feudal rulers will take what they want by force using robot warriors.  Simple as that.\n\nEdit 2:  Some people are suggesting that investing in the potential creation of Skynet is a better long-term strategy than divesting from AI??  That will also lead to the extinction of money!!!  And possibly humans but who cares about that.  \n\nI just really love money.  I dunno, I thought you guys would be with me on this...\n\nEdit 3:  Looks like I am not crazy after all, its a massive bubble and it's coming at us faster than ever because the timelines for new tech just get shorter and shorter.  People are starting to see AI it for what it is really is.  The ultimate enemy of money and bringer of crashes.
