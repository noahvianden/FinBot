You guess.  You hope.  You have a dream that what you think or believe actually becomes true.  Unless you are one of Jensen's direct reports, you don't know anything of what his management team is thinking.\n\na) No home grown chip from any CSP has proven to be much of anything except TPU and still to this day it has a relatively small (and rapidly shrinking) footprint and it is limited in performance and functionality compared to GPUs.   This is after Google has spent $Bs on it.  It certainly would have been cheaper for them to have started with GPUs than to build their own DIY chip.\n\nb) There are some irons in the fire at other CSPs (Azure/Meta) to build new chips, but what everyone is learning (like Google and AWS) is that it's a lot harder than anyone conceived when they started funding these programs.    Harder to build chips and deliver software, and support that software.  It's years of development.    How are Inferentia and Trainium doing anyway?  Do you ***know*** anything about those?\n\nc) These big CSPs are paying Nvidia $4500/yr to support the software stacks for these rack and racks of GPUs as was just disclosed on the ER call.  That tells you how important the SW stack is.  All these chips are going to need ground up development and support.\n\nIf the semicustom rumor is true, the reason Nvidia is talking to these guys is about selling IP and know how and compatible software and support.   Listen to Pat Moorehead discuss on his 6/5 podcast.   Beyind that there are only like 1/2 dozen hyperscalers in the world, yet there are a whole lot of down stream customers who will not be spinning their SW stacks to pivot to say an Azure part.   Those guys won't be departing the Nvidia platform ecosystem anytime soon.

Silly guy, that's more like what the koolaide drinkers in AMD information silos believe.  \n\nReal world is a little different.   All these companies are running as fast as they can to develop and deploy their own GenAI systems.  They need Nvidia, they want more GPUs.   A coordinated toppling of Nvidia would be as simple as everyone simultaneously cancelling their orders and never buying again.   It's super simple.

You appear to not understand this market very well.  Software is a huge factor.   These chips aren't interchangeable.   4 $10,000 GPUs aren't the same as one $40,000 GPU especially when there is little software to support the $10,000 GPUs.

If you just look at their revenue origination chart, you'll see that most of the revenue comes from data center.  You could predict the numbers looking at the growth rate from quarter to quarter. Furthermore, the biggest source of their revenue is data center growth which is the area, they're forecasted to see the most competition. The biggest AI datacenter owners, Microsoft with Azure and Amazon with AWS are both either producing or have committed to produce their own in house AI chips. Apple is producing their own chips. That takes away the biggest buyers of potential chips. Now factor in AMD with their new MI300x gpu's at 10k a pop. Significantly cheaper than Nvidia's solution by a minimum of 50%+ plus it's faster. There's just too much competition. 80%+ of the revenue is datacenter and the competition will drive margin down and revenue down.\n\nTLDR: the revenue will plateau and stay flat due to datacenter competition. There's no catalyst for the next revenue spike and companies are starting to show a desire to seek alternatives to Nvidia. Finally lead time for GPU delivers has gone from 8-11 months to 3-4 months but, the growth in revenue for next quarter shows that the reduction of the lead time hasn't lead to a significant increase in the guidance. \n\nRevenue trend: [https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc\\_financials/2024/Q4FY24/Rev\\_by\\_Mkt\\_Qtrly\\_Trend\\_Q424.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2024/Q4FY24/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q424.pdf)\n\nLead Times Source:  \nhttps://wccftech.com/nvidia-drastically-reduces-delivery-times-of-its-ai-gpus-as-supply-chain-witnesses-improvement/", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">I think their growth is plateauing\n\nTheir guide was nothing but positive, from 22.1 to 24B, 10% Q/Q for a $88B company.

Thus the reason Microsoft is designing their own ai chips in house now and have announced they\u2019ll be partnering with Intel to use Intel 18A. I think Nvidia\u2019s data-center growth is going to stall which is where a large percentage of their revenue comes from. \n\nUntil a company delivers a AI product that makes big big money, I don\u2019t see where the next big leap will come from\u2026. As it stands, based on this guidance, I think Nvidia is now over valued and we\u2019re getting into greater fool territory. I sold my shares at 724 last week as I didn\u2019t want anything to do with earnings week. I suspected it was going to dump and it did.

The psychology behind this trade comes down to: NVDA has been priced as if the AI revolution is coming/happening now. Post earnings will show us if traders believe the trade is over (sell) or still has room to run (hold/buy). \n3. Will AI continue to find new ways to integrate into our everyday lives? ChatGPT/generative AI has relatively just recently come into the mainstream so what tools are coming next? Are NVDA chips going to be integral to that tools development? Personally, I say yes. They are clearly the dominant leader in the chip space, and as others commented, the companies buying their chips are building their frameworks around those chips. Thats the benefit of being the first mover in a space. Simply- their chips work, and if a company has invested so much into their framework, and it works. What reason is there to switch and use someone else's chips?\n\nTLDR: 2/23 options are gonna get roasted in both directions with IV crush, but NVDA is just taking a breath before it starts its next leg up.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Ok yeah there will be recession/depression soon.

{"title": "Bearish earnings DD on Etsy", "selftext": "\nEtsy reports earnings tonight after close. I expect them to report bad numbers and have bought puts yesterday. \n\n\n**The marketplace is stagnating and only increasing revenue thanks to higher fees**\n\n\nSince the first quarter of 2022, Etsy has faced declining rates in their Gross Merchandise Sales. In the latest quarter, they managed 3% annual growth, but GMS was still flat compared to Q3 of 2021 \u2013 meaning 0 growth in 2 years.\n\nThey reacted quickly by increasing seller fees in Q2 of 2022, which you can clearly see on the chart led to a bump in their revenue growth rates.\n\n\nWhile there were very public seller protests against the fee increase, Etsy ultimately went through with it, and predictably, all sellers remained on the platform. That\u2019s because Etsy has become the No.1 marketplace for the kinds of goods they sell, so there really wasn\u2019t a good alternative for any of their sellers. Sellers bit the bullet and stayed with the website.\n\n**Competition from TikTok**\n\nEnter TikTok, which has quickly become an extremely viable channel for typical Etsy products. The video format and discovery options on TikTok lend themselves perfectly to products typically sold on Etsy \u2013 you can stumble on a video showing something cute and homemade, and immediately purchase the item through TikTok. Here\u2019s a quote from an Etsy Seller on their Forums from October 29, 2023:\n\n\u201cI don't have a TikTok but I know a few sellers in my category that do and are killing it with sales.  I agree we need something live here on Etsy to compete.\u201d\n\nThe video and live formats on TikTok are simply much more appealing to modern customers compared to Etsy, which essentially works the same way as Amazon.\n\n**Popular Etsy products are increasing in popularity on TikTok**\n\n\nWhile Etsy doesn\u2019t disclose their sales by product category, we can make an educated guess by visiting their \u201cbest selling items\u201d website as well as other websites that make estimates:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/market/best_selling_items\n\nhttps://bloggingwizard.com/best-selling-items-on-etsy/\n\nWithout being able to quantify them, these are some of the best selling product categories on Etsy:\n\nJewelry, beads, pendants, etc.\nPins\nStickers\nBooks\nT-Shirts\n\n\nTikTok has offered these creators amazing terms by taking only a 2% commission on each sale (compared to 6.5% at Etsy) and paying for discounts on the products.\n\nThe screenshots show how search interest on TikTok has developed for some popular hashtags related to these product categories in the USA (all screenshots show global search interest over the past 3 years). \n\nAnother sign of TikTok\u2019s increasing popularity in this space is that they will be increasing their own fees on sales soon, to 6% per sale by April 1 and 8% by July 1 (which would be even higher than Etsy\u2019s fees). TikTok\u2019s parent company Bytedance is highly profitable, so it stands to reason that this move is not made out of desperation, but because they feel like they have taken a large amount of market share in this space. (https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-shop-hikes-seller-fees-axes-subsidies)\n\nThe total market for these sorts of custom goods is quite limited and, in my opinion, not growing that quickly overall. My assumption is that any sale made on TikTok for these goods is a sale that Etsy is losing, and this seems to be supported by data.\n\n**Etsy Metrics are declining**\n\n\nWhile Etsy continued to be a popular holiday destination for shoppers, their iphone download rank has plummeted in the new year compared to Q1 of 2023.\n\n\nWebsite hits for Etsy.com decreased by 5-7% y-o-y in the past 3 months as per Similarweb (unfortunately I cannot show the data since I wrote down last years website views by hand, and Similarweb only shows the past 3 months to free users). \n\n**Risks**\n\nA well known activist investor recently took a large stake in Etsy. There\u2019s a risk that they could announce shareholder friendly steps during the earnings call, such as stock buybacks, divestitures, etc. Since the stake was only announced at the beginning of February 2024, I think the likelihood of concrete actions being announced is however low \n\n**My position**\n\nStrike 70 puts expiring this week. As always you can go closer to the current stock price to minimize your risk. IV on Etsy is not particular high, with a 5.1% implied move in either direction.", "id": "1awaoud", "created_utc": 1708517927.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/nq0wkibb01kc1.jpeg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=073818c7ba114e348ad6fba5c9738f14a882021b\n\nWish me luck.
