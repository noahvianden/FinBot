{"title": "URA/CCJ is way undervalued atm imo", "selftext": "URA is currently experiencing a downswing because CCJ is experiencing a down swing, it is not going to last for much longer.\n\nNuclear sector companies are about to see a golden age like never before. Everybody wants to stop climate change but solar, wind, and hydro are not effective enough to do so. People are also now realizing that Nuclear is debateably the safest of all the energy sources, especially if you measure it by number of casualties per kilowatt.\n\nI worked in the nuclear field for some time and have a very good understanding of nuclear physics, and can tell you with 100% certainty that the \"dangers\" of nuclear power are all either overblown or outdated. Modern reactors are nothing like the reactor at chernobyl. \n\nPeople may want to mention fukushima, however fukushima is an example of how safe last gen nuclear plants were. They faced an incredible fight with a massive earth quake and a tsunami that made it over the sea wall which was there to protect from tsunamis, they went through flooding equipment issues and through all of it they kept the plant and the surrounding area safe.\n\nYou may want to say that \"they had to evacuate the surrounding town and radiation levels are higher\" I'm here to tell you that its just fearmongering by the news, the approved exposure rates are so small its absurd. You are far more likely to experience the effects of radiation by going to the beach on a sunny day, or by taking a lot of flights than you are by living your entire life outside of fukushima or three mile island.\n\nNuclear plant workers actually experience less radiation than the average person. Smoking, taking flights, spending time in the sun, etc all increase your exposure rate significantly.\n\n\n\nNuclear power is the future and this is the start, we have finally left the age of ignorance. With the new gen 4 reactors, and Small modular reactors being approved we have the safest, cleanest, and most sustainable energy source at our fingertips. The US government has also actively decided to invest in nuclear power again.\n\nRisk and fear have caused the nuclear sector stocks and etfs to suffer but this year is a big year for nuclear, westinghouse is finished with its latest gen reactor and it is set join the grid in 2nd quarter.\n\nURA is currently kangarooing which means big money for anyone who knows that it will be ending up and the option prices are extremely cheap for how much you can make off of them. I personally believe that URA will jump probably to 30 this week at least for a bit and jump to a high of 34-35 by march 15th.\n\nThe AI bubble will pop but the nuclear bubble hasn't inflated yet get in while you can.

Solar panels require huge amounts of space, are only useful at certain times of day and year, and produce a fuck ton of waste when they need to be replaced. Wind plants are only useful during certain weather conditions and are incrediblg vulnerable to storms.

Nuclear was always a small fraction. Renewables have been more then nuclear ever was by 2022 and the expansion of renewables increased significantly in the last two years which are not shown in the graph above. In 2023, >50% were generated by renewables which is about twice as much as peak nuclear energy production\n\n> Your plants were already built and working.\n\nThey were build in 1980 and have not been maintained for at least a decade if not more. Even pre Fukushima, Germany has been depowering nulcear e.g. in 2003, 2006 and 2010 but obviously Fukushima (2011) kind of finalized it. The german reactors were made by with old technology.  Yes, seeing how high the share in coal is, it doesnt make sense from a CO2 standpoint. But CO2 never was the reason for shutting down nuclear. \n\nSimply the fact that energy prices are pre Ukraine war again shows that the discussion about energy prices is irrational. \n\nIt is much more significant that the german government is not allowed to take debt to stimulate the economy without a 66% vote. This is completely contrary to any fiscal policy principle where basically everyone says to spent in a downturn.

I assume you just haven't actually looked into the history so let me fill you in. \n\nYour graph literally illustrates my point. Nucelar was doing what it was supposed to up until Gerhard Schroder showed up. The reason the share of nuclear kept going down was not because solar and wind are some life saving measure, it is because you guys stopped expanding and actually started closing plants. The leader of that was the aforementioned, Gerhard Schroeder. During that same time he heavily pushed bringing in Russian gas to power the country. What did Schroder do after he left the German government? Oh yeah he went and became the chairman for Nord Stream 1 and then did the same for Nord Stream 2. He also joined the board of Rosneft (Russian oil company) and then Gazprom (Russian gas company who owns those two pipelines). He sold you a lie so he could personally profit. Energy consumption came down in Germany last year due to having to reduce manufacturing capabilities with an unstable grid. Here is your country \"moving towards renewables\": https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-05/germany-paves-way-for-major-expansion-of-gas-fired-power-plants \n\nYou see the spikes and uptrends in oil, gas and coal as it gets closer to 2022? You are making up the baseload power lost by non-CO2 emitting nuclear with CO2 emitting sources because renewables are intermittent. Renewables are good for supplementation. But they cannot and will not be able to power an economy. It is a fallacy. The world has spent trillions on renewables and has barely made a dent on fossil fuels. It is an expensive way to destabilize the grid. \n\nThe vast majority of nuclear's costs come in building the plant. Your plants that were shut down in 202 could have operated at least 20 more years, if not more. Plants around the world that are just as old as Germany's plants are being extended for decades to come. If nuclear is such a dud, then why is China building nuclear plants like crazy? They have 55 running now, 22 under construction and another 70 planned. Why is Japan turning back on all of their plants and looking to build more even after Fukashima? Korea, France, Finland, UK, Taiwan, US, Belgium, Ukraine, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey are just some of the countries building new nuclear plants or extending the lifespans for old ones. The long and the short of it is that if nuclear power was discovered today, people would hail it as a savior.
