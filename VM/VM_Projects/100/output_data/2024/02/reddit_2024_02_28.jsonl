That means the layoffs may affect about 670 jobs.\n\nThe company\u2019s announcement marks the latest headcount reduction among video game developers in recent months, continuing a broader trend of significant downsizing across the tech industry. \n\nOn Tuesday, Sony said it would lay off about 900 employees in its PlayStation division, or 8% of its workforce. Last month, Microsoft cut 1,900 jobs across its gaming unit three months after it acquired Activision Blizzard, and Tencent\u2019s Riot Games slashed 11% of its workforce.\n\nEA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a memo to employees on Wednesday that the video game company is \u201cstreamlining our company operations to deliver deeper, more connected experiences for fans everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe cuts will support EA\u2019s \u201cstrategic priorities and growth initiatives,\u201d according to a Wednesday filing with the SEC. The company expects its restructuring plan will be \u201csubstantially complete\u201d by the end of December.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing to optimize our global real estate footprint to best support our business,\u201d Wilson wrote in his Wednesday note. \u201cWe are also sunsetting games and moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.\u201d\n\nWilson added that the cuts will enable EA to focus more on its \u201cbiggest opportunities \u2014 including our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities.\u201d \n\nDuring the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call last month, Wilson said the company would focus on continuing to invest in its existing gaming franchises attracting large online audiences, including Apex Legends, Battlefield, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and The Sims.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/ea-layoffs-company-to-cut-5percent-of-workforce-or-about-670-employees.html", "id": "1b2knaw", "created_utc": 1709161853.0, "score": 636, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty overvalued stock and I guess you don't need so many employees when you just reskin the same game every year and make all your money selling FIFA packs.", "score": 329, "replies": [{"body": "Now AI will reskin them.", "score": 41, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1075354516506195}, {"body": "Does anyone knows what are the revenues they are getting from selling those fifa packs", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "a lot of money", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Any number you can share", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11795681715011597}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38033074140548706}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5770291686058044}, {"body": "And AI", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nope, they over hired.
