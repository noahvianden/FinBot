Apple says that OSX can only be used on Apple hardware. People can and do build machines that run OSX. Apple used to sell OSX separately, and if people bought their copy of OSX, there was actually nothing Apple could do if someone bought a copy of OSX and installed it on a non-apple machine.\n\nNow, Apple gives OSX away for free for Macs, there is no option to buy it separately. In effect, every copy of OSX is licensed for a specific Mac, so installing it on a non-mac would mean making a copy of OSX, which would violate copyright.

But only a year later and I already know a lot more than I ever did, and actually getting positive, albeit modest returns on my money and growing both my savings and investment capital. I never thought I'd be in that position but it actually turned out to be easier than I thought. \n\nI get the opinion that the market is rigged, it's not, but it's definitely not egalitarian. Ultimately the big fish can afford more losses and they can throw their weight around and cause market movements that simple retail investors can't do. \"The market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent\" and all that. It is ultimately, if you think about it, a zero sum game. Every win is an equal loss from someone else and vice versa. Ultimately the longer you stay in it the higher the chances you'll eventually come back to zero from where you started. But that doesn't mean someone can't benefit from it. A lot of people on here make insane wins only to lose them because they put them all back into the game. We do not live forever and splitting wins into savings and reinvesting the remains can generate positive overall profit as long as you don't get too greedy. Before you discount yourself as \"incapable\" of understanding, try it out.  I have been trading for a year and a half and I'm absolutely not a savant or making insane gains like people on here but getting an average 10-15% growth on my yearly income is objectively something that wasn't that hard nor something I can complain about. I am also fully cognizant that these kinds of returns are not guaranteed to continue in the future, but my point is that even simple things can generate benefits.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5309903025627136}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48391658067703247}], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Lisa decided to bless \ud83d\ude4c him at exactly the right time... \u2705\ufe0f", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02951662614941597}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30906984210014343}, {"body": "Who decides after just based on sample 10 mins of 5 mins Candle at the open, example SMCI yesterday open 5 mins of candle was bullish.

For example, the capitalization of all public companies in Germany is $2.3 trillion, France - $3.2 trillion, Italy - $0.8 trillion, Spain - $0.65 trillion, UK - $3.3 trillion, Russia - $0.65 trillion.\n\nNvidia, having created almost 1.5 trillion in capitalization since the beginning of 2023, has shown the fastest and most massive increase in value in the history of the global financial system. The stock has grown 200 times in 10 years!\n\nNo stock in the history of trading has had an accumulated trading volume of over $700 billion in a month by its own calculations.\n\nNo company has ever formed an industry trend of similar strength, bringing all related companies together in a frenzied and frenzied rally. Nvidia is the trigger, followed by all the others.\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia since February 19 has led to a cascading collapse of overheated stocks in a tech sector awash in AI hype.\n\nNo company has burned through as much as 1/4 of the US national savings to sustain the insane bubble.\n\nThe US market is eating Nvidia and all the other companies.\n\nThe closing of positions in Nvidia by the first wave of speculators from October 2023 - organized a rally in cryptocurrencies (selling profitable positions in Nvidia and moving hot money into crypto), the second limited wave went from February 7.\n\nAbout 500 million bucks of daily financial flow into Bitcoin-related ETFs is money mostly taken out of Nvidia by those selling the bubble to a new wave of waits in perpetual growth.\n\nThere are two icons in the US market right now - Jensen Huang (Nvidia) or better known as \"black leather jacket\" and Sam Altman (OpenAI). All other infodumps and events are so insignificant and insignificant that they are unable to influence the market. The Fed together with Powell's speeches are declassified to children's amateur performance in the provincial theater, and nobody is interested in boring macrostatistics anymore.\n\nThe concentration of idiocy is so high that in order to maintain the Nvidia bubble, since the end of January they started to take cache from other stocks (most companies outside the technology sector went into a downward drift). Now the entire market, the entire financial system is working in the interests of Nvidia and a dozen other hypo-absorbers of AI.\n\nNvidia has created the strongest rally in the history of mankind with 10 trillion since the beginning of 2023 (major spurt since November), 1.5 trillion of which is sitting in Nvidia itself, it is Nvidia that will bury this idiocy.\n\nNvidia reported results that are expectedly strong, but don't justify the advance in the context of a capitalization run-up. A very detailed analysis of US company reporting will be given in March.\n\nNvidia is now generating 22 bln in revenue and 12 bln in net income per quarter, meaning it is well on its way to a potential of up to 100 bln in revenue and 50 bln in profit for the year (the actual 12 months are 61 bln and 29.8 bln respectively).\n\nHowever, even with these results (they still need to be realized), the current valuation is about 3.5 times higher than the industry average.\n\nIn order for Nvidia's 1.8 trillion capitalization to reach the historical average for its segment, it would need to show about 350-400 billion in revenue and 100-120 billion in profit, which is obviously impossible - there are not that many consumers of AI products.\n\nThe fact that with what fierceness the market eats up any mention of AI indicates both insanity and deep insanity (similar things were already seen in the late 90s, but on a smaller scale).
