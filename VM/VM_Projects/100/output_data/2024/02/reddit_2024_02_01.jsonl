{"title": "Two Big Differences Between AMD & NVDA", "selftext": "I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.\n\nObviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research. \n\nThe first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes. \n\nSpeaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA. \n\nI've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.", "id": "1afxwfr", "created_utc": 1706748347.0, "score": 217, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 364, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty stupid when NVDA ceo is paid mostly in stock options which is worth hundreds of millions.\n\nEDIT: ok looked it, his salary is 95% from bonuses and stock options.

This is compared to 3.35 T/s of H100. mi300x is a much more powerful solution.

See CUDA vs opencl.\n\nWe're talking about networking. Open Standards are the king in networking. And even CUDA was only really relevant when this was a small market. You will see CUDA disappear as we advance further. \n\nMeta's Pytorch 2 is replacing CUDA with OpenAI's Triton for instance, and Microsoft and OpenAI are using Triton as well.\n\nNvidia purposely neglected OpenCL in order to build a vendor lock in. But there is too much momentum now for CUDA's exclusivity to survive.\n\n> I don't disagree, but the role of CPUs in ML workloads is not very important, system integration is everything. Curious where you're getting efficiency numbers from though. For high performance workloads Nvidias strategy is to rewrite in CUDA (with limited success thus far).\n\nML workloads aren't just inference. Recommender systems built on AI use something called RAG. Which leverages Vector databases. And those run on CPUs. This is where Zen architecture excels. Because it has the state of the art throughput per watt.

Hard to see the future but I was convinced model size was done scaling in 2017, obviously I was wrong.\n\nYes, they split the model across multiple GPUs. But GPUs don't train on data in another GPU's pool of memory. You're right though fast interconnects are important though because the GPUs do communicate. \n\n> Why did apple and AMD neglect it though? Nvidia was the only company that cared and are seeing dividends from this today. This field has been my life and I cannot state enough how frustrating parallel computing has been for the last decade. \n\nThere was really no market for it. Apple doesn't make datacenter products, and when this stuff was starting to take off, AMD was struggling financially, and they concentrated on saving the company by concentrating on CPUs. AMD was actually pretty strong in GPGPU early on, but they had to scale back their R&D. \n\nEven today AMD would have been woefully behind if the new leadership didn't with great foresight bid on the government contracts for Frontier and El Capitan. It's literally what funded the mi250 and mi300 programs. Not organic AI demand. Which only exploded a year ago.\n\n> And you're right, not all ML workloads are deep learning nor embarrassingly parallel. But that's not the money maker, Nvidia has been trying to make money off other applications for a long time and DL was the first use case that really made sense. What has been working for Nvidia is convincing more traditional f500 companies that they can move their datacenter budgets to GPUs and Nvidia will help rewrite apps to run on GPUs (see Nvidias takeover in biotech, for example). Grace and Intel/amd datacenter CPU's have completely different purposes.\n\nRight now we're seeing a lot of demand for training. But as this stuff gets deployed, Inference will start to overtake training workloads. Think in mid-term we will probably see like a 40%:60% training inference split.\n\nAnd yes you can replace some compute heavy CPU scientific workloads and move them to GPU. But a lot of software still runs best on CPUs. There is a bit of a gold rush for GPUs since the LLM breakthrough, so right now everyone is trying to get GPUs for training.

GPU interconnect is king. Id be surprised if amd isn't working on a solution for this. I suspect their focus on inference is just playing to their current strengths. \n\nI think it's both. Also the key to being able to scale this stuff is RDMA support. Basically non CPU bound Remote Direct Memory Access. Where each GPU node can be directed on how to route communications by some central switch or algorithm. \n\nThis is basically what Broadcom announced. Their Ethernet based switches will be able to link remote AMD GPUs to talk point to point over Infinity Fabric.\n\n> That's what made Nvidias gamble so crazy too.. there was no market for it, until there was. And amd GPGPU was dog shit at the time, I used it. Or tried to rather, half the instructions didn't work and performance was well below theoretical perf. Ended up on GTX 980s because it was so much easier, and in those days it was still a pain to get CUDA going on Linux (fortunately they fixed this about 7 years ago).\n\nNvidia was smart here, I have to give them credit. They funded the universities, and this generated enough demand to fund this part of the business. And it grew from there.\n\nMeanwhile AMD was busy scrambling to save the company by investing in the CPU business by cutting GPU research. AMD too did the right thing, because they knew Intel was vulnerable, and this did save the company. They also invested in the chiplet research, which lifts all boats, including datacenter GPUs.\n\n> no one knows how this will play out- people have been saying this for a long time now. There hasn't been signs of model development slowing down. I think what's more likely is we see a move away from transformers and into something less memory hungry. 6 years ago it was kind of crazy to think a model needed even 40GB of memory.\n\nYes there is Mamba for instance, which is supposed to be a bit more memory efficient, but the jury is still out whether it is better than Transformers.\n\nHowever I do think existing models are good enough for wider adoption. There will no doubt continue to evolve, but there is a huge rush to implement this technology. Companies won't just burn cash by training, they need to generate revenues. And LLMs are good enough for a lot of use cases already. Thing is the LLM inference takes a lot of compute. Hence why the market is exploding.\n\nLisa predicts $400B TAM for 2027. And that's just accelerators. Not CPUs, servers and networking gear. Lisa also isn't a type to over hype things.\n\n> The fun part for AMD/NVDA is model performance has scaled with GPU perf, just like gaming. I'm not so sure it will switch back to CPUs and I don't think either company will mind.\n\nTransformers do exacerbate what we call the Von Neumann bottleneck in GPUs. Where memory has to be accessed through the memory bus, instead of being distributed near compute (or compute being distributed next to memory, something Samsung is experimenting with). \n\nBut the big advantage GPUs have is their programmability. Like you implied, this stuff is evolving rapidly, and even though GPUs are not as efficient as some ASICs would be. Their flexibility and programmability more than makes up for it.\n\nEither way, whether you are invested in NVDA or AMD, these are exciting times to hold these stocks.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda", "intc", "amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.029707957059144974}], "tickers": ["nvda", "intc", "amd", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0024300517980009317}], "tickers": ["meta", "nvda", "amd", "msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.009134151972830296}], "tickers": ["amd", "intc", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.031485699117183685}], "tickers": ["nvda", "amzn", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Mellanox is also what I am wondering... with it replace traditional ethernet switching in datacenter?

Currently Nvidia has many more years of software development and support for their Hardware. However since AMD has open source software I'm betting that there will be more adoption if their Hardware is good and cheaper than NVIDIA. \nThe biggest limiting factor going forward is the power a chip can consume. Thermals become an issue as well as generally just powering the chips. Alot of the performance of a chip for a given size of silicon comes down to the density of the logic and SRAM transistors.\nSmaller transistors allow for greater efficiencies since they require less voltage to operate when compared to larger ones and they also allow for less parasitic when switching. Remember that capacitance is directly correlated to area, so a smaller capacitor has less capacitance. Capacitance limits the switching frequency of the IC and is a partial reason for the energy usage of an IC. \nThis is why intel isn\u2019t competitive in terms of power when compared to AMD cpus. In gamers nexus\u2019s review the 14900k draws about twice the power as the 7950x while providing a similar performance. Intel\u2019s 10nm node is showing its age and so they physically cannot improve their designs without either shrinking the node or increasing the die size. Currently the The 14900k has a die size of 257 mm\u00b2 and a zen 4 ccd has a die size of 70mm2. While not directly a fair comparison (since im ignoring the io die) AMD is able to provide the same performance as the intel cpu while using half the power and almost half the die area due to the process node advantage. \nWhy does this matter? Transistor scaling is slowing down significantly since we are reaching the limits of nature. If we look at the process node densities for nvidas gpus we can see that ampere had 44.56 million transistors per mm2 on Samsung 8, and 143.7 million transistors per mm2 on tsmc 4. However tsmc 3 only has a density of 173.1 million transistors per mm2. Furthermore SRAM, which is a significant portion of logic circuits on a CPU/GPU, is slowing down significantly. Tsmcs n3 node only provides 5% downwards scaling on SRAM when compared to TSMC 5. \nAs transistors slowdown in scaling downwards new packaging technology is required for Moore's law to continue. AMD is the only company who has years of experience designing chips around these packaging technologies and what they have created is incredible for how modular everything is. Smaller dies allow for better yields, they allow for them to use cheaper older nodes for the SRAM cells as seen in the x3d products. This is why hardware wise AMD currently is superior to NVIDIA.

Obviously, this wont hold unless earnings skyrocket across the board but it make keep climbing a while longer, because thats how bubbles happen.\n\nWingstop is a decent business. They take cheap cuts of chicken and turn them into something fat slobs love. Nothing wrong with that. I get the itch for buffalo sauced wings once per year. Their business is growing rapidly for a restaurant but as you point out, there are many reasons to not invest and I agree.\n\nI havent touched it for a few reasons and I probably never will even though its been on my radar for well over a decade. I dont like that they have no competitive advantages. I dont like that they are fast food but only dine in/take out and no drive through. I dont like franchisees at all. They tend to cut corners all the time and you have to spend tons to police them. Further, once automation goes full steam, you will regret sharing your profits with franchisees. See whats happening to the auto industry. They would give near anything to get rid of all their dealerships but they cant due to contract. When we have robots who can do 99% of the work, these restaurants will regret franchising.\n\nI am also shocked that people are eating so much of this cuisine in terms of health. Its just about worst food anyone can eat, right there with fried chicken and fries. Its horribly unhealthy and add in the ranch and other sauces and I just dont get why people hate their bodies so much (lol). But here we are.\n\nJust as a fyi, a wing is usually about 100cals and has about 7 or 8 grams of fat... well 1g of fat is 9cal... so even if we assume 7, that 63 of the 100 calories from fat.
