{"title": "Sony cuts PlayStation 5 sales forecast to 21 million units after posting record revenue", "selftext": "Sony cut its sales forecast for its flagship PlayStation 5 console on Wednesday, after warning of weaker transactions in its key gaming division.\n\nThe Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 21 million units of the PS5 in the fiscal year ending March, down from a previous forecast of 25 million units.\n\nThe cut in outlook comes after Sony posted record quarterly revenue in the all-important December quarter which encompasses the holiday season. Sony sold 8.2 million units of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in its fiscal third quarter, which runs from October to December. Sony has sold 16.4 million PS5 units so far in its fiscal year.\n\nSony also trimmed its fiscal year sales forecast for the gaming division by 210 billion yen to 4.15 trillion yen, saying it expects a decrease in sales of hardware.\n\nThe company\u2019s challenge now lies in trying to keep up momentum for the PS5, which was released more than three years ago. In October, Sony made available a refreshed version of the console with better specs.\n\nRival Nintendo has been grappling with a similar issue, managing to keep interest in its near seven-year old Switch console thanks to new game releases and movies associated with its famous characters, like Super Mario.\n\nSales at Sony\u2019s gaming business rose 16% year-on-year to 1.4 trillion yen in the December quarter, the company said on Wednesday. However, operating profit fell 26% in the division, due to increase losses from hardware due to promotions in the period as well as a decline in sales of first-party games.\n\nSony also lowered its sales forecast for the entire company to 12.3 trillion yen from 12.4 trillion yen for the fiscal year.\n\nSony beat analyst expectations by a wide margin in its fiscal third quarter when it reported results on Wednesday.\n\nHere\u2019s how Sony did in the December quarter versus LSEG consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: 3.75 trillion Japanese yen ($24.9 billion) versus 3.58 trillion yen expected\n\nOperating profit: 463.3 billion yen versus 428.4 billion yen expected\n\nSony said that it will partially spin off its financial services business via a public listing. The company plans to distribute slightly more than 80% of its shares of Sony Financial Group through dividends in kind as a result of the spinoff, in a listing due to take place in October 2025.\n\nSony\u2019s financial services unit saw revenue in the December quarter rise more than 1,100% to 311.7 billion yen. The company said this was thanks to a rise in sales at its insurance business.\n\nSony also reported a 21% jump in sales in its image sensor business, which it sells to companies like Apple for smartphones.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony in January scrapped a planned merger with Indian firm Zee Entertainment. The deal, which was negotiated for more than two years, was seen as a way for Sony to get a foot into the lucrative Indian entertainment market.\n\nHiroki Totoki, Sony\u2019s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that India has \u201cgreat growth potential,\u201d adding that the company will \u201cseek various opportunities\u201d in the country and will look into plans to \u201creplace\u201d the failed merger with Zee.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/sony-posts-record-quarterly-revenue-on-playstation-sales-boost.html", "id": "1aqlc02", "created_utc": 1707912335.0, "score": 467, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "In the good old days, companies used to lower prices to increase sales.  \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "score": 287, "replies": [{"body": "I was in Canada and it was cheaper to buy a PS4 on release day than to wait a few years.\u00a0", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Same with the PS5 & XSX.

We didn't have these insane up-days, where the market jumps 0.5% in the last hour of the day, 3 days a week.

However, in the second half of Jan, the rally actually accelerated into where we are now. There's no actual underlying fundamental or macro economic data to substantiate that acceleration - its just fanboy hysteria. The indices are getting very frothy. If you look at the bond markets, and even the currencies, its signaling a very different picture. \n\nWhat does that mean for thetagangers? You can't sell volatility, you can't short anything, for reasons I described in my comment. You can buy the top like a fool (sell puts on nasdaq stocks) and have another good few months before getting wrecked when volatility expands, or get wrecked now, shorting an explosive market (insane). Not great options. Most are opting to sell puts like idiots, I imagine.\n\nMeanwhile, volume is thinning out and its creating destabilizing price action. That is not to say its a top. It could take months for a top to form. I'm not saying its going to crash either. We're only about 4% off the highs from 2022, which is a pretty poor 2-year return.
