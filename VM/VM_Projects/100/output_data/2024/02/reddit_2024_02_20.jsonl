I do remember this being talked about periodically with less enthusiasm as COVID was propped up to create a similarly manic cycle, but with even greater effect.\n\n2) the dot-com bubble wasn't recognized as having burst until after 9/11 when the attacks were used as a pretext for undeclared war as well as distracting from the stock market tanking. It was an unprecedented attack on American soil that had about 60 years of history between. This closed the exchanges for 4 days.\n\nThe stock exchange closed for a record ~5 months for WW1 which was prior to the great depression.\n\nRight now while the markets are open, there are ways for people to manipulate them to keep propping them up and therefore the likelihood of them either being completely shut down to halt trading, or scaring Americans in a stunned fashion with no easily digestible buying direction would require unparalleled numbers of events to occur. However, this is likely what it would require to snap people out of it enough to force a correction because of how insane the controlling interests are of our financial system.\n\nThe grasping at bear-like straws in this sub lately is a signal that people are realizing even the highest of ridiculous high hopes and fake stories of people creating major gains are not enough to outpace all the other factors like inflation, job losses, and general malaise.
