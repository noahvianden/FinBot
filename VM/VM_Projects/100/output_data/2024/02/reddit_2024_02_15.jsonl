{"title": "$NVDA to $1500 via Gains, Trains, and AI-mobiles.", "selftext": "***Degenerates and regards,***\n\nIf you think its too late, its not. Everyone wants to see the stock plummet so their logical, \"Its too high, overvalued, definitely going down\" thought process can be validated. I can promise you one thing, nothing about this will ever make sense and everyone will reference this post 3 months from now. Bulls want hopium, Bears need copium, and Wall street bets is Dopium.\n\nBuckle up, because I'm about to re-iterate  some truths about NVDA that'll make your dopamine receptors light up like a Christmas tree.  NVDA is destined to hit $1500, pre-split. Ignore current prices, ignore ratios, ignore the media, and listen:\n\n1. **The AI Revolution (Obviously):**\u00a0NVDA is at the forefront of AI, by sheer luck. As our world becomes more intertwined with AI, Nvidia's dominance in providing chips and stuff for AI processing will be undeniable.\n2. **Data Center Dominance:**\u00a0NVDA's data center segment is ready to explode. Demand for cloud computing and data processing is up, Nvidia has data centers filling a need in the market.\n3. **Gaming Galore:**\u00a0Let's not forget about the gaming sector. NVDA's GPUs are known worldwide. As gaming continues to evolve and expand, Nvidia will continue to shine. Potentially aided Apple in the push to the virtual reality frontier.\n4. **Autonomous Vehicles:**\u00a0Imagine Nvidia in cars, and self driving technology. Its already advanced but there is plenty of room to grow.\n5. **Rising Revenue:**\u00a0Revenue growth speaks for itself. With consistent revenue increases year over year, Nvidia can thrive in any market.\n6. **Profitability Powerhouse:**\u00a0Not only is Nvidia growing its revenue, but it's also raking in the profits. With impressive profit margins and a solid financial foundation, not to mention the stakes Nvidia holds in other companies which will profit in this AI boom. Think $SOUN, $RXRX.\n7. **Innovation Incarnate:**\u00a0Nvidia's commitment to innovation is unparalleled. From cutting-edge GPU architectures to breakthroughs in AI research, Nvidia is  pushing the boundaries of what's possible in technology. Look it up, and see how far we've come in such a short time.\n8. **Market Dominance:**\u00a0Market dominance is undeniable.\n9. **Economic Expansion:**\u00a0As the global economy rebounds from recent challenges, obviously NVDA stands to benefit. With increased business activity and investment in technology infrastructure, its tendy town.\n10. **The Wisdom of the Autists:**\u00a0And finally, let's not discount the wisdom of the autists on Wallstreetbets. With their unparalleled ability to sniff out tendies from miles away, the collective intelligence (sarcasm here) of the WSB community is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nToo much hopium? Here is what could go wrong.  \n**Supply Chain Disruptions, Regulatory Issues (Pelosi wants to make money), Competition Intensification, Macroeconomic Factors (ie. the Crash Bears are praying for), and Technological Shifts (tech and companies come out of the woodwork all the time)**\n\nYou've heard this all before. But know this, NVDA isn't just a stock; it's a ticket to tendie town. Hedge funds, fellow WSB enthusiasts, and normal folk alike all want to be apart of this already meteoric rise . \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15 Don't miss out on the single greatest investment since BTC.\n\nNever learned how to read? Me either, Here's all you need to know. NVDA is undervalued and overvalued. People will tell you its going up and its going down. Bears, Bulls,  Battlestar Galactica. None of this matters.\n\nTLDR; NVDA has no reason to go down. No one wants to miss out.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. I'm just a smooth-brained ape with a keyboard. Do your own damn due diligence. Why believe me?\n\n", "id": "1arinsu", "created_utc": 1708012592.0, "score": 166, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|65|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like people dont understand how this works lol.
