NIO has proved the concept, but hasn't proved the concept viability for making money.\n\n-The stations are expensive and look like they'd need constant maintenance, and that's with them only needing to support their own cars. I'd estimate scaled-up manufacture of these to still cost around 500k each including the price of the land they're on, with probably 2k/month operating expenses in addition to the electricity used. It's difficult to find a price for a supercharger, but I'm going to guess about 50, with little to no operating expenses or downtime due to lack of moving parts. \n\n- big problem that I don't see mentioned much are the inevitable lines that will form when multiple cars show up to swap their batteries at the same time. 5 minutes sounds great but if you're waiting around for 3 other cars to get their battery before you, you're back to 20 minutes and just wanting to use a charger. Adding capacity for more cars alleviates this but now you're paying for ANOTHER one of these (see cost above)\n\n-charging will only get faster. Cell phones used to charge at about 2.5 watts over USB and would easily take all night. Current iPhone is 25 watts, and is the slowest in the entire industry. Some of the new phones are charging at >100w. I think in the time it would take to see widespread adoption of swappable batteries, charging speeds will be high enough to obsolete them.\n\n-ask most EV owners and they'll tell you that range is not that big a deal on long trips. Very few people want to do a long drive without a decent break.\n\nThe only real selling point i see for battery swap stations are people in the city that park on the street, don't take public transportation, have a long commute, and can't readily charge their car overnight or at work. I don't want to discount that market but I don't think it's big enough  to force a paradigm shift toward automated, swappable battery systems for the consumer market. I suppose it's a little better on battery life and grid demand as well.\n\nThat being said the cost to replace the battery in current fleet of EVs is outrageous and SHOULD be made more cost-effective to replace. If this comes with the added bonus of enabling these types of stations, no complaints here, but I don't think NIO's tech is going to be a game changer, and I predict it will be phased out soon. \n\nMore than willing to eat my words if I'm wrong, RemindMe! 5 years", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 5 years on [**2029-01-03 08:41:53 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2029-01-03%2008:41:53%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18wu3wg/elon_vs_the_chinese_ev_makers/kg3pvfp/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fstocks%2Fcomments%2F18wu3wg%2Felon_vs_the_chinese_ev_makers%2Fkg3pvfp%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202029-01-03%2008%3A41%3A53%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%2018wu3wg)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22282443940639496}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3274160325527191}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4015771150588989}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5195339322090149}, {"body": "Thank you, one of the few in this thread making sense.
