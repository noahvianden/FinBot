Its ror or return on risk. So you go to the trade screen and on the option chain there is layout.Click on lay out and customize then you can setup the categories. I personally use last, net change, delta, vega, theta, imp vol, return on risk, prob itm, open interest, volume.So far the trade plan is working fine. I stay around 25% prob itm or so with good open interest and vol. I try to stay within the 1% a week plan. For the 80% or closing early you just have to calculate what your daily rate is on your trade and if you have got more than the remaining days  its time to close you are wasting time. Don't think things can't change on you.Also don't freak out if the stock drops and you get assigned and you are negative. It is a paper loss and means nothing. You have a working asset that is making you premium. i personally have  in the monitor tap sections and stick the share position in it and don't look at it.then have sections for the puts and calls separate. Make sure your strike is above your trade price when selling a call and just sit back and enjoy the trade. I have had a stock drop a good amount twice > 30% of the trade price. i just followed the plan and continued to pull in premiums. I did have to watch for it jumping up and roll the strike higher a few times but all good.This has been the most profitable and least stressful way of trading I have found and can be used on a small account also. I would suggest having at least 3k to start.Then first look for stocks that have the volume and open interest. it does no good to trade on a option you cant get in and out of.After you find stocks with good options start sorting them by stock price and then look into the companies. After that have your favorite list. then get your watch list setup on the side and load your list.I have symbol, description, impl vol, last. then list by the impl with the highest first. this will give you the best high iv options.After my trade is set I usually don't look at it too much except maybe at lunch on my phone. i do all my research on the weekends and after hours.

On it I would be looking at longer options and further out on the strike with just a small amount of delta so you won't be as affected. Or just wait it out. You are pulling a lot of profit with just the stock movement. Wait for it to settle and either dead down or side ways  then get into options on it. \n\nOn the COIN. You had the strike above a solid resistance point and then another one around your strike which is all good. Looks to be pulling bock which is good for your option. A suggestion on using the charting try out ttm squeeze. It helps me find the momentum on a stock.\n\nI would not suggest  the wheel if you are fully against loosing your stock. But it is great for additional incomes on your stocks in addition to dividends on stocks you hold. It does have a draw back of limiting your potential profits in a situation of a stock up. I have been caught in a couple. Its just one of those things you have to deal with. I have found that on the whole the wheel is a very profitable way to trade. \n\n You do have to change your thinking on if a stock has fallen and may be negative. You need to be in good stocks with value.  Remember that this is a working asset. Your main focus is income. If it stayed down 15% for 6 months trading side ways but was pulling in .5% a week in income is it a bad stock or good? Not to mention if a favorite stock was down and you are able to buy more and better your position and allowing you to sell more call options or sell more put options at a good strike price. All are good. Then the stock rises and you are riding that also.
