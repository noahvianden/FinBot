Unclear how many use this kind of dummy panel door.  \n\n(Yes, I'm aware it's officially called a plug door, but that name has been misunderstood by people who, understandably, think of the normal kind of doors that are too large to swing through their frame and thus would act like a cork/plug in a pressure differential situation.)\n\nThis configuration would be better called a dummy door panel since that's basically what it is.  It's basically an outside door that sits on 4 pins and has a hinge designed only to tilt it back slightly for inspection and maintenance.  It doesn't have any \"plug\" type functionality. \n\nFor those interested, this dummy door panel/plug door has no handle or pressure release.

Two large pins on the bottom of the aircraft door frame hinges insert into collared brackets on the door.  \n\nTwo smaller pins on the upper part of the door feed into channels attacked to the airplane frame.  \n\nBeefy springs at the bottom are intended to lift the door up an inch or two so that the upper pins are secured in retention channels.  Overall, the door seems like it would need to be forcefully pressed downward to lock it in place or remove it.  The biggest mystery is how that was overcome.\n\nBeyond this spring loaded retention, each of the 4 pins has extra safety bolts designed to prevent the door from being shifted up or down once it's in place.  These bolts are fitted with castle nuts and cotter pins/wires.  These bolts do not seem strong enough nor intended to support the door itself, just to keep it from moving enough to unlock the pins.\n\nIt's a good guess these safety bolts were missing but it's unclear how the door's intended downward/upward movement happened to release the pins.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "The door plug should be any 737MAX9 configured to seat 193 Passengers or less. 194 passengers or more and you need the extra emergency exit capacity.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think it's 189 PAX but yes.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20601095259189606}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48790353536605835}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10058793425559998}, {"body": "I was DCAing from low $100s as I bought Initially at high $280-300 was positive on my holdings and then this shit happens .", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "made your own judgment if you are holding position ... \n\ni am just sharing my idea while i do not have any position in BA ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m closed my position at market open secured some gains, while long term the company might be ok and worth investing in the capital tied up would be better invested elsewhere. unless they drastically change their leadership and design/QA I am not sure how this gets fixed.

Yall rock. Love this place\n\nI will try to answer a few requests:\n\nNo I did not get 'rich' from this trade. Made great money on the trade but not life changing. Super grateful\n\nI did stick to the trade, genuinely saw it shifting and even told private group text chat about it like I did here\n\nNo discord or public chat room\n\nI am self taught and have traded for about 19 years now.\n\nFair warning I'm very direct\n\nOk idiots for 2024..\n\nSo you are all still rather bearish with your double top talk and the media has been more bullish lately. The big money stole your shares when SPY was 355-410ish. Theyre not selling those and you WANT a crash to rebuy them. So big money is already winning and gives zero fcks. They want to pump this beast and so does team Blue. Imagine going on campaign saying the market is at historic highs. Anyways all that is bullish.\n\nThen we have had 2 major wars begin, gold breaking out, rate hikes, job layoffs literally everywhere in MULTIPLE waves, and rampant inflation. Lets not forget the sell pressure from QT all year.. YET after all of this, THE INDEXES ARE AT OR NEAR ATH. Fcking wild yes indeed. So that means its all been digested and yet the market still doesnt give af.\n\nThe good data from a month or two ago had an amazing reaction where indexes ran 2-3% in a few days. So any good news seems to cause more gains whereas bad news may not cause more losses (as demonstrated through 2023 while we went up).\n\nALSO, even more bullish as rates are going to go down, and QT ends in mid 2024 to alleviate some sell pressure. Bulls are very thirsty as you can somewhat see in the recent bitcoin rally and price reaction of equities to ANY good data. Mofo's still be hunting for that yield. and so stocks want their BTC movement too. You're all going to (again) be wondering why how and what the hell is going on while indexes eventually grind higher for the year.\n\nFor 2024, I think SPY will hit 505, possibly up to 519.", "id": "191jvo8", "created_utc": 1704716010.0, "score": 317, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|4 years ago\n**Total Comments**|502|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19599127769470215}, {"body": "So if I\u2019m reading between the lines correct, we should buy calls on Boeing", "score": 203, "replies": [{"body": "Now is the time to long the stock.
