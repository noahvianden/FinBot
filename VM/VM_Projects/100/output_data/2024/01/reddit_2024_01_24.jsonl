{"title": "Alaska Airlines CEO says company found loose bolts on \u2018many\u2019 Boeing Max 9s", "selftext": "New York\nCNN\n \u2014 \nAlaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci revealed the carrier found \u201csome loose bolts on many\u201d Boeing 737 Max 9s in an interview for \u201cNBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\u201d scheduled to air Tuesday.\n\nIt\u2019s the CEO\u2019s first interview since a door plug on one of its Max 9 airplanes shot out from the side of the fuselage only a few minutes into a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more than frustrated and disappointed. I am angry. This happened to Alaska Airlines. It happened to our guests and happened to our people,\u201d Minicucci said, according to excerpts released ahead of the interview\u2019s airing.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 factory will have what the company calls a \u201cquality stand down\u201d at its Renton, Washington facility Thursday, the company announced Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDuring the session, production, delivery and support teams will pause for a day so employees can take part in working sessions focused on quality. This is part of the immediate quality actions recently shared by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe internal notice Boeing sent to its employees indicates that the 737 stand down is the first of several that it will hold at its facilities.\n\nNBC asked Minicucci if Boeing has a problem with quality control extending beyond a single plane.\n\n\u201cI think this is the issue that\u2019s at question right here, which is what is Boeing going to do differently on their quality program, to make sure that when we get an airplane, it\u2019s at the highest degree of excellence and that\u2019s what\u2019s got to be different going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the company is adding its own extra oversight on the airplane maker\u2019s production line.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration urged airlines on Sunday to inspect so-called door plugs on an earlier version of Boeing 737 airplanes. After recent inspections of the newer Max 9s, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have found loose bolts.\n\nFAA opened a formal investigation into Boeing\u2019s quality control around two weeks ago. The agency said it continued to review data collected from inspections of 40 sample aircraft as it considered how to determine if the planes were safe to fly again.\n\nMinicucci noted in the interview that the inspections take about 10 hours per door.\n\nIn a statement, Stan Deal, the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: \u201cWe have let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers. We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance. We will follow the lead of the FAA and support our customers every step of the way.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of United Airlines, one of the biggest buyers of Boeing jets, also expressed frustration with the company.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that\u2026 this keeps happening at Boeing. This isn\u2019t new,\u201d said Scott Kirby, CEO of United, in an interview Tuesday on CNBC. \u201cWe need Boeing to succeed. But they\u2019ve been having these consistent manufacturing challenges. They need to take action here.\u201d\n\nUnited has 79 of the Max 9s, more than any other airline, and had originally scheduled nearly 8,000 flights with the plane for this month before the incident, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Boeing\u2019s future is also uncertain regarding orders for the 737 Max 10, a newer, larger version and more expensive version of the 737 Max that has yet to be certified by the FAA.\n\n\u201cI think the Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for us,\u201d said Kirby. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a plan that doesn\u2019t have the Max 10 in it.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Chris Isidore, Gregory Wallace and Hanna Ziady contributed to this report.", "id": "19e477f", "created_utc": 1706057440.0, "score": 556, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "\"Some loose bolts on many planes\" = \"a lot of loose bolts\"\n\nIn an industry where near perfection is supposed to be the standard, this is a disaster.

The hair-raising incident drew fresh and sharp criticism of Boeing\u2019s quality control systems and safety culture, which has been under the microscope since two fatal 737 MAX crashes five years ago.\n\nLast week, an anonymous whistleblower \u2014 who appears to have access to Boeing\u2019s manufacturing records of the work done assembling the specific Alaska Airlines jet that suffered the blowout \u2014 on an aviation website separately provided many additional details about how the door plug came to be removed and then mis-installed.\n\n\u201cThe reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeing\u2019s own records,\u201d the whistleblower wrote. \u201cIt is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.\u201d\n\nThe self-described Boeing insider said company records show four bolts that prevent the door plug from sliding up off the door frame stop pads that take the pressurization loads in flight, \u201cwere not installed when Boeing delivered the airplane.\u201d the whistleblower stated. \u201cOur own records reflect this.\u201d\n\nNTSB investigators already publicly raised the possibility that the bolts had not been installed.\n\nThe account goes on to describe shocking lapses in Boeing\u2019s quality control process in Renton.\n\nThe work of the mechanics on the door plug should have been formally inspected and signed off by a Boeing quality inspector.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t, the whistleblower wrote, because of a process failure and the use of two separate systems to record what work was accomplished.\n\nBoeing\u2019s 737 production system is described as \u201ca rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nIf that account of what happened is indeed fully documented in Boeing\u2019s system it should be readily verified by the investigation.\n\nThe Seattle Times offered Boeing the opportunity to dispute the details in this story.
