We don't want to just buy after every bad news for obvious reasons. In an exaggerated example, if the Fed announces unemployment catastrophically jumped to 35% in December, that is certainly not a good time to buy: That's the makings of Great Depression 2.0 right there.\n\nIt's certainly risky. We don't want to buy after every bad news for obvious reasons. In an exaggerated example, if the Fed announces unemployment catastrophically jumped to 35% in December, that is certainly not a good time to buy: That's the makings of Great Depression 2.0 right there.  we would now be at 928 dollars. In essence, after bad news is published, the sellers do not all immediately cash in and let the bulls have fun. They usually gain complete control of the stock for some time afterward, and the bulls slowly come back in.\n\nWith less exaggeration, there was the Apple watch ban. After it was banned, AAPL dropped some 2%, but it kept going. As we saw this past week, AAPL dropped 2%, then another 2%, once again some 1.5%, and on Friday it dropped .5%. If we bought $1000 of AAPL right after the initial 2% drop, we would now be at 928 dollars. In essence, after bad news is published, the sellers do not all immediately cash in and let the bulls have fun. They usually gain complete control of the stock for some time afterward, and the bulls slowly come back in.\n\nAnother problem is that often, bad news piles on top of each other. We can look at Boeing for an example. The Alaskan Boeing 737 Max 9 experienced technical problems and this news is bad enough, but then agencies started to get on Boeing's butt, forcing them to temporarily decommission a number of Boeing 737 Max 9's for inspection. This happened over a weekend, so we don't see how this would have played out, but I am pretty certain that we would have seen a sharp decline after the initial news, then it rises back up, and then another sharp decline after the news part 2.\n\nThis happens with lawsuits a lot. There seems to be a little bit of a dogpile culture with lawsuits. Some random publisher sued Microsoft (MSFT) for alleged copyright, and then the New York Times (NYT) jumped on with their own lawsuit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, it certainly is a plausible idea to find stocks that are currently being beaten up by the stock market, wait a bit to see how they move, and then decide how to move forward from there.\n\nOne last thing: If you handpick stocks, they should be ones outperforming the market as a whole.
