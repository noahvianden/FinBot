{"title": "Will Mark Cuban's pharmacy - Cost Plug Drugs destroy CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens etc.", "selftext": "CPD is genius since it doesn't have to do go through FDA approval cause they are a compounding pharmacy. As a result they can cut costs like crazy. The only checking is done by the state board of pharmacies, which is nowhere as stringent and hence as expensive as FDA.   \nAlso they basically only have generics so that means they don't really 'invent' anything going through Phase 1, Phase 2 etc. and most conditions don't really need any medical research. And earlier US companies used to do most of the cutting edge medical research, but now all the research has moved to Europe. Pfizer has Biontech in Germany, J&J has Janssen in Swiss, Sanofi is in France mostly, I guess Moderna is the only one still in US but might also move soon.\n\nPlus they're online, so they don't need to maintain expensive equipment equipment like freezers or even deal with theft. They can also share liability with the shipping companies like UPS , Fedex incase of spoilage, so in case a patient sues them they can involve the shipping partners.\n\nAlso compared to physical pharmacies they don't have to call the cops or do any verification of patients before sending the drugs (not sure about this), so there are labor cost savings\n\nI guess Rite Aid has already 'bit the dust', and now Walgreens is next. So CPD is basically like a ingenious hack in the medical industry and just avoids all the expensive regulatory processes.", "id": "190c581", "created_utc": 1704580228.0, "score": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "OP, you seem to be confusing and mixing up several aspects of the drug industry.  Understandable as it's a convoluted with several distinct parts.  Here's how it works in a nutshell:\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies like Merck and Pfizer and Eli Lily and hundreds more do all the drug discovery and drug development work.  THEY do the clinical trials you mentioned world wide with various partners.   These trials take promising new molecules through all their required Phases and documentation and the entire process is overseen by the FDA in the US.  Other countries have their own regulatory agencies with their own requirements.  It's a lengthy and costly process and is never guaranteed.  Drugs fail at all stages of the process.  IF the pharmaceutical/biotech company gains the regulatory approvals they need for the drug by demonstrating the drug is safe and efficacious in humans THEN they will manufacture the medicines themselves or make them through contract manufacturers.  This is also a highly-regulated part of the industry.  \n\nOnce the products are made correctly and to exacting standards they sell their finished products primarily to giant drug Distributors like McKesson or Cardinal or AmerisourceBergen in the US.  Other countries have their own distributors and supply chains.  These distributors then sell and distribute the drugs to pharmacy chains and hospital systems and various types of health clinics for dispensing.\n\nPharmacies like CVS and Walgreens and Cost Plus all DISPENSE the drugs.  Pharmacists work there and take prescriptions written by your doctor for you and dispense the meds to you the patient.  Insurers and PBMs dictate what the price is to you and how much you have to co-pay.  They don't work for you.  They work for your employer who pays for the drug plan you receive through your employer.  Their mission is to save your employer money by establishing \"tiers\" of drugs which dictates their price and co-pay level. \n\nThere are mail order pharmacies that do the same thing as the brick and mortar pharmacies  but they mail the drugs to you usually giving you a 90-day supply at a time. All these pharmacies  don't do the actual clinical trials or work with the FDA to get the drugs through the regulatory process.  That's the pharma/biotech companies as I've explained. \n\nCost Plus also isn't a \"compounding pharmacy\". There are hundreds of small specialty compounders all across the US but that's not what the big guys or Cost-Plus is doing.  For the most part they dispense the pre-made pills or liquids, injectables, inhalants, patches, gels, ointments, etc.  already made in standard dosages and dosage forms by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.  Cost-Plus is a mail-order pharmacy using generics and a low fixed markup so that the drugs are as affordable as possible.  The big chains can and are starting to offer the same model for generics.  There's nothing Cost-Plus can do that they can't also do if they can make it work economically.  \n\nIMHO the real value of Cost Plus is that they offer a cheaper alternative to millions of patients  (with or without drug insurance) who can use generics.  They also publish their drug prices and markup so it's clear what they are charging and making.  This was always difficult to get from your pharmacy chain or PBM before.  AND this puts pressure on PBMs/Insurers and pharmacy chains to offer better pricing at least for the same generics.  Many PBMs and chains were marking UP generics and making them needlessly expensive for the patient, just for big profits.  Now the Cost-Plus model is offering transparent pricing and a lower cost option and the chains can't hide behind obscure opaque pricing. \n\nWill they put the chains out of business?  Doubtful, for a whole host of reasons, but they WILL perhaps change the costs of generics accessed through the chains.  That helps everyone and I hope I've helped YOU understand the drug industry a little better....", "score": 337, "replies": [{"body": "Wonderful explanation of the pharmaceutical industry.

(Pharmacists, please weigh in!) Like they take a powdered form of a drug and mix it with a flavored syrup so it can be taken as a liquid or they turn it into a suppository form.  MOST chain pharmacies and Cost-Plus are not hand-crafting custom dosage forms for patients.  They are dispensing ready-made drugs in the forms in which they are commercially produced by the manufacturers.  In the case of Cost-Plus they dispense generics.   Most compounding pharmacies have the skilled staff and the capability to craft custom medicines which is very helpful if a patient needs something different than what's \"off the shelf\".

But as you and others have pointed out,  through their partner, Truepill, they offer additional services.  From their website ; \"Truepill is a digital health platform that delivers diagnostics, telehealth and pharmacy infrastructure to power consumer health experiences.\"   AND as you mentioned they have additional plans for building a sterile-fill facility which will be operational in the near future.  This will be a welcome new supply source as injectables are often in short supply. \n\nAnything they can do to make medicines more affordable and possibly put pressure on other dispensers to lower their costs is a huge benefit for patients.  \n\nThanks for your clarifications and those of others.

Ron DeSantis.\n> \n> \u201cThe Company is increasingly dividing \u2013 rather than delighting \u2013 a growing number of consumers,\u201d the letter states, citing a recent poll that found Disney is the fifth most polarizing brand in the world, right behind the disgraced and collapsed crypto exchange FTX.\n> \n> \u201cDisney\u2019s board faces a number of pivotal decisions over the next 12 to 24 months as it rebuilds consumer trust and oversees a complex transformation that includes an optimization of the streaming segment, a direct-to-consumer pivot for ESPN, the evolution of the Company\u2019s film studios and a growth plan for parks,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cThe board will also once again need to engage in critical succession planning. Having a sizable owner in the boardroom to bring the market\u2019s perspective and serve as one of many voices would only benefit shareholders. While this type of director may not always be needed at Disney, we contend it is the right addition at this key moment in time.\u201d\n> \n> The letter also slapped back at the investment firm Blackwells Capital, another large shareholder that last week urged Peltz to end what it called his \u201cego-driven campaign.\u201d Ancora called the firm\u2019s principal, Jason Aintabi, \u201ca publicity-seeking greenmailer with a questionable personal and business history\u201d who opposes Peltz\u2019s efforts despite having \u201cmade billions of dollars over many decades\u201d through shareholder activism.\n\nhttps://www.thewrap.com/nelson-peltz-disney-board-seats-ancora-holdings/\n\n> **Bill Ackman Jumps To Musk's Defense Over Anti-Semitism Controversy, Pledges To Stay Invested In X: 'Earth Is Fortunate...'**\n> \n> Tesla CEO Elon Musk, recently criticized for endorsing anti-Semitic comments and lashing out at advertisers choosing to pull out of advertising on his social media platform, found support from fund manager Bill Ackman.\n> \n> What Happened: Ackman, expressing his views on social media platform X, owned by Musk, defended the billionaire entrepreneur\u2019s commitment to free speech and praised his recent interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit.\n> \n> \u201cMusk is a free speech absolutist which I respect,\u201d Ackman wrote.\n> \n> Ackman said his firm, which invested in Twitter\u2019s privatization via The Pershing Square (OTC:PSHZF) Foundation, intends to maintain its interest in X and support companies advertising on the platform.\n> \n> \u201cWhether we make a profit on our investment is not important to us as we never intend to sell our interest.\u201d\n> \n> In the interview, Musk criticized advertisers who abandoned the platform over the anti-Semitic content controversy, asserting that he and X were being treated unfairly compared to other social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.\n> \n> Ackman argued that X is targeted due to its perceived competition with other media organizations and because articles mentioning Musk, especially amid controversies, attract more clicks. He said that even Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) suspended ads on X under media pressure, despite its heavy investment in Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok.\n> \n> \u201cIf Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing,\u201d Ackman said. \u201cI am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board.\u201d\n> \n> Addressing Musk\u2019s response to the anti-Semitic post, Ackman, who is Jewish, stated that Musk did not exhibit any anti-Semitic intent. He supported Musk\u2019s clarification during the interview that Jews often support oppressed groups due to their history.\n> \n> \u201cAnd he [Musk] is correct in saying that Jews should rethink support for organizations that seek their elimination,\u201d he added.\n> \n> Ackman expressed gratitude for X\u2019s insulation from external influence. \u201d \u201cEarth is fortunate that @X is owned by an individual that is largely insulated from financial and other influence,\u201d he said.\n> \n> However, he suggested that a \u201ccarefully governed trust\u201d could be a more suitable long-term owner.\n> \n> While Musk thanked Ackman for his support, X is expected to incur losses of $75 million in advertising revenue by year-end due to the suspension of ads by some advertisers, according to a New York Times report.\n\nhttps://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bill-ackman-jumps-to-musks-defense-over-antisemitism-controversy-pledges-to-stay-invested-in-x-earth-is-fortunate-3255625\n\n> But Peltz\u2019s effort does have its share of supporters. Bill Ackman, the influential hedge fund manager and founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, was seen at the Dealbook Summit carefully listening to Iger, Elon Musk and other interviewees. Iger\u2019s remarks about Disney pulling its ads from Musk\u2019s X (Twitter) seemed particularly troubling to Ackman, who has expressed disapproval of \u201cDisney [caving] to public pressure\u201d regarding X while investing heavily in TikTok.\n> \n> \u201cIf Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing,\u201d Ackman wrote on X. \u201cMeanwhile Disney invests heavily on TikTok, likely alongside videos of kids teaching other teenagers to be anorexic and worse. I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ike-perlmutter-bob-iger-nelson-peltz-disney-activist-fight-1235715097/\n\nIt's obvious that literally every single Disney investors/shareholder are supporting Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora while BlackWells Capital is barging in as well:\n\n> **Disney Inks Deal With ValueAct While Blackwells Capital Nominates Board Candidates Amid Peltz Proxy Battle**\n> \n> Disney and CEO Bob Iger secured new support from activist investor ValueAct Capital in the company\u2019s proxy fight with Nelson Peltz.\n> \n> The Mouse House also got an unsolicited vote of confidence, in a roundabout way, from Blackwells Capital, which said it is nominating three candidates to the board to rival those picked by Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management in a looming proxy fight \u2014 although Blackwells called the media company\u2019s agreement with ValueAct \u201ca disappointing defensive move by Disney that does not solve for anything.\u201d\n> \n> Disney on Tuesday announced an \u201cinformation sharing\u201d deal with ValueAct, an investor in Disney, which ensures the investment firm will support the company\u2019s recommended slate of nominees for election to the Disney board at the 2024 annual meeting. Under Disney\u2019s confidentiality agreement with ValueAct, the media conglomerate will provide information to the investment firm and consult with ValueAct on \u201cstrategic matters,\u201d including through meetings with the Disney board and management.\n> \n> Separately, Blackwells Capital, another Disney shareholder, announced that it will nominate three candidates \u2014 Jessica Schell, a former Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal exec; Tribeca Film Festival co-founder Craig Hatkoff; and TaskRabbit founder Leah Solivan \u2014 for election to the board of directors of Disney, which is expected to be held this spring. In announcing the trio of candidates, Blackwells slammed \u201cPeltz\u2019s reprise of a contrived campaign that is disconnected from the needs of Disney stakeholders.\u201d\n> \n> Disney confirmed that Blackwells Capital provided notice of its intent to nominate the three individuals for election to the company\u2019s board at the 2024 annual meeting of shareholders. Disney said the board\u2019s governance and nominating committee \u201cwill review the proposed Blackwells nominees and provide a recommendation to the board as part of its governance process.\u201d\n> \n> In late November, Peltz renewed his proxy battle with Iger and the company\u2019s board and announced plans to nominate two directors. That came after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors.\n> \n> Peltz\u2019s Trian hedge fund subsequently announced it would nominate Peltz and former Disney CFO James Rasulo as candidates for directors of the Disney board at the annual shareholders meeting. Trian controls about $3 billion worth of Disney\u2019s shares, 78% of which are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter (whom Disney alleges has a \u201clongstanding personal agenda\u201d against Iger).\n> \n> Jason Aintabi, Blackwells\u2019 chief investment officer, said in a statement, \u201cWe call on Mr. Peltz to end his peacocking so that Disney can focus on its bright future, and not be dragged backward in time. Disney\u2019s current leadership is invaluable to its shareholders, and our three exceptional candidates are being nominated along with a business proposal specifying that any incumbent director outvoted by Blackwells\u2019 nominees be immediately added back to the board following the 2024 Annual Meeting.\u201d\n> \n> Blackwells\u2019 campaign \u201cprovides shareholders a necessary alternative to what would otherwise be a solipsistic sideshow,\u201d Aintabi added. Blackwells owns about $5 million worth of Disney shares.\n> \n> At the same time, Aintabi called Disney\u2019s agreement with ValueAct \u201ca disappointing defensive move by Disney that does not solve for anything. Bringing all shareholders a real and better choice for directors is the necessary act that will support the future success of Disney.\u201d\n> \n> In response to the Blackwells announcement, a rep for Trian said in a statement, \u201cTrian welcomes other shareholders attempting to help fix this iconic but wayward company. We believe long-suffering Disney shareholders need Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo as independent voices and catalysts for much-needed change on what\u2019s been a chronically underperforming board.\u201d\n> \n> To that, Blackwells\u2019 Aintabi responded, \u201cWe are gratified that Trian sees the merit in Blackwells nominees given they are independent, have the relevant experience and present themselves without an agenda. Our view remains that Disney shareholders do not need Nelson Peltz or Jay Rasulo on the board; if anyone is needed it\u2019s the Blackwells\u2019 nominees.\u201d\n> \n> ValueAct, in announcing its agreement with the Disney board, touted its \u201cextensive experience investing in media and technology companies navigating significant business transformations,\u201d including Spotify, the New York Times, 21st Century Fox, Nintendo, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce.\n> \n> Iger said in a statement, \u201cValueAct Capital has a track record of collaboration and cooperation with the companies it invests in, and its co-CEO Mason Morfit has been very constructive in the conversations we\u2019ve had over the past year. We welcome their input as long-term shareholders.\u201d\n> \n> Morfit added: \u201cDisney is the world\u2019s leading entertainment company. It has the best intellectual property, sports brand, and parks and experiences assets in the industry. As legacy technologies transition to digital platforms, we believe Disney can lead the media industry forward. We could not be more excited to partner with Bob and the board to help create long-term sustainable shareholder value.\u201d\n\nhttps://variety.com/2024/biz/global/disney-valueact-blackwells-nelson-peltz-board-1235860414/\n\n...and that's why Peltz/Perlmutter will easily take over Disney since they're the most beloved folks among Disney investors while ValueAct/Iger are the most despised. In fact, here are conclusive proofs of that:\n\n> **Bob Iger gets 'C' rating for Disney return: Analyst**\n> \n> Bob Iger's return to Disney (DIS) is one of Yahoo Finance's top stories of 2023.

Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin, who covered the stock during Iger's first tenure as CEO, said she would give the media executive a 'C' for his first year back at Disney.\n> \n> \u201cIt's hard to see him stumble in the first year\u2026 but in fairness to him, mostly what he's been doing is reversing things Bob Chapek did the prior two years,\u201d Martin told Yahoo Finance Live. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear he's been able to move forward at all rather than undoing the one bad decision he made in leadership, which was to hand the reins to Bob Chapek.\u201d\n> \n> Watch the video above to hear Martin discuss Iger's return, Peltz's battle for the board, and what the company could do to change her 'hold' rating on the stock.\n> \n> For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n> \n> https://finance.yahoo.com/video/cpi-report-oracle-slides-revenue-121057416.html\n> \n> Video Transcript\n> \n> And Laura, a near-term issues seems to be all of these activist battles. How should Bob Iger approach handling someone like Nelson Peltz, and perhaps others.\nLAURA MARTIN: So I think what's great for public shareholders about somebody like Nelson Peltz is when Bob Iger comes out and says, we're going to spend $60 billion on the theme park over 10 years, that might be great for him. But public shareholders care about this year and next year because they're going to be retired in 10 years.\n> \n> So I think what Nelson Peltz forces Bob Iger to do is justify the cost structure at the entertainment assets and the TV assets, compared to the revenue growth, which is single digits to negative. And it really forces him to cut costs. I think it's a primary reason they're going to cut a lot of content costs on the streaming side because they can't cut them on the sports side because their rights fees keep going up.\n> \n> So I think what Nelson Peltz does is force Bob Iger to, basically, fire more people, which unless he can grow the revenue faster on the, let's call it the core business, the traditional business, he needs to cut the overhead here.\n> \n> SEANA SMITH: So Laura, it sounds like, if I'm hearing you right, you think that maybe some of the changes that would be enacted by Nelson Peltz would actually better position Disney then for the future, and maybe make you a little bit more positive on the name.\n> \n> LAURA MARTIN: I would say that Nelson Peltz is far more short-term oriented than Bob Iger who's a business builder. And I think public shareholders are more aligned with that kind of time frame.\n> \n> BRAD SMITH: So with that considered, Laura, I mean, we've heard Disney talking about the thousands of acres of land that they could develop on, building out more of the parks, resorts experiences in other parts of the world. That still looks like money going out the door. So at what point do you think Disney is ultimately going to be able to deliver on this, and perhaps satisfy some of the investors?\n> \n> LAURA MARTIN: So I think this is a tale of two cities right now, meaning that the parks are really healthy. So I think Wall Street is supportive of investing money in the parks because the return on capital of money into the parks is going to be positive. But I do think the traditional, like ESPN linear business and the studios have had underwhelming results, meaning, when the market's giving them capital, they're not actually over delivering the cost of capital.\n> \n> So in order to do that, you have to cut costs. So I just think that the economics of the streaming/linear TV business are broken right now for the whole industry, not just for the Walt Disney Company, for the whole industry. So the industry needs to consolidate. It needs to rip out costs. It needs to spend less on content. And I think getting out of India is going to help Disney. They've announced that reliance. And Disney are in, I guess, a handshake deal right now. I think that's helpful. And I think, when they launch ESPN, the app, that's going to be helpful also.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/bob-iger-gets-c-rating-170938667.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JplnHuRu9I\n\nBy the way, we had these news so far:\n\n> **Nelson Peltz's Trian to seek at least three Disney board seats, sources say**\n> \n> Activist investor Nelson Peltz is pushing ahead with plans to seek at least three board seats at Disney (DIS.N) as the firm is not satisfied with Disney CEO Bob Iger's changes, several people familiar with the matter said.\n> \n> During a conversation on Thursday morning with Iger, Disney extended an offer for Trian to meet with the company's board but rejected the activist shareholder's request for seats on a board that will soon have 12 members, Trian said in a statement.\n> \n> Trian, which owns roughly $3 billion worth of Disney stock, said it \"intends to take (its) case for change directly to shareholders,\" signaling it will proceed to a second proxy fight and nominate director candidates when the window for nominations opens early next month.\n> \n> \"Investor confidence is low, key strategic questions loom, and even Disney's CEO is acknowledging that the company's challenges are greater than previously believed,\" Trian said in the statement.\n> Shares in Disney, which has a market capitalization of $169 billion, are down 16% since Feb 9, when Peltz withdrew from his campaign to gain a board seat.\n> \n> Investor enthusiasm lifted Disney stock 20% in the two-and-a-half months after Iger's return in November 2022 but lost most of the gains this year, closing on Thursday at $92.69 per share, less than a dollar higher than the price before Iger was brought back.\n> \n> **RESTRUCTURING, COST-CUTTING**\n> \n> Over the past 12 months, Disney has restructured the company and significantly reduced costs. It told investors earlier this month it is on track to achieve about $7.5 billion in cost savings \u2013 $2 billion more than its original target.\n> \n> Disney said it will work to make its streaming business profitable, build ESPN into the \"pre-eminent\" digital sports brand, improve the performance of its film studios and \"turbocharge\" growth at its theme parks, through $60 billion in investment over the next decade.\n> \n> Disney noted Peltz is allied with Isaac Perlmutter, a former Disney executive who was terminated earlier this year and has a \"longstanding personal agenda\" against Iger.\n> \n> The company said Perlmutter's agenda \"may be different than that of all other shareholders.\"\n> \n> Despite Iger's efforts and Thursday morning's phone call, positions appear to have hardened this week.\n> \n> Disney named soon-to-be-retiring Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman and veteran media executive and former group chief executive of Sky, Jeremy Darroch, to its board, a pre-emptive step companies targeted by activists often take.\n> \n> The men will join early next year and former Illumina (ILMN.O) chief, Francis deSouza, will leave.\n> \n> **SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT**\n> \n> Another investor, Blackwells Capital, issued a statement of support for Iger and his restructuring of the company, as well as for the two new board members, Gorman and Darroch.\n> \n> Blackwells said displacing these individuals with Peltz and other Trian nominees would deprive shareholders of \"valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company\u2019s history.\"\n> \n> Trian said while the two new Disney directors did represent an improvement from the status quo, they \"would not restore investor confidence or address the root cause behind the significant value destruction\".\n> \n> The Disney board on Thursday announced a cash dividend of 30 cents per share, payable on Jan. 10.\n> \n> Disney said it will recommend shareholders support its slate of nominees. Investors and industry analysts are already calling the presumed battle Disney 2.0, but they note it might be tougher this time for Peltz to win over other shareholders.\n> \n> Patrick Gadson, co-head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Vinson & Elkins which is not involved, said proxy advisers will assess how much change Disney has accomplished.\n> \n> \"If they\u2019ve made significant progress,\" Gadson said of Disney, proxy advisers \"are more likely to allow for time to complete the transformation.\"\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/activist-investor-peltz-seeks-two-seats-disney-board-cnbc-2023-11-30/\n\n...and Disney announced these plans:\n\n> **Disney Reinstates Dividend, Amends Bylaws Amid Push By Nelson Peltz For Board Seat**\n> \n> Disney today announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share for the second half of its fiscal 2023, its first such payout since the dividend was halted three years ago during Covid.\n> \n> It will be payable January 10, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 11. The company had said back in February that it planned to bring back the dividend this year.\n> \n> \u201cThis has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company, defined by a strategic restructuring and a renewed focus on long-term growth,\u201d said Mark Parker, Chairman of the Board. \u201cAs Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company\u2019s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.\u201d\n> \n> The dividend move comes as activist investor Nelson Peltz, backed by big Disney shareholder and former Marvel boss Ike Perlmutter, is seeking to join the board of the media giant \u2014 saying today he would bring the fight \u201cdirectly to the shareholders\u201d after Disney rejected his offer and named two new directors instead. This push by the founder of Trian Partners has led Disney to restate and amend its corporate bylaws that deal with outside candidates seeking board seats.\n> \n> Shareholders elect directors at a company\u2019s annual meeting. Companies list their nominated directors in a proxy statement ahead of the gathering and provide shareholders with a list of the names on proxy cards. Stockholders can also present other, outside candidates for director, not endorsed by the company, as Peltz says he intends to do. It\u2019s not clear how many board seats he is gunning for. Disney\u2019s fiscal year ends in September and its annual meeting is usually in sometime March. It was held a bit later this year, on April 3, as the company battled Peltz for the first time in the early part of the year. He withdrew from the fight in February, before the meeting. Prior to that, he had set up a dedicated website called Restore the Magic that detailed what he saw as Disney\u2019s failings. Not clear yet what he\u2019ll do this time around. Disney said earlier today that Perlmutter has a \u201clongstanding personal agenda\u201d against Iger.\n> \n> The amendments laid out by Disney in an SEC filing today do the following:\n> \n> -\u201cAddress recently adopted amendments to Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by requiring that any person soliciting proxies in support of a director nominee other than the Board\u2019s nominees provide a representation that such person will comply with Rule 14a-19 and deliver reasonable evidence to the Company that the Rule 14a-19 requirements have been met.\u201d\n> \n> This SEC rule from last year (14a-19) requires all parties use a \u201cuniversal\u201d proxy card that lists all director nominees presented by both management and shareholders for election at the annual meeting. It was meant to make it easier to get outside shareholders candidates on the ballot so some companies (not just Disney) have been amending their bylaws to make it not quite so easy,\n> \n> -\u201cRequire that any person directly or indirectly soliciting proxies using its own proxy card use a proxy card color other than white.\u201d The white card is typically used by management.\n> \n> -\u201cEnhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to\u2026director nominations made by stockholders, including by requiring: certain additional background information, disclosures and representations regarding any proposing stockholders, any proposed director nominees and business and any other persons related to a stockholder\u2019s solicitation of proxies; and any notice of director nomination be accompanied by all written questionnaires required of the Company\u2019s directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominees.\u201d\n\nhttps://deadline.com/2023/11/disney-reinstates-dividend-amends-bylaws-nelson-peltz-board-seat-1235644175/\n\n> **Disney Board Adopts New Rules for Nominating Directors in Wake of Nelson Peltz\u2019s Announced Proxy Fight**\n> \n> Company also announces first cash dividend for shareholders in more than three years\n> \n> The same day activist investor Nelson Peltz announced he was launching a proxy campaign to get seats on Disney\u2019s board of directors, the company adopted amended bylaws covering nominations of directors by outside parties.\n> \n> Meanwhile, in a bid to win shareholder favor amid the brewing proxy battle, Disney separately Thursday announced a cash dividend of $0.30 per share, payable Jan. 10, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 11, 2023. It\u2019s the company\u2019s first dividend payments to investors in more than three years, after Disney suspended them during the COVID pandemic.\n> \n> On Nov. 30, Disney\u2019s board \u201camended and restated\u201d the company\u2019s bylaws, which became effective as of Thursday, the company said in an SEC filing Thursday.\n> \n> Among other things, the amendments \u201cenhance the procedural mechanics and disclosure requirements relating to business proposals submitted and director nominations made by stockholders,\u201d Disney said in the filing. That includes requiring \u201ccertain additional background information, disclosures and representations regarding any proposing stockholders, any proposed director nominees and business and any other persons related to a stockholder\u2019s solicitation of proxies\u201d and that \u201cany notice of director nomination be accompanied by all written questionnaires required of the company\u2019s directors completed and signed by any proposed director nominees.\u201d\n> \n> In addition, Disney\u2019s revised bylaws \u201caddress recently adopted amendments to Rule 14a-19 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by requiring that any person soliciting proxies in support of a director nominee other than the board\u2019s nominees provide a representation that such person will comply with Rule 14a-19 and deliver reasonable evidence to the company that the Rule 14a-19 requirements have been met,\u201d Disney said.\n> \n> The SEC\u2019s Rule 14a-19, which went into effect for shareholder meetings involving contested director elections held after Aug. 31, 2022, establish new notice and filing requirements for all soliciting parties, as well as formatting and presentation requirements for universal proxy cards. In addition, the rules require shareholders presenting their own director candidates in the contest to solicit holders of a minimum of 67% of the voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election.\n> \n> Disney\u2019s new bylaws also require that \u201cany person directly or indirectly soliciting proxies using its own proxy card use a proxy card color other than white.\u201d\n> \n> The announced intention by Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management to launch a proxy fight to get its directors on the board comes a day after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors, with terms starting in early 2024.\n> \n> Peltz\u2019s Trian, which controls about $3 billion in Disney stock, issued a statement Thursday that after the Disney board rejected Trian\u2019s request for board seats, including one for Peltz, the hedge fund will \u201ctake our case for change directly to shareholders.\u201d\n> \n> In response, Disney noted that 78% of the shares claimed to be beneficially owned by Trian are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter. Disney said Perlmutter \u201cwas terminated from his employment by Disney earlier this year and has voiced his longstanding personal agenda against Disney\u2019s CEO, Robert A. Iger, which may be different than that of all other shareholders.\u201d Perlmutter did not immediately have any comment, his rep said.\n> \n> On Thursday, investment management company Blackwells Capital, a Disney shareholder since 2018, weighed in on the drama by issuing a statement of support for Iger\u2019s leadership of the company and the board appointments of Gorman and Darroch. \u201cDisplacing these individuals or other members of the board with Mr. Peltz and other Trian-selected nominees would deprive shareholders of valuable, experienced voices in the boardroom at a critical time in the company\u2019s history,\u201d Blackwells said. \u201cBlackwells is concerned that Trian\u2019s campaign prioritizes Mr. Peltz\u2019s ego over what is best for all Disney shareholders, and that its latest effort may cost Disney shareholders upwards of $50 million and serve only as a value destructive fog for Disney\u2019s leadership and board.\u201d\n> \n> Blackwells chief investment officer Jason Aintabi said in a statement, \u201cMindless, drum-beating activism is not the right strategy for shareholders. Disney\u2019s board is acting in the best interests of all shareholders and should be allowed the time to focus on driving value at one of America\u2019s most iconic companies without this fatuous sideshow.\u201d\n> \n> Regarding the reinstatement of the dividend, Disney chairman Mark Parker said in a statement, \u201cThis has been a year of important progress for The Walt Disney Company, defined by a strategic restructuring and a renewed focus on long-term growth. As Disney moves forward with its key strategic objectives, we are pleased to declare a dividend for our shareholders while we continue to invest in the company\u2019s future and prioritize meaningful value creation.\u201d\n\nhttps://variety.com/2023/biz/news/disney-board-bylaws-nominating-directors-nelson-peltz-proxy-fight-1235815361/\n\nAnd when it comes to dividend, one guy is pointing this out:\n\n> they have about 1.8 billion shares outstanding, so it's roughly a $550 million payout. the last time they paid a dividend was 2019, and they paid out $0.88 per share; roughly 3x as much.\n> \n> just to put in perspective, disney is going to lose about $500 million in november alone from the marvels and wish flops.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/187u045/disney_brings_back_its_dividend_after_threeyear/kbh01np/\n\nAll of these are 100% conclusive proofs that Iger knows that he will lose the proxy war for certain and will be ousted and get replaced by Peltz and/or Perlmutter as the next CEO, especially since Iger is the most despised individual among every single Disney shareholders/investors while Peltz/Trian is/are the most beloved folks among every single Disney shareholders/investors. Those who claim that Peltz/Perlmutter can't become Disney CEOs themselves, they will become Disney CEOs because they will fire every single Disney board members and replace them entirely with Trian members and Perlmutter's goons. How? By bringing in a puppet CEO whom they will control very easily:\n\n> Pelz is gonna handpick your buddy Igers replacement very soon. No more pandering anymore, enjoy.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kceom7n/\n\n> I said pick the replacement, doubt they will run it themselves (at least not for long) but it\u2019ll prevent some Iger loyalist hack\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kcep6v5/\n\n> Highly doubt Chapek would come back, and Iger\u2019s words are meaningless at this point. Probably will be pull someone cutthroat that will stop employees from dictating the company, maybe a video game executive or something\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/18d46xg/elon_musk_goes_off_on_disney_ceo_bob_iger_saying/kceuqx9/\n\nOnce they make a video game executive their puppet CEO, all of these will happen overnight and they will become the majority Disney shareholder or even own every single Disney shares.\n\nThe problem is, Peltz has a history of completely hacking off General Electric until there was nothing left and Perlmutter has a history of saying this:\n\n> If Disney's stock price keeps falling, Iger also has to worry about agitating more investors.\n> \n> Iger is already tangling with ex-Marvel exec Ike Perlmutter, one of Disney's biggest individual shareholders, who has joined activist investor Peltz's fight to try to improve Disney's results by getting a bigger say over its strategy and operations.\n> \n> **Perlmutter has told people he wants to break up Disney as much as he can and gain control of some of the IP, and \"people underestimate Ike at their peril,\" said a source familiar with Perlmutter's conversations.**\n> \n> Disney's largely liberal stance on hot-button social issues could bring out other activist investors with political as well as financial motivations, like Paul Singer of Elliott Investment Management, a big GOP donor. There are people who \"would love to take down the 'woke' company,\" the source added.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/bob-iger-ceo-disney-return-insiders-anxious-losing-faith-2023-11\n\n...which is why all of these will happen soon after 2023:\n\n1. Bob Iger, Pete Docter, Kevin Feige, Jennifer Lee, and Kathleen Kennedy will get fired immediately and Peltz/Perlmutter will become co-CEOs of Disney while the entire Disney board will be replaced with Trian members and Perlmutter's minions while Docter, Feige, and Lee will respectively be replaced by John Kricfalusi, Ethan Van Sciver, and Chris Savino.\n\n2. Literally every single upcoming Disney releases including **Kingdomf of the Planet of the Apes**, **Inside Out 2**, **Deadpool 3**, **Elio**, and **Avatar 3** will be completely scrapped for tax write-offs.\n\n3. Pixar will be sold to Sony (which then will be shut down entirely), Walt Disney Animation Studios will be sold to Comcast (which then will be shut down entirely), Lucasfilm and 20th Century Studios will be sold to The Daily Wire, and Marvel will be kept by Perlmutter himself.\n\n4. Kevin Feige, Pete Docter, and Jennifer Lee will be completely blacklisted from Hollywood by Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora for spreading \"woke and pedophilic agenda\" to children. Feige and Docter will flee to Japan where the former will become a producer of **Godzilla** films and other Toho monster films while the latter will become a full-time animator at Studio Ghibli. Lee, on the other hand, will never be heard from ever again. Ironically, Kathleen Kennedy will be spared due to her status as a veteran producer.\n\n5. Every single Disney theme parks will be demolished to make ways for something else. In places of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort, state prisons will be built, in place of Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Resort California, Russian propaganda centers will be built to improve the reputation of Russia, and in place of Tokyo Disney Resort, hentai clubs will be built. As for Walt Disney World, once it's demolished, one half of it will be replaced with hentai clubs that also perform conversion therapy while the other half will be replaced with state prisons as Ron DeSantis always wanted. All Disney stores will be shut down immediately and give ways to anime stores instead.\n\nIt should also be remembered that far-right bullshitters on YouTube praised David Zaslav when he scrapped **Batgirl** because they perceived it as him waging war against \"woke garbages\". Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter/Ancora will do the same thing for the entire upcoming Disney releases to appease those same far-right bullshitters and spite Iger/Feige and no one will be able to stop them since they will have the total control of Disney and its boards, meaning that they can just ignore shareholders even if they don't like any of those decisions that they pull off. Rermember, Peltz/Perlmutter would be CEOs and the board would be filled entirely with Trian members and Perlmutter's goons.\n\nI advise you all to read everything here carefully before making any rebuttals.\n\nP.S.

It primarily discusses the involvement of activist investors like Nelson Peltz, Ancora Holdings, and others in a proxy battle for board seats and influence at Disney. The text also mentions the concerns and strategies of Disney's current CEO, Bob Iger, and the company's response to these investor actions. It suggests a significant shareholder support for Peltz and his allies, as well as a criticism of Iger's leadership and Disney's recent performance.  \n>  \n>**Assessment of Validity:**\n\n1. **Complete Takeover by Peltz/Perlmutter/Ancora/Ackman**: The claim that these investors will completely take over Disney and become the majority shareholders or own all shares is speculative and lacks concrete evidence. Corporate takeovers, especially of a company as large and complex as Disney, involve numerous legal, financial, and regulatory hurdles. It's also important to note that shareholder support can be fluid and influenced by various factors, not just investor activism.\n2. **Criticism of Disney's Performance and Leadership**: The text reflects a valid critique of Disney's recent performance and decisions, particularly under Bob Chapek's leadership. However, it's worth noting that corporate governance and strategy are complex, and different stakeholders might have varied perspectives on what's best for the company.\n3. **Dramatic Changes Predicted**: The text's predictions, such as the firing of top executives, scrapping of major projects, selling off major studios, and radical changes to theme parks, are extreme and should be approached with skepticism. While activist investors can influence corporate strategy, such radical changes seem improbable and are not typically how corporate governance unfolds, even in contentious situations.\n4. **Peltz and Perlmutter's Alleged Intentions**: The claim that Peltz and Perlmutter intend to break up Disney or take control of its intellectual property is a significant assertion that would require more concrete evidence to be deemed credible.\n5. **Feasibility of the Predicted Outcomes**: Many of the outcomes predicted in the text, like the replacement of key personnel and the selling off of major divisions, seem implausible and overly dramatic in the context of normal corporate operations and governance.\n\n>In summary, while the text raises legitimate points about shareholder activism and criticism of Disney's leadership, many of its claims and predictions are speculative and not supported by solid evidence.

These investors are challenging the current leadership of Disney, particularly targeting CEO Bob Iger and the board's decisions. Your assertion is that these investors, especially Peltz and Perlmutter, are gaining significant support from Disney's shareholders and are poised to take control of the company.\n\nKey points include:\n\n1. Investment firms like Ancora and individuals like Bill Ackman are aligning with Peltz and Perlmutter in their efforts to gain board seats at Disney.\n2. There's a perception that Disney's current leadership, especially Iger, has been underperforming, leading to discontent among shareholders.\n3. The narrative suggests a drastic overhaul of Disney if these investors gain control, including firing key executives, scrapping upcoming Disney projects, and potentially selling off major parts of the business like Pixar, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Lucasfilm, and 20th Century Studios.\n4. The post also mentions possible changes in Disney's theme parks and a general shift in the company's direction.\n\nIt's clear that you are deeply concerned about these potential changes, fearing a complete transformation of Disney's core identity and operations.

Musk is a free speech absolutist which I respect. I think he is entirely correct that he and @X are treated unfairly and inconsistently by advertisers. \n> \n> @tiktok_us @instagram @facebook and others have enormous amounts of problematic content, antisemitic and otherwise, but the advertisers don\u2019t boycott those platforms. \n> \n> Musk is targeted because the other media organizations view @X as a competitor and any time his name is in an article about controversies, it draws clicks. MSM is incentivized to attack him as it actually drives attention to their sites and therefore more revenues. It is these attack articles by other media organizations that put pressure on the @Disney\u2019s of the world to stop advertising on X. \n> \n> If Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing. Meanwhile Disney invests heavily on TikTok, likely alongside videos of kids teaching other teenagers to be anorexic and worse.  I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board. \n> \n> X presents the opportunity for advertisers to access an incredible global audience that is not available elsewhere. And it is cheap compared to other alternatives because of current circumstances.  \n> \n> On Musk and antisemitism:\n> \n> After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent when he responded with the \u2018actual truth\u2019 tweet, and further clarified thereafter. \n> \n> I thought he made what he meant extremely clear in the @andrewrsorkin interview, namely, that Jews are drawn to support \u2018oppressed\u2019 groups and causes through various non-profits due to our history of being an oppressed minority. \n> \n> Musk points out correctly that a number of these organizations and their members support Hamas. And he is correct in saying that Jews should rethink support for organizations that seek their elimination. \n> \n> Many Jews are doing that right now. \n> \n> To use a Muskism, Earth is fortunate that @X is owned by an individual that is largely insulated from financial and other influence.  That said, perhaps some form of very carefully governed trust would be a better forever owner than any individual. \n> \n> @PershingSqFdn invested in the Twitter privatization in support of free speech. Whether we make a profit on our investment is not important to us as we never intend to sell our interest. \n> \n> I am more inclined to like and support companies that advertise on the platform because I appreciate their support for free speech. I have actually bought products I learned about from ads on @X. I can\u2019t think of another example of my responding to direct advertising other than on X. \n> \n> Unfortunately, recent (and society\u2019s long-term experience) with non-profit governance, see @OpenAI\n, certain private universities etc. should not give anyone confidence that a traditional non-profit would be a better owner of X than Musk. \n> \n> Perhaps some day the ownership of X should be distributed to each American, one share for each American during their lives and one for each person born, with a charter which permanently vests the free speech principles by which it operates. \n> \n> Until then, we all should be grateful that X is owned by Musk.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/billackman/status/1730442461644730553?s=46&t=heuN3aUb-lI7mK8tmq9uxw\n\nAlso, Elon Musk is calling Bob Iger to get fired immediately, essentially joining forces with Peltz/Trian/Perlmutter:\n\n> **Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, saying he should be 'fired immediately'**\n>\n> 1.

The company recently pulled ads from X after Musk supported an antisemitic post.\n> \n> Musk chimed in (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): \"Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy.\"\n> \n> When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: \"He should be fired immediately.\"\n> \n> He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: \"truth.\"\n> \n> Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n> \n> It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At The New York Times' DealBook Summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: \"Go f--- yourself.\"\n> \n> At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out.\n> \n> \"Is that clear?\" Musk asked. \"I hope it is. Hey, Bob.\"\n> \n> Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X.\n> \n> \"We know Elon is larger than life in many respects and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's Tesla or SpaceX or now X,\" Iger said.\n> \n> Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month.\n> \n> \"By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us,\" Iger said.\n> \n> Musk faced an onslaught of criticism over his post on X, which called an antisemitic post the \"absolute truth.\" Musk later walked back his original comment, calling it \"foolish.\"\n> \n> Iger and Disney are among many that Musk has targeted over the years.

In an effort to restrategize, Iger will cut back on movies and other new content to better the company\u2019s financial standing, as it looks to cut billions of dollars in costs and make its streaming business profitable.\n> \n> Disney has said the proxy fight is apparently in part due to a personal grudge held by Peltz\u2019s ally and former Marvel boss Ike Perlmutter. Trian has oversight of shares owned by Perlmutter, who has been an outspoken critic of Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n> \n> The fight launched by Trian last month came the morning after Disney appointed Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky TV boss Jeremy Darroch to its board, in what appeared to be a move to temper Trian\u2019s discontent.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/trian-nominates-peltz-and-former-disney-exec-to-media-giants-board.html\n\n> **In Disney Board Fight, Nelson Peltz Will Nominate Himself and Ex-Disney CFO Jay Rasulo as Director Candidates**\n> \n> Activist investor Nelson Peltz, who\u2019s looking to shake up Disney\u2018s board, plans to nominate two directors as candidates for directors of the Mouse House\u2019s board: Peltz himself, and former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo.\n> \n> Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management said Thursday it submitted a notice of its intention to nominate the two independent director candidates at Disney\u2019s 2024 annual shareholders meeting, expected to be held next spring.\n> \n> \u201cDisney is one of the most iconic companies in the world with unrivaled scale, unparalleled customer loyalty, irreplaceable intellectual property (IP) and an enviable commercial flywheel. However, Disney has woefully underperformed its peers and its potential,\u201d Trian said in a statement.\n> \n> Disney confirmed that Trian provided notice of its intent to nominate Peltz and Rasulo as directors. The company said the board\u2019s governance and nominating committee, which evaluates director nominations, \u201cwill review the proposed Trian nominees and provide a recommendation to the board as part of its governance process.\u201d\n> \n> Responding to Trian, Disney said the company \u201chas an experienced, diverse and highly qualified board that is focused on the long-term performance of the company, strategic growth initiatives including the ongoing transformation of its businesses, the succession planning process, and increasing shareholder value.\u201d\n> \n> Last month, Peltz\u2019s Trian Fund Management renewed its proxy fight to get its directors on the Disney board. That came a day after Disney named Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman and former Sky chief Jeremy Darroch as new directors, with terms starting in early 2024. Trian, which controls about $3 billion in Disney stock, said that after the media conglomerate\u2019s board rejected its request for board seats that it would \u201ctake our case for change directly to shareholders.\u201d\n> \n> In a response Nov. 30, Disney noted that 78% of the shares claimed to be beneficially owned by Trian are owned by former Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter. Disney said Perlmutter \u201cwas terminated from his employment by Disney earlier this year and has voiced his longstanding personal agenda against Disney\u2019s CEO, Robert A. Iger, which may be different than that of all other shareholders.\u201d\n> \n> Rasulo, who served as Disney\u2019s CFO from 2010-15, said in a statement provided by Trian, \u201cThe Disney I know and love has lost its way. As independent voices in the boardroom, Nelson and I are confident that the combination of my decades of experience at Disney, Nelson\u2019s significant boardroom skills and history of driving positive strategic change, and our combined consumer brands expertise and financial acumen, will be additive to the Disney board. With a shareholder mandate, Nelson and I look forward to helping the board and management reorient the company towards delighting its consumers again and driving significant value for its owners.\u201d\n> \n> Before being appointed CFO, Rasulo was chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide from 2005-09 and president of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts from 2002-05. When Rasulo left the company in 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger praised his \u201cstrategic acumen and savvy insight\u201d and said the exec had been \u201ca vital contributor to Disney\u2019s success.\u201d\n> \n> Peltz asserts that Disney stock has underperformed its media-industry peers and the broader market over the last decade \u2014 and even before that, shares languished since Iger was first appointed CEO in 2005. Trian claims \u201cDisney shareholders were once over $200 billion wealthier than they are now,\u201d referencing the cumulative market value lost between Disney\u2019s all-time high closing stock price on March 8, 2021 and Oct. 6.\n> \n> \u201cMr. Iger has sold the vast majority of his ownership stake built up primarily through share-based compensation \u2014 more than $1 billion of Disney stock \u2013 leaving shareholders alone to face the daunting reality of a complex turnaround in a rapidly evolving industry,\u201d Trian said in its Dec. 14 statement.\n> \n> Key problems for Disney, according to Trian, are that Wall Street consensus earnings-per-share estimates for the company\u2019s fiscal years 2024 and 2025 have \u201cfallen meaningfully, even as the company claims to be cutting billions of costs,\u201d while \u201cstudio content continues to disappoint consumers, slowing the speed of the flywheel and threatening future earnings growth.\u201d\n> \n> Trian continued, \u201cThe root cause of Disney\u2019s underperformance, in our view, is a board that is too closely connected to a long-tenured CEO and too disconnected from shareholders\u2019 interests.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cTo resolve the malaise and crisis of confidence among Disney shareholders, the Board needs fresh perspectives from truly independent directors selected by the shareholders themselves,\u201d Peltz said in Trian\u2019s announcement Thursday. \u201cJay and I have the strategic, operating, financial and governance expertise to help Disney and are committed to working with the other members of the Board and management team to address the fundamental issues underlying the Company\u2019s continued poor performance. There is much that can be done to revive Disney and restore the confidence of Disney shareholders, and Trian looks forward to discussing these opportunities with our fellow shareholders over the coming months.\u201d\n> \n> On Nov. 30, the day Peltz announced the proxy fight, Disney adopted new bylaws covering the nomination of directors, apparently in part to require Peltz to disclose details of Perlmutter\u2019s involvement in the proxy fight. And, seeking to woo shareholders amid the brewing battle, Disney announced its first cash dividend payments to investors in more than three years.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2023/biz/news/disney-board-nelson-peltz-nominates-jay-rasulo-1235838088/", "score": -11, "replies": [{"body": "> **Bob Iger Prepares for Ike\u2019s Pirate Ship to Fire at Disney**\n> \n> As ousted Marvel mogul Ike Perlmutter and activist investor Nelson Peltz enlist former Disney exec Jay Rasulo in their quest to reshape the studio, the CEO faces a somewhat more credible challenge to his reign.\n> \n> \u201cYou broke my heart.\u201d\n> \n> That\u2019s what former Marvel Entertainment chairman and CEO Ike Perlmutter said to Bob Iger, according to The Wall Street Journal, when Iger made it clear in 2015 that he was not going to name veteran Disney executive and Perlmutter favorite Jay Rasulo as his eventual successor. (He anointed Tom Staggs instead, and Staggs was out the following year. Being a potential successor was hazardous duty at Disney, at least in those days.)\n> \n> Iger\u2019s relationship with Perlmutter went sharply downhill from there and last March, after incrementally stripping Perlmutter of his duties at Marvel, Iger ejected the contentious billionaire from the company altogether. Even before that happened, Perlmutter had backed his friend and Palm Beach neighbor, Nelson Peltz, in his quest for a seat on Disney\u2019s board, which Peltz and Perlmutter argue is too cozy with Iger to be effective.\n> \n> Peltz dropped that first run at Disney after Iger pledged to slash costs and lay off thousands of employees. But with Disney stock still languishing, Peltz and Perlmutter are back, having added Rasulo to the team. The goal is to get board seats for both Peltz and Rasulo and \u2014 one must suspect \u2014 eventually to install Rasulo in the CEO job that eluded him years ago. Presented with Peltz\u2019s first run at the company, it would seem very possible that shareholders would dismiss him and Perlmutter as two 81-year-olds driven by Perlmutter\u2019s quest for revenge.\n> \n> But with Rasulo on board, they\u2019ve added a respected longtime Disney executive. Rasulo had largely disappeared from the public eye, serving on various boards including iHeartMedia and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. In a Dec. 14 statement announcing his alliance with Peltz and Perlmutter, Rasulo said, \u201cThe Disney I know and love has lost its way.\u201d\n> \n> Says one Disney veteran, \u201cJay has credibility. He\u2019s not some Palm Beach crank. He\u2019s a very legitimate voice about where Disney was eight years ago. Ike is angry and eating three nights a week at Mar-a-Lago but Jay showing up on that side is a very significant event.\u201d\n> \n> Iger appears to be taking the challenge seriously, enlisting reinforcements of his own: On Jan. 3, Disney secured support from the Mason Morfit-led investment fund ValueAct Capital Management, which has agreed to back its board of director nominees as part of a strategic consulting deal. Meanwhile, shareholder and investment firm Blackwells Capital LLC may be a wild card in the mix. While a Blackwells exec stated Wednesday that Peltz should \u201cend his peacocking,\u201d in a nod to backing Iger, the firm also plans to nominate its own board members \u2014 Jessica Schell, Craig Hatkoff and Leah Solivan \u2014 something that holds no appeal for Disney.\n> \n> The question for Disney shareholders is whether they are antsy enough at this point to take a chance on the more credible Perlmutter-backed dissidents, whose talk of love and broken hearts is at odds with their cold-blooded reputations. Peltz is an activist investor who has swooped in on a broad assortment of companies that were seen as undervalued. Perlmutter is a controversy magnet with a well-established reputation for squeezing a dollar until it begs for mercy.\n> \n> Rasulo was just the sort of tough executive Perlmutter would favor: One Disney veteran describes him as effective but also as \u201csort of a blunt instrument\u201d as he made tough budget cuts and sometimes referred to other executives as \u201cchildren playing at business.\u201d A Disney insider rolls his eyes at Rasulo\u2019s claim that he is jumping into the fray out of love for the company. \u201cIf that was really his motive he wouldn\u2019t try to engage in a fight along with Nelson frigging Peltz and Ike Perlmutter,\u201d he says. \u201cIke wants retribution and Peltz wants a fast buck. They don\u2019t give a shit about the company.\u201d\n> \n> Perlmutter\u2019s longtime attorney, John Turitzin, bristles at that. \u201cIt\u2019s an absurd suggestion to make,\u201d he says. \u201c[Perlmutter] has got, I don\u2019t know how many billions of dollars tied up in Disney. He\u2019s not going to [play] a revenge game with the majority of his personal wealth.\u201d (Perlmutter became one of Disney\u2019s largest individual shareholders when he sold Marvel to Disney for $4 billion in 2009. Turitzin says he has never sold a share.)\n> \n> Perlmutter is very much a self-made man who was never a natural fit at Disney, which has always tried to front executives who present a friendly face to the public. Before Disney and the other legacy entertainment companies were engulfed in troubles, Iger was the smooth, deft embodiment of that idea. For most of that time, Perlmutter presented no face at all: Photographs of him were all but nonexistent until Donald Trump appointed him as an adviser on veterans affairs. (That led to a ProPublica investigation and an allegation from House Democrats that Perlmutter and two other Mar-a-Lago associates had illegally tried to influence government officials \u201cto further their own personal interests.\u201d At one point Veterans Administration officials, ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange during an event to promote suicide-prevention, were startled when Captain America turned up beside them on the podium as Spider-Man waved from the trading floor below.)\n> \n> For years, Perlmutter made waves at Disney, in part because of thrift that was extreme to the point of fishing paperclips out of waste-paper baskets. And there was more. In 2012, Financial Times reported that he had driven several executives out of Disney\u2019s consumer products division, including the chairman of the highly profitable unit, and three African American women who sought financial settlements. Another woman was moved to a different division after alleging that Perlmutter had threatened her, saying he had a bullet with her name on it. Both Disney and Perlmutter declined to comment at the time. (Perlmutter, known to carry a gun, was named in a 2018 bribery trial when former NYPD Sgt. David Villanueva testified that he had helped expedite the renewal of Perlmutter\u2019s gun license.)\n> \n> When Marvel replaced Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle in the 2010 Iron Man sequel, Perlmutter was reported to have told a Disney executive that the move saved money and no one would notice because Black people look the same. Turitzin says Perlmutter has told him that he never made that comment.\n> \n> In his memoir, Iger wrote that Perlmutter had stood in the way of two of Marvel\u2019s groundbreaking films. \u201cI called Ike and told him to tell his team to stop putting up roadblocks and ordered that we put both Black Panther and Captain Marvel into production,\u201d Iger wrote. At that point, Marvel\u2019s Kevin Feige was said to be on the brink of leaving the company. Perlmutter\u2019s attorney Turitzin says the mogul resisted Black Panther, which was the first to go into production, \u201cnot because [he was] racist but because it had never been done before\u201d and its success wasn\u2019t guaranteed.\n> \n> In the year since Iger returned as CEO, Disney has faced numerous well-documented challenges: losses at the streamer (which Iger has pledged will be profitable in 2024), a faltering performance from animated films, a Marvel slump and more.

Disney made a string of announcements meant to excite investors.\n> \n> 2. Nelson Peltz told CNBC in a statement he won\u2019t be backing away from his proxy fight.\n> \n> 3. Disney announced its ESPN flagship streaming service will launch in August or the fall of 2025.\n> \n> 4. Disney also said Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras Tour\u201d film will debut on Disney+.\n> \n> Are you not entertained, Nelson Peltz?\n> \n> Disney shares jumped 6% in after-market trading Wednesday after the company posted earnings and flooded the zone with new announcements meant not only to excite its employees and shareholders, but also to put activist investor Nelson Peltz in his place.\n> \n> Peltz has launched a proxy fight against Disney, asking investors to nominate him and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo to replace current board members Michael Froman and Maria Elena Lagomasino. Both Disney\u2019s higher profits, and string of content and partnership announcements, appeared to form a direct rebuttal to Peltz\u2019s concerns about the company.\n> \n> \u201cThe last thing we need right now is to be distracted by an activist or activists that have a different agenda and don\u2019t understand our company,\u201d Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told CNBC\u2019s Julia Boorstin in an interview Wednesday.\n> \n> During his company\u2019s first-quarter earnings conference call, he added, \u201cwe have turned the corner and entered a new era.\u201d\n> \n> Peltz, who first took a stake in Disney last year only to abandon and then renew his proxy fight threats, responded with a statement to CNBC that he won\u2019t be backing down this time.\n> \n> \u201cIt\u2019s deja vu all over again,\u201d Peltz\u2019s firm Trian Fund Management said in a statement. \u201cWe saw this movie last year, and we didn\u2019t like the ending.\u201d\n> \n> It was hard to keep up with Disney\u2019s announcements this quarter:\n> \n> 1. ESPN finally set a launch date for its direct-to-consumer service: August or fall of 2025.\n> \n> 2. Disney is buying a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite. It is Disney\u2019s \u201cbiggest foray into the gaming space ever,\u201d Iger said to Boorstin.\n> \n> 3. Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour film is coming to Disney+.\n> \n> 4. Disney upped its dividend by 50% versus the last dividend paid in January.\n> \n> 5. Disney announced a sequel to \u201cMoana\u201d is coming to theaters in November, which will likely be the studio\u2019s biggest box office hit of the year.\n> \n> 6. Disney is on track to meet or exceed its $7.5 billion targeted spending cuts by the end of fiscal 2024.\n> \n> 7. The company said it expects full-year fiscal 2024 earnings will increase at least 20% over 2023.\n> \n> All of these announcements came a day after Disney made more big news, revealing it\u2019s launching a joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox to offer ESPN in a new skinny bundle of linear networks that caters to sports fans later this year. It will be the first time cable cord-cutters and cord-nevers will have access to ESPN outside the traditional cable bundle.\n> \n> It\u2019s only logical that the mountain of announcements came this quarter, given activist pressure from Trian and Blackwells Capital. Iger has a vested interest in beating back critics of his performance and strategy.\n> \n> Peltz has been vocal about bashing Iger\u2019s leadership as shares have slumped in the past year, underperforming the S&P 500. Trian has launched a website, Restorethemagic.com, that claims Disney has \u201cnot performed for shareholders.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIt saddens me that the board didn\u2019t welcome me,\u201d Peltz said last month. \u201cThis company is just not being run properly.\u201d\n> \n> Iger said he hasn\u2019t spoken with Peltz recently and doesn\u2019t intend to speak with him. In a filing last month, Disney said \u201cin deciding not to recommend Mr. Peltz, the directors considered a number of factors, including that in a two year quest for a seat on the Disney Board, Mr. Peltz had not actually presented a single strategic idea for Disney.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/disney-q1-earnings-nelson-peltz-isnt-abandoning-proxy-fight.html", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Because now Elon Musk is apparently planning to buy Disney. Granted, the source is Inside the Magic, but still:\n\n> **For Sale? Elon Musk Has the Ultimate Power Move To Get Even With Bob Iger**\n> \n> As the war against The Walt Disney Company rages on, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk could play a massive power move and worm his way into the House of Mouse.\n> \n> Over the last few years, Disney has come under fire from outsiders, claiming the company to be heading in a dangerous direction when it comes to its content. As the company strives to be as diverse and inclusive as possible, many fans of the once untouchable entertainment giant have declared this direction as a \u201cwoke agenda.\u201d\n> \n> From a same-sex kiss in Pixar\u2019s Lightyear (2022) to the studio\u2019s first-ever openly gay teen in Strange World (2022), the casting of Black actress Halle Bailey as Ariel in The Little Mermaid (2023) and rumored appointment of a person of color to play Hercules in the future, Disney\u2019s efforts are loud and clear. So loud that the phrase \u201cgo woke, go broke\u201d has been circulating online for a while now.\n> \n> And the box office failings and supposed lack of content direction have also caught the attention of numerous key players in the wider business world. There is Nelson Peltz, who is battling for a place on the Mouse House\u2019s board after Disney\u2019s multiyear stock low in 2023. This is the second proxy battle against Disney; Peltz ended his first attempt following the company\u2019s severe cost-cutting measures, led by Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, but reignited the attack late last year. Trian Fund Management\u2019s Peltz is also being supported by two former Disney executives, Ike Perlmutter and Jay Rasulo, in his bid for a seat on the board.\n> \n> **Disney and Elon Musk**\n> \n> But perhaps even noisier than Nelson Peltz is Tesla and X owner Elon Musk. Musk has been extremely vocal in his attacks on The Walt Disney Company. Disney pulled advertisements from X (formerly Twitter) following Musk\u2019s promotion of an anti-semitic conspiracy theory on the social platform, with Musk later telling Bob Iger to \u201cgo f*** himself\u201d at the New York Times Dealbook Summit they both attended in late 2023.\n> \n> Not long after his expletive-ridden tirade against the CEO, Musk continued his assault on X, writing, \u201cHe should be fired immediately. Walt Disney is turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company.\u201d The businessman then pulled Disney+, the Mouse\u2019s streaming service, from his Tesla vehicles.\n> \n> In a fairly one-sided battle, one may assume that the feud between the two business giants will eventually die down, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. In a surprising turn of events, Elon Musk will now help fund a new fight against Disney\u2013Gina Carano\u2019s lawsuit. Once lined up to be part of the new wave of Star Wars, Gina Carano was fired from Lucasfilm in early 2021 following months of controversial social media posts and online interactions. The hammer fell on her time as Cara Dune after the actress and former MMA star seemingly compared being a Republican to being Jewish in the Holocaust. The incendiary comments that came amid the height of the pandemic also saw Carano\u2019s talent agency, UTA, part ways with her.\n> \n> The lawsuit from Carano is based on wrongful termination and discrimination regarding her political views and is aimed at both Disney and its subsidiary, Lucasfilm, which creates Star Wars content. In her suit, funded by Musk\u2019s X, Carano seeks that Lucasfilm recast her in the sci-fi franchise.\n> \n> \u201cAs a sign of X Corp\u2019s commitment to free speech, we\u2019re proud to provide financial support for Gina Carano\u2019s lawsuit, empowering her to seek vindication of her free speech rights on X and the ability to work without bullying, harassment, or discrimination,\u201d X\u2019s Head of Business, Joe Benarroch, said in a statement, via The Hollywood Reporter.\n> \n> So, with Musk banging at the door, could the entrepreneur, like others, actually make a bid to take on Disney in a more brutal fashion? Well, part of one Disney theme park just went up for sale, and it could be Musk\u2019s ticket into the Mickey Mouse palace.\n> \n> According to the Financial Times, U.S. activist fund Elliott Management is calling on Japan\u2019s largest property group, Mitsui Fudosan, to launch a 1 trillion yen (approx. $6.8 billion) share buyback.\n> \n> \u201cThe report said Elliott also demanded the company sell down its $3.6 billion stake in Oriental Land, which runs Tokyo Disneyland, citing people familiar with the matter at both Elliott and Mitsui,\u201d wrote CNBC. The outlet also stated that shares in The Oriental Land Company fell by 2.2%, with Mitsui currently owning a 5.4% stake, making it Oriental Land\u2019s second-largest stakeholder.\n> \n> Tokyo Disney Resort is unusual in the way that Disney does not actually own the parks; Disney licenses The Oriental Land Company to operate the Disney parks in Tokyo. But with this part of the empire going up for sale, could Musk make a bid for it? Nothing the businessman does seems to make sense, so while there is only a small chance he\u2019d infiltrate Disney this way, there is still a possibility that he would do this to get even with Iger. And it would cost him a fraction of the cost of Twitter.\n> \n> In fact, it was only earlier this week that some of Musk\u2019s more ardent followers suggested he buy The Walt Disney Company. After posting Disney\u2019s diversity and inclusion standards on X, with the caption, \u201cAn anonymous source just sent me this from Disney. It is mandatory, institutionalized racism and sexism!\u201d Musk responded to a comment asking him to buy Disney and \u201cfix it\u201d with the thinking face emoji. Musk\u2019s reply got just under 1 million views.\n> \n> This was just the latest chapter in the animosity the SpaceX co-founder holds for Disney. In December 2023, Musk tweeted that \u201cDisney has a major content problem. Almost their entire upcoming slate is unwatchable. They are the world\u2019s biggest example of go woke, go broke lol.\u201d\n> \n> Iger isn\u2019t the only business owner to be in the sights of Musk. When Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg launched Threads as an offshoot of Instagram and a direct competitor to X, Musk challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match, which the latter accepted. So far, this battle has yet to happen, but\u2013as he said to his first wife, Justine, during their wedding dance\u2013Musk is keen to be the \u201calpha\u201d in all of his relationships.\n> \n> The Nelson Peltz and Elon Musk sagas began not long after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wore down Disney with its political attacks against the company. It all started when Disney opposed the HB 1557 bill, which became colloquially named the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, in 2022. What followed was a legal battle that dominated the political landscape of the Sunshine State and later that of the entire United States as Gov. DeSantis aimed to secure the Republican Party nomination for the 2024 Presidential Election.\n> \n> With The Walt Disney Company\u2019s Q1 Earnings Call arriving later today, it will be interesting to see if Bob Iger addresses these noisy business developments. The saga unfolding around Disney may read like a Shakespearean tragedy (or comedy, depending on how you look at it), but with a legacy at stake, will Disney find the power to fend off those knocking at the gate and reignite trust across its century-wide fanbase?\n\nhttps://insidethemagic.net/2024/02/elon-musk-and-disney-bob-iger-sale-th1/", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06428156793117523}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06428156793117523}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04537438228726387}], "tickers": ["tsla", "msft", "cpi", "dis"]}

Really, there are always permabears saying it's going to finally correct or crash or whatever, and the Big Short has not helped things as now everyone wants to be a Michael Burry and call a new top. I've been a small time RE investor for a bit now, physical property not stock. So I've always got my ear to the state of RE value and trends, and I'm generally bullish on it as it is a protected asset class that the state insists on propping up and becomes generally more scarce due to regulatory creep. But for the time being, I think the dump is finally coming within the next half-year.\n\n1. For once, the Fed is actually working against the housing market. They quite literally are trying to induce some kind of correction by yanking up interest rates to their highest levels in 25+ years. So there are no smoke and mirrors financing policies that can toss them a lifeboat right now.\n2. As many have heard, the effective monthly mortgage payment is basically at its highest point ever, by a huge margin. The cost to own has surged past the cost to rent. We're talking 50+% in under a year for the same priced home, and as home values rocketed during COVID QE there is now nowhere to go but down in order to meet demand.\n3. Demand has been frozen, this is known by all in the industry. While values have only flatlined the industry itself (RE agents, mortgage personnel) are in recession as transactions are simply not happening. So why have values only treaded water rather than dumping?\n4. Supply has simply not been there. Historically low supply. Literally just not enough houses to cause any sort of market panic or crash. People still need to buy homes to live in, and for the time being sellers have found a buyer for their price, eventually, just not as quickly as 2021-2022.\n\nWith all of these factors in mind, consider a few things just happened:\n\nHome values have double topped and are on the downswing [https://ycharts.com/indicators/us\\_existing\\_home\\_median\\_sales\\_price](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_existing_home_median_sales_price)\n\nand more critically:\n\n[US housing supply is finally soaring back to levels unseen since the great housing crash of 2007](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR)\n\nFrozen demand is finally starting to meet a glut of supply, and mortgage rates have remained largely unchanged, still the most expensive time to buy a house in American history. Commercial RE has already been in hell and a foreclosure crunch is expected. Probabilities markets predict that the Fed will be cutting rates within the next half-year, where they accurately assessed the rate hikes prior. This means the expectation from people with actual money (not idiotic talking heads with no stakes), is that a recession and dovish pivot is on the agenda next.\n\nI'm personally betting on at least a small housing crash this year and loading up on some puts to hedge my portfolio.

Time on market proves this.  \n\nThe reason why home prices haven\u2019t declined and are plateauing is because potential sellers are in their homes with insane gains over the past 3 years (contributing to massive equity) and their rates are lower than they would get now.  This gives sellers the thought of \u201cI don\u2019t HAVE to sell so I\u2019m not adjusting my price.\u201d  I usually just let those ones sit on the market untouched.  Keep your house, then.  \n\nI see a lot of (ignorant) realtors saying, \u201cwhen rates go down, housing is going to explode again and home prices will increase exponentially because demand will re-enter the market.\u201d  My take on it is, \u201cdoubt it.\u201d  And here\u2019s why: when rates come down enough to reignite demand, then you\u2019ll have god knows how many homeowners putting their homes on the market in order to cash out their gains and upgrade since they can\u2019t cash out refi right now because they\u2019ll lose their lower rate.  This, in turn, will probably flood the market with supply which, in my opinion, will be what moves the market down to more logical pricing.  One could say, \u201cwell, they\u2019ll cash out refi when the rates come down,\u201d and this I doubt because psychologically, Americans love buying new things when they make a ton of money.  From a psychological standpoint, after people have paid over asking for homes they honestly really didn\u2019t love, they\u2019ll sell and try to buy something they actually wanted.\n\nAdditionally, historically, when the fed pivots and begins to decrease fed funds rates, this triggers a spike in unemployment.  I\u2019ll bet, if this happens this go around, we\u2019ll see demand remain suppressed due to unemployment increase and FUD within the buyer circle forcing potential buyers to be more conservative and not pursue purchasing until it\u2019s clear their jobs are safe.\n\nAt the end of the day, there\u2019s so many ways this could play out, and it\u2019s impossible to predict the future.
