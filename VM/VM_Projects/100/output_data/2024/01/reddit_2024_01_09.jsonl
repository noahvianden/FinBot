Who knows! lol\nGenerally speaking it is the overall market that goes up and keeps going up, not individual companies. Most individual companies tend to have boom and bust cycles that follow the news cycle. If they are in the news making headlines... That typically isn't the ideal time to buy in.\nBuy the rumor, sell the news. Nvidia has made some great moves the last couple years. The bitcoin halving coming up is likely going to be a tide that raises all crypto and make GPUs hot commodities again for mining. AI and video walls certainly aren't shrinking markets, so there is plenty of chance for growth that Nvidia can capitalize on. Automation and self driving cars are very GPU hungry, and cheap enough that we are starting to see more mass deployment. Lots of up-side potential for nVidia and other chip makers!\n... But nVidia has been on the hype cycle for a bit now, so how much of that growth is already baked into the price? I suspect they are at a point where their business is priced in, and any deviation from expectation has far more down side risk, than good news bringing upside risk right now. They may not fall in price, but the likelihood of their price rising significantly again in a repeat of the last few years seems unlikely.\n\nDont go for companies after they have made headlines. Look for companies that have been out of the hype cycle for a while. Look for companies that are taking a hit in the media right now but are unlikely to go out of business for it. But mostly, don't make big plays on companies that are already big. I mean, you likely have a 401k, or a broad market index fund... Big popular companies are already well represented in those funds, and that is where the bulk of your money should be. If you are buying individual companies, then look for that dark horse, not the market darling! Or buy a bunch of companies in an emerging industry and wait a decade for 1-2 winners to make the 10-20 bankrupt failures worth taking the risk on.\nI may well be wrong thinking that Nvidia is going to stale for a while. But are there are lots of other companies with more growth potential right now. Put another way, we just went through a major downturn in markets, and everyone went to safety in tech stocks. Those big stocks are selling while the overall market is flat or rising... That means money is rotating into smaller and more risky companies again.
