Job gains have moderated since early last year but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.*\n\n*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.*\n\n*In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.* ***The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.*** *In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*\n\n*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*\n\n*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Loretta J.

Here is my DD:\n\n1. AAPL has had a great run. It has strong resistance at 200. Currently trading at 186. Though couple of days it was as high as 195. It's been at all time high. Based on my TA, regardless of good or bad earnings (the psychology is that earnings have to be superb for the stock to jump higher). Hence if the stock is at all time high, and earnings are meh, people will take profit. Earnings can be great (unless it's superb) and stock will still drop. Since it's at all time high, I see people taking profit here and it's a good spot to get PUTS. Here's why:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp8t6akhd0gc1.png?width=1473&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29758c6a6858223bdfaea90a0be97a1d6b119a7\n\nOn the chart above, you will see numbers 1-5. The blue vertical lines are where the earnings occurred. Let's start with #1. From previous earnings to the end of 1, arrow points down. What happened to earnings? It popped. Even though earnings were bad (see the E is red), it still popped. Going to #2. Arrow pointing up. Earnings down (even though they were good). #3. Arrow up, earnings down. #4, arrow down, earnings up. See the pattern here? It is the inverse of the arrows. If arrows are pointing down from previous earnings to current earnings, it most likely go up. Vice-versa if they're pointing up. We are currently at #5. What you think comes next, especially since it's almost at all time high? Noted, the average move in earnings is $5-10. If you are buying PUTS, suggestion would be buying at between 180-185 strike.\n\n2. $AMZN. Same analogy. $AMZN didn't really follow the patterns as $AAPL did though. And while it is at it's high, I am cautious about AMZN due to the success they've had from last earnings to this earnings (holidays, people shopping etc..). I'm leaning towards PUTS since from last earnings to today's earnings has seen significant growth, but if earnings are superb, it could go higher. Might not play AMZN.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot add more than one attachment, so I'll reply to this post so you can see the AMZN chart.\n\n3. $XOM. I'd buy calls for $XOM due to the fact that $SHEL did great. One thing in the market is psychology. $AMD did great, but stock fell. They're in chips/semiconductor business. $QCOM did great, but same thing happened. So if $SHEL did great and stock went up, I see $XOM also going up.\n\nWith all that in mind, playing earnings before earnings is truly a gamble. Rather than being a predictive trader, aim to be a reactive trader. It's best to trade after earnings are released. Most of my winnings have come from being reactive to how the earnings were (except the QCOM.. though I did make $15k from FOMC news on SPY. Hence used the winnings to play earnings)\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/mjgaphv1i0gc1.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e7d5f60e1ce8ff2108771e9e3946f39d3b1bc7b\n\nAMZN chart:", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great DD.
