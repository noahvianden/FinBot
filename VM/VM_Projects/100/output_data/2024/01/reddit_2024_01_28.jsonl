Good science is testing, auditing, verifying from many different sources.  \n\nExample, I've seen great debates of reasonable people debating whether CPI is good or should be improved, particularly how it measures shelter and comparing it to history.\n\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf\n\nIn this post though I am particularly interested in this claim of unemployment.  \n\nMaybe those with a background in econometrics can chime in with whether there are any potential distortions in unemployment or if there are reasons to believe perhaps it is lagging?  Anything backed with data or links to articles by economists would be great, refutation or support both appreciated.\n\nIf so obviously this could have large implications on consumer spending and market valuations going forward.", "id": "1ad8dys", "created_utc": 1706464224.0, "score": 358, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "Employment is a lagging indicator anyway.

{"title": "Tesla's Bull Case", "selftext": "I see a lot of negative sentiment around Tesla and a true lack of understanding of what is to come.\n\nI have been in Tesla since 2017 and this company has evolved in ways I never imagined.\n\nI am more bullish today than I have ever been.\n\nThis is not investment advice and I honestly don't care whether you buy, sell, short, use options or anything else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople see Tesla's market cap of approximately $575 billion and immediately think it's overvalued.  They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets focus on the now for a moment though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.\n\nThe TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.\n\nThe current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.\n\nSo for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.\n\nWhat will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.\n\nThey will also be ramping the Cybertruck as well this year, new product for which I expect in the 75k-100k range produced/delivered.\n\nSo that is vehicle outlook for 2024.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat about energy which just seems like a completely overlooked aspect of the business.\n\nThey delivered over 14 gwh of energy storage in 2023, up from 6 gwh in 2022.\n\nThe Lathrop factory is scaling to produce 40 gwh annually and they have a new factory in shanghai on the books to come on later this year for an additional 40 gwh of production.\n\nTesla did about $3.9 billion in revenue in 2022 from energy,  around $6.4 billion 2023.\n\nThey only deployed 14 gwh of what will soon be 80 gwh of capacity and it already is starting to impact their profits positively and becoming a meaningful source of profits and revenue.\n\nSo while the vehicle business will have lower growth in 2024, the energy business will have accelerated growth.\n\nWhat about batteries? Tesla is ramping their own 4680's and expects to install additional lines later this year and produce all they need for the Cybertruck ramp as well as Semi and future projects that require it.\n\nThe IRA bill that passed is going to pay Tesla for the production of these batteries.  They literally are looking to be at a production rate of 100 gwhr of 4680's annually later this year and will get paid per kwhr produced.  This amount of money that will come in is not understood yet.\n\nSo for 2024, energy is entering into a very interesting and lucrative phase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not really going to touch on charging much but their network of chargers continues to grow, other vehicle manufactures will gain access this year as well as all the new Tesla's produced, this is something to consider.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay so that covers 2024, I expect earnings to be far better than people expect, especially in the latter half of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nThe TAM for vehicles will be expanding massively.  They already said they plan to produce their next generation vehicle in 2025 in Austin and then expand to their new factory in Mexico, and another undecided location for a factory overseas.  The #1 selling car is the Model Y at over 1.2 million sold annually.  What happens when there is a new vehicle for a fraction of the cost made by Tesla.  I don't even know if it will qualify for the POS tax credit from the IRA but if it does, the price for this car could be insane. It's already expected to be sub 25k. This thing will sell many millions and usher in that next wave of vehicle growth. The car goes into production next year, did I say that already, NEXT YEAR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets talk about what is probably the greatest opportunity of our lifetime, I am not even talking about FSD for autonomous vehicles which would revolutionize travel and the economics of it for people and the company, I am talking about Humanoid Bots.  I don't think people understand that they are coming, not just from Tesla but multiple companies and they are around the corner.

{"title": "BIG WEEK AHEAD", "selftext": "We have Fed speak and six significant earnings reports with forward guidance this coming week.  My thoughts:\n\nJPOW & Committee has no reason at all to do six rate cuts this year so far.  Too bad - the economy would boom otherwise.  He won\u2019t declare victory and most likely will remain cautious.  I think the market needs to get over the Fed and move on.    \n\nTuesday the fun begins:\n\nMSFT -  red hot!   The tunes are full blast - can they dance?   They have three businesses to report on plus AI.  Microsoft 365, Asure cloud, & personal computing- XBOX, Bing, Surface, and Activision.  Their yoy earnings is expected to increase 19%.  They been pushing AI close to two years now - show me the money!  Would like to see  yoy revenue growth of at least 25% based on their price. I think they are over bought.  \n\nGOOGL -  is expected to grow earnings by 53% to roughly $ 1.61.  Let\u2019s see how search and YouTube does.  Maybe they have a new AI story to tell.  Over bought I think.   \n\nAMD -  is expected to grow earnings by 12% to roughly $0.77.   It\u2019ll be about forward guidance I believe.   I like what I hear about the 8000G processors with lower power graphics and innovative content creation capabilities.   They have a strong story as well with their neural processing unit(NPU) Ryzen A for PC\u2019s. Over bought but will continue to kick ass I think.\n\nThursday:\n\nAAPL - is expected to grow earnings 12% with flat yoy revenue.  Really don\u2019t see any surprise to the upside.  Heard the Apple Pro Vision isn\u2019t gaining any app\u2019s on Netflix\u2019s.    Really no growth story so far.  Sell. \n\nAMZN -big Q upcoming.   They need to demonstrate they can make big money.  They are expected to grow earnings from $0.03 to 0.79/share.  Use them a lot - we\u2019ll see.\n\nMeta - expected to grow earnings by 66% to $5 roughly.  Meta plans to have 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips to drive its data centers & AI by end of 2024. Year of efficiency is over I think.  \n \nI\u2019m hoping for a flat week, but do have puts on MSFT & APPL.   My opinion only.

The National Financial Conditions Index continues to fall beyond any possibility of recession.\n* The Fed will begin a rate cutting cycle this year, but will probably not taper down QT until Q3 or Q4. Because QT is the real driver of disinflation, inflation will not come back.\n* The yield curve will remain inverted throughout 2024, giving businesses, CRE, and consumers enough breathing room to refinance their debts. Debt service as a percentage of income continues to fall.\n* In May 2023, wages started rising faster than CPI and this trend could continue all year. The consequence is more consumer spending, more taxes paid, and recovery of living standards toward pre-pandemic levels. \n\n**Bear Thesis:**\n\n* Inflation continues falling at about 25bp per month while the Fed can't or won't cut that quickly, which means the real interest rate increases throughout 2024. \n* Rising real interest rates plus a steady reduction in prices reduces both supply and demand. Money flows into fixed income instead of cars, houses, businesses, R&D, etc. as the real cost of debt for businesses and consumers increases.\n* The BTFP ends, and banks all tighten their lending standards at the same time.\n* Real estate crashes as people lose faith in the idea of hoarding inflation hedge assets, and try to sell the negative-cash-flowing investment houses they bought a few years ago.\n* By June or July, people start talking about inflation hitting 0% soon, and the Federal Funds Rate is still 5%.
