Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta\u2019s progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.\n\nStart-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia \u2019s GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta\u2019s H100 purchases.\n\nThe H100 is Nvidia\u2019s current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.\n\nThough, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.\n\nLink to video \n\nhttps://x.com/stockmktnewz/status/1748039110256685481?s=46&t=oN4WEfF1pxTYkKs03Quflg", "id": "19a67ll", "created_utc": 1705625705.0, "score": 652, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "Bullish for Nvidia as if they needed more reasons.", "score": 407, "replies": [{"body": "Crazy to think that even at the insane compute power and astronomical cost of these units today, in 10 or so years, the typical consumer device will be just as or more powerful.\u00a0 Moore's law marches on.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Moores law will be a myth in a few decades", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Moore's Law is technological advancement on a sigmoid curve (S-curve).

Even if the EU bureaucracy decides to formally oppose the deal, Amazon can and will sue to move forward or they will have to pay a large penalty to iRobot. \nAnother clarification Amazon did not drop the purchase price arbitrarily. After the deal was negotiated IRBT received a $200 million 3 year term loan for working capital . As a result, that debt would transfer to Amazon reducing the value of the assets acquired, simple math. \nI read IRBT\u2019s latest 10Q and the Company is struggling but the acquisition by Amazon is a major reason for that. After the deal was announced IRBT lost a top 5 customer who carried their products, also other retailers who compete with Amazon reduced marketing efforts and orders. If the acquisition does not close, with a little hard work IRBT should be able to get that major customer back and re-engage with other retailer customers to restore lost business and increase joint marketing efforts. They can probably increase sales by 20% within a year of cancellation of the Amazon deal. \nAlso the company on YTD basis still spends 20% on R&D which is $150 million annually. Way higher than needed but that\u2019s probably also a requirement of the deal with Amazon. If the deal gets cancelled (big IF), an independent struggling company is not going to spend 20% of revenue on R&D.  They will cut this in half. So in the event the deal gets canceled IRBT gets a large termination payment that it uses to pay down debt. Within a year they restore lost business and cut R&D and SGA costs; the combined impact of these moves could add well over $110 million to the bottom line, restoring the company to profitability. That alone is worth $1Billion in market cap. Once the company restarts earnings calls and markets the turnaround of a machine learning AI pioneer it will likely see an additional market cap bump. \n\nIn fact the company maybe in a better position if the deal gets cancelled from an equity shareholder perspective.
