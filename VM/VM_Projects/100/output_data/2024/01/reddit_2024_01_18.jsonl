{"title": "Everything you need to know about AMD in 8 bullet points.", "selftext": "Everything you need to know about $AMD, in 8 bullet points.\n\n1. $AMD's rise over the last decade has been the result of the company betting on chiplets. Chiplets consist in making a chip out of many small chips, instead of making a big one (monolithic) directly like $NVDA does. This is how it has disrupted $INTC and how it is now poised to disrupt $NVDA.\n\n2. We are nearing the \"end\" of Moore's Law. Making monolithic chips is getting exponentially harder and therefore, chiplets are the way around the end of Moore's Law. They enable much  higher yields at similar if not higher levels of performance. $AMD has been working on chiplets for about a decade now, while the rest of the industry is only just catching up.\n\n3. $AMD is just a bunch of people working together to design chips. The company's success is a result of having bet on the right roadmap (chiplets), but also of its excellent organizational properties. Lisa Su is a world class leader and ensures; everyone feels connected to the mission; employees are empowered and accountable; communication is extremely transparent. \n\n4. The market still doesn't quite understand why $AMD bought Xilinx. Essentially, Xilinx is the #1 FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) company in the world. FPGAs enable chips to change shape autonomously and adapt to whatever computational task. They have the potential, over the long term, to deliver much more efficient computing. FPGAs will allow $AMD to deliver AI acceleration in any of their products. \n\n5. $AMD also bought Pensando, which excels at making datacenters stateful. Stateful data centers hold information about their current state of operations. This data can then be used to train AI models, that enable organizations to run data centers at increasingly higher levels of automation. Pensando came with a lot of software engineers too and is essentially going to enable $AMD to provide the environment for their computing engines to do their best work.\n\n6. The combination of the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions give $AMD a highly differentiated roadmap. For $AMD to bring chiplets to the world, it's had to fine tune its $AMD Infinity Fabric tech, which excels at connecting chiplets. $AMD is now positioned to use this tech to connect any kind of computing engine. This gives $AMD a structural competitive advantage, whereby going forward it will be able to fill specific gaps in the market that no one else will be able to.\n\n7. $AMD is now transferring its chiplet expertise to the GPU market. $NVDA is busy making bigger and powerful chips, defying Moore's Law. $AMD is meanwhile coming from below, with the same strategy that it used to distrupt $INTC. So long as $AMD's organizational properties persist, it's a matter of time before its GPUs are atleast as competitive as $NVDA's. The latter has a strong software moat, but even a moderate gain in GPU marketshare could lead to considerable returns for $AMD shareholders.\n\n8. In the Q3 conference call, Lisa Su said $AMD has made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in the Datacenter GPU business, with \u201csignificant customer traction\u201d for the next generation MI300 chip. Additionally\u2013and in line with previous guidance\u2013Lisa Su said on the call that AMD Datacenter GPU revenue will be: $400M in Q4 2023, implying a 50% QoQ growth of the Datacenter business; over $2B in FY2024. Q4 earnings will therefore be pivotal for $AMD.

{"title": "Blackrock BTC ETF does not insure against theft/hacking, and on the Coinbase custodian side, only $100 million is insured?", "selftext": "So I was reading the [prospectus for the Blackrock BTC ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust). And I noticed the following excerpts. \n\nFrom page 82, it seems the maximum amount that Blackrock can recover from Coinbase in a case of hacking/theft of BTC is only $100 million:\n\n> the Bitcoin Custodian\u2019s aggregate liability in respect of each cold storage address shall not exceed $100 million\u037e\n\nFrom page 81, it seems that Coinbase has a maximum insurance of $320 million among all its customers (I assume not just ETF customers, but also regular people who have opened a Coinbase account):\n\n>Coinbase Global maintains a commercial crime insurance policy of up to $320 million ... ... The insurance maintained by Coinbase Global is shared among all of Coinbase\u2019s customers,\n\nAnd on page 33, it seems that even if an internal Blackrock employee went rogue and stole all the Bitcoins, Blackrock won't insure against that either:\n\n>Although the Trust\u2019s transfers of bitcoin will regularly be made to or from the Trust\u2019s account at the Bitcoin Custodian, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Trust\u2019s bitcoin could be transferred from the Trust\u2019s account at the Bitcoin Custodian in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts ... ... To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third-party or is incapable of identifying the third-party which has received the Trust\u2019s bitcoins through error or theft, the Trust will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred bitcoins. The Trust will also be unable to convert or recover its bitcoins transferred to uncontrolled accounts. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\n\nThe general idea I get about the Blackrock BTC ETF prospectus is that there really isn't any insurance, and if there is any hacking/theft of Bitcoin and the ETF collapses, there is no protection against you losing everything. If this is the case, this is a shame, since I was hoping there was more protection mechanisms to hold a BTC ETF over holding BTC yourself (if I pass away and I hold a BTC ETF, at least my BTC ETF can be left for my family members through inheritance, but if I hold BTC and my family members don't know my private key, my BTC is lost forever).", "id": "199pjym", "created_utc": 1705582604.0, "score": 364, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0664312019944191}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "\"ohh no, blackrocks CEO died and he was the only one with a password to the laptop!!\"", "score": 59, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07722533494234085}, {"body": "These are things are giving spacs a run for the money in terms of worst performing asset..", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10801611095666885}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03860647976398468}, {"body": "You don\u2019t need to be a genius to see that BlackRock is simply going to work and manipulate BTC prices just like the CCP has done in the past. \n\nBlackRock: Sell a bunch of calls, sell a bunch of BTC through foreign subsidiaries to drop the price and collect from those sold calls.\nNothing to protect consumer from an unregulated cryptocurrency", "score": 221, "replies": [{"body": "yeah blackrock is only going to buy the bare minimum and ftd the rest to scalp as much as possible", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": ">**ftd** the rest\n\nWas gonna ask.

For example, Coinbase may want to buy more than $1 billion commercial crime insurance (which would come closer to covering the 24 hour BTC trading volume at least), but the insurance company is charging much more for $1 billion commercial crime insurance versus $320 million.\n\nIt's 2) that I am worried about, because perhaps the insurance company knows something that we don't, and the insurance company doesn't view Coinbase's security against hacking/theft as good as you and I view it.  In theory, if everyone viewed Coinbase's security against hacking/theft has rock solid, **including the insurance company**, then Coinbase should be able to buy a much higher commercial crime insurance amount for a lower insurance cost, rather than the $320 million they have now.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6133678555488586}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5217217803001404}], "tickers": ["recovery"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.366491436958313}, {"body": "No one is as sloppy as FTX.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Mt.
