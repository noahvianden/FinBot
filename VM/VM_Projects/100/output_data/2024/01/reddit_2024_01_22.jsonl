{"title": "#3 reason why I'm backing out of Google in my portfolio: Chrome updates Incognito warning to admit Google tracks users in \u201cprivate\u201d mode", "selftext": "[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/chrome-updates-incognito-warning-to-admit-google-tracks-users-in-private-mode/](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/chrome-updates-incognito-warning-to-admit-google-tracks-users-in-private-mode/)  \ndisclaimer: I do still own GOOGL/Alphabet, but started backing out of it in early 2022. I would say that between individual stocks and mutual funds it is still 8% of what I own.\n\n  \nI'm seeing a downfall of trust with the platform, its draconian limitations on discussing things that are perfectly legal - but that go against Google employees' likes - via Youtube, not to mention the mass criticism of how bad the search function has become (compared to why we all liked the search function years ago).\n\n  \nGranted, Alphabet has more going for it than what the common user interfaces with, but it's that lack of trust on so many levels that has me worried about it being as solid of an investing platform in the future. If a person can't trust it to give unbiased search results, or to allow unbiased discussions or how-to videos (of perfectly legal topics) on its video platform, and if one cannot trust it to cease tracking everything one does - what company or country would be foolish enough to trust its highly sensitive data on Alphabet's servers?

{"title": "Tesla is 1T+ valuation easily", "selftext": "Now I won\u2019t go full regard on you guys and say you should 0DTE calls or 7DTE calls. But I do think in the coming few months, Tesla will rally big and can end this year with a 1T+ valuation. \nWhy?\nFSD (Full Self Driving) \nWe all know other car manufacturers are catching up to Tesla\u2019s electric cars. Their range is similar, they drive well and the only reason now to buy a Tesla, is because of the supercharger network that is unmatched in US (which is also slowly being opened to other cars). So yes, it\u2019s true tech specification wise, other car manufacturers are catching up and at this rate they might catch up in a few years in sales too. But Daddy Elon has an ace up his sleeve. \nThat ace is Tesla Self Driving. Full disclosure, I own a Tesla with FSD, and I own other cars and I can confidently say no other car manufacture is even attempting to do what Tesla is doing. The closest I\u2019ve seen is some videos of Chinese car manufacturers attempting something like Tesla, but the bottom line is Tesla is way ahead of the competition, rest of the competition is not even trying. \n\nThe only issue is that even though Tesla is way ahead, their product is kind of garbage. You can\u2019t use it with any consistency so it makes no difference to the user experience with or without FSD. It certainly does not affect sales of Tesla cars in any significant way. But I have strong reason to believe this product will follow a trend like ChatGPT. \n\nFor all you regards who entered AI in the last year, you probably have no idea of the real history of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. It was not a linear continuous improvement. It was not we kept slowly getting better with our chatbot and finally it became good enough to become ChatGPT. No you see, it was a sudden step size improvement that shocked most researchers in the field. You see OpenAI released GPT1 which could barely spell correctly and seemed useful for pure research. Then OpenAI released GPT2 which had a lot of hype because researchers were \u201cafraid\u201d of releasing it to the world and when we finally saw it, it tended to create grammatically ok sentences but most of the time it was incoherent and didn\u2019t even make as much sense as a toddler. Then came GPT-3, at which point OpenAI was spending millions upon millions training this model. GPT3 and 3.5 seemed kinda useful if you prompted it really well. In fact many companies popped up that just prompted GPT3 really well and created text for copywriting etc, but a good 50%+ of the time you used to get nonsensical responses. It didn\u2019t feel like you were talking to a human. There was a general feeling among researchers I spoke to, that this scaling experiment from OpenAI failed, there is a missing piece to human intelligence etc etc. Then suddenly came ChatGPT, it always held a conversation with you. Yes it could give you wrong answers, but it always gave answers that made sense, you understood what it was trying to convey to you. This proved OpenAI\u2019s thesis that just scaling worked .\n\n\nAll this to say that it looks like the technology does not work until it just suddenly starts working. Tesla is now doing the same thing for FSD that OpenAI did, they are using pure scale, the human hand engineering has been pushed to a minimum. This in my view is the correct approach to self driving, and so in the coming year with the release of Version 12, the first end to end neural network trained Self driving model, I think they will have made the breakthrough needed to solve driving and the market has not priced this in. Version 12.1 has reportedly started going out to select customers, which is why I\u2019m so confident that EoY is a good timeline for Tesla. It will be the second big revolution that occurs due to AI. 1T+ to me seems easy, much more likely to reach 2T+ eventually.
