{"title": "PayPal to launch AI-based products as new CEO aims to revive share price", "selftext": "Jan 25 (Reuters) - PayPal is launching new artificial intelligence-driven products as well as a one-click checkout feature, the company said on Thursday as its chief executive tries to inject new life into the payments giant.  \nIt is the first major announcement under Alex Chriss, who joined PayPal in September, and the new products are another example of how companies are trying to tap investor enthusiasm for AI, which helped drive U.S. stock markets to record highs this month.  \nInvestors hope Chriss, who was previously a senior executive at software company Intuit, will revive PayPal's stock which is down more than 22% from January last year due to margins which have underwhelmed investors. Chriss has called 2024 a \"transition year\" for PayPal, and has promised to grow revenues beyond transaction-related volume.  \n\"The data that we have and our ability to actually see what people have bought and know what merchants are trying to target, that's where I think AI is the huge opportunity for us,\" Chriss told Reuters in an interview.  \nPayPal will this year roll out a platform that uses AI to enable merchants to reach new customers based on their prior shopping history, using data from the roughly half a trillion dollars' worth of merchant transactions it has processed globally.  \nMerchants will also be able to use a separate AI-based tool called \"smart receipts\" to recommend personalized items to shoppers in their email receipts, along with a cashback reward.  \nPayPal is introducing a \"one-click\" checkout feature called Fastlane, which in early testing has accelerated checkout speeds nearly 40%, along with new features for Venmo business profiles, the company said.  \nThe S&P 500 index climbed to its fourth straight record high close on Wednesday, fueled in part by a rally in technology stocks on AI optimism. PayPal reports fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 7.

{"title": "Some thoughts. Perspective.", "selftext": "Alright. The short-term results are not great and it's been feeling like that for a while now. I think we need to take a bit of perspective as I'm seeing so much bias and misinformation my mind was almost starting to go off course.\n\nSome context here: French guy. English teacher, been to the US/CA many times. Lived in NA for a few years. Always been interested in predicting the future. I remember in the late 90s/ early 2000s asking my dad why people were still buying Kodak cameras and why cars were not electric (which of course, he answered in perfectly rational and practical arguments). Started following tesla  kind of late in 2017, went all in in 2019, at the lowest point, after patiently waiting for years. Been ridiculed so many times in 2019 for investing in \"a company that's going to go bankrupt\".\n\nAs I said the short-term results are not great. But whoever invested in Tesla for the sole car business is insane.\n\nLet's talk about the car business though. No legacy automaker can make a good electric car profitably, including the market leader, which is actually the worst-positioned. The only guys who can do that aside from Tesla are the Chinese, and although they are good at it they lack brand image.\n\nLet me tell you something as a teacher: most students are crazy about Teslas. Not just because they are new, but because they get it, unlike many boomers. Also, and I'm not kidding, 95% of my students have iPhones. Which wasn't the case a few years ago. See, brand image takes time to fully develop itself.\n\nAnd it's going to be the exact same for Tesla. Currently a vast majority of people who are looking for a new car are just clueless. The media has done an amazing job at spreading misinformation about EVs and more particularly Tesla, and it's fucking insane. But even if they hadn't, adoption takes time. And I'm not worried about iPhone sales, the same way I'm not worried about Tesla sales in the long run.\n\nStory time: after I bought my model 3 in early 2021, 5 people around me bought one including 4 in 2023. Including my in-laws, who are 65. When people see things for themselves they understand, but often they do need to see it from someone they know.\n\nAnother story: my dad told me yesterday \"hey did you see how Teslas don't work in the cold?\" - he literally sees me going to work every day with below freezing temperatures but still believes the media. Keep in mind we are in France so he saw it from the French media. Even though it happened in Chicago.\n\nTo sum things up: legacy auto sells to boomers, the news loves to trash Tesla, zoomers will buy Teslas like they buy iPhones.\n\nNow that we're done with the car business, let's talk about FSD.\n\nYes, Elon has overpromised and underdelivered. Progress seems slow. But his fundamental thesis is still intact: photons in, controls out. Just like a human. I truly believe that this is the only approach that will work on a large scale. Waymo is great but geofenced, and costs 200+k per vehicle! Looking at FSD12, and even prior builds, it absolutely is an AI, not a hardware problem. How is LIDAR going to help you in an edge case scenario? I think we can all agree that current interventions in FSD are inference and understanding problems, not hardware problems. It is going to take a lot of time to be perfected enough (I do think we need AGI) and once we get it it will need regulatory approval which will take a long time, but it is the only scalable approach.\n\nNot even taking other products into account.\n\nTL;DR: Car is fantastic AND profitably made, with Apple-like brand image. Adoption will take time but future generations are much better informed.

If you don\u2019t, you have to buy NVDA shares so you have some for me to buy from you. \n\n\nYou\u2019ll buy them for $900 each and get $100 from me for each one, giving you a loss of $800 each. Each option contract is for 100 shares so your loss is actually $80,000. You get to keep the original $100 ($1x100) I paid you for the call option. So in the end you\u2019ll be down $79,900. \n\n\nIf NVDA keeps going up then the price you have to buy the shares for me will keep going higher, widening your loss. \n\n\nNormally when you sell a call your broker will make you have some collateral on hand. If I bought the call from you when NVDA was $100 a share, the broker probably would want $100x100x30% = $3,000.  \n\n\nAs NVDA goes up, the collateral requirement will go up. Normally the broker will just liquidate your position to stop you from losing more money than you have but sometimes they\u2019ll give you a chance to deposit more money to allow you to keep your position open. \n\n\nIf the share price moves up rapidly from $100 to $900 then you could easily have the $80k loss with only a $3k account. In which case your broker is going to freeze your account and demand payment. If you don\u2019t have it they\u2019ll sue you and maybe consider a payment plan. If you still can\u2019t manage that you\u2019ll have to declare bankruptcy.", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "If I were to instead buy call options instead of sell my downside would only be the premium I paid for it and upside could be unlimited right?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.
