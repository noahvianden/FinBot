{"title": "Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge rose 0.2% in December and was up 2.9% from a year ago", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/26/pce-inflation-december-2023-.html\n\nAn important inflation gauge released Friday showed that the rate of price increases cooled as 2023 came to a close.\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s personal consumption expenditures price index for December, an important gauge for the Federal Reserve, increased 0.2% on the month and was up 2.9% on a yearly basis, excluding food and energy. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective increases of 0.2% and 3%.\n\nOn a monthly basis, core inflation increased from 0.1% in November. However, the annual rate declined from 3.2%. The 12-month rate is the lowest since March 2021.\n\nIncluding volatile food and energy costs, headline inflation also rose 0.2% for the month and held steady at 2.6% annually.\n\nThe release adds to evidence that inflation, while still elevated, is continuing to make progress lower, possibly giving the Fed a green light to start cutting interest rates later this year. The central bank targets 2% as a healthy annual inflation rate.\n\nMarkets took little notice of the data, with stock futures indicating little change at the open and Treasury yields mostly lower.\n\nAs inflation drifted closer to the Fed\u2019s target, consumer spending increased 0.7%, stronger than the 0.5% estimate. Personal income growth edged lower to 0.3%, in line with the forecast.\n\nThe data indicated that consumers are dipping into savings to pay for their expenditures. The personal savings rate fell to 3.7% for the month, down from 4.1% in November.\n\nWithin the inflation numbers, prices for goods declined by 0.2% while services prices rose by 0.3%, reversing a trend when inflation began to spike. As the pandemic forced people to stay home more, demand for goods spiked, adding to supply chain problems and exacerbating price increases.\n\nFood prices increased 0.1% on the month while energy goods and services rose 0.3%. Prices for longer-lasting durable goods such as appliances, computers and vehicles decreased 0.4%.", "id": "1abjaix", "created_utc": 1706278459.0, "score": 237, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The M2 money supply is almost the same level it was in 2019 as a percentage of GDP. Not everyone agrees with monetarists but they don't disagree the impact of QT while it's the money supply increasing sharply that made many warn of inflation before the fed would admit to it. \n\nIn the same way that the Fed was too slow to increase rates and tamper QE, they can also be too slow to drop them.", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Do we really think 5.5% is too high though?

Some will say that its not just interest rates, but supply chains going back to normal, and sure, that has some part to play, but we can't suggest inflation was a result of low rates (not supply chain issues), and disinflation was only supply chains (not interest rates). In reality its a mix of both. \n\nOver the decades interest rates have fallen as population growth slows and the baby boomers go into retirement. We saw the same in Japan. Those demographic trends are more much more similar in the US in the 2010s than 1980s. I'm not sure I buy the argument that the entirety of the 2010s rates were just the unwinding of the financial crisis, a period of twelve years when asset prices largely bottomed out in the first four. And rates in the 2010s weren't just low, they were effectively pushed into negative territory with how much QE was increasing the supply of money.\n\nHave we really gone from effectively negative rates to rates not seen in several decades? I personally doubt it. A number of commentators seem to suggest the long run neutral rate may have increased, say in the 2-3% range, but we don't (and can't) know either way, as JPow frequently mentions. Even then that's still significantly below 5.5%.\n\nWhat we do know is the GDP has increased significantly while the money supply has been decreasing. How long is that trend really sustainable for? There other trends too that seem completely unsustainable, one is high government spending holding up the economy, another is a frozen house market which has only not crashed due to the increased prevalence of cash buyers and a decrease in sales. Its also meant some industries such as furniture stores have taken a nose dive. As a whole things are fine right now, but all these trends can't continue forever, something has to give eventually.
