A decrease in consumer prices is bad! Without much evidence to support it, the assumption is that a reduction in consumer prices will create a negative feedback loop that will cause Recession. \n\nEnter, The Federal Reserve. Their Keynesian mandate: a 2% year-over-year increase in consumer prices, and they\u2019ll inflate the money supply at what ever level is necessary to achieve this.\n\nThe result is that the entire benefit of any productivity increases that should have been realized by the consumer through reduced prices is stolen by The Federal Reserve through monetary inflation.\n\nThe primary benefactor of this becomes the government, who will realize a relative reduction in the real value of their massive debt and deficit burdens, allowing them to rapidly expand both - in real terms, not just nominally - as shown in the charts above.\n\nThis works, effectively, as an average 100% tax on all productivity gains that society has generated (and will generate) since our abandonment of sound money in the early 1970s. \n\n\\---\n\nYou are a squirrel gathering nuts. You are allowed to keep only what you gather, less capital gains tax, of course. The only entity allowed to grow in real terms and in league with the technological advancements of humanity is the government \u2013 and this will continue until we return to sound money that is backed by something finite. \n\nThis is a lesson that has already been taught by history before. It\u2019s the entire reason the country was founded on sound money to begin with, and, sadly, it\u2019s a lesson that\u2019s going to have to be eventually retaught again.
