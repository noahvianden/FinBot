I maintain that Copilot integration into teams will be a big selling feature and will boost MSFT's bottom line.\n\n2. I maintain that Copilot actually does markedly improve search results.  It mostly weeds out a lot of the blatant selling generated by google's algorithm.  I still find it takes 3 or more attempts at refining the query to start to get the results I want, but it's still preferable to scrolling through pages of irrelevant ads.

I quickly wrote a data plotter in Python to ingest JSON and plot the data using matplotlib. The data needed to be transformed into the correct reference frame etc. I am not saying doing this task is hard, however using Copilot allowed me to do the mundane translation function in about 5 seconds instead of 2-3 minutes, and aided with some other basic functionality that would just waste my time to do it myself.\n\nDo I believe Copilot can \u201cinnovate\u201d and see what you need to implement in code past the next few lines of code? No, I don\u2019t.\n\nDo I believe Copilot does the easy bits that waste my time and allow me to focus more on the bits that require planning?
