{"title": "(Bloomberg) Apple Vision Pro deliveries are delayed to March", "selftext": "\"*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.* \r  \n\r  \n*The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple\u2019s website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited \u2014 or something in between.*\n\n*Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.* \r  \n\r  \n*With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.* \r  \n\r  \n*The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn\u2019t comment on the sales performance of new products.*\r  \n*Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that\u2019s \u201cimmaterial.\u201d*\n\n*Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset \u2014 making it cheaper and more comfortable \u2014 and find compelling applications for the device.*\r  \n\r  \n*In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it\u2019s under particular pressure in China. The company\u2019s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters \u2014 its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*\n\n*Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*\r  \n\r  \n*It\u2019s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren\u2019t too tight.*\n\n*Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever \u2014 about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*\r  \n\r  \n*The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals \u2014 a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer\u2019s field of view \u2014 in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.* \r  \n\r  \n*And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*\r  \n\r  \n*Another concern that\u2019s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google\u2019s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*\r  \n\r  \n*But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they\u2019ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls \u201cspatial computing.\u201d*\r  \n\r  \n*To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.*\r  \n\r  \n*A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn\u2019t have a closed-in feel \u2014 a complaint with VR headsets.*\r  \n\r  \n*\u201cFrom the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.\u201d*\r  \n\r  \n*That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer\u2019s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. \u201cIt was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,\u201d Rockwell said.*\r  \n\r  \n*Apple also developed an interface that doesn\u2019t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*\r  \n\r  \n*One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they\u2019re in the same place.*\r  \n\r  \n*\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,\u201d Rockwell said. \u201cIt changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.\u201d*\n\n.................................\n\n*https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/apple-to-get-first-taste-of-consumer-demand-for-3499-vision-pro/ar-BB1gVwvZ*\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "19c5iic", "created_utc": 1705850131.0, "score": 268, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 135, "comments": [{"body": "VR PornHub fridays delayed?

We evolved to sense the world in stereoscopic 3D. We recognize faces so well because our near-field vision kicks in the detailed and fast visual recognition that our brains adapt for. Our near-field vision is responsible for us instinctively backing away when someone invades our personal space, and on the positive side, is why we tend to get our largest doses of oxytocin when face to face with our friends and family, because it hits differently when someone is right there - our brains are tuned for it.\n\nWe see people up close in full scale, and we hear sound coming from people's lips in 3D space.\n\nVideocalls and phonecalls fail to represent all of this meaningfully, and they certainly don't facilitate shared 3D spaces to actually do things in together, which is why people use videogames to hang out online instead of videocalls. We yearn for that togetherness with people we are close to but aren't physically with. The world is a big place, and there are lots of distant friends/families, in addition to many places and live events that people want to but will never get to go to.\n\nYou could have all sorts of fun and useful experiences with others: \n\nConventions, festivals, concerts, fishing, golfing, work conferences, museums, talent shows, talk shows, stage plays, recording booths, dance clubs, movie theaters, music video creation, virtual photography, virtual schools, virtual offices, sports stadiums, new virtual sports, painting and sculpting, birthday parties, acting and roleplaying, paintball, tabletop and card games, regular video games, and so on.\n\nThese don't need to be literally as perfect as the real thing because you are facilitating connections that wouldn't happen in real life in the first place (or can spice them up and go beyond real world physics). My friend 3000 miles away is not suddenly going to be able to go to a movie theater with me tomorrow. I can't suddenly travel 5 hours on a whim to see my favorite band. There's only 5 band members and they can't be everywhere at once.\n\nWhat you'll get in the end as VR matures are experiences which, on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being a 2D screen and 10 being real life, would feel like an 8 or 9 much of the time. They would feel divorced from screens and have more in common with real experiences - **that is value**.\n\nThat also tackles many of the aspects of VR as a medium - it is a place to explore media, stories, experiences, and even your identity in new ways through avatars, and that is also value. \n\nThis is what VR is - a medium of exploration and a tool of connection, facilitating this in ways that no other device can.\n\nHere are some other usecases in more detail:\n\n- Replace existing screens with a more versatile virtual screen of any size, any angle, any amount, curved or flat, 3D or 2D, it can follow you or be stationary and returned to, and can be shared via other AR or VR users across the globe.\n\n- Tour real world places in the past or present all over the world with a perceptual sense of being there.\n\n- Attend a fully virtual school or university where it can be like a magic school bus ride where you tour the earth and solar system in real scale or go inside blood cells, making learning more fun, varied, and hands-on, with the ability to eliminate physical bullying, travel, and have a wider recruitment range for teachers.\n\n- Try on clothes at home to your exact size by using holograms and seeing the materials in different colors/lighting and with physics applied.\n\n- Have a personal instructor (not an AI, a human) show up right in front of you to assist you in all sorts of things such as a personal fitness instructor who could virtually bend your joints to get you to more easily follow along.\n\n- Use it to explore identity freely with the ability to switch gender/race/species/body-type and feel like you have ownership of that body due to the body transfership illusion.\n\n- Perform as an entertainer in new ways through dancing, acting, and talents unhindered by physical laws, and create new art in 3D space using sculptures, animated paint, and visuals not possible in reality, or create existing 2D art on a virtual canvas that can be undone, saved, easily traced, with no mess or gathering of tools.\n\n\nAR is a whole other beast.

{"title": "Disney to at least $120", "selftext": "Please do your own due diligence this is just based on my findings. Disney's Business model has to the best of any other entertainment company. They make money in the box office (hopefully) then they add it to streaming, where it attracts more and more people to pay for Disney+. This is relatively standard for most entertainment companies, but here is where things take a turn. The most successful movies they can add as rides to their theme park, crafting whole new worlds, and these childhood memories are something the children who go there will remember for the rest of their lives, turning some of them into lifetime Disney fans for life.  The only other company who does this is Comcast, owning Universal Studios, but I think Disney is much stronger due to the fact that CMCSA is heavily oriented around Harry Potter, and zero new content is coming out from that franchise. Their Nintendo  partnership stands to benefit them, hence the success of the Super Mario Movie. Universal is rapidly gaining ground, however Disney announced a 60 billion dollar in its parks over the next 10 years... I don't know if that will fully materialize., but if it does, it will be a huge blow to Comcast.\n\nThat was a very very basic image of their business model. I didn't even mention the rapidly growing segment that is cruises, licensing, merchandise, etc. There are other posts about Disney in AI link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/19bbjb3/dis_the_mega_ai_bull_case_for_disney/).   \n\nWhen we get into the multiples this company looks even more attractive. Price to book is 1.6, forward PE is 21, and although I never use PEG as a reliable metric it is only 0.49. In 2019 (fiscal) the profit margin for DIS was almost 16 percent. If we can reach the point where streaming gains offset losses from linear TVs decline, (expected to generate later this year!) margins could return to 10ish percent is my estimate, which when you apply revenue growth means that it could have a PE below 10 in coming years if the price remains stagnant. I think next year will be better for Disney's box office, I think they could break or near 1 billion on two films this year, Deadpool 3, and Inside Out 2, which might pull them out of their slump and take things back to normal with their box office woes. When you combine all these factors, my calculations gave it a fair value of 122.66, but do it yourself before investing!\n\nI'm surprised you read to the end of this, have a great Sunday!\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "19c4y08", "created_utc": 1705848498.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|17|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n^^[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14559097588062286}, {"body": "I couldn't be any happier than this...I log into Reddit and immediately see two bullish posts in WSB about Disney.
