In 2 CC sales, with the first bought to close, I\u2019ve captured about 5% premium relative to my underlying basis. I used part of that to briefly put a collar on (bought puts while I had CCs on) and captured a bit more when I sold to close. My effective net is about -4.5% on the position. \n\nCurrent CCs are 2/23 37 strike. I\u2019m not going to roll those at this time. Just sitting and letting theta work. I prefer to not roll often, and I prefer to sell CCs on up days. I\u2019ve been staying on news around the stock, and I\u2019m not seeing indication of meaningful/decisive downside catalysts. Earnings are right before my CC expiration (2/20). All of this adds up to possibility for a bounce, and I don\u2019t want to be greedy chasing premium. \n\nThe best action now is no action, letting time work. If the stock stays down, cool. I can buy to close right before earnings to uncap upside. By that time, buying to close will lock in nearly full value on the CCs if MOS is still down. I could sell to open a day or two after earnings to let the market process the earnings call. \n\nIf the stock were to run through my strike, I would assign out having locked in 7% vs my basis in < 60 days. \n\nUpside and downside possibilities are acceptable and managed. \n\nI hope there\u2019s value for people reading this in terms of thinking through position management and considering both upside and downside possibilities for positions.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3420589566230774}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good buy", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18259018659591675}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02091284468770027}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Just depends, could just be some recently bias around seeing this happen more often.
