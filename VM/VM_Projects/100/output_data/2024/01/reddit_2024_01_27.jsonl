I think sentiment sucks, I think Elon could potentially find means to crater the stock. I think there is *a lot* to root for in this company, but the sharks of issues surrounding it means I would rather wait to see if there is a large discount after we potentially see a correction in the broader market.\n\nShort term, however, I believe we see a large bounce, as one does in Tesla when it hits these levels of oversold on the hourly timeframe. We are talking <15 RSI on the 4h chart, and oversold on the Daily, more then 25% below the 200MA. There's a lot of calls here for a strong bounce >200 and possibly to 230 before the month is over. It's happened **many** times before with Tesla, and will likely happen again.\n\n**That being said, lets look at then numbers.**\n\nI see plenty of people here talking about how Tesla is doomed now and is \"just another car company now\" because BMW and Cadillac are both making EVs, which are both getting to Level 3 autonomous driving before Tesla. But just googling for five minutes will tell you that both of these companies are nowhere near positioned to overtake Tesla, and if anything they are in a better position for Tesla to just simply buy them out to shut them up.\n\nThese are all TTM for 2023, and I am simply going to just look at the range of prices for each companies **cheapest** EV options.\n\n**Tesla**\n\nOperating Margins - 14.3%\n\nTesla cars sold - 1.8 MILLION\n\nCheapest EV - Model 3 - $38 to $50k\n\nOperating margin per vehicle - $5300 - $7150\n\n**Cadillac**\n\nOperating Margin - 6.98% **<<< Half of Tesla's operating margin**\n\nCars Sold TTM - 147k **<<< Less then 90% of Tesla's volume**\n\nCheapest EV - Lyriq - $57 to $61k **<<< 22% - 47%  More expensive than Tesla**\n\nOperating margin per vehicle - $3970 - $4250 per Lyriq (?)\n\n**BMW**\n\nBMW Margins - 17.58% **<<< Better then Tesla**\n\nCars sold TTM - 360k <<< **Less then 70% of Tesla's volume**\n\nBMW i4 - $52,200 - $61600 <<< **22% - 36%  more expensive then TEsla**\n\nOperating margin per vehicle $9000 - $10829 <<< **Better then Tesla**\n\nSo, yeah, BMW makes more profit per vehicle but their volume is astoundingly less then Tesla, Tesla simply has the factories and the verticals to support their tremendous growth. And on top of that, Teslas are MUCH cheaper then both these two examples which I am seeing brought up multiple times in this chat.\n\nLevel 3 driving is great, but at least for BMW it's going to cost $6000 to install. What if Tesla decides to simply include it in their most expensive model trim at cost? It's going to be like $70k to get Level 3 in a BMW when a Tesla will let you have it for $55k? It's a no brainer. You buy Tesla.\n\nI'm not even going to go into the charger stations. No \"car company\" is going to try and compete in that space. Tesla owns 58% of the charging station market. Any of these companies trying to compete against Tesla are still feeding into Tesla's margins because they will depend on them to charge their vehicles. Just wait until you see a day when traditional gas stations start implementing EV chargers throughout the midwest. Tesla will be the go-to.\n\nListen, i'm not a Tesla shill. But even outside of charging stations and EV vehicles, their other verticals still make billions and you don't even hear about them. So just be thankful when there's a dip because there is good reason to see Tesla being a 1 trillion dollar company this decade.\n\nEdit: I also want to add, with Cadillac and BMW we don't even really know the margins for their EV line up yet. It will take at least a year until we can be confident that they are actually breaking any ground in profitability, or if they are straight up taking a loss at these prices.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "You missed the point entirely.
