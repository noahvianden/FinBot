{"title": "MGT shooting through the roof today!", "selftext": "McAfee Global Technologies ($MGT). Has been discussed ALOT in here over the past 5 days and it is worth another mention. \n\nAs you know John McAfee has been announced CEO of MGT which sparked the stock to go from $0.30 to currently $2.80. Plenty of DD in this sub. This was just a PSA.\n\nMGT, which is run out of Harrison, New York, said it would buy the D-Vasive assets for $300,000 in cash and 23.8 million restricted shares of MGT.\n\nMGT and its subsidiaries primarily acquire and develop intellectual property assets, including social casino and gaming platforms.\n\nCurrently trying to figure out where this is going and if there is any estimated valuation following these announcements.\n\nEdit: $3.13 now. This might hit 100% today. But, my DD couldn't find a basis that would support the stock price. Could be a big bubble.\n\nEdit 2: 5/17/2016 Tuesday. Hit an all time high of $5 before dropping back down. The hypetrain never stops. Realize this is already 2000% above what it was last week.
