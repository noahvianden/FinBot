W\n\nThe physiological means of insulin secretion in the periphery (the brain has it's own insulin centers) where the pancreas secretes insulin directly into the portal vein, it is taken up in the liver, and carries out it's actions.\n\nInsulin has localized effects in tissue. Subcutaenous insulin is known to induce lipohypertrophy, which is largely *cosmetic* in nature, but it can also induce localized insulin resistance in areas that repeatedly receive it. But the areas where it is injected commonly make use of the insulin regularly, too, just not to the same extent. Also because of the way the insulin is prepared and absorbed, the amount of local effect it has through injection is negligible.\n\nIn the lungs it's a very different story, and there are different mechanisms for absorption and distribution into the systemic circulation. Lungs absorbing insulin is different than skin absorbing insulin. Anyone with a decent understanding of the localized/systemic effects of insulin, and understanding of pharmacokinetics, volume of distribution, and all that other fun stuff (ie: endocrinology researchers, pharm researchers, and post-graduate level biochemists in the field) would be able to elicit the inherent differences in the absorption and distribution, and the potential for risk that this carries.\n\nThe lungs are used as a vector for transmission of several drug therapy regimens, but typically the response is desired *in the lungs* (acetylcysteine for CF, corticosteroids/beta-agonists for asthma/bronchospasm, nasal vaccines for IgA specific upregulation in lung tissue for immune function in certain very new vaccines). The response of insulin in the lungs would be an undesired/potentially adverse reaction to administration of insulin via these means.\n\n**TL;DR**: It *is* very different.
