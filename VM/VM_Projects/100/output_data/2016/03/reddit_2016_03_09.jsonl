Please forgive me. Fuck that. And worst yet, I can't even cover. I have to watch my money plummet, minute by minute.\n-5.61% so far.\nEDIT:\n-6.77% OK enough, you can stop now. Go back up please.\nEDIT 2:\n-7.02%... It just doesn't stop, does it? Holy mother of fuck fucking god. For an index that was already down 33% before today. This ought to be a fucking joke. Please tell me someone hacked bloomberg to feed false data. When do we hit a circuit breaker? WTF is going on\nEDIT 3:\n-7.91% THIS IS JUST INSANE HOW THE FUCK CAN AN INDEX PLUMMET 8% IN A DAY ESPECIALLY AFTER LOSING 33% IN LIKE 3 MONTHS WTF IS GOING ON\nEDIT 4:\n-8.02% I can't take this shit anymore. I just keep refreshing and I am in total disbelief. What an utter fucking scam. Fuck that, fuck that and fuck that.\nEDIT 5:\n-8.36%... I didn't even think such large one-day drops were possible. What the fuck! How is that even possible? We know China is slowing down a little, but not by 8 fucking percent! I bought YINN at $20.72, how much trouble am I in?? I can'T even see because the market isnt fucking open but if i could i would sell my yinn right now and go full yang. this must mean its going back up\nEDIT 6:\n-8.45% Looks like we finally hit a bottom. I lost 25% of my investment on YINN. To say that I spent all week-end feeling terrible for not buying more YINN. This is some fucked up shit.\nBut at this level (semi-stable), I would certainly add to my YINN position. I would double down. I think we are going back up, perhaps -5% for the day.\nEDIT 7:\nLooks like I called the bottom 100%. What do you think YINN will open at tomorrow? $16?$17? Maybe I can keep my loss beneath 20%. 20% in a fucking week-end.\nEDIT8 : WHAT THE FUCK THIS ISNT OVER -8.56% THE SELLOFF IS RESUMING HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE BREAK CANT COME TOO SOON\nI am most likely averaging down on YINN tomorrow. There is no way this one can keep dropping. Just no way at all.\nEDIT 9: Can't sleep. At least it has stopped dropping. It has been ridiculously stable at -8.45% for the last hour or so. Will stay online watching it until 9:30AM tomorrow morning.\nEDIT10: -8.98% im actually lauhing right now this is just ridiculous.\nEDIT11: RALLY TIME!!! Can we finish in the green today, Reddit? The chinese bank knows no limit.\nEDIT12: OH YES -6.96%! GO GO GO!!!!!!! YOU CAN DO IT BANK OF CHINA!\nEDIT13:\nRALLY TIEM! -6.01%!

{"title": "Professional Stock Trader: Ask Me Anything (AMA) About Trading Penny Stocks", "selftext": "I have been trading for a living since 2002 and have been consistently profitable since 2004. I trade stocks of any price but generally focus on ones in the $1 to $100 price range. I prefer small cap stocks in the $2-20 range but will trade anything that is liquid and has the volume that is needed to really move. I generally don't trade stocks under .50 unless they have a specific catalyst. The reason for this is the SEC started cracking down on pump and dumps in October 2014 and began halting OTCBB and Pink Sheet stocks. Pump and dumps were the only penny stocks that were liquid enough to trade. There are 8000 OTCBB and Pink Sheet penny stocks out there but a majority of them are highly manipulated and illiquid. A lot of people are interested in these kind of stocks but I can assure you that you no longer have an edge and are near guaranteed to lose money due to them being illiquid. The absolute worst of these are the sub penny stocks trading below $.01 per share. These stocks are often compared to gambling in a casino and you have very little chance to profit in them.\n\n\nMost of the world is completely clueless about the stock market and especially what goes on behind the scenes in penny stocks. I am sure that as you read all the question and my comments below you will see many of these people posting and taking offense to what I say about the reality of the penny stock market. I feel it is finally time to show what it really takes to be a successful stock trader. Please understand that I am talking about trading (day trading, swing trading) and not investing. Trading (short to medium term) and investing (long term buy and hold) are completely different. I focus on technical analysis/ and statistics. Low priced stocks have no fundamentals so fundamental analysis is generally irrelevant especially for companies that do not earn a profit, and very few if any penny stocks earn a profit. Even for a high priced stock if you are a day trader the fundamentals are basically irrelevant except on the day earnings are released, but that only occurs 4 times per year and there are 246 other trading days in the year so it makes sense to ignore the fundamentals for the most part in short term trading.\n\n\nI will be happy to answer people's questions. Please refrain from asking questions about whether you should buy XYZ stock as I am not a registered investment adviser and I am not legally able to provide this sort of advise.\n\n\nBefore you ask your comment please read through the questions asked by others below. I am not going to answer the same question multiple times. Also please post the question here for everyone to see or if you prefer to keep it private, post in a pm, but please do not do both.\n\nIf you like what I have to say... great.

Your book is incredibly generic for someone with 14+ years experience. You throw out generic percentages as though it was researched: \n\n* \"For Instance 99% of books written on trading will tell you to follow the 50 and 200 day simple moving averages...\"\n* \"Since 95% of people are wrong at timing the market it is logical to conclude that the herd is almost always wrong.\"\n* \"This scenario will happen to you 85% of the time!\"\n\nBased on this, you'd just do the opposite of these percentages and you'd make money. Then there is contradicting advice. In one section you outline how 99% of classical technical analysis is useless then you quickly follow that on the importance of \"Support and Resistance\". Any practitioner of technical analysis will tell you the two are intertwined: SMA, MACD are both indicators that outline areas of support or resistance. Then there is just advice I've never heard before: \" Buy when a stock is approaching support, and sell when a stock is approaching resistance.\" I never heard of someone advocating for limiting your upside by selling on approaching resistance.\n\nBesides the lack of helpful advice in your book, the worst point is how you advocate against falling into the trap of buying into professional trading alerts/dvds but then this is followed up by an advertisement to enroll in your own trading course. \n\nSince this is an AMA, my question would be what was the point in writing a book/course to share your strategies?

I use Medved Trader for charting.\n\n\n How do you choose your trade sizes? I have a large account and usually risk .5% of my equity on a trade.  \n\n\nWhere did you learn to be successful?

Volume can tell you whether price movement is legitimate or not. A lot of manipulation goes on in the market. Sometimes stocks rise real quickly when not too many shares are being traded or stocks fall sharply when not too many shares are being traded. In both cases a lack of volume would mean the price increase will most likely not be sustainable and a reversal or a pull back are possible. 2. Higher the volume means? Higher volume means there's big institutions or large traders that are causing the move up or down. If you can get on the same side of the market as them you may be setup to profit nicely. On top of this you need volume to enter and exit a stock. It's less the case when you have a very small account and may only need to trade a few hundred shares but when you are trying to trade larger positions if a stock is illiquid, this mean the volume is low and you can't get in and out when you need to. This is a transaction cost known as slippage and it's an addition to the commission you pay to your broker. Why do you like the 1-2 million volume stocks? I have a large account with over a million. I trade usually 5000-50000 shares. I don't wan't to be trading all of the volume in a stock because then my orders will move the price. Even with a smaller account you still don't want to trade lower volume stocks because volume is what makes stocks move and to make money you need a stock to go up or down. Low volume stocks can move quickly but it's kind of a mirage because you can't really profit off of those moves because of the ways the market making algorithms are programmed to take advantage of the less informed small market participants. On top of this even when you are trying to trade a few hundred shares, if a stock has like 50000  or 200000 volume, you aren't going to be filled your full position if it's more than 100 shares and you could end up paying 2,3 or even 5x the commisions to get into the stock.  3. When looking at charts, are these where you find the \"patterns\" you speak of? Patterns form due to various reasons. One reason is that trades are looking for the patterns to form and therefore they do, which is a self fulfilling prophecy. Another reason is the algorithms used by the market makers and big institutional traders are computer programs which repeat the same process over and over again. On top of this there are other types of patterns like seasonal patterns that occur due to weather (for example oil stocks usually due better May through November due to warmer temperatures and therefore a higher demand for gasoline.) Is this also called a trend? A trend is defined as a period of higher highs and higher lows in an asset like a stock, commodity, bond, option, etc. So stocks move in waves and therefore when they pull back you want the bottom of that pull back to be higher than the previous one. A down trend would be the opposite.  When using Ameritrade and each trade costs 15-20 dollars and you have around 3-4K, how much of your portfolio % should you risk to maximize in profit? (I heard you shouldn't ever invest more than 20%) but this is irrelevant because 20% of 3k is nothing. Ameritrade is a shitty broker as is scottrade (the worlds worst) and and may others that charge like 15+ per trade. With that said when you only have $3-4k you are in a bad position. You really can't execute proper money management which is how traders are successful in the long term. You need enough capital so the expected price movement in a stock will cover the commissions on the trade and give you enough of a profit to merit you spending the time and resources to be involved. This really means taking a decent size position but you can't do this. You have to put all your money in each time and if you get some bad luck you can lose all your money in one trade. My suggestion would be to spend time educating yourself about how the market works, even if it takes a couple years and in the mean time save more capital to add to your account. The general rule is don't put more than 15-20% of your account into a trade and down't risk more than 1%. This isn't really possible unless you have $100k or so. If you can risk 3-5% that would be okay but you have to understand that any money you put into the market which is not put into a safe longer term investment like a index fund or some high dividend blue chip stocks, must be risk capital. This means you need to be comfortable losing every last penny of it. The reality is you could get bad luck and lose every penny and on top of that if you need the money for something else, it will cloud your judgement and make you trade based on fear and greed and this is a recipe for disaster.\n\nHope this helps.
