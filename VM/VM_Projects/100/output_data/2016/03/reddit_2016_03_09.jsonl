Please forgive me. Fuck that. And worst yet, I can't even cover. I have to watch my money plummet, minute by minute.\n-5.61% so far.\nEDIT:\n-6.77% OK enough, you can stop now. Go back up please.\nEDIT 2:\n-7.02%... It just doesn't stop, does it? Holy mother of fuck fucking god. For an index that was already down 33% before today. This ought to be a fucking joke. Please tell me someone hacked bloomberg to feed false data. When do we hit a circuit breaker? WTF is going on\nEDIT 3:\n-7.91% THIS IS JUST INSANE HOW THE FUCK CAN AN INDEX PLUMMET 8% IN A DAY ESPECIALLY AFTER LOSING 33% IN LIKE 3 MONTHS WTF IS GOING ON\nEDIT 4:\n-8.02% I can't take this shit anymore. I just keep refreshing and I am in total disbelief. What an utter fucking scam. Fuck that, fuck that and fuck that.\nEDIT 5:\n-8.36%... I didn't even think such large one-day drops were possible. What the fuck! How is that even possible? We know China is slowing down a little, but not by 8 fucking percent! I bought YINN at $20.72, how much trouble am I in?? I can'T even see because the market isnt fucking open but if i could i would sell my yinn right now and go full yang. this must mean its going back up\nEDIT 6:\n-8.45% Looks like we finally hit a bottom. I lost 25% of my investment on YINN. To say that I spent all week-end feeling terrible for not buying more YINN. This is some fucked up shit.\nBut at this level (semi-stable), I would certainly add to my YINN position. I would double down. I think we are going back up, perhaps -5% for the day.\nEDIT 7:\nLooks like I called the bottom 100%. What do you think YINN will open at tomorrow? $16?$17? Maybe I can keep my loss beneath 20%. 20% in a fucking week-end.\nEDIT8 : WHAT THE FUCK THIS ISNT OVER -8.56% THE SELLOFF IS RESUMING HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE BREAK CANT COME TOO SOON\nI am most likely averaging down on YINN tomorrow. There is no way this one can keep dropping. Just no way at all.\nEDIT 9: Can't sleep. At least it has stopped dropping. It has been ridiculously stable at -8.45% for the last hour or so. Will stay online watching it until 9:30AM tomorrow morning.\nEDIT10: -8.98% im actually lauhing right now this is just ridiculous.\nEDIT11: RALLY TIME!!! Can we finish in the green today, Reddit? The chinese bank knows no limit.\nEDIT12: OH YES -6.96%! GO GO GO!!!!!!! YOU CAN DO IT BANK OF CHINA!\nEDIT13:\nRALLY TIEM! -6.01%!
