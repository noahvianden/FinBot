{"title": "My trades since Brexit", "selftext": "http://imgur.com/a/M6Emy\n\nThese trades were all done after a somewhat yolo of my entire account at the time (~4000$) that brexit would go through and cause market panic for at least a little while, i have family in the UK and that event seemed way too close to call.  Put all my money on some relatively short term puts and pulled out a little over 100% overnight.\n\nMy previous experience in trading anything is literally just advice from a friend who did well for himself in the 08 crash, i had made a few long term way way OTM put bets that never really paid off.  The brexit bet was  my first real YOLO.\n\nMy only rules were basically never get too greedy, very limited trading when my sleeping schedule was fucked up, and only yoloing with money I won from the market to begin with (i had to deposit some of my savings to daytrade)\n\nI basically set a value I thought the market was 'supposed' to be at (2160) and bought calls or puts accordingly.  I do not feel comfortable holding calls since most of my option buys were around 30 days out, and the market typically hasn't jumped more than 1% up, but volatility makes calls worth absolutely fucking nothing real quick.\n\nMy next big play is essentially all-inning on SPY puts about 60 days out when/if VIX goes under 11.\n\ntl;dr high volatility buy calls low volatility buy puts ez money ez life. also i'm retarded and just throw money in extremely high risk options just hoping to get lucky", "id": "564wth", "created_utc": 1475753411.0, "score": 388, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "Take notes, this is a good wsb post. more like dis plz", "score": 175, "replies": [{"body": "Don't tell me what to do.
