Then, when the partnership was announced along with good numbers, stock immediately went up since the deal happened and the first reaction is positive. Later, people got more info on the deal and realized PYPL didn't make some kind of great deal that's a huge win-win. The deal was probably neither a winner or loser, and there is now a lower probability of a takeover than there was yesterday.
