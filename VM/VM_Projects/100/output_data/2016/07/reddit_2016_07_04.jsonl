Imagine two people running around a circular track. If you stand still, you and the runner will be at the same place twice a day.

When the day is over, both clocks read 12:00. It took 720 days.  \n\nAlthough to be honest, I *was* wrong. It won't be 1440 days and 237 years respectively. It will be half that, so 720 days and 117.5 years are how long it will take before the clocks match again.  This is because I was calculating on 24 hours, but really clocks are 12-hour instruments.
