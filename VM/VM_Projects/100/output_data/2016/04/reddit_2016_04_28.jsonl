As an example, a lot of sim racing players have claimed that their racing times have been significantly decreased (meaning that they are faster) when using the Rift. This is because their view of the road is much less obstructed, so they can watch for curves quicker and pinpoint when to brake for turns better. At some point, I think professional players will have to get into VR because it will provide a huge jump in their performance.\n\nYou should really try VR if you haven't already. Some games, like Elite Dangerous, are unplayable on a regular monitor after you've played it in VR.\n\nSome more of my own thoughts: I think the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift that are shipping to customers now are more of an extended (and expensive) beta program. Shipping has been horrible, and there's not many fully fleshed out games available right now. Honestly, I think the only people that will appreciate expensive VR right now are the competitive gamers, VR enthusiasts, and software developers.
