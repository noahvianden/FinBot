Let me recap:\n\n\n**BAD:**\n\n1) Shitty phone nobody needs. Dismal sales numbers so much so they won't even release numbers for it. \n\n\n2) No chance against chinese companies making better phones at half the price and it's only going to get more competitive. No chance in India where a great phone can be had for 150.00.\n\n\n3) Ecosystem is dead. Apps is over. I haven't bought an app in so long and I own both platforms.\n\n\n4) Apple cannot produce anything comparable to google/microsoft in big data space. Machine learning? no. Voice recognition/digital assistant? no. Decent maps? Don't make me laugh. Self driving cars? Are you fucking kidding me??? I wouldn't trust their engineers. VR/AR? Good luck with that. They don't have the raw R&D knowhow for this.\n\n\n**GOOD:**\n\n1) Bunch of money they are going to use to do buy backs so their execs can cash out their stock. This is short lived strategy.\n\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\n\nEn fin, nothing on horizon. The best they had, iphone 7, is a dud. The gravy train on apple is over. Look at the technicals. It's down down down. Lots of people have made tremendous gains and will take their winnings now that market value is plummeting.\n\n\nSELL SELL SELL. You can buy back in a year when the hype for iphone 8 comes out. Till then, it's all misery.\n\n\nOk, off to listen to my sweet $1000 shiny black iphone 7 in its big ass case cause it scratches like a motherfucker.

We use those every day. \n\nYou could argue the push towards electric cars is happening. Well, shit, electric motors have been around for almost as long as IC engines.\n\nSimilarly, the principle behind batteries has been known since before we had any fucking use for batteries.\n\nJust because someone is old doesn't make it obsolete. Something being old is a good reason to innovate it, not chuck it. The statement that 3.5mm jacks are the same today as they were in the 60's is a lie. Back then, they didn't have jacks for simultaneous audio in and audio out (as we do today, with headphones that have mics on them). The ways of using these jacks we have today didn't exist in the 60's (e.g. card readers, light meters, etc)  How about instead of occasionally bitching about the challenges of making them waterproof, people actually figure out how to make 3.5mm jacks waterproof? \n\nI could argue on and on about this, but it all boils down to one problem: Apple is effectively run by a fuckwit industrial designer, Jony Ive. It's clear that this idiot is behind idea generation today. That's not what his job should be.\n\nI essentially make my living consulting on different aspects of product design (mostly medical and consumer/business electronics, today), I have since before I graduated college. I have seen scores of awesome companies and products destroyed when industrial designers were given too much control over things. Their one job should be to package other people's ideas nicely, not to actually come up with ideas. The ideas should be generated by executives and product manager teams that review advances in technology, as well as consumer demand and market gaps, and figure out ways to use new technology to close market gaps and satisfy consumer demands. \n\nApple is not doing this.

I already said this in my original post, but allow me to reiterate this point. If I'm going on a fucking trip, I'm already going to be on the lookout for an available outlet to charge my phone. I have zero desire to do the same for my headphones.\n\nEdit: As far as regression goes... Let's set aside the topic of headphones for a sec. Can you name a single note worthy innovation that's come from Apple since the iPhone 4? It doesn't matter if it's a full product, a kind of software, or even just a single feature. Personally, the only thing that comes to mind is the way LiPo batteries are arranged in the most recent MacBooks, and even that isn't even much of an innovation. Everything else, just about, has been a circle jerk around bringing somewhat novel industrial and graphic design theory/concepts to mass produced goods.

Case in point: wireless concert mics. The problem is [the most basic if these systems are quite hefty and out of the budget of typical consumers](http://www.samash.com/concert-288-all-in-one-dual-channel-wireless-system-i-band-swc288aix?cm_mmc=Google-_-Microphones-_-Channeladvisor-_-Samson+Concert+288+All-In-One+Dual-Channel+Wireless+System+I-Band&utm_source=GGL&utm_medium=CSE&utm_campaign=Channeladvisor&CAWELAID=500002510000037898&gclid=CjwKEAjwu8m-BRDM8KTcjdj8qy0SJACdjSZpzSAhuZFdJRQDQvFFCEZn7N2d3yf-6lNeAhYczc_32RoCfErw_wcB).\n\nWhat most people don't understand is that whenever you deal with digital-analog conversation (or vice versa), there is only so much room for miniaturization. At the end of the day, you are restricted by the size of capacitors, resistors, and inductors. The sizes of these components are determined by the way certain properties of certain materials factor into equations that are used to design circuits. The only way to create more miniaturization is to either discover heretofore unknown elements and compounds, or to make new mathematical discoveries. It's not too likely that any new relevant materials are going surface any time soon. Similarly, I can assure you that no revolutionary math is going to be discovered either - 90% of electronics are built on math from the 18th century or earlier.\n\nBluntly put, wired audio provides the absolute best ratios of quality to cost to complexity; there's a reason why *all* studio recording is wired, even though 99.9% of studio recorded audio ends up being converted to digital signals sooner or later.\n\nYou have to understand that you, as a (most likely) relatively young North American or Western European guy, with relatively few economic challenges, might not mind charging a Bluetooth headset once a day so that you can listen to music for an hour or two. But a South American truck driver, who will listen to hours of audiobooks on his phone, with extremely limited access to outlets will hate that idea. Middle class parents will not want to buy their kids costly wireless headphones, which their kids will lose or destroy (most likely by fucking up charging cycles). Hell, there are days when I use headphones for upwards of 10 hour a day. I don't want to deal with charging them, or with charging my phone even one extra time to accommodate the greatly increased power consumption.\n\nBattery tech will certainly increase but, once again, there are enormous limits to what can be achieved. There have recently been some minor improvements in lithium battery tech, mostly related to safety. But the last time we saw anything resembling a breakthrough in battery tech was when lithium batteries appeared on the market...which was more than 15 years ago.\n\nBut even assuming that angels descend from the heavens and give us immortal batteries, with unprecedented size:power ratios, next year, we'll still run into the first issue of audio quality... If you want to match the performance of $30 Sony earbuds, you'll still need much bulkier equipment that will cost upwards of $200, granted our battery angels don't also bring us an endless supply of new nano electronics with unprecedented physical properties.\n\nTrust me dude - this is coming from someone who has a much better first hand understanding of the industry than you - the whole push for wireless audio may be great for technically minded, upper middle-class folks and other people who can be placed in the market group of \"people who'd buy a smartwatch\", but sucks for just about anyone else.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "While I see your point in some areas, you also have to understand that the same exact argument was made vs computers in the beginning stages.  \n\n\"It's too expensive, we don't have the right technology, it's not worth it, there's no actual use for it, we already have &lt;insert blank here> I don't see the point.\"\n\nOriginally it took massive amounts of space and electronics to have next to nothing compared to what we have today.\n\nIf someone doesn't push for it then it will ever happen.\n\nAnd your point about people in massively remote areas honestly doesn't mean much to Apple in particular because that's *not the target customer*.  I see why you brought it up regarding headphones though, and your completely correct.\n\nBut again, these people in particular also probably won't buy *an 800$ phone*.\n\nAnd in regards to your recording studios argument, again, obviously *not the target customer*, but one day it could be.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Keep in mind, various audio technologies have been around for well over a century.

I don't mean this in an SJW way, but that's a somewhat ignorant view. First off, [only about half of Apple's revenue comes from the Americas, both north *and* south](http://www.statista.com/statistics/382175/quarterly-revenue-of-apple-by-geograhical-region/). Second, you don't have to live in a jungle for multiple wireless gadgets to be impractical. I mean, chances are that if you live in NYC, you'll probably be reluctant to carry an extra thing (no matter what, wireless headphones will have more bulk than wired ear buds, with which are an arbitrary little thing that you don't notice in your pocket) and you'll be very reluctant to have to find places to charge it. If you commute for 1.5 hrs a day via subway and listen to music and he whole way (very reasonable assumption, if you live in Brooklyn and work in Manhattan), as well as during the day, you're going to have to plan your charges and may very well have to interrupt your normal music listening schedule. You're also going to have charge your phone more, to compensate for increased power consumption, thereby shorten the useful service life of your phone, since frequent charging kills rechargeable batteries.\n\nNo matter how you spin it, the world is not currently set up to benefit from the abolition of the 3.5 mm jack, since there are no better alternatives to it, and probably will not be in the foreseeable future.\n\nWith that said, plenty of people will still buy iPhones and Apple won't die this year. The problem is that Apple's products will appeal to fewer consumers. This is a process that has been happening more and more. \n\nI'm a former die hard Apple fan. By the time iOS 7 came out, I realize that I couldn't tolerate how counterintuitive and closed Apple's whole ecosystem had become. The candy color scheme and flat design seriously clashed with my sense of aesthetics, and was the final straw that made me switch to Android, which I absolutely love. More or less the same thing happened to my entire family. It's also happened to plenty of my friends. \n\nAs I said in my original post, Apple products are ceasing to be about actual user experience and instead becoming an exercise in intellectual masturbation around artistic concepts. Almost all of Apple's recent projects, starting with iOS 7, have been better suited for an industrial and/or graphic designer's personal or academic portfolio than for consumer use.\n\n\"Courage\" makes for great portfolios and concept work that provides inspiration for industry development.

The trade-off for this design, to keep the processor within temperature and power requirements meant that the processor could not run as many instructions per clock. This resulted in poor performance for single-threaded applications.\n\nOf course, most games were still heavily reliant on one thread to do most of the work. The result (that pretty all reviews gave) was the processor was significantly underperforming when compared with Intel's CPU's. (It's not that the CPU didn't have the processing power, it just was not being utilized).\n\nCPU architecures take a long time to develop, and AMD has been stuck with the bad design decision for these last 5 years. Over this time AMD lost quite a lot of its market share, and as a result its share price tumbled.\n\n\nSo this now brings us to Zen and why there is so much hype. It is the first opportunity for AMD to release a new architecture that finally addresses the single-threaded performance and make up the gap in performance compared to Intel's chipset. It will finally be able to offer much stronger competition and as a result will be likely to regain some of its lost market share.\n\nRemember, AMD does not need to outperform Intel (Although it would be good if they do) as long as Zen is close enough in performance but at a lower price they will regain market share.\n\nAlso, based on the Zen architecture there will be a new range of APU's (Integrated CPU, GPU). This is an area where AMD is actually the market leader, NVidia do not have a license to produce x86 based CPUs so cannot compete, and AMD have better graphics card technology than Intel. (AMD APU's are what most of the current consoles use, including XBox One and PS4)\n\n\nIn summary,\nI think AMD has a lot of potential with Zen, and I think the highest probability is the share price increases alongside increased market share.\n\nAlso, the release of the extra shares will actually be used to pay down the debts (as well as fund their agreement with Global Foundaries) - less debt = less interest on those debts. This actually improves AMD's financial position.\n\n\nI hope this helps to provide you with some more insight about the company (from my understanding).\n", "score": 136, "replies": [{"body": "Oops..
