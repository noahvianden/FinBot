In the meantime, I wouldn't worry too much. Here's some things to consider:\n\n-From my understanding of the video, the Roam system essentially looks like a powered air-cast or brace that provides extra support superior to wearing a conventional version. Great for certain applications, but the human wearing it is still in charge of generating the power. Roam lacks a rigid structure/hydraulic that can provide the same amount of support, strength potential and force generation. \n\n-There is hardly any information on how the Roam suit actually works besides saying \"high performance nylon\" and \"air pressure\", and no demonstrations of it working as a system. The video shows an elbow-joint piece of Roam being activated and gently molested by someone to \"prove it's durability.\" I wonder how much abuse it could take in a military context. \n\n-Ekso has somewhere around 60 patents, and is way ahead of Roam in R&D, development, marketing, and customer base (already being used in hospitals across the country), and is the only one with an FDA approval for stroke rehab. I could see Roam being used for rehab of less severe injuries or broken bones, though a cost-benefit over traditional casts/braces would have to be performed, and if it would delay the healing process by doing too much work for the patient. \n\n-Ekso has a huge contract with the military for the DARPA'a Warrior Web program: http://ir.eksobionics.com/press-releases/detail/566/ekso-bionics-selected-for-development-of-next-generation\n\n-Ekso has smart, adaptive software that \"learns\" from the wearer's capabilities and adjusts itself (ex: the suit will support a stroke patient with a weak left side more on the left than on the right)\n\nI'm not counting Roam out, as I think the product has a good concept and a lot of applications, but I don't see it out-competing Ekso of its target users. \n", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "The more troubling thing is that he left EKSO, not the possibility his new company will outcompete it.
