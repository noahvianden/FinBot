I think my thing is this: I definitely don't think there's \"one way\" to invest. People are great traders and if you are a great trader, fantastic. There's a lot that I look for when I'm looking for a company - and I posted that elsewhere in this thread - but when you really break it down, I'm simply looking for what I believe to be great companies that I think are going to continue to be relevant because they are part of a theme (pet ownership and increasing amount of $ spent on pets, water, demand for infrastructure in the age of Big Data, digital payments, etc etc etc....), serve a well-defined need or other factors. Buy and hold generally equates with \"owning JNJ\", but I don't think buy and hold has to be \"boring\". I generally own things with the intent of owning something for 3-5 years +. However, if a couple of decades from now I'm still owning something, fantastic. \n\nThe end result is being less day-to-day because what I'm looking for is things that I have long-term confidence in (and therefore, require the core homework of listening to conference calls and doing research, but I'm not sitting there fretting about every move up and down each day.) If the market is down 500 points, it's never fun but I calmly look to see what I want to add to and I already have my shopping list so it becomes do I want to add to anything. It's not trying to tweak and micromanage in advance of every Yellen speech and other event. Add a little here on occasion, sometimes take a little profit if I feel it's prudent (the data center REITs a couple months ago) and otherwise a lot of sitting on hands. I actually like researching, so the time that would be spent trying to make trades is instead spent researching. It's just an approach that I (and I emphasize I - again, I'm not saying there's one way to invest) is a lot less stressful. \n\nAs for the GPRO thing, I definitely think that people can absolutely make money on things like GPRO initially, but people have to time the turn. I think the concern that I have is that a lot of people don't separate the hype from the investment.

Until then, nothing else matters: not billions in buybacks, not dividend increases, not little purchases, not the pipeline, not anything. It's been joked in the last year or two that \"Good news for Gilead is bad\", but after the last couple of quarters, it's started to become apparent that \"Good news for Gilead is bad, but so-so news is even worse.\"  The last couple of quarters were not *terrible*, but the stock certainly reacted as if they were. Gilead waited patiently rather than being a buyer during the biotech run-up, but the company's patience has not been admired or rewarded (or understood, as the question is now more at the forefront in conference calls.)\n\nPeople need continued patience with Gilead because as much as that's an issue, the environment in biotech is dismal and likely to change substantially; it's well apparent that the healthcare system in the US needs massive change and if the price increases of recent years are no longer going to be tolerated (now it's EpiPen and Mylan, soon enough it'll be something else), then people have to think about the implications of that when they consider investing in healthcare.\n\nThat's not really an in-depth analysis, admittedly, but it is really the core of the issue with Gilead. The market is looking past Hep-C and going: what else you got? Gilead basically is heavily built upon two purchases that were absolute home runs and people might have to really be patient for the next act (and again, in the meantime you're likely going to have further uproar over costs.)  \n\nGilead is a good company, but I think people keep trying the stock because it screams value (and in the $70's it really is discounting a lot) from a surface examination.

I thought it was undervalued.\" Gilead is undervalued - I totally agree with you - but I think I just emphasize some caution from the standpoint of just because it's undervalued doesn't mean that that necessarily changes any time soon to prepare anyone who is reading for the idea that it may be a longer wait.\n\nIt is rather amazing at the way that Gilead is treated by the market, almost as if it's just going to be a depleting asset. It's remarkable to me that it's in the $70's again, but I think looking at the charts, it looks like the $76ish level is not out of the question. A while back before the last quarter, I said on here (or r/investing, forget which) that if it broke below the Feb low around $81ish, it was going into the $70's and in the upper $70's, it would be too tempting to ignore. I got in and then got out before the quarter. I am usually much more long-term in my view, but I just remained concerned that the \"good news is bad, anything not good is worse\" mentality for Gilead had not changed. Sure enough....here we are back in the $70's. \n\nIf this were to break down further (and it wouldn't have to be because of something Gilead did, could be political pressure on pharma, could be any number of broader things) and get around that $75 area, perhaps I'll try again.\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I see.

I think they have to start moving a little more aggressively with new concepts and being a little less reliant on Chipotle. People thought this would bounce back overnight, but more patience is going to be required and a complete return to form is by no means guaranteed. I like Middleby (MIDD), which isn't cheap at all and not something I'd recommend at this point, but there's a company that provides cooking equipment to all these companies: Dominos, Starbucks, Subway, Chipotle, McDonalds, Chik-Fil-A and many, many (many) other major chains count themselves as customers. When you make a bet on a valued supplier like that, you're not reliant on a particular chain doing well (and people are fickle, what's hot today may not be so hot a year later), you're dealing with a company that sells to ev-er-y-body. \n\nAs for Chipotle and the customer being fickle, everyone acted like the customer would be loyal.

Couple thoughts:\n\n1. It concerns me a little bit that there is what appears to be some degree of \"groupthink\" on r/stocks that someone throws out some ultra microcap and then people pile in. It's gambling, especially in regards to these biotech microcaps that people talk about on here so often. **I mean, look at the microcaps discussed in this thread - I'm seeing a number of the same things appear multiple times**.\n\n2. A lot of the microcap stuff can easily be pump and dump or simply a \"good story\" that turns out to be a lot less than hoped.\n\n3. I have some view on a lot of industries and larger cap names. I have no idea about a lot of these tiny stocks that have less than 100M market cap. It's just not at all what I'm looking for, so I don't devote that time to it.\n\n4. The reason why I approach investing the way that I do is not because I think it is the \"one right way\" or something. It's simply what's right for me, and what's right for me may not be right for someone else (different risk tolerance, yadda yadda yadda.) That said, the reason that I take the approach that I do is because I don't want to sit there checking prices all day. I don't want to babysit stocks. I don't want to gamble on little companies and go, \"what fine mess did they get themselves into now?\" every time news comes out. I don't want to be stressed every time the market is down 500 points. I've never come on here upset about a particular name because if something I own is down, I'm looking to see if it's an opportunity. \n\n5. The approach is not complicated - if anything, I think this is not a bad philosophy to go by: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle. People sometimes add a lot of unnecessary complexity because they think they need to. \n\nIt's simply own great, well-managed companies with the intent to own for the long haul. Reinvest dividends. Re-allocate all the time spent stressing over every move up and down and all the time spent figuring out trades to researching stocks and trying to find other companies as potential candidates to add to the shopping list - and I think having a shopping list is something I recommend for everyone. If the market is down 500 points, it's great to have ideas in mind for things you want to add to or buy rather than starting from square one and scrambling to think of something to buy when the market is down. Knowing something that you want to add that's on your shopping list is a high quality decision. Scrambling to buy something to buy something because the market is down and you think you should be is not.\n\nPTX = No idea about the company. Negative book value, debt is about 6x market cap. 52 week change: -86%. If someone looks at this company and has a genuine knowledge of the science behind what the company is doing and believes that there is a turnaround possible, okay. If you're buying this because \"it's down a lot\", then no. I'm really, really of the opinion that I want great companies with great management that I don't have to babysit and I can just be confident that smart management will do smart things to grow the company. It's less fuss, less stress and I don't have to sit there micromanaging the investment and looking at every move up or down.\n\nCGC.TO. I don't hate the Canadian microcap pot stocks as much as it goes back to the idea of not wanting to babysit something. I'd rather just own Scott's (SMG), which is getting into providing growing equipment for pot in a significant way. Shareholder friendly, large multi-billion dollar company that offers a nice dividend yield. I can have a play on pot and not have to really think about it/worry about it. Or, as others have mentioned, big tobacco will be on top of pot the moment it is broadly legalized; they have the scale and they have the infrastructure. So, I don't hate these names, but not my thing.\n\nATVI: ATVI is certainly not cheap, but it's a well-run company and while I don't have any game investments I think it's a fine place to be as long as game studios walk the line with micro-transactions. From a gaming standpoint, micro-transactions are an annoyance, especially as gamers start to feel more and more nickel-and-dimed. If studios keep it reasonable, it's the gift that keeps on giving from the standpoint of investors, as Take Two (TTWO) literally said about GTA Online (http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-s-online-mode-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving-take-two-says-about-its-monetary-opportunity/1100-6418882/).\n\nURRE: What's the deal with this appearing multiple times in this thread? No idea, sorry.\n\nAIM.TO. Again, no familiarity. It IPO'd in 2005 and the performance since then is not really acceptable, although you've had these periods of growth then periods where this has tanked (2008, then it has lost in 2014, 2015 and 2016). One of the things I look for is great management and relatively consistent growth; companies that basically hit the ball year in/year out. Long-term growth stories that are steady, consistent performers. \n\nYou may have reasoning for AIM that is perfectly valid, but just not really for me. I mean, basically this is what I'm looking for.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is what I'm looking for. Again, I am not saying that this is \"the one way\" by any means. It's simply the things I am looking for when I am looking for potential long-term investments - and really, I buy with the intent to own for the long-term. I'm tired of all the trying to time this, that and the other. I'm not going to re-position and re-think for every Fed speech, I'm not going to try to endlessly tweak and stress over what I own and this is an attempt to find those longer-term names where I don't feel as if that's required.\n\n1. Moat. I do not buy something if I don't feel the company has a moat/barriers to entry. That's really a huge thing to me, as I'm buying businesses that I want to own for 3-5 years and - hopefully - beyond. I do not want anything where I feel that someone else can do the same thing tomorrow. Whole Foods was a growth story and Whole Foods believed that no one else could do what they do. Well, no: everyone could do what they do and soon enough, they did. Whole Foods has admitted as such and now the growth story is over. They are scrambling to do this (open up smaller stores in an already overcrowded grocery market to emphasize their cheaper 365 product when they should have been doing that years ago in anticipation of the inevitable point where everyone would do the same thing), that (rewards program) and the other (be more promotional.) \n\n\n2. Part of a durable theme. I try to identify what I believe are durable, long-term themes that I want to capitalize on. This can be as simple as a continued rise in pet ownership and spending money on pets. It may be something like the era of big data and associated infrastructure. It could be an acceleration away from B & M retail as more and more retailers face the reality that retail is overbuilt in this country and store counts are going to shrink. It could be something like more and more people growing their own fruits and vegetables and greater consumption of prepared/fresh as the freezer section declines. It may be alternatives to traditional sweeteners as people move away from sugar, yet still want sweetness in their drinks and foods. It could be many things. When I say durable, I mean....\n\n\n3. ...not a fad. I do not want to have to babysit investments, I don't want to try and sit there and time the cooling of a trend and I definitely have no interest in trying to chase trendy investments. People can do very well with fads, but most people do not: the fad cools considerably and people don't exit it (see GPRO). I don't like apparel, I don't like fickle consumer plays - and the consumer is ultimately fickle. Michael Kors (KORS) was an incredibly hot stock until it wasn't. To quote \"Project Runway\", \"As you know in fashion, one day you're in. And the next day, you're out.\" Have no interest in that. Also have no interest in...\n\n\n4. ...drama. Especially stupid drama. Lululemon (LULU) has mostly done well for investors over the years. I'll question the moat, but beyond that, shit like promoting your clothing has seaweed in it and then it doesn't makes my eyes cross. I have no tolerance for inane bullshit like that.\n\n\n5. Quality management. I want shareholder-friendly management that has consistently demonstrated a track record of shareholder returns. Look at some of the greats: look at John Malone's Liberty companies. Look at Danaher. Look at Bill Stiritz, formerly of Ralston Purina, now of Post Holdings. Berkshire. Markel. BAM.  Middleby. Casey's.\n\n\n6. Stable, consistent growth. I am looking for companies that hit the ball year in/year out. Fiserv is a fine example. Danaher. Visa. Ecolab.\n\n\n7. Tangible assets. I do like to devote a good deal to tangible assets, including even things like land and water rights play Limoneira (LMNR), as well as a number of REITs and other companies (pipelines, infrastructure, etc.)\n\n\n8. Needs. Does the company satisfy a need/address a problem? While not every investment is going to focus on \"needs\", a good deal of them do. Ecolab: giant hygiene and sanitation company: restaurants and grocery stores need to stay clean and follow food safety standards, hotels need to get rid of pests, etc. \n\n\n9. Compelling valuation.\n\n\n10. Dividend is a plus, most things I own pay a dividend, whether tiny or significant (or in-between.)\n\nBonus: I tend to like companies higher up the pyramid that deal with all of an industry rather than a specific player or just broader plays in general.\n\nTo offer an example of the kind of thing I'm talking about, rather than betting on a particular chain restaurant I'd rather bet on a Middleby (MIDD) that sells equipment to any restaurant and they are an enormous innovator for a lot of things that are behind-the-scenes at Starbucks, Subway, Chipotle, Chik-Fil-A, Dominos and elsewhere. Thermo Fisher is another one of these sorts of \"picks and shovels\" plays, only for science.\n\nAdditionally, for those who watch to watch a highly entertaining CEO speech, here's one from the Middleby CEO from a couple of years ago at the Baron Funds Conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL-jQwpZ5Ag\n\nIn terms of a broader play, I like Visa as a broad play on consumer spending where I'm getting something that will benefit with greater consumer spending, whether it be online or B & M, and I don't have to bet on a particular retailer that may or not may not have the right mix of products this quarter or may go through any number of other problems.) With Visa, the concerns are regulatory and to some degree technological advancement, it's not betting on a clothing retailer who didn't have a good quarter because they got stuck with too many Winter clothes during a warmer-than-expected Winter. Inane stuff like that starts to get into #4 above.\n\nLastly, I also like to focus on companies with considerable recurring revenue. Ecolab is heavily consumables that have to be reordered frequently.

I also don't care for Square's management.\n\nGilead needs to buy something. Until then, nothing else matters: not billions in buybacks, not dividend increases, not little purchases, not the pipeline, not anything. People need continued patience with Gilead because as much as that's an issue, the environment in biotech is dismal and likely to change substantially; it's well apparent that the healthcare system in the US needs massive change and if the price increases of recent years are no longer going to be tolerated (now it's EpiPen and Mylan, soon enough it'll be something else), then people have to think about the implications of that when they consider investing in healthcare.\n\nBlackstone has enormous talent and incredible assets and the issue that I have with it and the rest of the private equity MLPs (well, aside from OAK, which is different) is that it's 10 steps forward and 9 rapid steps back when the cycle turns for private equity. Perhaps that changes eventually, but that's the issue that I have: it's so an example of fantastic when the environment is great and absolutely awful when it isn't.

This will probably never happen, but I think I can I can kind of envision it as a subsidiary of a Dollar General.

On the flip side, I look at a brick and mortar retail industry that has basically put its head in the sand and hoped Amazon would go away. As I've said elsewhere, I think we are entering the next phase of the decline in malls and what I call the end of the \"mall era\". \n\nMacy's CEO admitted the other day that retail is overbuilt in this country. Well, duh: the amount of retail sq ft per capita in the US vs other developed nations is ridiculous. Either this is dawning on him now or he's just now willing to admit it. So B & M retailers will have to shrink their store counts over the next few years and I don't see where the deep bench of potential tenants is for all of this big box mall space. Anchors are going to leave and that will create a domino effect, particularly for C/D-level malls and strip malls. Sears is gone within a year or two. Gap, JCP, Macy's, Nordstrom, Office Depot and others are going to have to shrink. They all let Amazon grow unchecked in the manner it did, similar to how Sears didn't take Wal-Mart seriously enough years ago.\n\nSo, if I'm Macy's and I have to shrink my store count...now what? Put more effort into online and try to go against Amazon NOW? Yeah, I don't think so.  A lot of traditional retailers are going to be in a squeeze from the standpoint of they're going to have to be very creative to find new growth avenues. Amazon is by no means cheap, but rarely has it ever been, either. It's a volatile stock, as well. Looking out, I only see e-commerce sales growing and AWS is a compelling growth story.\n\nJNJ = Not cheap, but just something that you can own and not think about.\n\nBA = I'm a little more partial to LMT, but I think BA is fine. The other thing that people aren't aware of and that is actually a really interesting little company in the industry is Heico (HEI or the HEI-A shares.) That's not cheap at all, but a pretty exceptionally well-managed platform company that has been exceptionally successful at acquisitions over the years. \n\nDIS = It has not done well this year because of continued concerns over ESPN. I'm not going to play down the concerns because they are legitimate concerns and ESPN is a huge part of the company. However, if you have any sort of long-term view, I think you own Disney and look for an opportunity to add a bit more. Exceptional management will likely figure out ESPN's issues, it just isn't going to be overnight.\n\nGOOG: I'd love to see a greater level of success in terms of Alphabet and its \"other bets\" - today they basically are merging Nest with another division - Nest, which they paid a ton for. That said, I think what I do like is the fact that the company is diversifying away from what has been their core. Apple's problem is that they have been reliant upon the iPhone for years now and it should have been well apparent that there was eventually going to be a maturation in the smartphone market and to start to prepare for that eventuality. However, they really haven't. I like Alphabet, but again, I think you almost have to own Alphabet as much for the company that it is trying to be 5-10 years down the road as for the company it is today.\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Very interesting to here your viewpoints on those.
