I am personally willing to put in some money and incorporate an LLC and start a Kickstarter so that we can pool some funds together and get majority ownership in a nano-cap company (per WSB's choice, of course!) for laughs. We will attend shareholder meetings, pay lawyers to push for a liquidation through Chapter 7 and return the money to everyone via Paypal as gains for you all.\n\nIf this can get off the ground, I'm willing to do weekly video updates on how the LLC and its investments are doing. I live in Boston, and if anyone in the Boston-area is down to meeting so that we can formulate a plan and make this legit, I'm down. I really want to do this, and I'm willing to devote the time.\n\nIn fact, if enough people think this is a good idea, I will incorporate an LLC in the coming weeks at my own expense for future purposes should someone else wish to take on the mantle.\n\nHowever, I will warn everyone that we will need at $10,000,000 to even try something like this though... I doubt most people are willing to put down more than $500 or $1,000.", "id": "4xpc5b", "created_utc": 1471199107.0, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "Gofuckyourself LLC.", "score": 96, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42529773712158203}, {"body": "You think I'm putting my money in the hands of these jabronies.
