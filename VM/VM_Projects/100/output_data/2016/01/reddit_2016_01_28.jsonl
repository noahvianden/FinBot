No \"infinite\" mad 4500% gains like the lucky buyers of FB jan5 $105 calls, but you can still make a tidy 200-1000% if you choose your strikes right and avoid high IV. \n\nThey also benefit a bit from time decay thanks to the higher theta on the further OTM short options as long as the long option is ITM. Max profit is at expiration with both legs ITM. I prefer verticals for short-term expirations for binary events like ERs, cuz I can still play like a pussy with a small outlay, but increase my chance of being right even with only a couple days left since I can go out 5% for the same price I'd pay for 20-30% usually. And if you go with weeklies, since expiration is right around the corner, max profit is easily attained. \n\nUsing $4200 you could have yolo'd 14  \"sure bet\" 600/590 jan5 put spreads today for $3 a piece, netting you a max profit gain of $700 per spread, which would total $9800 in gainz realized immediately, more or less. No stressing over theta decay, IV crush and all that shit. \n\nand if you still wanted to do the pussy yolo and target July, you could do some ridiculous spread like a single 600/420 for $42, realize a gain of $600 tomorrow @ $550 or hold awhile to your $400 target for a potential max gain of $13,765 by exp. and keep in mind, as long as your long put is still ITM, you are making money thanks to decay on the OTM short option. Icing on the cake, you save like 90% on commissions. \n\nJust keep in mind sometimes verticals will still bring a wave of profitable disappointment if your short is too close and the underlying goes deep ITM. Granted, you'll still make profit, probably max, but it hurts to see that if you had gone in without a jimmy hat (the short option) you coulda made a cool 3000% on some OTM low IV weeklies at the last minute but have to settle for 500% instead, lol.\n\n#yachtboiproblems\n\nI love going bareback on my options as much as the next yolohustla but definitely have a more consistent track record with spreads.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Where i learn about the acronyms you are using?
