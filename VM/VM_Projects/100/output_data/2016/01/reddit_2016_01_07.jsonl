{"title": "shorting powerball UPDATE", "selftext": "Hi all, original (GUILDED) thread here : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3zsn4x/shorting_powerball/\n\n\nIt appears that my windfall will continue. No one won the powerball last night and the jackpot is going to grow again. When i walked into the office this morning everyone was like \"MAN HEAPSPRAY no one won last night we should organize a COMPANY WIDE powerball pool\"\n\nSo im 'reinvesting' the '9 dollars' we 'won' from the last time and starting a company wide pool today which should get me about $2,400 dollars worth of tickets.\n\nI already have an excel spreadsheet setup to generate random numbers that fit the same numbering scheme as the powerball numbers, so all i have to do is create ~1,200 rows. \n\nBefore anyone starts complaining about fraud, I'll remind you that this is EXACTLY what AIG did when insuring against the derivatives market during the financial crash, and no one went to prison there, so i have some outs if this all goes wrong.\n\nIn true WSB fashion, when i earn the $2,400 plus the $600 from last time, i will open a robinhood account and put all $3,000 dollars into AMD stock.\n\n\nWish me luck everyone! Hopefully we lose!", "id": "3zvxp5", "created_utc": 1452180679.0, "score": 274, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "The line between 'trading  community' and 'criminal enterprise' continues to be blurred here at WSB", "score": 329, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Your post has been automatically removed because it included a misspelled version of Rev.
