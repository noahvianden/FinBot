{"title": "Hittin' the road with my truck packed, $5k, and my TOS account. No job, no dignity, no second chances..", "selftext": "Look, I'm about to pull the ultimate life crash & burn scenario, or possibly one of redemption & the american dream.\n\nWell, I'm at the end of the rope here. Flat broke and I sold my bike for $6,200 yesterday, & am leaving my place next Friday. I have no job, a 2004 Pathfinder & my personal belongings will fit in the truck. I haven't had income in 6 months. \n\n\nI broke up with my girlfriend and she's keeping the apartment. So with nothing in hand but the $6,200 I'm hitting the road to find a shitty hotel somewhere off the interstate in bum fucked Alabama, or maybe Atlanta. I'm gonna take $1,200 and pay for the hotel and food for as long as that'll buy me, and deposit the remaining 5k in my TOS account.\n\nI'm formerly u/here_for_r_investing, I created this account yesterday because my other handle is only a few days old anyway, and obviously I'm not \"here for r/investing\". I realize that now after watching the glory/madness of WSB. \n\n\nThe only 'false' hope I have is that I turned my paper trading account from 100k to 10M trading options, and while I realize the emotional difference between real and paper is palpable, I'm going all in on my hopes/dreams/dignity here anyway. Either I take the money I got yesterday, go find a job and get set up somewhere like a rational person, or I risk everything and put myself in a REALLY bad situation if I fuck up. I've never been such a rational person anyway, which is probably why I find myself in this situation right now.\n\nSo, I want to post my trades here with screenshots as I set out on this fucked up quest. And there's no other group of crazy fuckers I'd rather share the reckless abandon with. \n\nI hope this works out and I can create some glory stories to tell my grandkids, instead of me cowering in shame and humiliation. yolo", "id": "419xcu", "created_utc": 1452973781.0, "score": 316, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 251, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 395, "replies": [{"body": "God damn I love this subreddit.", "score": 155, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22487202286720276}, {"body": "This is going to be an epic movie when all is done.
