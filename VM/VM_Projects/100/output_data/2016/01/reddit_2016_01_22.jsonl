Out of curiosity, which stocks propelled you to a $50 profit?\n\nI lost an opportunity to profit ~50% from Tesla a few months ago since I just held the stock after taking the advice to hold stocks long-term even if they fluctuate in price, but I regret not pouring more money in then selling for the 50% profit.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Started with WTW I bought at $18 sold at $24. That started the addiction. I got NXTD? at .63 sold at $1.20, GBSN at 0.12 sold at .24, AMDA at .10 and sold at .13, AMD at $1.78 sold at $2.15. I'm missing a few, but our combined order history is an OCD persons nightmare. My son is homeschooled and while I make lunch his job is to watch the market. I give him the prices and he sells for me. The amount of orders is more than I expecte. Sorting through it isn't happening this late at night.                                                                                   I'm afraid to hold on to anything so I understand your fear. I couldn't imagine buying a real stock like Tesla though. To me being able to even buy that is a huge achievment in life.                                      I highly doubt this luck will continue. At this point I'm just trying to see how long it lasts.
