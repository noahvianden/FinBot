Not that I think Brexit will happen, mind, but because I believe the potential upside is huge.\n\n>Efficient market theorists would have one believe that the possibility of Brexit has already been priced into the market. To a certain degree, this is undoubtably true. However, markets are run by people, and people are emotional, squirrely, and far from omniscient.\n\n>One of the lasting lessons I took from reading Antifragile by Taleb was that there can be massive upsides to betting against the market. Let us consider the original question: Whether to buy or sell volatility in anticipation of Brexit, regardless of whether we think it will happen.\n\n>At the moment, polling suggests (and the markets seem to believe) that Brexit will not happen. If the polls and markets are correct, when the votes are tallied tomorrow and Britain remains in the EU the markets should not move much. There will perhaps be a few twitches as traders breathe sighs of relief, but meeting expectations is not big business. Selling volatilty, then, in anticipation of \"Bremain,\" is unlikely to have a large upside.\n\n>On the other hand, consider that the British defy expectations and vote to leave the EU. Panic and fear will likely take hold of the markets, and volatility will almost certainly spike as traders buy options in order to protect themselves. Buying volatilty, then, is likely to have a much larger upside, even though it is the less likely outcome.\n\n>The math becomes simple. In basic probability, the formula to determine an expected outcome is as follows:\n\n    [(probability of winning)(amount won per bet) - (probability of losing)(amount lost per bet)]\n\n>Let's say we choose to buy $1,000 worth of volatility ETFs or ETNs, in hopes that Britain will leave the EU. We can expect a 10% drop in volatility (loss of $100) if Britain stays, as the market settles and becomes less volatile. If Britain leaves, however, we can expect a 40% increase in volatility (gain of $400), which is not unreasonable if we purchased a leveraged ETN like $TVIX. After looking at the odds from British bookies (and factoring in a bit of wild guesswork), we think there's a 3/4 chance that Britain will remain in the union and a 1/4 chance it will leave. Because we went long on volatility, we win if Britain leaves.\n\n>The math becomes:  \n25% chance of $400 gain - 75% chance of $100 loss = +$25.\n\n>Even if we think that Britain will remain in the EU, then, it can make sense to bet on Brexit.\n\nOther reading:\nhttp://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/06/daily-chart-14\n\nhttp://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2016/06/eu-referendum-polling", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Explain why investors will buy options to protect themselves?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Puts to hedge long positions and calls to hedge short positions.
