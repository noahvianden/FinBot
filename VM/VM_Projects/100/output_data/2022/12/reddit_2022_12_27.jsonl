Ill check out Ben Felix.\n\nI have a theory that I\u2019d like to run past you if you don\u2019t mind.\n\nI think that general societal sentiment has had a wake up call over the last 2+ years. Partly because of the smooth bull run that we\u2019ve had since 2009 so why upset the apple cart right?\n\nMy theory is this. Trading will become so very much more sharp and aggressive from here on in. Like a yo-yo.\n\nFrom before the 2009 bull run and 2008 financial crisis, people still watched a bit of tv together - the internet and instant information (and to a large degree players in the game) was probably 10% what it is now.\n\nI think that now following the stock shock and given the massive shift in western social information culture, by that I mean so many more people are thinking short term to make a buck combined with the accessibility of trading that was not prevalent before the \u2018prosperity bull run of 2009, that we now live in a completely different era of instant information, desire to get rich quick because of exposure to rich you tubers, jealousy, greed - call it what you want - that from NOW on, valuations and PE ratios are going to be the trigger rather than the driver for extreme sentiment with 100\u2019s of millions of people jumping on bandwagons to get rich. Whether that be shorting or longing.\n\nIf this theory is correct, then we will see a completely different future investment landscape with spikes and troughs, the likes that we haven\u2019t seen in history, which will determine a companies stock value.\n\nAgain, if this wild speculation is found to be accurate - we will see a spike in asset and equity values soon that will be unlike anything else.\n\nThis won\u2019t be good for anyone. But hell, if there\u2019s any truth in my theory, there could be some huge life changing plays to be made by buying during the next 3, 6 or 12 months.\n\nAgain - if true, it won\u2019t be pretty.

Part of the reason we're seeing such a drawdown in stocks this year is that many stocks were in sentiment bubbles that had nothing to do with the fundamentals of the companies they were attached to.

We probably won't be seeing a huge spike in asset or equity values in particular because leverage is expensive right now.

Elon's recent shit show at Twitter further pulled the mask off, and now most sane people, even those that were under his spell of bullshit, are thinking back to all the crazy things Elon proclaimed, and saying to themselves, 'holy shit, that guy is full of shit!'\n\nSo again, look at what any major car company in the world is valued at, and look at tsla. Now the fanbois are quick to go to the usual talking point Enron has burnt into his minions' brains. It's not just a car company. Margins, growth.\n\nWhile there is truth to margins and growth, it is in fact just a car company. The tech and software and whatever else tesla works on is specifically for their cars. And in that space, they have made no advances greater than anyone else. FSD is bullshit that rubes paid 15k for and odds are another company will crack the self driving mystery long before TSLA does. Reference to the piss poor investment they're making in R&D.\n\nNow to growth and margins. WIth heavy competition, growth can't be sustained. This can be argued as we're only in the early stages of the EV movement, but cars have brand loyalty, more than a lot of other consumer products. People that like Honda stick with honda. People that like and can afford Mercedez will stick with mercedez, etc. SO no chance of growing 50% or whatever. That growth rate, even without competition, implies a highly exponential curve. meaning by year 4-5 of that 50% growth, your numbers are in the 10s-100s of milliomns. That growth rate was absurd to begin with, and again something Elon repeated to manipulate people.\n\nMargins. Well they have great margins, partially due to the fact that they build shitty cars. Fact. But with competition, and especially competition from established players with a history of quality and brand loyalty, that margin can't hold. Especially when your product is too expensive for the working class, and others will build cheaper cars for that crowd. So your market is upper middle class to rich people. Rich people will buy their porche and MB EVs, and upper middle class now have a wide range of choices. So that margin can't hold up.\n\nIF all that makes sense, this company will in the very near future be valued as a car company. Meaning a PE of less than 10. WHich would bring this stock down to $40-60 range. And speaking of growth, Elon has all but destroyed the brand so good luck even maintaining 20% growth. Sure people in China might not really get exposed to his twitter antics and hard right politics, but America is obviously turned off to him, at least the demographics that would buy a tesla. And he's widely the most hated man across Europe other than Putin at the moment, so good luck with that. And guess what, a 50K car is not gonna get any play in emerging markets or 3rd world countries. Even a place like India with its billion plus people will not be buying 50K teslas. \n\nTL;DR: TSLA, after the next few earnings calls show the growth collapse, which will lead to margins being shaved down to reasonable levels, will settle into a car company valuation. Unless FSD magically starts working in the near future(it has zero chance of doing so) this party is over. Let's me say it one last time: It's not a tech company, a software company, it's not saving the world, and Elon is a piece of shit who has shown his true colors. Anyone with half a brain, regardless of how much you've already lost, needs to dump this ASAP. Odds of it ever getting back to 150 are very low. This will settle into a 100bb market company, if that, and will either reside there or be bought by one of the big dogs.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble", "tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "What are you trying to say bro.

{"title": "Let's talk chip stocks - what's still oversold and overbought in this macroeconomic shitshow.", "selftext": "TLDR: NVDA, AMD, overbought, TSM, INTC oversold with limited downside +5% dividends on INTC and 2.39% dividends on TSM\n\n**Tech macrosector analysis:**\n\n\nCrypto GPU mining is essentially dead, killing the \"gaming\" market for both NVDA and AMD, with INTC largely unaffected. \"gaming\" revenue accounts for roughly 40% of NVDA's and AMD's revenue. Although if we factor in forward looking trends, there is significant investment in INTC for manufacturing within USA, while NVDA/AMD still rely on TSMC for chip production, this can significantly boost the revenue and outlook of INTC if supply chain issues continue with the global trends looking negative with international relations with China being largely negative. Although TSM has invested in manufacturing plants within the US, it's questionable if it can support the current volume demand or future volume demand for the west. \n\nOne advantage NVDA has is its GPU market share dominating the AI space, with its GPUs being the predominant brand used for AI research and DIY at home use. As AI tech picks up steam, we may see NVDA's forward looking revenue improve within the next year or two. AMD lacks both manufacturing investment advantage as well as a growth outlook for AI sector, therefore I am most bearish on AMD from a technological innovation standpoint.\n\n\n**Fundamentals**:\n\nEPS:\n\n\n\n\n\nStock| EPS | 3-YR Qtrly EPS drawdown| 3-YR Stock Drawdown | current P/E ratio\n---|---|----|----|----\nNVDA | $0.27 | 77% | 57% | 60x\nAMD | $0.04 |  97% | 59% | 38x\nINTC | $0.25 | 87% | 62% | 8x\nTSM | $1.78 | -283% (growth)| 45% | 13x\n\n\nAlthough initially the price drawdown for INTC may seem fair given the quarterly EPS decline, I believe the significant drawdowns on INTC is due to investment into manufacturing plants and processes within the USA, which I believe will pay off in the coming years compared with NVDA and AMD. TSM drawdown seems unjustified given the continued increase in EPS through the economic downturn, although we may see a drawdown at some point if macroeconomics worsens, TSM remains a strong bet as semiconductors will always be in continued demand for the foreseeable future. NVDA and AMD are extremely overvalued from a P/E ratio standpoint, as a ton of growth and hype was priced in given their exposure to cryptomining and technical outlook vs their competitors, but I believe AMD is falling behind in both processor and graphics vs Intel and NVDA. I believe both AMD and NVDA has significant downward price momentum to reduce their P/E ratio to be more in line with the macroeconomic outlook and improve their realistic evaluations.\n\nHow I would play the market:\n\n**Long side:**\n\nIf you want to take a long position or positions with minimal downside through the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, I would invest heavily into INTC and TSM as these both continue to perform in terms of dividends and have P/E ratios that are very reasonable. Plus they also provide significant dividend returns even while stock price dips. I would take a lesser position in TSM if any, due to uncertainty with China, but if you want exposure to any upside from NVDA and AMD, it may be better just to take a position in TSM rather than either NVDA or AMD, as any demand growth from them will be passed through to TSM.\n\n**Short side:**\n\nI believe NVDA and AMD both have significant drawdowns in share price to go. Given the P/E ratios of both companies, I have taken short position in NVDA multiple times since Q4, but I also do not believe that the 97% EPS drawdown is priced in for AMD either.\n\n**Current positions:**\nOut of the above mentioned, I hold:\n\nLong: 600 shares INTC\n\nShort: 10x 130P 17 FEB 23 NVDA\n\nNone of this is investment advice, not guaranteed to be accurate, DYOR, I hold no liability, I wrote this for entertainment purposes only. etc. etc.", "id": "zwoinz", "created_utc": 1672171168.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|231|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lslau3/i_believe_intc_intel_will_be_the_greatest_value/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zwoinz/lets_talk_chip_stocks_whats_still_oversold_and/) \n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: NVDA, AMD, overbought, TSM, INTC oversold with limited downside +5% dividends on INTC and 2.39% dividends on TSM", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc", "nvda", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "My favorite chip manufacturer is LAY'S which is a subsidiary of PEPSICO (PEP) :)", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "Pringles is one of my favorite but they\u2019re owned by Kellogg so I worry they may be over extended with cereal", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37606361508369446}, {"body": "Utz is a better buy and lays is overpriced.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3731428384780884}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2765420079231262}, {"body": "upvote for DD, we really don't have these any more", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "INTC is a government subsidised pos tho\n\nGo learn something you ritardos\n\nhttps://siliconangle.com/2022/12/19/intel-delays-construction-18b-german-chip-fab-angles-government-funding\n\nEdit.

They have a lot of cool projects in the works, but until any of those contribute meaningfully to revenue, it's prudent to consider them as basically a car company.

Imagine they also kept growing at the rate they have this year. This year, their unit volume is on track to grow 50%, but their TTM profit grew from $3.5B in Q3 2021 to $11B in Q3 2022, which is 214% growth.
