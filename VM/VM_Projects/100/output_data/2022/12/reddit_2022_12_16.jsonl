They're also mean-reverting so they're not just going to trend in any single direction for decades on end - some years they'll be a headwind, some years they'll be a tailwind.\n\nBut from a near-term perspective ideally you'd want to be buying stocks after they've been discounted for higher interest rates because that usually means rates will be a tailwind to future valuations as they're likely to make back down. Lower rates are good only in hindsight because the worst time to invest is probably when stocks have rallied 50% on the Fed cutting rates to zero. At that point interest rate moves can really only be a headwind as they move back up and stocks need to rerate.\n\nImo as a long-term investor the only important consideration of higher interest rates is the impact on business models. For example if you're a business and you can borrow $1 million at 2% to invest in a project that will yield a 3% return on that investment it makes sense to borrow and grow your business. But if your return on invested capital is low then borrowing at higher rates directly impacts your ability to grow.\n\nThis impacts tech more than other sectors because it's common in tech to borrow money to invest in projects which will yield a return way out in the future. Higher rates fundamentally makes the growth model used by a lot of tech companies today much more challenging which could result in lower returns long-term if you're overallocated to those types of companies.\n\nHowever, if you're a steady dividend paying company that isn't borrowing money to invest in growth then higher interest rates really doesn't have much impact on your ability to operate.\n\nI think what's interesting about the market right now is that if interest rates do remain high speculative tech is likely to face long-term headwinds and it's likely many in the space won't survive. However, if rates end up falling back down (as some expect) it's likely capital will come out of the steady dividend stocks and back into growth over the next several years. This is basically the story the post-GFC economy - so the question savvy investors need to ask is whether this is truly regime change?\n\nIf you're unsure about where interest rates are heading you probably just want to remain diversified or invest in profitable growth companies as a middle ground. If you do this I personally don't think you should care about rates much at all because some years they'll be headwinds and others they'll be tailwinds, what's important is that your investments long-term will be able to continue to grow with the economy.\n\nThe stocks which have out performed this year solely because they're better plays in a higher rate environment could end up being very bad investments over the next several years if these moves in rates are unsustainable. Personally I don't think that risk is highlighted enough here and I worry those who have over allocated to \"safe\" dividend stocks this year could see fairly mediocre returns going forward if rates move back down. But people can do what they like, it's just I suspect a lot of them would be better off buying bonds if they're buying dividend stocks simply because they have a low risk-appetite.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Solid points...
