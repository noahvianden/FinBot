Having invested for roughly 30 years, this whole \"don't fight the fed\" perspective suggests an incredibly short investing horizon and one that doesn't and shouldn't affect your investing decisions much.

The consensus is that lump sum has higher expected returns but the variance is also higher. Further, that it beats DCA 66% of the time.

Otherwise we would tell all investors to go 100% equities all the time since it has a higher expected return than bonds.\n\nDCA is a safe way to enter the market, as it slightly underperforms lump sum investing on average, but avoids the catastrophe of lump summing right before a contractions. For a long term investor it won't matter *that much* if they keep on investing. A combination of lump sum and DCA can increase expected return but have less risk than lump sum alone.\n\nI personally just invest every paycheck, so that is technically lump-summing, but if I were advising someone with a gigantic sum of wealth that could be invested tomorrow, it feels irresponsible to dogmatically advise to lump sum the entire thing without taking into account their risk tolerance, let alone what you may think about the market.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6254963874816895}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09833060204982758}, {"body": "\u00bfQue?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19773325324058533}, {"body": ">6 months ago DCA was the devil\n\nI speak for myself, it only seemed like a bad idea when everything was at it near the peak.
