It is bad for the common person and good for the super wealthy that control the economy.\n\nThe best and most stable places to live are probably small rich countries with governments that are not overbearing (Switzerland for example), not the United States. Switzerland can probably be best described as a loosely allied, decentralized federation. Yeah there is local socialism (ie the unobjectional kind, not the kind that leads to \"superpowers\" and oppression), but there is also obviously a ton of capitalism and libertarianism in Switzerland.\n\nEven so-called socialist utopias like the nordic countries not only do not solve the problems they purport to solve (high income taxes haven't prevented the greatest wealth inequality in the world in Denmark), they also aren't purely socialist. The nordic countries have the most capitalism in the world, they have some of the highest per capita small business ownership and sole proprietorship rates in the world. And Denmark basically invented modern capitalism, so there's that.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3043249547481537}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15600256621837616}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "You say you\u2019re not a one step thinker, yet you seem to not have thought about the implications of your own policy prescription.

We\u2019ll force you to sell your stock and lose control of the company.\n\nI have and continue to think about the implications. I already mentioned that. I am not a one step thinker. I don't propose this as **the solution**, I understand it has a number of flaws. I would hope any idea would go through years or decades of refinement and thought before anyone started proposing it (in contrast leftist partisans tend to have great loyalty to some naive idea they heard on the most recent Vox video or whatever). I have no loyalty to it, if I heard something better I would abandon the wealth cap idea in a second. In the real world there are not best solutions, only better solutions.\n\nI could have gone into details of the problems that I could already foresee with the idea, but my comment was already long and I don't have all day to philosophize. Talking too much about hypothetical policies is pretty masturbatory, but I'll do it a little now.\n\nI think the flaws you mention are some of the weaker ones. The emergence of cabals that control pools of individual wealth is a bigger concern to me. Disallowing competition among the wealthy may have them cooperate to attempt to game the system. Hopefully it would limit their influence in each cabal itself though.\n\n\"Punishing success\" is a non-issue to me. If you agree with capping net worth, you believe there is a point of dimishing returns in monterarily incentivizing individuals. Even more importantly, the more you give to the guy who already has billions, the less free energy for people to innovate today. A trillionaire makes it harder for more billionaires to exist. The wealth cap should be set high, but finite as a function of currency float, inflation, or something smarter.\n\nThe cap would enable more rich people (and therefore successful / productive people) to exist by reducing inequality among the wealthiest. It would actually spur more innovation not already in the market. It would make it harder for a smaller number of people to control the rules of the game. It could make generational wealth not last basically indefinately as it does now.\n\nThe principle behind the idea is simple. There is a limited number of resources. Lets handsomly reward the most productive, but even so there is a finite limit to individual human productivity. Therefore the reward to that individual productivity must also be limited. This is part of the justification.\n\nThe ecological principle resonates with me more. I'm not against inequality. We need inequality, but it shouldn't be unrestrained. Natural systems have plenty of inequality, but no unrestrained inequality. If one organism or species used up all the resources, everything would die off. Every natural system is limited, biological and non-biological. It makes sense to me to limit wealth instead of letting it be unrestrained.\n\n>Company running too efficient with too good of a margin? We\u2019ll force you to sell your stock and lose control of the company.\n\nTrue to the extent that public market caps are actually based on efficicency and good financials. Obviously we have seen many examples were this hasn't been the case in recent decades.\n\nIt might make you lose control of multiple companies, or let go of some amount of control. I would want the wealth cap to be very accomodating, but finite. Maybe capping wealth would deflate company valuations down to reasonable levels. There would be less incentive to pump asset prices in general, at least for the super wealthy. I think this would all contribute to a healthier financial system with fewer boom and bust cycles.\n\nTo be clear the idea is not for any entity to force people to sell assets. There would be no forced asset sales. When I mentioned the things about hoarding I was referring to assets owned surrepticiously, not those owned \"publicly\" so to speak. In those cases assets would be seized and destroyed, just like we seize assets of law breakers. Everything I have said so far would obviously imply lots of details to be worked out if this idea were seriously considered.\n\nThe idea is you could not add to your wealth beyond a cap. If you didn't have liquid wealth beyond this point, yes, you would be forced to sell assets.

{"title": "Who really caused inflation? Biden? Powell? Trump? Xi? Putin?", "selftext": "It seems on top of the money printing that Powell did, there were a lot of reasons that the inflation is persisting.\n\n1. One of the person that people point fingers to is Powell - 2 years of 0 interest rate, massive buying of bonds. That certainly spiked the money flow.\n\n2. One can also blame Putin because it\u2019s the Ukraine conflict that gave a huge bump to the gas price, making inflation (food and energy, specifically) way higher and more sticky than the Fed likes. \n\n3. Another compounding reason for inflation was the Shanghai shutdown for the better part of 3 months. So many businesses were hit with the possibility of not getting their parts, leading to massive spikes in components and materials, leading to a lot of inflation in goods.\n\n4. Yet another person to blame would be Trump, and no, it\u2019s not the stimulus. It\u2019s the things he has done to the immigration system. He makes immigration very hard for foreign workers and the policy is proven to be particularly difficult for businesses that want to hire people. They have to compete for good workers and keep them with higher salary.\n\n5. And at last, it could be said it was Biden\u2019s fault - because it happened on his watch. Biden did release a lot of oil reserves (like half of all the reserve), but the administration\u2019s failure to reach diplomatic solutions before the Ukraine conflict (especially Blinken) is more or less relevant to the inflation predicament we are in.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s probably a compounding effect of all of their actions that resulted in this situation. It\u2019s unfortunate that poor people have to pay so much for the basic needs. But it\u2019s also unfortunate for people whose portfolio got hit a lot - plus high interest rate is inherently bad for the US\u2019s future because the Us\u2019s leadership is fundamentally a leadership in technology, and advances in technology requires risk taking, growth and low interest rate.\n\nLessons to be learned:\n1.

It also left its short-term interest rate at -0.1 per cent.\n\nAll 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected no policy change, though most of them had said the bank should do more to improve the functioning of the bond market.\n\n**The surprise decision has the potential to jolt global financial markets as the BOJ\u2019s steadfast commitment to defending its 10-year yield cap has served as an anchor indirectly helping keep borrowing costs low around the world.**\n\nThe yen strengthened to as much as 133.21 against the dollar, compared with 137.16 immediately before the announcement.\n\nA further firming of the yen would help reduce the cost-push inflation weighing on domestic-oriented businesses and households as Kishida picks Kuroda\u2019s successor in the coming months. \n\nThe governor had repeatedly stuck to a resolutely dovish stance by stressing the need for stimulus until stronger wage growth takes place, ruling out the possibility the BOJ will take action against the yen\u2019s slump. \n\nIn the runup to the BOJ gathering, speculation had been growing over the likely direction of policy after Kuroda steps down. \n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida is planning on revising a decade-old accord with the BOJ and will consider adding flexibility to the agreement\u2019s 2 per cent price goal, local media reported over the weekend. The reports came after a key aide to Kishida told Bloomberg earlier this month that there is a possibility of reaching a new accord with the central bank.  \n\nThe yield on 10-year government debt remained unchanged at the BOJ\u2019s cap of 0.25 per cent after the decision. \n\nThe governor will elaborate on the BOJ\u2019s views on policy and inflation at a press briefing. \n\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/business/kuroda-shocks-by-tweaking-boj-s-yield-cap-sparking-yen-jump?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social-organic&utm_keyword=dlvr.it", "id": "zqdvtq", "created_utc": 1671509295.0, "score": 568, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "The BOJ previously had interest rates in a window of [-0.25%, 0.25%] for its 10 year bonds. The big news is that the new window is [-0.5% to 0.5%]. In other words, if the 10 year hits 0.5%, the BOJ will intervene to keep it down, instead of doing so when it hit the smaller value of 0.25%.\n\nThis is different from a rate hike as the Fed does it, although in this case it happens to also be contractionary. The Fed typically raises its the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) by moving the entire window which usually has a width of 25 basis points. So if the interest rate is currently set to target [4%, 4.25%], then a 1% rate hike would take it to [5%, 5.25%]. The analagous BOJ policy for the Fed would be to widen the range. For example, if the Fed Funds Rate was [3.25%, 3.75%], what the BOJ is doing with its yield curve is akin to the Fed making the FFR lie between [3%, 4%]. \n\nIn BOJ's case and in the current economy this would be contractionary. However, if for instance, the market really really wanted to hold onto bonds (demand goes up, prices go up, rates go down), then the yield on the market wouldn't want to go to the higher level. It in fact may want to go to the bottom end of the window, forcing the BOJ to sell relatively more bonds to keep the yield from going below the window. In today's case, what might happen is the yield in the market will probably hit the ceiling, forcing the BOJ to buy relatively more bonds to keep yields down.\n\nNote: I'm saying 'relatively' because in practice it's buying bonds the whole time, the question is just if it buys less or buys more relative to the current buying rate, in order to target a particular range for their 10 year bonds.\n\nAnother difference is that the Fed targets the Federal Funds Rate, which is a rate between banks in the so called 'overnight lending market' to make sure all lending transactions clear. The BOJ here is directly intervening to change their bond yields in the secondary market (this is where you and I can buy bonds, as opposed to the primary market, which is the government directly auctioning off bonds. Intervening here is called 'monetization' and typically means the country is entering hyperinflation).

Thank you!\n\nI have a question though, I'm struggling to understand the rational for widening the range?

I think what it implies is that even despite all their bond purchasing, they haven't been able to keep the interest rate within their bound in a way that was sustainable and without spillover effects, such as a devalued yen, inflation, or disrupted JGB markets.  From what I'm hearing on the news it seems as though the latter was the biggest concern, the fact that the BOJ owns proportionally so many means the secondary market is having trouble functioning.\n\nI don't exactly claim to understand the mechanism but I think it means that if they let bonds float a little higher there will be more buyer interest rather than just relying solely on the BOJ.  If the BOJ owns all the bonds then the secondary market won't work.  \n\nAs for why they raised (lowered) both ends of the bound, I have no idea.  I wonder if it's a sort of optics thing, because just raising it upwards clearly shows that they haven't been able to hold the line.

Buying bonds makes the rate go down. If they let rates rise, they'll buy **fewer** bonds, and at lower prices than if they didn't raise the ceiling.

If they buy more bonds, they will increase the price / lower yield of the bond market.\n\nSo I'm talking about two different things: what the market forces are taking the yield to, and what the BOJ is doing to counteract. I think your comment is describing what the BOJ might do to cause the yield to go up to the end of the window. But I'm not talking about the BOJ causing it, the market alone can do that via supply/demand. The BOJ doesn't care where in the window the yields are, market forces might make the yield go to the higher end of the window without the BOJ buying fewer bonds.\n\nThe amount of buying/selling the BOJ does depends on the market fundamentals.

Now they won't. Suppose the supply/demand would naturally cause yields to go to .7% but BOJ buys enough to keep a lid on it at .5%. Let's say that took x purchases to defend the ceiling.\n\nSuppose they'd kept the old window of .25%. Would this require purchases greater than x or less than x?\n\n>The amount of buying/selling the BOJ does depends on the market fundamentals. If yields skyrocket on their own, then doing absolutely nothing is contractionary, and the BOJ will have to buy more to prevent it.\n\nRight, they'd have to buy more to prevent skyrocketing. But they'd buy *even more* to keep yields *even lower* like they used to.\n\nIt takes a certain amount of money to suppress yields from 1% to .5%. It takes even more to suppress from .5 to .25%.
