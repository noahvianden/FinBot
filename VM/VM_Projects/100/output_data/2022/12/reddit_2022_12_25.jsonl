If they were back-logged by months and months for deliveries, what would be the point of incentivizing with discounts.\nAll the previous points and this combined indicate that sales were counted for full sale price at the time of down-payment and not at time of delivery. One of Enron's uncovered EPS fabrications involved something like this. \n\nRecent court rulings which label TSLA FSD as false-advertising. \n\nOther court rulings which imply that Tesla is required to upgrade all past MCU's due to misleading statement about compatibility with FSD.\n\n(We seeing a pattern yet?)\n\nTesla semi being a big nothing burger.

Pepsi shared how, although the trucks can haul chips at 80 battery life for 425 miles YET sodas are heavily implied to only be able to make 100 mile runs. \n  [note, marketing rhetoric would say that \"fully loaded\", could mean weight OR volume...it seems fully loaded by volume was what was meant. \n\nCold wether issues with battery-longevity issues becoming more well-known.\n\nBuild quality issues becoming more well-known. \n\nCompetition from others, ostensibly with better products at comparable prices.\n\nThe brand has become politically associated in an age of growing tribalism.\n\nTrue FSD being a ways down the line, quoted from Musk recently. \n\nThis coupled with the removal of the radar and other components on the surface necessary to FSD, presumably to bolster gross margins..yet ..they weren't already the best ever, ever.\n\nManner of reporting net gross margin is different than how most report it.

I suppose this will make the back-log look large again. \nAnd couple this with the discount conundrum and you really have to scratch your head. Have/are they manufacturing delays to make demand look more than it really is?\n\nOn that point, they misrepresented actual demand and back log a few months ago. They showed amount if pre-paid as a dollar value not quantity, which was still lower. The problem with this is the amount to put down more than doubled. It's more misleading rhetoric.\n\nSolar city, both as an example of the existence of shell corporations, and as a reminder that they recently where reported as pulling back out of much of their Solar product development.

Does its efficiency change with the amount of energy available for capture?\n   * Is there a maximum instantaneous amount of energy it can capture?\n\nRegardless, these factors won't add up to enormous range loss even with, say, 3x heavier load. The reason that diesel trucks get so much worse range with a heavier load is because they can't recapture any of the fuel they burn. There should only be a minimal range difference for a truck with regen braking. There's just nowhere for that energy to go besides 1) increased rolling resistance and 2) loss during braking in comparison to acceleration.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla has already demonstrated driving a max load (jersey barriers, although we don't know the *exact* load weight, the truck was \\~81,000 lbs) 500 mi, so the theory on paper is borne out in reality: They can drive slightly over 500mi with chips in the back, and *also* over 500 miles with concrete.\n\nYes, I'm aware of derivatives lol what are you getting at", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok but you did not finish your systems of equations and went on a about about desired realities.\n\nEnergy in, at least now, and/or sentiently guided, is less energy out.\n\nEnergy used used to speed up in your equation derives from a fixed, amount. \nAll else equal you start with a base, call it 10, 100;whatever, the energy is externally injected into the system.

The twitter stuff has me  scared. Plus, I don\u2019t want to support someone who I think is using his influence to spread awfulness to the world\n\nElon can always top his controversy and the media is going to report on him and his ventures mercilessly after the shit he\u2019s pulled.\n \nI think Elon doesn\u2019t care who he pisses off and he will end up pissing off the right as well.\n\nI know a republican who doesn\u2019t want to support Elon due to him being overly welcoming to Kayne on coming back to twitter after his first round of antisemitism.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the argument that it was simply Elon showing support for his bipolar friend. The optics don\u2019t look that way when it comes to Jews frightened by the scary rise in attacks against us and antisemitism. Elon should know he has a huge following. Elon didn\u2019t have to welcome him back enthusiastically or acknowledge him.\n\n\nHe followed this up by publicly showing up on stage with Dave Chappelle who also recently did an antisemitic rant on SNL. It may seem innocent / non-offensive to non-jews. But, the world\u2019s richest man publicly endorsing these two isn\u2019t great in terms of optics.\n\nIt\u2019s also why my mom won\u2019t buy a Tesla.\nI don\u2019t believe Elon is antisemitic in his heart \u2026 I just think he\u2019s foolish and doesn\u2019t see what he\u2019s doing. Doesn\u2019t take away the effects of his actions.\n\nNow it\u2019s probably just a small minority who would feel that way. But, Elon offends at random. He doesn\u2019t look at optics or the way things look.\n\nI think he\u2019ll just offend indiscriminately.\nHe\u2019s not targeting any one.\nIf he was he would be targeting the left.\nA good chunk of the right thinks coal is clean from what I understand. They think climate change is a lie. Plus, a Tesla is expensive and not as convenient as a gas car.\n\nAlso, keep in mind he\u2019s be targeting the alt right, moderate republicans who believe in electric cars and who have a lot of money to spend on Tesla aren\u2019t necessarily agreeing with his stances.\n\nDr. Fauci is technically a non-partisan figure and many fiscal republicans have a lot of respect for him. Your talking about a man who has served under multiple presidents from different parties.\n\nSure it may seem like the right hates him. Not the case for all republicans.\n\nElon is an equal opportunity offender. I don\u2019t see it being reigned in. \n\nEven for those who may support Elon.\nNot everyone is loud and proud with their controversial politics. They like to keep it to themselves.\n\nBuying a Tesla sends the message that you gave 10s of thousands to Elon\u2019s company. Kind of embarrassing even if you agree with some of what he says. You may not want to advertise it to the world.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s a good chance you don\u2019t agree with everything.\n\nI think his antics could have an effect.\n\nAlso, consider the high value of the stock and Tesla brand was due to the image of Elon as the real life Iron Man, beloved by all and making the world a safer and better place. We bought because we believed in Elon as a genius. That ideal is gone.\n\nEven buying Twitter alone killed the stock because it makes him seem like not a genius.\n\nPlus, if he thought people were trying to have him fail before with shorts alone. He\u2019s made a lot of people root for him to fail now. Powerful people who he probably caused the loss of real money. Politicians who gave him breaks who he\u2019s screwed over.\n\nWho knows how that plays out.\n\nIf Elon gave up control and Tesla managed to convince the public they were free of his influence maybe I\u2019d recommend it again.\n\nBut, I also agree that the Tesla bot isn\u2019t that impressive yet.\n\nThe other scary thing I used to read about Tesla is the rate they churn employees and people get fired or leave.\n\nThis has real consequences ! One even started a real competitor. Others go work for Apple.\nThey need amazing talent. The best and the brightest.\n\nPeople want to work for a company they are proud of. Working Tesla used to be something you could brag about. Now it\u2019d be preferable not to work there.\n\nNot to mention FUD for the stock also makes attracting talent harder. If the stock seems like it isn\u2019t going to he worth a ton people won\u2019t value it as much.\n\nPlus, Elon has a reputation as a guy who is hardcore to employees. Cutting staff mercilessly\u2026. It had benefits but it might scare away good people.\n\nI think even Elon worries about it.
