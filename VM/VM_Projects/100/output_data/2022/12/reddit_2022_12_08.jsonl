It looks like Lina Khan might be looking to make a name for herself in pursuing antitrust action by going after more M&A.\n\nDisclosure: long-time MSFT shareholder", "id": "zg8c32", "created_utc": 1670526810.0, "score": 317, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Have a hard time imagining it holds up, maybe its for concessions or to look like FTC actually does stuff but I have a real hard time imagining that theres data to support that this is too big for Microsoft.\n\nI mean AB + Xbox revenue combined is about equal to Sony, and billions less if you take out the mobile portion of AB. They will have a market share in the teens post acquisition, they won't be the largest game publisher either (that would be Tencent and Embracer Group) and they have publicly attempted to negotiate with Sony for a 10 year deal for CoD on their platform (and have successfully negotiated with Nintendo and Valve for 10 years (the company who owns the most popular PC game distribution site, Steam)). The last console generation they were outsold 2 to 1 on Playstation, and while things are more positive for Xbox this gen they are still behind in console sales compared.\n\nI just don't see this holding up in court, I can see maybe they'd add a concession that all CoD games would be on Playstation so its forced to be in writing but I can't imagine this just is blanket blocked.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo add a lot of concerns of Microsoft being too powerful and then raising prices of their consoles and games are things that Sony, the market leader, has already done. The PS5 costs more now than it did 2 years ago, and yes Microsoft games are now going to be $70 but Sony was the first console publisher to raise their game prices also 2 years ago.
