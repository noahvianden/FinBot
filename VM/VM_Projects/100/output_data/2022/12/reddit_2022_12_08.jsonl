It looks like Lina Khan might be looking to make a name for herself in pursuing antitrust action by going after more M&A.\n\nDisclosure: long-time MSFT shareholder", "id": "zg8c32", "created_utc": 1670526810.0, "score": 317, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Have a hard time imagining it holds up, maybe its for concessions or to look like FTC actually does stuff but I have a real hard time imagining that theres data to support that this is too big for Microsoft.\n\nI mean AB + Xbox revenue combined is about equal to Sony, and billions less if you take out the mobile portion of AB. They will have a market share in the teens post acquisition, they won't be the largest game publisher either (that would be Tencent and Embracer Group) and they have publicly attempted to negotiate with Sony for a 10 year deal for CoD on their platform (and have successfully negotiated with Nintendo and Valve for 10 years (the company who owns the most popular PC game distribution site, Steam)). The last console generation they were outsold 2 to 1 on Playstation, and while things are more positive for Xbox this gen they are still behind in console sales compared.\n\nI just don't see this holding up in court, I can see maybe they'd add a concession that all CoD games would be on Playstation so its forced to be in writing but I can't imagine this just is blanket blocked.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo add a lot of concerns of Microsoft being too powerful and then raising prices of their consoles and games are things that Sony, the market leader, has already done. The PS5 costs more now than it did 2 years ago, and yes Microsoft games are now going to be $70 but Sony was the first console publisher to raise their game prices also 2 years ago.

Less than 15k lightnings made, less than 20k Rivian, GM might as well not be making the hummer I think it\u2019s less than 5k total still..? It\u2019s not like anyone has actually done anything yet or ran away with it. That\u2019s not saying tesla will come out of the gate like they normally do, the cybertruck is a completely different beast and was designed to be mass produced as fast and cheap as possible. Because of this, it\u2019s manufacturing process and tooling is completely new and is likely to have lots of kinks. So we\u2019ll see where these truck numbers are at by the time CT starts up, but I believe they\u2019ll all still be well below 50k annual rate. \n\nAlso worth noting the truck market is only large in North America, it\u2019s basically non existent in China and Europe.\n\nAlso, just because it\u2019s a \u201cflagship\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anything.

Growth is teslas crutch, as soon as tesla stops growing it\u2019s gone.\n\nIn my model I see tesla slowing growth down in vehicle deliveries over the next few years, margins will follow (car business). But I still believe margins will be above the average 8% due to their obvious production advantages. While this happens their energy business will be hitting a turning point, it\u2019s already happening now. Last Q they reported 60% growth, they are no longer cell constraint so this growth will continue and they opened a new megapack factory that 10x current capacity. 4680 cells are getting closer to final stage, everything is lining up for energy.
