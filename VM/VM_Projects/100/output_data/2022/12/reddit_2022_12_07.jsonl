{"title": "Tesla will be the Myspace of the EV market. Tesla Semi will not change that, just like Myspace music did not save Myspace.", "selftext": "TL:DR - Tesla is only #1 in EV because they were first. Their market share will only decrease from here, Tesla Semi will not change that, in 5 years they will not even be a top 5 EV manufacturer.\n\nTesla created the EV market, no one can deny that. Companies become market makers by creating and cornering a market before there is real competition, then staying ahead of the newcomers.\n\nNew companies try to create new markets all the time. Few are successful. Even fewer create truly NEW markets, most are just iterations past old norms. EV vehicles are not a new market, they are an iteration on the norms of the consumer vehicle market. This means Tesla not only has to defend against newcomers to the consumer electric vehicle space, but they have to compete against very successful consumer vehicle manufacturers altering their established brands in EV's.\n\nThe F-150 is best selling truck, for decades, period. In the USA trucks have an exceptionally loyal customer base, and oversized market share. What Loyal Ford or Chevy owner would choose the cyber truck over the Lightning or Silverado EV? Its rhetorical moron, everyone knows there is not enough to be statistically relevant.\n\nTesla is only #1 in the EV space because they created that market and have not yet had to face real world competition. During that time they have failed to establish a market cornering brand. Right now Ford, Chevrolet, and Hyundai/Kia are all competing to be #2 in the EV market had have openly stated their intention to be #1 in the EV space in the next 5 years or so.\n\nBefore trying to mumble something about \"Tesla's innovation\" around Elon's dick, stop and think about this example. When Toyota entered the truck market they created a new \"small truck\" market. The overwhelming success of the Toyota truck that was eventually named the Tacoma launched them to success in the truck market. Nissan and other imports jumped on the small truck market, but the Nissan offering never hit it big in that space, Why? Because Ford launched the Ranger and Chevrolet the S10 and quickly claimed the #2 and #3 spots. Toyota is still a dominant player in \"small trucks\", but only barely and never managed to corner that market, and they were already a reputable and trusted car brand when they created that marked. Toyota is only dominant in the \"small\" truck space, their larger truck offerings cant come close to the F-150 or Silverado. Tesla was not a reputable or trusted manufacturer when they created this market, and I would argue still are not reputable or trustworthy. Look at Elon, he wasted $44 billion buying a social media company, just so he can ruin his reputation faster than he was by just being a social media user, how does that inspire trust in the brand?!?\n\nTesla Semi is not their savior, it is proof they are the Myspace of the social media world. Tesla created a market where no one thought one would exist (or so oil propaganda had everyone convinced), but now that the value behind the market has been established, how can Tesla out compete Ford or Toyota? All of Tesla's profitable models are in the \"luxury\" space where the margins are higher. Tesla is struggling to produce their still very expensive economy\" model 3, which can not compete against true \"economy\" EV's like the Leaf. Eventually Mercedes EV's will be preferred in the luxury EV space and the model 3 will never be able to compete with a Civic EV or Corolla EV. I am planning to buy an EV in 2024 and if there is a Civic EV, the Model 3 would have to have equal quality, and a LOWER price to even be considered, and would still also have to compete with Leaf etc. Why? Because Nissan entered the EV market years after Tesla, yet their very first EV, offered 2014, still sets a standard for quality/reliability in the EV space that Tesla can not equal even in 2021.\n\nI am not a trader or quant and this is not meant to be investment advice.
