{"title": "Tesla will be the Myspace of the EV market. Tesla Semi will not change that, just like Myspace music did not save Myspace.", "selftext": "TL:DR - Tesla is only #1 in EV because they were first. Their market share will only decrease from here, Tesla Semi will not change that, in 5 years they will not even be a top 5 EV manufacturer.\n\nTesla created the EV market, no one can deny that. Companies become market makers by creating and cornering a market before there is real competition, then staying ahead of the newcomers.\n\nNew companies try to create new markets all the time. Few are successful. Even fewer create truly NEW markets, most are just iterations past old norms. EV vehicles are not a new market, they are an iteration on the norms of the consumer vehicle market. This means Tesla not only has to defend against newcomers to the consumer electric vehicle space, but they have to compete against very successful consumer vehicle manufacturers altering their established brands in EV's.\n\nThe F-150 is best selling truck, for decades, period. In the USA trucks have an exceptionally loyal customer base, and oversized market share. What Loyal Ford or Chevy owner would choose the cyber truck over the Lightning or Silverado EV? Its rhetorical moron, everyone knows there is not enough to be statistically relevant.\n\nTesla is only #1 in the EV space because they created that market and have not yet had to face real world competition. During that time they have failed to establish a market cornering brand. Right now Ford, Chevrolet, and Hyundai/Kia are all competing to be #2 in the EV market had have openly stated their intention to be #1 in the EV space in the next 5 years or so.\n\nBefore trying to mumble something about \"Tesla's innovation\" around Elon's dick, stop and think about this example. When Toyota entered the truck market they created a new \"small truck\" market. The overwhelming success of the Toyota truck that was eventually named the Tacoma launched them to success in the truck market. Nissan and other imports jumped on the small truck market, but the Nissan offering never hit it big in that space, Why? Because Ford launched the Ranger and Chevrolet the S10 and quickly claimed the #2 and #3 spots. Toyota is still a dominant player in \"small trucks\", but only barely and never managed to corner that market, and they were already a reputable and trusted car brand when they created that marked. Toyota is only dominant in the \"small\" truck space, their larger truck offerings cant come close to the F-150 or Silverado. Tesla was not a reputable or trusted manufacturer when they created this market, and I would argue still are not reputable or trustworthy. Look at Elon, he wasted $44 billion buying a social media company, just so he can ruin his reputation faster than he was by just being a social media user, how does that inspire trust in the brand?!?\n\nTesla Semi is not their savior, it is proof they are the Myspace of the social media world. Tesla created a market where no one thought one would exist (or so oil propaganda had everyone convinced), but now that the value behind the market has been established, how can Tesla out compete Ford or Toyota? All of Tesla's profitable models are in the \"luxury\" space where the margins are higher. Tesla is struggling to produce their still very expensive economy\" model 3, which can not compete against true \"economy\" EV's like the Leaf. Eventually Mercedes EV's will be preferred in the luxury EV space and the model 3 will never be able to compete with a Civic EV or Corolla EV. I am planning to buy an EV in 2024 and if there is a Civic EV, the Model 3 would have to have equal quality, and a LOWER price to even be considered, and would still also have to compete with Leaf etc. Why? Because Nissan entered the EV market years after Tesla, yet their very first EV, offered 2014, still sets a standard for quality/reliability in the EV space that Tesla can not equal even in 2021.\n\nI am not a trader or quant and this is not meant to be investment advice.

As a FAANG person, I can confirm Meta has lost its luster with the most important customer, advertisers in the US and EMEA. Meta\u2019s dual marketplace powered by end users and advertisers hit major snags from globally regulatory and tech changes. Regulatory changes limit Meta\u2019s ability to track consumers which impact performance marketing \u2013 Meta\u2019s primary revenue source. Tech changes powered by Apple AppTrackingTransparency do the same at the device level. \n\nIn addition the youth demos are adopting other social or communication platforms like Discord, Twitch, Reddit, TikTok etc. People have a limit of waking hours where to spend their time and Meta\u2019s products, while maintaining MAUs, are losing screen share. \n\nThese trends point to an uphill battle for Meta. Also, no social network has proven unbeatable if you look back. Meta can pivot, innovate, and win back advertisers, but they have major headwinds.\n\nEdit: For folks unfamiliar with Meta\u2019s advertiser proposition, they claim that advertising on Meta platforms can increase awareness or sales of products and services. However, the latest privacy changes directly prohibit much of the omnipresent tracking Meta used to bolster its advertising performance. Apple made significant changes over the last 3 years to improve privacy on its devices as it relates to apps. Google will follow suit in the next two years further limiting Meta\u2019s advertising capabilities. \n\nMeta investors believe that Meta will find solutions to their advertising challenges and exceed the revenue targets compared to the previous 3-5 years **or** innovate faster than Google or Amazon on the ads front. There is a small possibility that Meta\u2019s meta verse investment pays off and users adopt Meta hardware and not Apple\u2019s hardware. You can dwell on that one based on consumer sentiment today.

FB and IG copy their competitors because they have an established footprint in places where their competitors are not yet. Therefore FB/IG become the way people experience these innovative features for the first time and it\u2019s going to have the same affect as it does when an American experiences the feature on a different app. I don\u2019t see the concepts behind FB and IG slowing down or failing anytime soon. I do believe the metaverse is moronic and is more of an indicator of what people should have realized. Zuckerberg innovated successfully once early in his life very successfully. Since then his company experienced rapid growth and has been carried by very good acquisitions and a willingness to develop features for any market. Basically it\u2019s just a concept of \u201cthrow as much as possible on the board and see what sticks\u201d. FB was massively bloated with add ons and apps in the late 00s early 10s and most of what was made is gone today.  Zuckerberg is the product of one good idea which catapulted to the point of being too successful to fail.
