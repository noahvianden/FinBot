{"title": "Meta and Alphabet lose dominance over US digital ads market as TikTok, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple take market share.", "selftext": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/meta-and-alphabet-lose-dominance-over-us-digital-ads-market/\n\nMeta and Alphabet have lost their dominance over the digital advertising market they have ruled for years, as the duopoly is hit by fast-growing competition from rivals Amazon, TikTok, Microsoft and Apple. The share of US ad revenues held by Facebook\u2019s parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabet\u2019s share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, you wouldn\u2019t be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising,\u201d said Dischler. \u201cSo it\u2019s really telling that more and more people are acknowledging that advertising is a great and scalable business model.\u201d Amazon\u2019s foray into the digital ads world has played a big part in hitting Meta and Google\u2019s dominance. After years of toying in the market, it ramped efforts up in 2015 and has since seen ad revenues skyrocket from less than $1 billion to an estimated $38 billion this year. \u201cBefore I joined, I didn\u2019t even know what Amazon Ads was,\u201d said an Amazon executive who says they now run \u201ca massive team\u2014and I didn\u2019t know this existed before the recruiter called.\u201d Paul Prior, chief operating officer of Undertone, a digital advertising company, said retail giants led by Amazon woke up to the realization that their extensive data on customers could be the basis for a massive advertising business with higher margins than the sale of goods online. But Amazon then went a step further, expanding its on-site ads business beyond its own shopping site. \u201cAcross the wider digital universe, they use that data set to empower brands and the advertisers to buy better, to spend more effectively and drive return on ad-spend,\u201d said Prior.\n\nApple has also emerged as a new threat. Its ad revenues have grown from under $2.2 billion in 2018 to more than $7 billion this year. Although that is just 1.2 percent of the global market, it is already more than Snapchat and Pinterest combined, and some estimates suggest Apple could reach $30 billion of ad revenue by 2026. Zuckerberg has repeatedly hit out at Apple\u2019s \u201cconflict of interest,\u201d criticizing it for charging \u201cmonopoly rents\u201d and stifling innovation.  Insider Intelligence has forecast that Google and Meta\u2019s US ad growth in 2023 will be just 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, while at least eight of its rivals are to experience double-digit gains.", "id": "zvzi00", "created_utc": 1672095453.0, "score": 873, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "So there is no more threat of antitrust laws against Alphabet and Meta.

Google will NEVER lose search market share, not in the traditional sense. The way you search today, if still applicable in 100 years, will belong to Google. The caveat, of course, is that people stop searching (googling) and start asking AI questions instead, BUT Google actually has the edge there as well with internal AI (not yet public)   \n\n\nSince search ads are the #1 driver of revenue you might be concerned that TikTok or Amazon or Apple are going to take away search market share, and that's just not going to happen...  \n\n\nUnless. Apple bundles an AI search solution on iOS that rivals or beats Google. Think the buzz that Siri had years ago, but actually helpful. That would MURDER Google's marketshare. \n\n...but, as we've seen (with Maps & Email) just bundling a solution doesn't mean users won't gravitate towards the better Google solution. \n\nWhich brings up one last point. Google owning Android gives them 50% automatic marketshare. So, it's really that last 50% of mobile (iOS) that they have to protect. \n\nAll that needs to be said about Google vs. anyone else is that Google has search, and as long as Google has search they have the absolute highest intent ad clicks on Earth. Why? People are searching for a solution and able to find it. \n\nFacebook doesn't allow this. \n\nApple allows this in an app setting (such as finding apps) but you can't just get an insurance quote or a loan. \n\nTikTok doesn't allow this. \n\nAmazon doesn't allow offsite traffic.\n\nDesktop search is going nowhere, either. Computer users will still use Google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) TikTok. Here's the thing. It's a terrible advertising platform for us marketers. Creative (i.e. ad assets) are almost ephemeral in the sense the little twats using TikTok have about 3.5 second attention span. Ads go stale in days, not months. \n\nThis means advertisers will use it, but lose more often than win. It's kind of like 15+ years ago when Google rolled out the Google Display Network (GDN) which Adsense is based on. Everyone thought it was this massive new ad platform that will offset high search ad costs. Nope, it was just trash traffic for the most part. \n\nThat's TikTok. There's money to be made, but you're basically doing drive-by's on bored young adults that want to see someone with no bra jumping rope. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) Amazon. They are a very real threat to retail ad budgets. That's for sure. That's not going to stop people from advertising on Google or FB (especially for ad retargeting outside of the Amazon platform); but ad dollars and ad dollars, right? If you allocate more to Amazon because you sell on Amazon, it makes sense. \n\nWhich brings up another point. To use it you need to sell on Amazon! That cuts out a lot of Fortune 500 advertisers and doesn't really scoop up much high-CPC marketshare of industries like financial products, which make up the majority of Google's search ad revenue. \n\nUnfortunately, Amazon DOES have AWS (vs. Google Cloud) so if you're looking at this holistically as a business, Amazon has a LOT more going for them across multiple fronts. \n\n...but again, this shouldn't impact native search marketshare and Amazon does not drive traffic offsite, so that's a big no to 3rd party ads. \n\n4.) Then there's Apple. This company represents the #1 threat to Google's ad marketshare. As I stated earlier, simply bundling an AI search solution and selling ads would drastically cut into Google's search ad revenue IF Google didn't have a competing product. \n\nApple has something like 50% marketshare on mobile, so you can't discount what they have the ability to do with their device base (same with Google's Android) \n\nAs an advertiser do I care about Apple right now? Yes and no. \n\nNo because it only matters if you offer an app as a primary product, and a lot of the companies I work with don't (though, 1 does and we almost exclusively use Apple) and for obvious reasons, the Android version of apps aren't allowed to be advertised. \n\nApple's ad system is also pretty terrible. You can't drive traffic to a landing page offsite, everything goes straight to the download page. Great if you want app downloads, but also not that great if you want to tailor your message. \n\nI see a future where Apple certainly controls a lot of overall ad budgets since they have the mobile ecosystem (just like Google does) + higher quality users; but this shouldn't cut into Google's current revenue stream by much. \n\nThese are 2 very different products with VERY different intent as explained previously. Google traffic is super high intent and that's because people are looking for a solution across endless topics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.) Lastly, there's Facebook. As an advertiser I've given up on them. All is not well with FB. I would NOT purchase stock in their company unless I believe in their version of the Metaverse, because ads are no longer a consideration. \n\nThat says a lot. I've made millions advertising on Facebook. I would absolutely love nothing more than to continue advertising on FB for the rest of my life. There's no point. Apple killed them when they eliminated the ability to get attribution, and then FB killed themselves with Cambridge and FTC issues to the point they had to basically eliminate all of their great targeting options. \n\nFacebook has 3 massive problems. \n\n1.)

It changed the entire industry. \n\nFed scrutiny became even higher. Once GDPR was put in place and then Cambridge issues (think of it like it exposed a huge hack) both Google and FB had to limit the way they allowed advertisers to \"track\" their website visitors. \n\nHowever, WITH the abilities you had before Cambridge broke was even crazier than just tracking. You could actually use 3rd party data (or stolen data) to build your list of targets! Think of it like this. \n\nWhat if I wanted to target every person with Diabetes in the United States. I could create some Diabetes-related ads, target an age/sex demographic and add a few interests like \"Fast Food\" or whatever and then see how the ads performed. \n\nOr, I could just use a 3rd party data source that had details on my target (all you need is an email address, really) and now I have a better list! \n\nTake it one step further and you purchase a list of people involved in a health provider hack and you have a ton of personal details, including their medical records (HUGE HIPAA violation, obviously) and guess what? Now my list of targets include ONLY people that fit my criteria! \n\nSee how powerful that was? \n\nNow, imagine that you never used any of the blackhat tactics, most people would never do it (except that RU political shit, right?) but 3rd party data allowed for extremely granular targeting that would basically allow any advertiser to pick and choose to the perfect audience for their product. \n\n...even if that product happened to be weight loss, a disease or their birthday. \n\nStarting to get creepy right? \n\nOnce Cambridge hit FB had to dial down the creep factor, so they got rid of 3rd party data sources were allowed on their platform by default (yes, anyone could use these 3rd party data sources) and it made things a bit harder, but of course, you still could target any type of interest you wanted. \n\n...including pages people liked. \n\nFor years it was still powerful, and creepy. \n\nThen, Apple hit, and took tracking options away (this was a direct shot at FB and Google ad dominance, btw) - now us marketers couldn't see who converted well. It was all a guess. \n\n...but hey, at least we can still target people!\n\nOh...yeah, about that. \n\nBy late 2021 FB made the decision to remove interest-based targeting for anything that was deemed a \"Detailed Interest\"...\n\nYou might think, \"that's fine, I'm not violating HIPAA with my ads\"...oh, it's not fine, because what actually happened was detailed interest targeting covers just about anything you could possibly think would identify a type of person beyond their age, sex and location. \n\nDo they like topics about teeth whiteners? Fuck if I know!! \n\nDo they subscribe to Republican pages and groups? Not. A. Clue. \n\nWant to target homeowners? Nope. \n\nPeople that like AARP? LOL. Maybe a year ago. \n\nWhat about people that run small businesses? Sorry bud, they took that away, too!\n\n\\----\n\nSee, Cambridge itself was the canary. Apple was the entire mine collapsing. \n\nFacebook ended up raising prices (CPM's) on their entire ad inventory and you had to agree that their estimates on conversion (who become a sale, .etc) were good enough. \n\nI've seen advertisers with 7 figure monthly budgets dial back to almost nothing (maybe $30k?) and move onto other platforms to test their luck. \n\nWhy? Because FB is just too damn expensive! It no longer backs out for advertisers, and since you can't refine your audience anymore (we call it \"drilling down\") what's the point?! \n\nYou can do this on TikTok (kind of) so it shows promise, but really, all we want is our old Facebook advertising back and we're never going to get it. \n\nAll we'll get are super high prices and no targeting options beyond age, sex & location + bland general interests like \"likes McDonald's\" or \"likes Dogs\" - yay, dude.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks! \n\nI had no idea Facebook actually improved on this after CA.

{"title": "Tesla vs. Toyota valuation", "selftext": "I have seen several posts in various other investing subreddits arguing that Tesla should have a valuation like other car makers. Sometimes an argument goes like this: Tesla only sells 10% of Toyota and the stock should trade at 10% of Toyota's value.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/as274qanl88a1.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf6d52d23c7e9643ef54faaea4267e5a5a98b773\n\nThis completely neglects the difference between ICEs (a declining industry) and EVs (a growing industry), but also the differences in profitability, other revenue streams and debt levels of both companies. Instead of cars sold, one could take a look at earnings.\n\nSo, let's take a look at the valuation. First, equity valuation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icutd33ol88a1.jpg?width=733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=436099028a5aec495bfa3cfa18d70697f86d0cbe\n\nBased on trailing 12-month non-GAAP earnings, Tesla has a PE of 30 compared to 10 for Toyota\\*. Hence, a 202% higher premium for a higher expected earnings growth. If we take the latest quarter, Tesla has an annualized non-GAAP PE of below 27. Here, Tesla trades at a 85% premium compared to Toyota.\n\nAlright, let's look at the total firm value, including debt: The enterprise value:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cld89cool88a1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63f79170a29708fffb0b9580a8d7e0bb08823150\n\nRight now, Tesla trades almost at the same enterprise value as Toyota.\n\nTesla has around 15 Billion $ in excess cash (21 Billion $ in cash - about 6 Billion $ in debt). Toyota has about 157 Billion $ in net debt. For the enterprise value calculation, the multiple is usually calculated with EBITDA (earnings + interest + tax+ amortization + depreciation). Based on trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, the enterprise value of Tesla is 21 times its EBITDA. For the annualized Q3 22 EBITDA, the multiple is below 19 times. In this case, Tesla trades at a 65% premium to Toyota.\n\nEveryone can make their own assumptions about the growth potential for both companies to evaluate differences in static valuation multiples. Likely, most investors would agree that Tesla should trade higher relative to their earnings than Toyota due to a significantly higher expected earnings growth. Right now, I view Tesla's valuation as relatively low compared to Toyota, even with modest growth assumptions for Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\**Values from Tesla are from their latest shareholder deck.

Any way you slice it, selling a fifth of what BYD sells per week even after price cuts and incentives, is a terrible look for a growth story. \n\nA huge part of the TSLA story was that it was supposed to be the pioneer, leading the EV charge. Now there is a legitimate case to be made that not only is TSLA not the leader, it is far behind. Are we so sure BYD won\u2019t do the same in other markets? \n\nThe IRA incentives are neutral for TSLA, not bullish. When you\u2019ve established market leadership, you want the competition to drown in your wake. The IRA gives the competition a fighting chance.

The rich man will enjoy eating it, sure, but for the beggar, it is manna from heaven.\n\nThe TSLA story has also been about massive margins. Now with the looming recession, Elon has come out and said they may decimate their margins in order to move volume. This is not positive for TSLA. It may be necessary, yes, but as TSLA margins erode, people start to wonder why it deserves a higher PE. Thus the serious PE compression going on right now.\n\nThen there is all the other political and Twitter stuff which for me has hit TSLA badly. It\u2019s really not rocket science. No other S&P CEO brings political agendas to the table. They try to stay as apolitical as possible for a reason. Elon doesn\u2019t care very much what people think. For me, that\u2019s not a good sign.\n\nAm I still bullish on TSLA? Yes. But has all of the above changed my investment horizon on the stock? Also yes. I used to think I would hold for 10 years and getting to $700 per stock was a sure thing. Now, I will be exiting at $400 whenever it hits that number.

Tesla Energy is aggressively going to provide charging for *all* EVs in the US in 2023 onwards, as their V4 supercharger stations will be highly profitable from an operations standpoint. Tesla Energy also has a significant tailwind, since the IRA provides charging station credits for new charging stations to be built.

{"title": "2022 Income Update (a year later): $850K or 132% trading options", "selftext": "Hi kids, I made a similar post last year, making $140K selling options:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/rve85t/i\\_think\\_im\\_allowed\\_to\\_post\\_this\\_143k\\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/rve85t/i_think_im_allowed_to_post_this_143k_options/)\n\nThis year, a lot has changed, **I've made less money SELLING options, at $108K as of Dec 26**, but the majority of my gains came from buying options (SPY puts when it hits $430 in the summer). So, the $850K is nice, but it wasn't Thetagang and I probably can't recreate it, I can recreate the $100K selling options though.\n\nI try to follow the tastytrade way, 30-45 DTE, closing or rolling at 21 DTE. I adjust this based on my risk and my availability actually. Sometimes I aim for 75% before I close, instead of 50%.\n\nLast year, my most successful strategy was just selling covered called, I hit $67K in 2021, however as the stocks tanked, I dumped a lot of them, converting my trades into spreads, **credit spreads (80% have been call credit spreads) have been my most successful strategy, earning $47K in 2022**. Main stocks were SPY, TSLA and NFLX. I was selling call credit spreads on TSLA before the split, I was making $1K/week until it split, then the IV disappeared, so I found NFLX. I've been selling 7-10 weekly call credit spreads on NFLX (this is more gamma/swing trading, not theta, I know).\n\n**Biggest single day loss: $16K on Tesla Iron Condors**. This was the first and last time I've ever done this, I thought I 'bought to close', but instead, I 'sold to open', instead of 7 Iron Condors, I had 14, it went very very poorly. Since I trade at the office, I don't have my portfolio open all day. I submitted my trade and logged off until 3pm, when I saw my blunder.. that was painful.\n\nThe saying 'it works until it doesn't' has never been more accurate than in 2022, I think I've stumbled on a strategy that works, then SPY increases 5% in a day on random news, so I stop trying to short SPY, I just can't predict what it'll do, except when its at $430.\n\nIn the Summer, when SPY hit $420, I spent $50K on Dec 2022 SPY Puts, then it went to $425, I bought more, then at around $430, I bought more. Kind of gambling, I hate buying Options, I hate the decay, I'd rather earn Theta, but, I 'had a feeling' or maybe just common sense that SPY shouldn't be at $430.\n\nI tried to take pics of my account as status updates, I had a feeling I'd make this post again at year end, but within 10 weeks, I probably made $600K.\n\nOpening account balance, Jan 1 2022:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rimdudc6e98a1.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=29197ea1b802afa2b0d07b1c2a64b6366b2c0753\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMid July:\n\nI closed my positions, making $200K by mid-July just on my purchased options. I took a pic since it was the first time my Margin account broke $1M. I was pretty happy. Take a look at my open P&L though, I was down like $100K just on my long positions (which is why I dumped them, I felt it was a losing battle, stocks would continue to go down) ..\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcrq4mf7e98a1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91516e16ca45343529aaa3015fbc5bbaee0705e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnd of August, what is it, 6 weeks later? I started to panic, I've never had such large gains, SPY kept dropping, I figured I should be a normal person and just take profits. I closed out my SPY puts, took a pic for the memories. Notice my long positions recovered a little, but still had a big $50K unrealized loss.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ckfiv38e98a1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5bd301aea697d43eefa3170b1256c42019fc110\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still expecting SPY to go down more, I might get back into shorting, I tried to buy puts if SPY hit $420 again, but it hit $410 and dropped back down, that would've been a good opportunity.\n\nFor those wondering, yes this is in my taxable account, I don't trade in my retirement or tax sheltered accounts. I pulled out $$, paid my tax on the gains and bought two rental properties, just to diversify my investments.\n\nAll in all, its been a good year, won't be able to replicate it. But with still $500K sitting in my margin account, I can probably hit another $100K in selling options, its been 10 years trading for me, I do it part time, I'll never stop.
