Loaning money to irresponsible parties is not inherently economically unstable so long as the risk of the loan is priced in.

Trading is largely about risk management and impulse control, in my experience, rather than being directionally right. And macro trading is very, very hard, in particular, for the reasons you outlined above. It definitely doesn't make sense to try to trade your macro view on a short term basis. Or rather, you shouldn't expect the market to go in a straight line from here to the end result *even if your macro view is entirely correct and perfectly predicts the future end state of the market.* \n\nAs a general rule, I just let my macro view (and I come from a macro background) constrain my overall trading, but not direct it. So, for instance, right now I think equities are totally bananas, like way overpriced, up here in fucking cloud cuckoo land. Every other asset class is pricing a recession of varying degrees of severity, but all anyone in equity markets can think about is next wednesday. So it makes no sense to believe that equities will suddenly wake up and reprice. I think it happens, but there is a LOT of noise and movement between there and here. \n\nSo maybe I try to chip in to long dated downside when opportunities present themselves to do so. And I don't currently want to be long any equities, at all. So I sacrifice 100% of the upside I can gain from being long any of the stocks I do like, and that's fine by me. I'm just trading around my core view, adding to shorts when I can, and also buying short term downside when I think there is a near term reason for a stock to underperform. \n\nI wouldn't actually suggest that you stop trading. Just pare it way way way back. Like I don't know what your financial situation is, but have a trading account that is maybe just 10% or max 20% of what you could afford to trade. And then trade that like it's 100% of your capital. Psychology should kick in fairly quickly and it should *feel* meaningful even if it's not central to your financial wellbeing. Just like you can be fully emotionally invested in a game with zero relevance to your real life.
