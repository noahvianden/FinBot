Because it was so clear what their role was going to be? Hence why musk was attempting to take the company private at one point. So he could get rid of the constant public shareholder scrutiny. A lot of people doubted Tesla's role, because they believed established car manufacturers could do the same thing but better. Compared to a startup with no car manufacturing experience at all. EV's up until that point had a bad rep and was notoriously hard to get right, so why they would be any different was seriously up for questioning.\n\nThe fact your also still looking at it in terms of the \"metaverse\" highlights where you are wrong.

I use to think the same, that VR was just for playing games and niche enthusiast's. That is until it saw what the [Meta quest pro could do](https://youtube.com/shorts/jUIE2l_9ig8?feature=share). This is where the real utility is, saying it's all about gaming and the in game second life, is like saying your phone is only good gaming and social media. Sure that is part of it, but it's not all of it. The fact companies will be able to use this to replace actual infrastructure, and people for increased utility is just massive in itself. VR/AR headsets/glasses will make all our lives more efficient, just like smartphones did. Maybe we will never use them as much as our phones depending on how good the form factor gets. But they will still have a huge impact all the same. It's possible going to work for a lot of people will involve using these headsets all day to do said work. The fact their is talk of Apple entering the space as well, also just highlights that Meta seems to be onto something.\n\n>You can't seriously argue that Zuck is more visionary than Musk.
