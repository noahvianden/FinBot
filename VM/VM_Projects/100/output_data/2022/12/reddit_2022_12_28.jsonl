{"title": "High IV Alert: Tesla (TSLA)", "selftext": "Tesla continues on a seemingly endless dive for new bottoms as the market gets colder towards Elon Musk. The options market seems to believe in a last minute rally towards the end of 2023.  Here is what we know:\n\n1. Implied Volatility is above 100% for all OTM calls with expiration date 12/30.  (image 1)\n2. Open Interest is biased towards calls 585 to 42%, back in 12/17 it was reversed 45% to 55% (image 2)\n3. Significant resistance levels built up at strikes $125 and $130 (image 3)\n4. 100K and 120K stocks pegged to hedges at strikes $125 and $130 respectively. As expiration gets closer and these strikes become less profitable, the contracts are closed and the hedges are released which further deflates the price of the underlying. (image 4)\n5. Strikes above $117 have above 70% probability of profit for option sellers.

This communication inference problem gets exponentially worse as the number of commenters in the discussion increases. It's a total mess of confusion.\n\nMoreover, buying and selling are actually different, in terms of mechanisms, motivations, psychology, dynamics, etc., and those differences impact how prices move up vs. down.
