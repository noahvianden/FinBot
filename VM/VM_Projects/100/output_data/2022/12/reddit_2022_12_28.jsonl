{"title": "High IV Alert: Tesla (TSLA)", "selftext": "Tesla continues on a seemingly endless dive for new bottoms as the market gets colder towards Elon Musk. The options market seems to believe in a last minute rally towards the end of 2023.  Here is what we know:\n\n1. Implied Volatility is above 100% for all OTM calls with expiration date 12/30.  (image 1)\n2. Open Interest is biased towards calls 585 to 42%, back in 12/17 it was reversed 45% to 55% (image 2)\n3. Significant resistance levels built up at strikes $125 and $130 (image 3)\n4. 100K and 120K stocks pegged to hedges at strikes $125 and $130 respectively. As expiration gets closer and these strikes become less profitable, the contracts are closed and the hedges are released which further deflates the price of the underlying. (image 4)\n5. Strikes above $117 have above 70% probability of profit for option sellers.

This communication inference problem gets exponentially worse as the number of commenters in the discussion increases. It's a total mess of confusion.\n\nMoreover, buying and selling are actually different, in terms of mechanisms, motivations, psychology, dynamics, etc., and those differences impact how prices move up vs. down.

{"title": "Metaverse off to ominous start after VR headset sales shrank in 2022", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/metaverse-off-to-ominous-start-after-vr-headset-sales-shrank-in-2022.html\n\nOver a year after changing his company\u2019s name to Meta and committing to spend billions of dollars developing the metaverse, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s bet on virtual reality is no closer to paying off. Sales of VR headsets in the U.S. this year declined 2% from a year earlier to $1.1 billion as of early December, according to data shared with CNBC by research firm NPD Group. Facebook\u2019s advertising business generates that much revenue about every three days. With the ad business mired in a slump, Zuckerberg has been looking to VR devices and related technology to pull Meta into the future. But data from analyst firm CCS Insight reveals that worldwide shipments of VR headsets as well as augmented reality devices dropped more than 12% year over year to 9.6 million in 2022.\n\nTaken together, the estimates of VR headset sales and shipments create a problematic picture for Meta, whose stock price has lost about two-thirds of its value this year. Zuckerberg has said he\u2019s playing the long game with the metaverse, expecting it take up to a decade to go mainstream and projecting it will eventually host hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. The Quest 2 has been around for a few years and, like any consumer electronics device, has lost some appeal as it\u2019s aged. And while Meta released a new VR headset in fall, the Quest Pro, that device is geared toward businesses and costs $1,100 more than the Quest 2, pushing it even further out of reach for many VR enthusiasts.\n\nMeta decided over the summer to raise the price of the Quest 2 by $100, citing inflationary pressures. Leo Gebbie, an analyst at CCS Insight, said in an email that Meta\u2019s price increase was a surprise \u201cgiven that the company has been willing to sell the headset at such a low margin to try and drive uptake of VR and gain a high market share.\u201d", "id": "zxl7up", "created_utc": 1672262081.0, "score": 440, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 258, "comments": [{"body": "Not super surprising sales are down.
