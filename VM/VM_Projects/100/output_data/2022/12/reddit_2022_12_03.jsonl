My opinion:\n\nOverall, they had poor growth the first couple years after IPO.  They were changing their model from direct sales of big ticket items to third party sales and high volume consumer staples.  \n\nSo as the volume of sales went up, they lost the highest profit margin business so that hurt their sales growth.  But even with that they underdelivered.\n\nBut this is a good decision long term and the last earnings report was actually really good (imo).  Large increase in revenue, net loss stayed about same, so improving margin.  They are basically breaking even minus advertising - which isn\u2019t great but def improving.  Their net loss stayed steady despite something like 45 percent more sales.  So they aren\u2019t just losing more to get more sales.\n\nSo high revenue growth, improving margins, some of the advertising should be coming off books to be matched with new sales mean they may break even in next year or so.  But if I\u2019m being honest, I think their path is to grow sales at the fastest clip they can without losing money so i don\u2019t expect any earnings any time soon - but if they can keep growth over 25 percent while breaking even I think that\u2019s a win\u2026 or even lose money for 45 percent growth is fine in a bull market not now.\n\nSo Financing will be hurt by market rates and exchange, but by my estimates they can survive a couple years even at status quo.  \n\nI also think the share price is crushed because the best companies to buy them were Chinese, and China has been crushed.\n\nAmazon is coming NOW, and that is scaring everyone but I think that\u2019s actually good.  Amazon will bring a lot of infrastructure and demand for online which should raise all the ships.  There is room for several online companies.  I also think if Amazon has any brains they\u2019ll just buy 25 percent of one of these dirt cheap front runners and build their network out from there instead of starting from scratch.  That should boost all of their values.\n\nIt\u2019s Africa - you knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.  But I still think what they got is worth way more than 4 per share and I bet they\u2019ll hit 20 in a year or two when everything recovers\u2026. But it\u2019s gonna be a white knuckle sorta investment, maybe 25 percent it goes to 20, 50 percent it limps around forever and and 25 percent it craps out.  It\u2019s not a BAD expected return, but just super risky and you can find some better bets out there if you look hard enough, but this isn\u2019t totally terrible for high risk profiles.\n\nBeyond that it comes down to can africa become a world economic engine.  Honestly the news of the last year strongly points to no.  Nationalization of mines, labor strikes, currency collapse, corruption all seem to be so imbedded it can\u2019t be solved in the next decade, and this Russian war is gonna make food scarce\u2026. But africa is resilient, so perhaps it can rise!  But a lot of jumia\u2019s potential value is in Africa\u2019s ability to have massive exponential growth which it has been really unable to deliver much in terms of positive signs.  But things change!  I wouldn\u2019t bet against africa to grow a ton in our lifetime, but you might not want to put all your eggs in Africa, in fact maybe just put one or two you can afford to lose cuz it\u2019s kinda obviously a bad idea on face.\n\nI also think the payout here is extreme.  If Jumia is the front runner, and africa becomes an economic engine either on its own or because of  some US/Chinese/India fallout\u2026 you might have that generational stock.  \n\nAs others have said, you might be better off with AFK or something if you aren\u2019t going to follow it close.", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "If I ever hear the \"X will become the Y of Z\" argument, I just buy Y.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Brilliant!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12374886870384216}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22697719931602478}, {"body": "I think its a lot of people hoping for the next big thing and not knowing the market over there.\n\nSame with the pump that happened with that Korean delivery company (name escapes me at the moment).

In videos posted online, workers upset about wages and Covid-19 restrictions could be seen throwing items and shouting \u201cStand up for your rights!\" Riot police were present, the videos show. The location of one of the videos was verified by the news agency and video-verification service Storyful. The Wall Street Journal corroborated events shown in the videos with workers at the site. Coming after a year of events that weakened China\u2019s status as a stable manufacturing center, the upheaval means Apple no longer feels comfortable having so much of its business tied up in one place, according to analysts and people in the Apple supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn the past, people didn\u2019t pay attention to concentration risks,\" said Alan Yeung, a former U.S. executive for Foxconn. \u201cFree trade was the norm and things were very predictable.

This is an ideal market for Tesla to move into for several reasons, some of which involve money but others that involve more intangible benefits.  The Pentagon is the single largest institutional user of fossil fuels on the planet and are aiming to cut that usage in half, in part via electrification.  They also make stringent demands on their supply chains being kept inside the borders of the United States, which means Tesla is one of only a handful of players that are even eligible to try to provide them with the technology they need to make that happen, and would provide the funds needed to fuel(pardon the pun) the on-shoring of the entire supply chain for North America, from raw materials onwards.  \n\nAnd then there is the political and social clout that comes with being a big supplier to the armed forces.\n\nSecondly, the aerospace industry is becoming increasingly serious about short-haul electric flights being a realistic scenario soon, and when that happens they will need top-tier batteries, motors and other core technologies.  I think it's a bite too big to expect Tesla to do planes soup to nuts, it's an industry with even more stringent standards than automotive when it comes to all sorts of safety regulations but partnering with an established maker of airplanes makes all kinds of sense, both from a business standpoint and in terms of cutting emissions.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I've looked into this a little bit as well and it's interesting.

Ukraine had a fuel crisis before it had a power crisis(although it has had both by now) as fuel storage and pipeline infrastructure  when hit tends to y\u00b4know....go up in flames.  That's the thing with fuel, be that jet fuel or diesel or whatever - it doesn't take very large bombs to create really big booms.  \n\nThe electrical grid on the other hand has taken some substantial licks but is generally up and running again, at least partially in a matter of days provided you have the spare parts and the manpower to fix it.  \n\nHowever, that does not change the fact that tactical vehicles, i.e those expected to be on the frontlines actually doing the fighting have to be able to be kept running when away from charging infrastructure, and therefore have to remain PHEV vehicles at best.  How big their batteries are compared to the power output of the engines is a tradeoff that has to be made for each individual vehicle type.  But even if not pure electric, there are multiple advantages to going PHEV that have nothing to do with going green.  For example, noise.  How quiet electric vehicles, including PHEV vehicles while operating purely off batteries is a bit of a problem in the civilian world but a major advantage in battle - I\u00b4ve seen stats that a main battle tank's power plant at full rev can be heard and distinguished at such by infantry at ranges up to two kilometers for example.  Friendly infantry operating in and around such vehicles will have issues just effectively communicating.  Being able to reduce thermal signature by running sensors and move turrets while in over watch, or even do some limited maneuvers purely off batteries is also a big plus.  \n\nNon-tactical vehicles on the other hand can and should be moved over to pure electric as soon as possible.  These include all the vehicles used on domestic US bases for a wide variety of purposes, and the investment in charging infrastructure there is money *very* well spent if it means saving fuel, as that means a much larger portion of the military's existing strategic fuel reserve storage facilities are available for warfighting purposes.  \n\nAs for EMP...people tend to worry too much about EMP weapons.
