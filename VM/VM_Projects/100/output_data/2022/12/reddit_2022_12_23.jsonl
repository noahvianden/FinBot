That scares me to want to buy one in the future and invest in it before these problems get sorted out which can hurt the company more in the future. \nOnce everything gets figured out and demand starts picking up, they have all the production in the world and a headstart on the EV market.

This year I'm not going home for Christmas but I've really been enjoying listening to those old Christmas carols, like \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\".

I think there was a spirit of optimism and even good will and cooperation in the western world.  Civil rights were a problem, but the ball started rolling for that in that era, too.  I dunno.  I hear that optimism reflected in that music.  And I was just thinking, that must be the Warren Buffet era.  And I just checked.  He bought his first stock at age 11, which would be in 1941.  It was indeed his era.\n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't invest, please, I'm 100% invested and I don't short!  This isn't investment advice, just a reflection on the state of things which I think has some relevance if you've decided to humor me thus far.  But I think the Warren era is over.  I don't feel that optimism in the USA anymore.  I don't even feel it here in Spain (even if for whatever reason life feels more down-to-Earth here).  I dunno.  It's a new era.  I guess the first cracks in the USA showed with Vietnam, which was about 50 years ago.  And around then Nixon closed the gold window.

Then I would think what it would take for them to double sales. They would have to cut prices below their cost to produce.  So that would worry me, a lot.  Since China is currently something like almost 40% their sales.  \n\nI would look at Europe and look at their current sales level.  I would also start looking at their market share trends.  I would then look at what they were trying to do in Europe over the next 2 years, and again, I would start worrying about margins. And the lofty, lofty growth they are trying to achieve.  Do I think they can grow sales significantly?  I do, but I think prices are going to bite them.\n\nOn to the US.  I would be more bullish about their prospects here.  IRA is going to help. But it\u2019s basically just a wash with the interest rate increases over the past 12 months.  And when your cheapest car is almost 50k, and the model you sell the most of is over 65k, there\u2019s going to be a lot of your customers that aren\u2019t even eligible for the tax credit.  Finally, I would be asking some hard questions about why they are offering an end of quarter discount if the issue is people waiting until January to buy.  It\u2019s only 2 weeks.  The cost of carry is 8k a month per car (3750 for 10 days)?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019ll go point by point, but thanks for actually responding.  \n\n1. For every 10% price reduction the market for those vehicles double (basically who can afford those) so in a sense, you answered your own question. I\u2019m not so sure that demand is a problem in China, given their actual sales. I\u2019ve heard a lot of noise but no actual data leads me to think that there will be a slowdown there, especially as they bring in cheaper versions of their cars. \n\n2. Europe still has significant backlog. Again, unsure that demand isn\u2019t there. Norway is a good example of a market leader and they just broke the record for the most of one vehicle ever sold in a year (model y) which was held by the VW beetle for decades. \n\n3. US is looking good with the IRA, the inventory has vanished (personally was thinking I\u2019d take advantage and upgrade my 3 to a Y but there were 0 within 200 miles of me). Cybertruck is going to be huge, I am not sure people are comprehending it yet, and deliveries will start this year on that. I would expect China to release a compact (only for Asia) end of 23, Europe to have its own in 24 and US to show more models this upcoming year. \n\nLastly, on the end of quarter discount, outside of the obvious ($7500 tax credit starts Jan 1) they probably will be moving to hardware 4 on all cars soon, which includes Hd radar. That will Osborne the ones they\u2019re making today pretty quickly. Better to sell them now. I\u2019m also not sure if a vehicle made Dec 31 would qualify for the $7500 tax credit or if it has to be made after Jan 1, 2023.

China is actually really transparent with their reported numbers, publishing weekly insured cars and monthly total sales and production.  There\u2019s currently zero wait for any Chinese made car in China, and China has incentives ending on dec 31.\n\nEurope\u2019s backlog has shrunk dramatically throughout the quarter, and there are reportedly quite a number of countries with inventory available to be sold.  So we shall see how things look in a week.  Backlog can\u2019t be too large if Tesla is choosing to ship german made cars to Taiwan.   \n\nTax credit is on sales date, not production date.

The ones left are the sycophants or the people who really believe in the vision and business. That last group are the ones (not the sycophants) who I really respect right now. I don't agree and think TSLA has always been super risky, partially because it is tied to one guy. \n\nIt is easy to dump on anything Elon right now and if TSLA becomes what it aspires to be, this might be the time to buy. I still wouldn't probably advise it, but whatevs. \n\nHonestly, if I were to look at this as a purchasing possibility, I would wait until Elon is forced to step down. I would guess the pps would drop significantly.
