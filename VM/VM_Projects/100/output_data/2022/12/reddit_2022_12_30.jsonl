{"title": "How WSB Can Make Money in the 2023 Bear Market.", "selftext": "**Please read this entire post, everything is important here!!!**\n\nSo usually wallstreetbets will find a meme stock and then we all load up on calls and buy shares, shorts have to cover, and then the stock price rockets.  \n\nI know people will get upset when I say this, but most of the price increase is caused by a gamma squeeze and not shorts covering.\n\nNow, because easy money is gone in the markets it is tough to find a stock that can run from shorts covering and a gamma squeeze. **This is where the genius idea comes in.**  Because of the way that the options market works we can: instead of pushing the price of stocks up... send them right into the ground.\n\n**Let me explain:**\n\nTypically when everyone on WSB loads up on calls for a meme stock, market makers who sold you those call contracts try to remain delta neutral (they only make money through the spread of the bid/ask of the contracts).  When the stock price increases the calls that everyone bought become closer to ITM which increases the delta, and because of this the market maker is forced to buy more shares to remain delta neutral.  Which then increases the price more, so they have to buy more and more shares pretty much.  This is what causes that huge exponential run-up we see at the top of meme stocks.\n\n**We can make money the other way:**\n\nInstead of looking for a stock that has way too many people stuck in short positions, buy calls, force them to cover, and profit.  We can do the exact opposite. *Look for a stock that has way too many people stuck in long positions, buy puts, force them to sell, and profit.* \n\nInverse gamma squeezes work the same way here, market makers who sell us the put contracts will want to remain delta neutral so they will sell shares.  When the puts become closer to ITM the market maker will have to sell more shares to remain delta neutral.  This then pushes the price down and they have to sell more and more shares.  It will cause an exponential move downward.\n\nThe most recent stock this has happened to is Tesla.  Way too many people were leveraged on long positions and when speculators started loading up on puts the stock went into a freefall. \n\n[$TSLA 2 Hour Chart](https://preview.redd.it/obkf2nxhd29a1.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8a859cdf8820b196d944d8beb43a92338301c3b)\n\nThis stock was at a 700 Billion market cap, and fell almost 50% in one month, that is insane.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cem Karsan](https://preview.redd.it/ix3f0y3ie29a1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6848298768d8912bd82a5f74c391731ebc206bad)\n\nThis guy has worked in quant funds and market making for over 20 years, he knows his stuff and way more than anyone in this sub. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cem Karsan](https://preview.redd.it/tfrug5vxe29a1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=f860ed8f9694b47ac9230ac8dfaafb40a1b5cded)\n\nHe knows that the majority of the recent decrease in Tesla's share price has been caused by an unusual amount of speculators loading up on put contracts.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion / TLDR:** \n\nInstead of looking for good companies that are over-shorted and then we load on calls...
