{"title": "How WSB Can Make Money in the 2023 Bear Market.", "selftext": "**Please read this entire post, everything is important here!!!**\n\nSo usually wallstreetbets will find a meme stock and then we all load up on calls and buy shares, shorts have to cover, and then the stock price rockets.  \n\nI know people will get upset when I say this, but most of the price increase is caused by a gamma squeeze and not shorts covering.\n\nNow, because easy money is gone in the markets it is tough to find a stock that can run from shorts covering and a gamma squeeze. **This is where the genius idea comes in.**  Because of the way that the options market works we can: instead of pushing the price of stocks up... send them right into the ground.\n\n**Let me explain:**\n\nTypically when everyone on WSB loads up on calls for a meme stock, market makers who sold you those call contracts try to remain delta neutral (they only make money through the spread of the bid/ask of the contracts).  When the stock price increases the calls that everyone bought become closer to ITM which increases the delta, and because of this the market maker is forced to buy more shares to remain delta neutral.  Which then increases the price more, so they have to buy more and more shares pretty much.  This is what causes that huge exponential run-up we see at the top of meme stocks.\n\n**We can make money the other way:**\n\nInstead of looking for a stock that has way too many people stuck in short positions, buy calls, force them to cover, and profit.  We can do the exact opposite. *Look for a stock that has way too many people stuck in long positions, buy puts, force them to sell, and profit.* \n\nInverse gamma squeezes work the same way here, market makers who sell us the put contracts will want to remain delta neutral so they will sell shares.  When the puts become closer to ITM the market maker will have to sell more shares to remain delta neutral.  This then pushes the price down and they have to sell more and more shares.  It will cause an exponential move downward.\n\nThe most recent stock this has happened to is Tesla.  Way too many people were leveraged on long positions and when speculators started loading up on puts the stock went into a freefall. \n\n[$TSLA 2 Hour Chart](https://preview.redd.it/obkf2nxhd29a1.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8a859cdf8820b196d944d8beb43a92338301c3b)\n\nThis stock was at a 700 Billion market cap, and fell almost 50% in one month, that is insane.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cem Karsan](https://preview.redd.it/ix3f0y3ie29a1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=6848298768d8912bd82a5f74c391731ebc206bad)\n\nThis guy has worked in quant funds and market making for over 20 years, he knows his stuff and way more than anyone in this sub. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cem Karsan](https://preview.redd.it/tfrug5vxe29a1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=f860ed8f9694b47ac9230ac8dfaafb40a1b5cded)\n\nHe knows that the majority of the recent decrease in Tesla's share price has been caused by an unusual amount of speculators loading up on put contracts.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion / TLDR:** \n\nInstead of looking for good companies that are over-shorted and then we load on calls...

If the Fed starts to celebrate the economy too much, this could backfire by causing markets to react in ways that counter their policy.

The Fed could just raise interest rates more to offset it, but it's better they just remain silent and let the market do the work for them. Thus, even if they internally are optimistic, they cannot make this *too* public.\n\nMy speculation: Jerome Powell is very pleased with inflation data in recent reports and most of the Fed has no plan on following their projected rate hike increases all the way (as depicted in their dot plots).

I can only think he wants to go after the job market because that's what worked half a century ago.\n\nAll together, there's also a good chance that he is snorting his own supply and genuinely believes what he's doing and saying.

I call bullshiit. The American Consumer is nearly tapped out of all savings, credit card debt has been on a strong increase the past few months. The warning signs are everywhere if you really look. Now that we're passed the the holiday season, three major things will happen:\n\n1- American consumption spending will fall off a Cliff. They are tapped out, credit cards are nearly maxed out. Ask me, I know :( \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2-Layoffs layoffs and more layoffs. As of November, unemployment rate is 3.7%. A lot of companies don't like to layoff during Thanksgiving and Christmas season. Google has been reluctant to layoff a significant portion of their staff...Expect Google to cut at least 3-8% off their workforce. Some friends in healthcare and other industries, especially in the discretionary spending sector are all Saying they will will let a great number of blue collar workers off in the coming months. Consumers won't and can't spend, no need for companies to be fully staffed. I'm expecting unemployment to hit 5-0% to 5.75% in 2023. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3- Housing market and rental prices will see a significant decrease. Overall Inflation will drop significantly after February. Great news right? No, not necessarily. See reason 1 & 2. Things will get ugly out there. For those older Millennial's, ask them if they remember 2008-2012 in the real world, where are the good jobs? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-As for the stock market, expect a major selloff in the coming 20-35 trading days. Earnings season will be bad in for Q4 2022 and much worse for Q1/Q2 2023. \n\nJan-October will be ugly in the real world. Really nothing the feds can do to stop the economy and jobs from vomiting and shedding workforce. We just gotta ride this tidal wave coming at us...2024 should be a much better year for stocks and jobs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Just my autistic view on the economy and markets.", "id": "zypuwy", "created_utc": 1672371434.0, "score": 284, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 332, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|537|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: 1- American consumption spending will fall off a Cliff.
