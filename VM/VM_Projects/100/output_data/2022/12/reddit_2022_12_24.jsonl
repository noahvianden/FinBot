{"title": "TSLA - Bull Case (Qualitative Opinion)", "selftext": "A lot of posts about folks dumping Tesla. Here are some counter points. I welcome feedback! Please be civil. \n\n1.\tI sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again. \n\n2.\tTesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn\u2019t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)\n\n3.\tTesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!\n\n4.\tThey are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something \u201cfrivolous\u201d like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly. \n\n5.\tTesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions. \n\n6.\tTesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes \u201cfat\u201d (ask any body builder). The \u201crecession\u201d is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!\n\n7.\tTesla is more than a car company\u201d. This is a polarizing statement! But let\u2019s look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do. \n\n8.\tThey are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple\u2019s consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!\n\n9.\tImportant point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution. Every challenge has been met with bold strategy and then executed to critical success. The team is the same, so why should the results be any different 10 years from now? Elon is one man and sure he may have brain fart from now and then, but the team and culture (results oriented) he has developed for the last 10 years will be the difference maker!\n\n10. Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest. I\u2019m confident that even in the absence of Elon, there will be a competent leader who take the reins and extract greatness. \n\n11. I\u2019m not going to call Elon a genius yet. But he is operating at much higher scale when compared to everyone else. Setting aside his success with PayPal. To gestate Tesla and at the same time expand into solar & rockets and compete successfully should show you that the man is not normal. And with this, you should expect some level of eccentricity. If not for this eccentricity (his downfall) he would likely rule the world. Be glad that Twitter is the channel for his eccentricities vs Tesla. \n\nAgain, these are all the musings of a random fool that is me.

Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again.\n\nThey do. Elon Musk is Tesla. People associate him with them. If he insults the left, which is the primary market of EVs and spouts right wing opinions, those will leave. There is a reason why nearly all CEOs try to be in the shadows and only present a curated version of themselves (Jobs)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn\u2019t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)\n\nHere is where you are wrong. Consumer report has them among the lowest ranking cars in terms of reliability. It is similar to Jeeps and Aston Martin. A specific group loves the car with the flaws - but once they go mainstream they don't. Tesla has now just gone mainstream and you have loads of complaints now. A car is a transportation vehicle. Technology might be cool for the group that used to buy Tesla's (and that now Musk is alienating), but not for the majority of people. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 that has faster charging, cheaper, very close in range (nobody could reproduce Tesla's EPA rating, but from other brands they could) and is more comfortable with better interiors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!\n\nFirst they do spend on advertising, they literally shot a Tesla into space. In fact they have the most expensive ad department in the world with Elon Musk. Musk cashed out 12b this year alone in stocks. No other company has the insane compensation package for the CEO. Tesla spends the most on advertising of any car company. They just call it compensation package for the CEO. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something \u201cfrivolous\u201d like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly.\n\nThey pay their suppliers 60 days later than most other car companies (Tesla around 82 days DPO - most other are max 30 days). Yes they are profitable now, but they are ramping factories quickly. If demand falls (and we are seeing that - why else would they have discounts in EU, US, China, Canada and Mexico) - then that profitability can quickly turn. Furthermore, FSD is smokes and mirrors and did not deliver what they promised. It could very quickly become a liability, if they have to refund them - and could seriously harm their cash cycle \n\n>Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions.\n\nTesla's cars are priced, because they were the first ones and people tolerated cheap materials for an EV that has high range. Now there are alternatives. There is inventory in the US and Europe now already. Yes they are probably cutting production and are already cutting staff, but they are still valued like the biggest car companies combined. If you stop the growth, they will go back to a more car company like valuation (especially as margins will compress with the discount and less sales). Most car companies trade at 5-8 PE. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes \u201cfat\u201d (ask any body builder). The \u201crecession\u201d is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!\n\nTesla still has not ramped production in two factories. That are huge costs without any proper gain yet. I don't think GE is the example you want to give, given that they had fraudulent numbers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla is more than a car company\u201d. This is a polarizing statement! But let\u2019s look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do.\n\nThey don't produce the solar panels - Samsung and Panasonic does. Insurance is a low margin business and I don't see any SaaS (FSD is not a product yet). The company loses money on everything except cars. So they are a car company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple\u2019s consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!\n\nWhat? Apple is hugely dependent on Foxconn. That Tesla controls most aspects of production is a positive and a negative. It comes with great margins in good times, but it also comes with worse ones when there is a recession. If a car part maker of VW goes down, they find a new one - but in recessions Tesla will weather all the cost. The dealerships are the same thing. you get the money, but in bad times the price cuts of other car makers influence the dealer margins - not their own, and dealers can make it up in service. \n\nIf you think that Tesla's decision are consumer centric, I advise you to read all the complaints about the service. People don't even get loaners. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Important point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution.

Furthermore they sold a huge amount of carbon credits. I give them credit, they managed to make EVs cool, but you can not give them an A for excectuion here.  Regarding culture, I advise you to look at all the racism lawsuits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest.

Seriously every cheap KIA/Mitsubishi has similar quality of materials. Secondly they are paying their suppliers later. the DPO (days payable outstanding) is 82 days for Tesla and 20-30 days for most other car companies. DPO doesn't make a difference if your earnings stay stable, but because Tesla pays their suppliers later and has grown fast the last few years, it appears that they have higher margins than they do. \n\nSo the high growth rate +. selling cheaper materials is most of their margin.

Either when Elon announces the CEO of Twitter or the location of the next gigafactory Mexico, it\u2019s off to the races, and if neither of those things happen\u2026 it\u2019s still about to go. The company is not currently going bankrupt so it\u2019s going to bounce, hard, before it continues its much deserved decline to reasonable levels. This is just market science, I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s been allowed to go this far. I tracked back the other day. On a five year chart Tesla has only been this oversold one other time. In 2019, it sold off 50% over 6 months then when it hit this same level of oversold it turned around and aggressively gained back 50% of what it lost over like 6 weeks.

You have to put a lot of miles on that battery to warrant how much fossil fuels went into harvesting it. Ontop of that, unless you are harvesting renewable energy, you're still consuming fossile fuels. Sure, you dont fill it up at a gas station, but your power company definitely is!

So let\u2019s agree to close the rich assumption.  \nNow about the energy sources and climate effect, you make some good points. But here\u2019s how i break it down.  \nOption A - we have clean energy sources and electric vehicles.  \nOption B - we have clean energy sources and hydrogen vehicles.  \nIn option A, there is some progress with clean energy sources but it\u2019s not completely there yet. EVs are further ahead and maybe we will be completely EV by 2040. We need both. Just because the sources of energy are not completely 100% clean does not discard the efforts being done in EVs. That said, even if the source if energy for EVs is not renewable, it could be better off. That\u2019s because the efficiency of power generation at a power plant (eg. A combined cycle gas powerplant) is much better than the efficiency at car engine. So it\u2019s a net positive regardless, although i agree it could be better.  \nWhen it comes to hydrogen as a source if energy, just like with EVs we need to be sure that the hydrogen comes from a clean source. There we have green hydrogen which is completely clean as it is sources from renewable sources like solar and wind through electrolysis. Then there is blue hydrogen which is generated through a process called steam reforming to natural gas. The process releases carbon dioxide which undergoes a process called carbon capture and sequestration, meaning the carbon is captured and trapped back into the earth instead of being released into the atmosphere. Notice that with green hydrogen, you already produce electricity then use the electricity to produce hydrogen. So in this case, the hydrogen is a method of transport of energy replacing the electrical grid cables and batteries.  \nWe still don\u2019t know which will be the winning technology as they are all undergoing fast development and non have economies of scale yet.

They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?\n\n\u00a7 Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n\u00a7 Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.\n\no Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.\n\n\u00a7 They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.\n\n\u00b7 **Can it be Replicated?**\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n\u00a7 None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.\n\n\u00a7 Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n\u00a7 Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)\n\n\u00a7 Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%\n\n\u00a7 ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%\n\n\u00a7 FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n\u00a7 In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets\n\n\u00a7 Low-Cost Provider:\n\n\u00b7 Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \\~12% gross margins and \\~1% free cash flow margins.\n\n\u00b7 It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla\u2019s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.\n\n\u00a7 Intangibles\n\n\u00b7 As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon\u2019s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.\n\n\u00b7 Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.\n\n\u00b7 First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.\n\n\u00b7 Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don\u2019t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren\u2019t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.\n\n\u00b7 It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like \u201copen your butthole\u201d to access the charging port. It\u2019s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n\u00a7 No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n\u00a7 To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n\u00a7 Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.\n\n\u00b7 **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.\n\n\u00b7 **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?\n\n\u00a7 Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n\u00a7 Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.\n\n\u00a7 It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn\u2019t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.\n\n\u00a7 When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.\n\n\u00b7 **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n\u00a7 Ha! Difficult, very difficult!\n\n\u00a7 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion\n\n\u00a7 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)\n\n\u00a7 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from \u201925 to \u201928)\n\n\u00a7 Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449\n\n\u00a7 Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \\~2.0%\n\n\u00a7 Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \\~5.4%\n\n\u00a7 Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.\n\n\u00a7 This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.\n\n\u00a7 Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.\n\n\u00a7 To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for \u201925.\n\n\u00a7 At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.\n\n\u00a7 With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.\n\n\u00a7 When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05\n\n\u00a7 With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n\u00a7 For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.\n\nSources:\n\nAggregated Data: [https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:TSLA](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:TSLA)\n\n10-Q 09/30/22: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022019867/tsla-20220930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022019867/tsla-20220930.htm)\n\n10-K 12/31/21: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.htm)\n\nCurrently Long TSLA\n\nEdit: Math Typos", "id": "zuaium", "created_utc": 1671890858.0, "score": 274, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 342, "comments": [{"body": "Question for you.
