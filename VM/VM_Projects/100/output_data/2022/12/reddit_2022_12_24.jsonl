{"title": "TSLA - Bull Case (Qualitative Opinion)", "selftext": "A lot of posts about folks dumping Tesla. Here are some counter points. I welcome feedback! Please be civil. \n\n1.\tI sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again. \n\n2.\tTesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn\u2019t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)\n\n3.\tTesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!\n\n4.\tThey are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something \u201cfrivolous\u201d like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly. \n\n5.\tTesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions. \n\n6.\tTesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes \u201cfat\u201d (ask any body builder). The \u201crecession\u201d is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!\n\n7.\tTesla is more than a car company\u201d. This is a polarizing statement! But let\u2019s look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do. \n\n8.\tThey are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple\u2019s consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!\n\n9.\tImportant point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution. Every challenge has been met with bold strategy and then executed to critical success. The team is the same, so why should the results be any different 10 years from now? Elon is one man and sure he may have brain fart from now and then, but the team and culture (results oriented) he has developed for the last 10 years will be the difference maker!\n\n10. Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest. I\u2019m confident that even in the absence of Elon, there will be a competent leader who take the reins and extract greatness. \n\n11. I\u2019m not going to call Elon a genius yet. But he is operating at much higher scale when compared to everyone else. Setting aside his success with PayPal. To gestate Tesla and at the same time expand into solar & rockets and compete successfully should show you that the man is not normal. And with this, you should expect some level of eccentricity. If not for this eccentricity (his downfall) he would likely rule the world. Be glad that Twitter is the channel for his eccentricities vs Tesla. \n\nAgain, these are all the musings of a random fool that is me.

Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again.\n\nThey do. Elon Musk is Tesla. People associate him with them. If he insults the left, which is the primary market of EVs and spouts right wing opinions, those will leave. There is a reason why nearly all CEOs try to be in the shadows and only present a curated version of themselves (Jobs)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn\u2019t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)\n\nHere is where you are wrong. Consumer report has them among the lowest ranking cars in terms of reliability. It is similar to Jeeps and Aston Martin. A specific group loves the car with the flaws - but once they go mainstream they don't. Tesla has now just gone mainstream and you have loads of complaints now. A car is a transportation vehicle. Technology might be cool for the group that used to buy Tesla's (and that now Musk is alienating), but not for the majority of people. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 that has faster charging, cheaper, very close in range (nobody could reproduce Tesla's EPA rating, but from other brands they could) and is more comfortable with better interiors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!\n\nFirst they do spend on advertising, they literally shot a Tesla into space. In fact they have the most expensive ad department in the world with Elon Musk. Musk cashed out 12b this year alone in stocks. No other company has the insane compensation package for the CEO. Tesla spends the most on advertising of any car company. They just call it compensation package for the CEO. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something \u201cfrivolous\u201d like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly.\n\nThey pay their suppliers 60 days later than most other car companies (Tesla around 82 days DPO - most other are max 30 days). Yes they are profitable now, but they are ramping factories quickly. If demand falls (and we are seeing that - why else would they have discounts in EU, US, China, Canada and Mexico) - then that profitability can quickly turn. Furthermore, FSD is smokes and mirrors and did not deliver what they promised. It could very quickly become a liability, if they have to refund them - and could seriously harm their cash cycle \n\n>Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions.\n\nTesla's cars are priced, because they were the first ones and people tolerated cheap materials for an EV that has high range. Now there are alternatives. There is inventory in the US and Europe now already. Yes they are probably cutting production and are already cutting staff, but they are still valued like the biggest car companies combined. If you stop the growth, they will go back to a more car company like valuation (especially as margins will compress with the discount and less sales). Most car companies trade at 5-8 PE. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes \u201cfat\u201d (ask any body builder). The \u201crecession\u201d is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!\n\nTesla still has not ramped production in two factories. That are huge costs without any proper gain yet. I don't think GE is the example you want to give, given that they had fraudulent numbers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla is more than a car company\u201d. This is a polarizing statement! But let\u2019s look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do.\n\nThey don't produce the solar panels - Samsung and Panasonic does. Insurance is a low margin business and I don't see any SaaS (FSD is not a product yet). The company loses money on everything except cars. So they are a car company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple\u2019s consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!\n\nWhat? Apple is hugely dependent on Foxconn. That Tesla controls most aspects of production is a positive and a negative. It comes with great margins in good times, but it also comes with worse ones when there is a recession. If a car part maker of VW goes down, they find a new one - but in recessions Tesla will weather all the cost. The dealerships are the same thing. you get the money, but in bad times the price cuts of other car makers influence the dealer margins - not their own, and dealers can make it up in service. \n\nIf you think that Tesla's decision are consumer centric, I advise you to read all the complaints about the service. People don't even get loaners. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Important point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution.

Furthermore they sold a huge amount of carbon credits. I give them credit, they managed to make EVs cool, but you can not give them an A for excectuion here.  Regarding culture, I advise you to look at all the racism lawsuits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest.

Seriously every cheap KIA/Mitsubishi has similar quality of materials. Secondly they are paying their suppliers later. the DPO (days payable outstanding) is 82 days for Tesla and 20-30 days for most other car companies. DPO doesn't make a difference if your earnings stay stable, but because Tesla pays their suppliers later and has grown fast the last few years, it appears that they have higher margins than they do. \n\nSo the high growth rate +. selling cheaper materials is most of their margin.

Either when Elon announces the CEO of Twitter or the location of the next gigafactory Mexico, it\u2019s off to the races, and if neither of those things happen\u2026 it\u2019s still about to go. The company is not currently going bankrupt so it\u2019s going to bounce, hard, before it continues its much deserved decline to reasonable levels. This is just market science, I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s been allowed to go this far. I tracked back the other day. On a five year chart Tesla has only been this oversold one other time. In 2019, it sold off 50% over 6 months then when it hit this same level of oversold it turned around and aggressively gained back 50% of what it lost over like 6 weeks.
