While NVDA is a profitable business will continue to make $$$ at current prices that are overvalued if the expectation is that they are going to grow into their inflated P/E number. \n\n1) At the current price, NVDA is overvalued \n\n2) Crypto has crashed and is continuing to crash. The last time this happened the market got flooded with GPUs as miners were trying to recoup their losses. This is already happening and will soften new GPU sales \n\n3) While NVDA Mellanox products are in high demand (at one point for a normal player who is not a hyperscaler, the lead time for network cards hit 52 weeks) the Industry moved to qualify/give market share to NVDA's competitors where they have competition (boo NVDA's monopoly on InfiBand devices).\n\n4) Crappy TA! The resistance levels that NVDA is running into currently is $192.74 on 2022-08-04 & $191.64 on 2022-08-15. So if you assume the stock price rejects those levels within a \\~5% margin that's \\~$183.30. We touched $187.90 and fell off it after there OMG 7.1% inflation is great move. \n\n5) I believe the Marco is more downside for another 12-18 months.
