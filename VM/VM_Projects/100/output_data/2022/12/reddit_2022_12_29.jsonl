Here\u2019s why:\n\nThis year, Tesla will post ~$10B free cash flow (up 100% from last year, 258% from 2 years ago, and 827% from 3 years ago). Now let\u2019s do a simple and conservative 10 year discounted cash flow with the following assumptions:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060\u206012% discount rate in the 10 year period\n2.\t\u2060\u2060\u20608% terminal discount rate\n3.\t\u2060\u2060\u20603% terminal growth rate inline with GDP growth, and less than half S&P 500 long term earnings growth rate.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060\u206040% free cash flow growth in the first year that glides down linearly to 3% over the 10 years.

There is plenty of upside: increase the growth rate in the 10 year period or the terminal period, decrease the discount rate to be more inline with S&P 500 returns, and you can make bull cases several times higher than today\u2019s Tesla price.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">This averages out to a compound annual growth rate of 23%, which is similar to Apple/Google over the 10 years after they first reached \\~$10b FCF.\n\nLet me stop you there. Apple/Google have an asset-light business model, and the tailwind of a rising internet. The car sector is very mature and capex is huge. \n\nFurthermore at 23% growth rate, that would mean 79b in FCF after the 10 years. \n\nVW has 24b. So you expect the company to do 3.2x the FCF of VW, who sells 7x more cars than Tesla - and that with no new models in the pipeline and an aging fleet. Furthermore at current prices, Tesla is worth 4.6x VW. So even when they get to that cash flow (which I don't think they will), the company will rerate to a similar PE due to growth stagnating after 10 years. \n\nYour DCF is a pipedream. It is more likely that Tesla's growth will stall in 2023, given that their lineup is aging, competition is already outselling them in EU/China and that the market for 60k+ cars is limited. The price cuts in EU/China/US/Mexico/Canada already point to demand lowering (all the while VW and BYD are increasing prices). Btw the average 3.5k discount that Tesla now offers would decrease their earnings by around 30% given that they make 9.2k per car. So they need to grow 30% next year, just to keep earnings even. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>: increase the growth rate in the 10 year period or the terminal period, \n\n23% is a crazy assumption for any business given the increased interest rates. It is insanity for a car company. Keep in mind that in contrast to Software, production gets exponentially more expensive. Assuming that 1 factory can produce 500k cars, to grow from 500k to 1m -  you just need one more factor, but to get another double you now need 2. TO get another double you now need four. These come with huge costs and labor expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> decrease the discount rate to be more inline with S&P 500 returns,\n\nYou are investing into a single stock tho, the discount rate should be higher not lower. I always assume a 15% discount rate, due to more risk investing into one stock.

You argue that we should price in the Semi etc for Tesla - but shouldn't you price in the reduction in dealer networks then?

Who\u2019s into free speech.  \n\nVery little about Musk's past indicates that he is a liberal at all, other than his own say-so (which means nothing). Regardless, it doesn't matter what his history is. What matters is what he's doing right now, and what he's doing right now is courting the far-right (who knows why, it's not going to be profitable I can say that much). And make no mistake, the right-wing in the US is fucking insane. This is important because Tesla isn't just a US company, they have an international reputation, and that international reputation has already suffered significantly and will continue to do so at this rate until he's removed and dissociated from the company completely. I live in Canada - Conservatives here are moving further right than they ever have, and even they look at the right-wing in the US and think they look like idiots. And that includes Musk - now at least, if not before.\n\nLikewise, his 'free speech' crusade is anything but. He's adopted the US right-wing 'strategy' of claiming to be pro-free speech/1A, but at the same time using his wealth and now his platform (Twitter) to silence and harass those who don't conform to his personal views. If you believe he's some kind of crusader in this regard, then so be it, I'm not going to change your mind -- but the more important part re: Tesla's stock value is that Musk has shown himself to be an insanely bad CEO at Twitter, he's making moves that open the company up to massive legal repercussions and very likely sanctions from the EU unless he reverses course. None of this inspires confidence at Tesla, and the reason Tesla has gotten this far is that they have an entire management team dedicated to keeping Musk out of the company business -- he's valued for his cult of personality/being the face of the brand, and now that brand is poison specifically because of this dumbass crusade.\n\nAt the end of the day people can make whatever investment decisions they want. You can make whatever inane claims you want. I'm here to counter that and say -- TSLA is going down, not up, and people should be prepared to see that happen. I doubt the stock passes $200 any time soon if ever. There's the possibility that it could see a significant bounce up in the near future, but long-term it's going much further down.

The thing is, Musk just came out and said they will trade off margins for volume, which is a good way of providing potential value in the future, as more cars on the roads are compatible with FSD, the greater the payoff will be when and if they solve it.
