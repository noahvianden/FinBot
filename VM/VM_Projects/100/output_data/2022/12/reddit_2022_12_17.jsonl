{"title": "John Carmack leaving META. \u201c\u2026 we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort \u2026 our organization is operating at half the effectiveness \u2026\u201d", "selftext": "Virtual Reality Pioneer Is Leaving Meta\n\nJohn Carmack, who was chief technology officer of Oculus, which Meta bought, is departing the company.\n\nJohn Carmack, a pioneer of virtual reality technology, is leaving Meta after more than eight years at the company, according to an internal post reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nIn the post, which was written by Mr. Carmack, 52, the technologist criticized his employer. He said Meta, which is in the midst of transitioning from a social networking company to one focused on the immersive world of the metaverse, was operating at \u201chalf the effectiveness\u201d and has \u201ca ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been a struggle for me,\u201d Mr. Carmack wrote in the post, which was published on an internal forum this week. \u201cI have a voice at the highest levels here, so it feels like I should be able to move things, but I\u2019m evidently not persuasive enough.\u201d\n\nAs the former chief technology officer of Oculus, the virtual reality company that Facebook bought for $2 billion in 2014, Mr. Carmack was one of the most influential voices leading the development of V.R. headsets. He stayed with Facebook after Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, decided to shift the company last year to focus on the metaverse and renamed Facebook as Meta.\n\nYet even though Meta was moving swiftly into an area that Mr. Carmack specialized in, he was sometimes a dissenting voice about how the effort was going. He became known for internal posts that criticized the decision-making and direction set forth by Mr. Zuckerberg and Andrew Bosworth, Meta\u2019s chief technology officer. Mr. Carmack had been working part-time for the company in recent years.\n\nWhat Is the Metaverse, and Why Does It Matter?\n\n\nThe origins. The word \u201cmetaverse\u201d describes a fully realized digital world that exists beyond the one in which we live. It was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel \u201cSnow Crash,\u201d and the concept was further explored by Ernest Cline in his novel \u201cReady Player One.\u201d\n\nThe future. Many people in tech believe the metaverse will herald an era in which our virtual lives will play as important a role as our physical realities. Some experts warn that it could still turn out to be a fad or even dangerous.\n\nMr. Carmack and Meta did not respond to requests for comment. Insider earlier reported on Mr. Carmack\u2019s departure.\n\nMeta\u2019s earnings have been hit hard by its spending on the metaverse and its slowing growth in social networking and digital advertising. In July, the Silicon Valley company posted its first sales decline as a public company. Last month, Meta said it was laying off about 11,000 employees, or about 13 percent of its work force, in what amounted to the company\u2019s most significant job cuts.\n\nIn a podcast interview in August, Mr. Carmack said Meta\u2019s $10 billion loss at the time in the division housing its augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives made him \u201csick to my stomach.\u201d He added that the company\u2019s metaverse efforts have been hampered by bureaucracy and dogged by concerns about diversity and privacy.\n\nIn other posts seen by The Times from this year, Mr. Carmack criticized features on the company\u2019s Quest virtual reality headsets. In his farewell post, he commended the Quest 2 headset as \u201calmost exactly what I wanted to see from the beginning\u201d in terms of its cost and mobile hardware, though he was still critical of its software.\n\n\u201cWe built something pretty close to The Right Thing,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Carmack\u2019s post, which said he was ending his decade in V.R., concluded by saying he had \u201cwearied of the fight\u201d and would focus on his own start-up. (He announced in August that his artificial intelligence firm, Keen Technologies, had raised $20 million.)\n\n\u201cV.R. can bring value to most of the people in the world, and no company is better positioned to do it than Meta,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBefore Meta, Mr. Carmack pioneered various techniques in computer graphics that became crucial to games that he developed, including Quake. He joined Oculus in 2013 as chief technology officer and stepped down from that role in 2019, moving into a part-time role.\n\nMr. Carmack this week also testified in a court hearing over the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s attempt to block Meta\u2019s purchase of Within, the virtual reality start-up behind a fitness game called Supernatural. The agency has argued that the tech giant will snuff out competition in the nascent metaverse if it is allowed to complete the deal. The hearing is expected to continue next week.", "id": "zogyrh", "created_utc": 1671313020.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "With Carmack leaving, maybe John Romero is available.  /s", "score": 150, "replies": [{"body": "He\u2019s going to make Meta his bitch.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "It makes me so happy that this is the only thing people remember about Daikatana.", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "It was the only good thing about Daikatana.", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7897076606750488}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08795061707496643}], "tickers": ["meta"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Yeah, the way their career paths have diverged is interesting.\n\nCarmack has been working at or near the forefront of interactive media pretty much non-stop for the past 30+ years.\n\nMeanwhile, what has Romero been doing for the past 20 years?
