{"title": "Three reasons why I believe lows are not yet in", "selftext": "I've been in cash since late 2021.  For some specific holdings, I was in cash a little longer.  I've ignored the urge to buy over the last several months despite a couple compelling rallies.  I believe we're headed lower in early 2023, and here's why.\n\n1. Shiller PE has exceeded 30 three times in history (four if you count 2018 as a separate occurence): 1929, dot-com, 2018 and 2020-2021.  In every instance, a correction followed.  **We are still at 29.26.**  That is very expensive.  I'm not going to get into the details of why I think criticisms of Shiller PE are mostly misguided, but I think any criticism that could be levied is probably outweighed right now by the fact that we have the highest Fed Funds Rate of the last twenty years, and that should significantly impact the price we're willing to pay for earnings.\n2. The terminal rate is now likely going to be higher than previously thought, yet the market hasn't adjusted.  In the September dot plot (page 4: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf)), not a single FOMC member projected a terminal rate over 5%.  Last week, Powell himself said the terminal rate will be higher than projected by that dot plot, and we can probably back into that conclusion just by starting with the current rate target (3.75-4%) and adding in a couple very likely looming 50bps hikes.  Just those two hikes get us to 5%.  Does anyone honestly believe the Fed will be done at that point?  I can't imagine so.  While the path down to 5-6% on CPI might be somewhat easy, it's highly unlikely it won't take more to get to 2-3%.  I don't think stock prices are properly accounting for this material change in expectations and its corresponding real economy threat.\n3. **Markets don't bottom before recessions begin.**  This hasn't happened a single time in the last 80 years (see for yourself: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)).  While markets might bottom before a recession is declared, the beginning date of that recession (declared after the fact) has pretty much always been before the bottom of the market.  Does anyone think a recession will be declared to have begun in Q4 2022?  I can't imagine so with unemployment this low.  This is a point I see people get wrong all the time on this sub.  While it's true that stocks often head higher before recessions are over, they don't do so before recessions begin.\n\nThose are my reasons.

It\u2019s so funny that so many people here think they can beat these algos consistently when they have no idea what they\u2019re up against. SIG is also a privately-owned company so it\u2019s impossible to assess (from the outside) which strategies are working and which aren\u2019t at any given time. Google Jeff Yass, fascinating back story of SIG\u2019s founding. \n\nOn the other hand, I find it ironic that these algos are themselves causing market distortions that can be capitalized on by live traders. Algos are likely the primary reason there have been so many 2% one-day swings this year. One example is the algos that trade on headlines, which are often misleading or can be misinterpreted, thus the algos can easily create these inefficiencies. Just check out SPX\u2019s spike up due to Powell\u2019s comments last week, which we have now given all back because the headlines didn\u2019t tell the whole story.

My guess would be that this would pull forward the bottom a bit so it's possible we could bottom before the recession happens this time around.\n\nPeople also keep asking why the VIX isn't higher, but that's because the market has been fairly well hedged this year. That quite bullish imo because there's a lot of money ready to come back into the market. You yourself are an example of this. All that's really required is continued good news on the inflation front and it seems likely the bottom is in and people like yourself will begin to put money back in.\n\nThirdly, so far this is an entirely Fed caused recession. It's not like anything has systematically broken in the economy. There's no global pandemic, no financial crisis, it's just the Fed slowing demand which can easily be reversed as we saw in early 2019. Given this and the fact employment is strong I think the market is largely betting against a deep recession that would warrant significantly more downside from here.\n\nFinally, even if you think the terminal rate is higher than priced it isn't sustainable anyway. The neutral rate of interest is where supply and demand is in balance, but today almost no one can afford a mortgage given where house prices and rates are today. For rates to sustainably go higher we basically have to have a significant housing correction for supply / demand to fall back into balance. And if housing has a significant correction you're basically guaranteed to see a recession and in that scenario the Fed would likely ease so I'm not even convinced that's a likely outcome.\n\nFor me the bear case is purely valuation. I simply think a lot of large cap valuations are excessive. I don't personally understand why a company like COST has a PE in the high 30s when historically it's traded in the low to mid twenties. And there are many examples of companies like this. JNJ is another which a few years back used to trade in the mid-teens and today trades in the mid-twenties - why?

I think the fact they are now showing some flexibility and have stopped name dropping Volcker should suggest they're at least mindful about overtightening.\n\nOut of interest where do you see the valuation issue? I assume you're speaking broadly about the S&P500, but within the S&P500 we're seeing interesting valuation differentials at the moment. Most large cap tech companies are trading at historically low valuations while companies like UNH, PG, JNJ, COST, WMT, LLY are all trading at valuations 50% - 100% above their historical averages for example.\n\nPersonally I think there's a chance we might just see a rotation over the next 6 months.

How much of that GDP growth is about worldwide inflation?   Just because GDP growth is not negative, does that mean people aren't hurting?\n\nYour Schiller PE is why I think we still have some down to go in the stock market.    The Fed started printing money by quantitative easing buying all sorts of stuff  to ease the effects of Covid, and that drove all investments way up.  Now is the time when we have to pay that piper on all sorts of investments.  That might not see effects in the real economy, evidenced by the unemployment rate.\n\nBecause of that wacky fed buying so much stuff, it might be that we see a market bottom without much of a GDP contraction, so \"markets don't bottom before recessions begin\" might be different this time, like the recession in GDP might be small or non-existent, or disconnected from the markets.  Hope is people can keep their heads, keep people working, and this is more of an adjustment to the quantitative easing.  \n\nI think that covid combined with the huge quantitative easing makes this a little different this time around.   After the previous pandemic, stocks had a great run up for a decade, but I'm not sure there was so much quantitative easing for that one.   Of course, the previous pandemic was also confounded with wars, and had an actual population decline two things we didn't see with covid.   The \n\nSchiller home price index is particularly interesting after the previous pandemic.  That's been on a decade long up/down swing too, and really looks like an up now.\n\nAs far as partying like it's the twenties, a factor in the great depression was the weather, that impacted food production.   We've got ways to mitigate that now, and equipment so that food production takes a much smaller portion of the population, but we do have a little weather issue now.  If it doesn't rain soon, the US southwest might need to be depopulated as the Colorado river dries up.  That goes further, with the Yangtze, the Rhine, the Mississippi rivers also being pretty low.  If it doesn't rain, we're going to have some big trouble.\n\n\nI'll throw out my DCA on robins, in that you're screwed either way for the next year or two,  taking a longer 5+ year look, and this is fine.
