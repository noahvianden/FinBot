Brand perception is tangible and important, especially for purchases heavily wrapped in questions of personal identity and status like a new car.   Brand perception has been measurably harmed.  \n\nProducts do speak for themselves, you're right.  They announce \"this is who I am, this is the culture I align with\", and brands carefully manage what their products say and mean.  You think the swarms of massive, pristine pickup trucks dominating right wing suburbia are just rationally chosen products picked for their utilitarian functionality?  Don't be absurd.  They're cultural markers, powerful ones.   A strong product does speak for itself, but brand perception is literally part of product strength.\n\nFurther, the culture wars are all consuming.  The shifts in brand perception are not equally distributed, and point to an increasingly partisan view of the company on the part of consumers.  That is bad.  Very bad.  If Tesla is seen as being firmly on the right wing side of the culture wars that will be catastrophic for demand in the US and EU.  \n\nI think the years of online shitflinging over Tesla has led to a certain amount of built in willingness to ignore any question of \"sentiment\" because there's always been so much \"controversy\" of the sort that takes up a lot of words on reddit or twitter but doesn't mean a goddamn thing in the real world.   These were categorically different to the perception shift we're seeing now - they were largely about Tesla as a company and investment opportunity, not Tesla as a car brand.\n\nMost of the \"perception\" issues and \"controversy\" in the past have been confined to TSLA as stock or Musk personally.  This is the first time we've seen that spill over to Tesla as an automotive brand in a statistically measurable way.       Note that the relevant metrics existed throughout all of Elon's earlier silly dustups, and they barely moved.  *This time is different*. \n\nYou may still argue that it doesn't change the long term case for TSLA, but I don't think it's accurate to argue that this debacle hasn't harmed the company \"fundamentals\" in any way.  The concerning shifts in sentiment here are not about short term stock sentiment and the recent share price dive, they're about the big picture perception of Tesla  products among potential consumers.
