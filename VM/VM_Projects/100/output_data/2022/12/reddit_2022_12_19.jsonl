Brand perception is tangible and important, especially for purchases heavily wrapped in questions of personal identity and status like a new car.   Brand perception has been measurably harmed.  \n\nProducts do speak for themselves, you're right.  They announce \"this is who I am, this is the culture I align with\", and brands carefully manage what their products say and mean.  You think the swarms of massive, pristine pickup trucks dominating right wing suburbia are just rationally chosen products picked for their utilitarian functionality?  Don't be absurd.  They're cultural markers, powerful ones.   A strong product does speak for itself, but brand perception is literally part of product strength.\n\nFurther, the culture wars are all consuming.  The shifts in brand perception are not equally distributed, and point to an increasingly partisan view of the company on the part of consumers.  That is bad.  Very bad.  If Tesla is seen as being firmly on the right wing side of the culture wars that will be catastrophic for demand in the US and EU.  \n\nI think the years of online shitflinging over Tesla has led to a certain amount of built in willingness to ignore any question of \"sentiment\" because there's always been so much \"controversy\" of the sort that takes up a lot of words on reddit or twitter but doesn't mean a goddamn thing in the real world.   These were categorically different to the perception shift we're seeing now - they were largely about Tesla as a company and investment opportunity, not Tesla as a car brand.\n\nMost of the \"perception\" issues and \"controversy\" in the past have been confined to TSLA as stock or Musk personally.  This is the first time we've seen that spill over to Tesla as an automotive brand in a statistically measurable way.       Note that the relevant metrics existed throughout all of Elon's earlier silly dustups, and they barely moved.  *This time is different*. \n\nYou may still argue that it doesn't change the long term case for TSLA, but I don't think it's accurate to argue that this debacle hasn't harmed the company \"fundamentals\" in any way.  The concerning shifts in sentiment here are not about short term stock sentiment and the recent share price dive, they're about the big picture perception of Tesla  products among potential consumers.

Which I personally think is very confusing, what determines the delta, please correct me if i am incorrect but to my knowledge delta is how much the option value goes up if the underlying rises or drops by a dollar. So why are some delta so much higher then others and what does that mean? Please elaborate as much as you can!!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "An options price has two componentes, intrinsic value and extrinsic value.  Intrinsic value happens when the contract is in the money which makes sense when you think about it.  For example if the strike of a call is $50 and the underlying is currently priced at $60, then the right to buy shares at $50 has value.  Extrinsic value is more about time and volatility.  So when a contract is out of the money, it only has extrinsic value since there is no intrinsic value in a contract to buy shares at $50 when the underlying is priced at $40.\n\nNow let\u2019s bring this back to delta.  Yes, delta is an estimate of the expected change in contract value based on the underlying moving 1 point.  There is more value in an in the money contract than an out of the money contract so it\u2019s reasonable to think that contracts at different strikes would have different price changes.\n\nNow let\u2018s talk time.  Extrinsic value tends to drop over time as the contract approaches expiration.  So it\u2019s reasonable to think that the price changes based on price movement would also be different here.\n\nAnother analogy that might help.  Floor traders have long used the delta of a contract to estimate the probability that a contract will expire at least $.01 in the money at expiration.  It\u2019s not an exact probability but it\u2019s close enough.  So in that light, seeing different deltas at different strikes and different times makes sense as well.  Ever notice that a contract at or very near the money is about $.50?  That would tell a trader that contract has about a 50% chance of being in the money which makes sense when it\u2019s right at the money since it could just as easily go either way.  Once it starts to move away from the money those probabilities would change based on the amount and direction of the move.\n\nAnyway, hopefully something in this gives you an idea of why deltas are different.

If the value of the cash you'd get from taking the profit now is worth more to you than the potential gain in the future, take the profit now. Otherwise, hold. \n\nAnother way to state that is hold only when your [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result) is sufficiently positive, otherwise exit.\n\nAlso, [risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/risk_reward_and_exits)\n\n> 3/ What percentage of your portfolio is typically allocated to hedging?

If there is a big down move, the other purpose of the puts are to prevent margin call (by expanding in value as the overall portfolio drops) - is there a standard or best practice to avoid margin calls?\n\nAll of the above are viable techniques. It all comes down to how much money you want to pay for insurance. By analogy, if you have a $500k house, it would be silly to spend more than $500k on insurance for it, so you pay some amount less according to your risk of loss. So you have to figure out your probability-weighted risk of loss and then hedge accordingly. For example (very simplified), if you think there is a 10% chance of total loss of the house, you should pay no more than $50k/year for insurance that covers the entire value of the house.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the cost of the hedge directly reduces your forward rate of return. If you end up spending 3% of the account value per year, that's 3% you have to make up in gains.

{"title": "Elizabeth Warren has said: Elon Musk took over Twitter, but he's still the CEO of Tesla (TSLA). That raises legal concerns \u2014 is he creating conflicts of interest? Is he misappropriating company resources?", "selftext": "In a letter to Tesla\u2019s board, the Democratic senator asks whether investors have been harmed by the billionaire tech mogul\u2019s time running the social network.\n\nElon Musk\u2019s chaotic tenure running Twitter has already drawn scrutiny from an array of international government officials, who have professed concern about his changes to content moderation, including the suspension of several journalists, and new restrictions on promoting rival social networks. (The Musk management style was again on display after his followers voted to give him the boot as the Twitter C.E.O. in a poll he ran overnight; more on the latest head-snapping developments later.)\n\nNow, DealBook is first to report, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is taking aim at an issue with more serious potential legal consequences: whether Mr. Musk has created a series of conflicts of interest with and misappropriation of resources from Tesla, the electric carmaker he also runs.\n\n*\u201cAs you know, it is the legal obligation of Tesla\u2019s board to ensure that its C.E.O. is meeting all his legal responsibilities and serving as an effective leader,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, Tesla\u2019s chairwoman, on Sunday night. (Ms. Denholm did not respond to a request for comment.) While the chaos at Twitter isn\u2019t Tesla\u2019s concern, Ms. Warren raised the possibility that many of Mr. Musk\u2019s actions may be shortchanging Tesla.*\n\nMs. Warren asked whether Mr. Musk\u2019s diverting of resources from Tesla \u2014 including software engineers and senior executives \u2014 is harming the carmaker. In her letter, the senator also questioned whether Mr. Musk\u2019s assertion that their being seconded to Twitter was purely voluntary, citing an anonymous employee who told CNBC, \u201cmost would also feel it was impossible to turn down a direct request from Mr. Musk without later facing poor performance reviews or other consequences.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren also suggested the possibility of Mr. Musk **intentionally shortchanging either Twitter or Tesla to benefit the other**, including Twitter potentially overcharging Tesla for ads or tweaking the social network\u2019s algorithms to benefit the carmaker. She also asked the board whether content appearing on Twitter under Mr. Musk\u2019s new content moderation, including a rise in misinformation and what the senator said was hate speech, could end up hurting Tesla\u2019s reputation.\n\nFull article: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/business/dealbook/warren-musk-tesla-twitter.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/business/dealbook/warren-musk-tesla-twitter.html)", "id": "zpuycg", "created_utc": 1671464626.0, "score": 588, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 254, "comments": [{"body": "Elon Musk has said and done so many things over the years that were obvious bald faced attempts to move markets to his advantage that it makes you wonder what he would have to do to be investigated by the SEC.", "score": 268, "replies": [{"body": "I guess he could ask them to investigate him, outside of that the SEC is a toothless bitch", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "He should make it a poll question and abide by the results of the poll.", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17930936813354492}, {"body": "He kinda did that on 60 minutes", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2255743443965912}, {"body": "No, the SEC is not a toothless bitch.

{"title": "Why December CPI numbers are likely going to show deflation and why annualized inflation will rapidly approach 0 in 2023.", "selftext": "As we all know, inflation is the buzzword of the moment. However, November's CPI was only +.1%, which would be 1.2% inflation annually. The numbers have come down dramatically since June of 2022, which showed a month over month gain of 1.3%. In other terms, as of November 2022 data, the annualized rate has dropped to what the monthly rate was only five months prior - a 92% decrease. \n\nWhat will December CPI show? We have inklings. \n\nRetail gas prices, available here -\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/indicators/us_gas_price\n\nshow that we are down about 13-14% from November. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/market-data/commodities\n\nNatural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and retail gas futures are all also down from November, variably so, but DOWN. An approximate 10-20% decrease across the board is apparent. \n\nWhat else is dropping? Food commodities are also visible at the WSJ chart, corn and wheat, coffee, all are plunging - the only exceptions are cattle and sugar. \n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf\n\nAs we can see from the CPI inputs, we have data at our fingertips showing that most of the inputs are down A LOT from November. Groceries and eating out are stickier than the raw commodity prices so they will not match the futures exactly, but the trend is down. The car market is also f*cked. The only numbers we cannot get (unless someone can - would be great!) are for shelter and the other factors at the bottom of the chart, but with the recent revisions to the BLS job numbers (no growth!) and the stalled housing market I think rents are also probably stable at this point. \n\nWhat does this mean? \n\nApparently the \"trading economics\" forecast for December CPI is +.2%. I disagree with this. Energy prices have been falling significantly since mid November, as have most commodity prices across the board. The rise in interest rates has already put us into recession IMO even if the numbers do not confirm this yet, and I believe fed policy is misguided as this entire fiasco was due to the supply chain issues generated by COVID and the invasion of Ukraine, NOT from loose monetary policy which was necessary to keep the economy afloat in the face of both crises. \n\nIn sum, I think the data we already have for December - barring something unforeseen at the end of the month - confirms that the next CPI print out will show DEFLATION. In fact, I would not be surprised if it was even -.5%. December 2021 CPI was +.6% (annualized +7.2%), if we are at 0% this month, inflation will have fallen by 100% year over year, and annualized CPI will drop to 6.5%. If we are -.5%, it will be down to 6%, a drop of 15.5% in one month! \n\nThe future is bleaker from there. The next print outs after Dec 21 were Jan 22 (+.6%), Feb 22 (+.8%), and March 22 (1.2%). April saw a relaxation (.3%), May went back up (+1%), and June was the peak (+1.3%). \n\nIf we assume 0% inflation through June 2023 - which I think may be GENEROUS given the energy numbers, the prohibitive interest rates, and the possible resolution of the Ukraine crisis and the continued amelioration of supply chain issues - off an annualized baseline of 6.5%, we would hit 5.9% in January, 5.1% in Feburary, 3.9% in March, 3.6% in April, 2.6% in May, and 1.3% in June. I.E., with values at zero and NOT negative, we are going to see today's annualized number become the actual annualized number as of 6/2023. \n\nIf December of 2022 comes in below 0 - i.e., -.5% as I think is quite possible given the energy plunge - things accelerate faster. Assuming we are at 6% annualized in Dec 2022 and the monthlies are -.3% through June 2023, we would be at 5.1% as of 1/22, 4% as of 2/22, 2.5% as of 3/22, 1.9% as of 4/22, +.6% as of 5/22, and -1% by June of 2022. \n\nBarring another black swan event - which is possible, but could also result in even more deflation! - the trajectory since June of 2022 would put as at annualized inflation of under 2% between March and June of 2023, with a risk of actual annualized DEFLATION also appearing sometime after April 2022 if the December trends continue. \n\nWhat does this mean? I think the Fed pivot will accelerate, I think we have one or, at most, two small hikes before the pause, and I also think that we will see rate CUTS by June of 2023. This likely portends a stock market bottom that has already occurred or will occur in Q1 of 2023, and if we see several consecutive negative CPI print outs, QE is likely back on the table by Q2-Q3 of 2023.", "id": "zpnu39", "created_utc": 1671445056.0, "score": 391, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 306, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I also think a lot of people here are underestimating how rapidly things can get ugly once momentum shifts. It's not just the near-flat recent CPI prints, but extreme deceleration in MoM inflation that's is alarming because it suggests it's probably not going to stop here but likely go into deflation. And we know once started deflation is likely feed on itself if left so at some point the Fed will basically have no choice but to pivot should that happen.\n\nBut my theory from the start has always been that inflation was almost entirely a result of stimulus and high savings rates and fundamentally unsustainable. For example, normally when rates rise it balances supply and demand, so while things like mortgage rates might rise in a normal tightening cycle economic demand would be strong enough that people can still afford the higher rates. But no one can afford these rates today - it's not just balancing supply and demand, it's a brick wall. That alone implies they're far too high because unless they bring rates back down we'll basically need to see a housing crash to bring supply and demand back in balance.  The thing that's always separated this tightening cycle from others is that rates haven't moved higher because of some fundamental strength in the economy, and in the long-run it's always economic strength that's required to sustain higher rates. In fact I'd argue we probably have far more deflationary forces in the economy today given demographics and technological advancements.\n\nBut at the end of the day what I think is irrelevant, what's important for making money in the markets today is seconding guessing the moves of our central banker overlords and in my opinion they've signalled quite clearly that they want a recession and for people to lose their jobs and I don't think enough damage will be done by June. I also think Powell is always wrong and fundamentally unable to enact moderate monetary policy - he basically only has two modes, hyper stimulate or overtighten. So my assumption based on historical data is that they'll overtighten and hold rates too high for too long, then they'll drop them back to super accommodative when they blow up the economy. If they wanted to keep rates higher for longer they should pause now, but it seems like they want to guarantee a recession which in the long-run only increases the likelihood of a dramatic pivot.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I got scoffed at a few weeks ago for saying housing will \u201ccrash\u201d - not truly a crash but a significant reduction", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Everyone thinks housing will go down?

{"title": "[Forbes] Are we in a recession?", "selftext": "Experts have been talking about a U.S. recession for close to a year now, but with no official announcement, the debate continues. Here is an update based on the most recent economic reports to help better understand where the economy currently sits and if a recession is still on the horizon.\n\n**Definition of a recession**\n\nA drop in output across all leading economic indicators defines a recession. More specifically, if employment levels drop, consumer spending decreases and industries don't produce as much as they did previously. These areas of economic activity have to be in a long-term decline for there to be an official call, a definitive recession.\n\nEven though the final monthly and quarterly numbers of these activities are used to determine a recession, they're not always representative of the state of the economy. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the agency that calls a recession whenever it notes that economic indicators are showing continued signs of a slowdown.\n\nIn the past, the NBER would call a recession after two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP). What makes things different this time is that other economic indicators still showed strength during the same contraction period. This forced the NBER to reassess.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/13/recession-fears-are-we-unofficially-in-a-recession-now/?sh=756e13f832ef\n\nEdit: The response has been crazy...I thought that we are NOT in a recession according to everyone on Reddit?", "id": "zpz85s", "created_utc": 1671474124.0, "score": 332, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 318, "comments": [{"body": "all this handwringing over technical definition vs rule of thumb but just keep in mind it is okay to debate.
