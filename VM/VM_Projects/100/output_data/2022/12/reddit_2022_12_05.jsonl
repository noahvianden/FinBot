If I see another SPY  chart I'm going to *lose my mind*.  Can we please throw out some actual ideas. I don't care about technical  analysis, just give me some tickers to look up for goodness sake.\n\n**Here's what I'm buying monday:**\n\nCHPT $20 Jan2024 - Huge open interest (EDIT: adding in a bro's DD which is linked in comments. Basically big potential for legislation to cause CHPT to pump. They also own 50% of the charging market share I think)\n\nSOFI $10  Jan2024 - Super cheap, planning to load up to get delta heavy on SOFI\n\nLCID $20 Jan2024 and $13 Jan 2024 - buying both these cause it's got lower IV compared to lots of stuff right now (60%)\n\nASTS  $20 Jan2025 - Loading up to hold for the next year at least, Hopefully  this stock moons. They de-risked recently cause their satellite array  did something neat. I don't know who cares I'm buying. I think this  stock moons.\n\n**Some random crap that's interesting but I'm not gonna buy just cause I'm focusing on what I already mentioned:**\n\nAZUL - Brazilian cargo airlines or something, who knows sounds cool maybe they transport treasure idk.\n\nVALE  - I've had fun trading vale ever since the epic battery day flop in  late 2020.... but I caught a rally on it a couple months later. It's  pushing higher. They are the worlds biggest nickle miner and they're in  brazil.\n\nI think the funny money fear is  overblown... so heavily regulated brokers like COIN and SOFI, might have a really good chance to moon in 2023 if sentiment turns around about that space.\n\nSIX - six flags had their CEO buying just recently, low options volume tho.\n\nBROS - I've got a few calls ($40 Jan 2024) . The company is expanding a lot. I like them better than SBUX.\n\nFOR  THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND HOLY CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT  RANDOM TICKERS YOU ARE INTO RIGHT NOW?!?!?! I know y'all sit there and  look at charts all day. Give me ur wildest ideas or your most half-baked  ideas.\n\n**DD or no DD just give moar tickers...**\n\nPlease and thank you my kind fellows.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "zcrxr2", "created_utc": 1670202055.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|152|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=zcrxr2)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=zcrxr2)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Give me tickers to look at that aren't SPY so I don't lose my mind.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "How does VM create a perfect TL;DR like this?
