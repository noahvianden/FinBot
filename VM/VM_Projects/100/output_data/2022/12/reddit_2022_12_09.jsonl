There are certainly different ways to interpret it, but the historical reality is that a Fed pivot into a rate cut (from a previous raising or flatline regime) has preceded an average 42% decline in the SP500, for these periods highlighted at least.  One should not conclude from this chart that a Fed pivot into a rate cut is the cause of these declines, but merely that it was coincident with the early part of the declines (perhaps because it was clear at those points in time of pivoting that the economy was already in trouble).  Also, there were other periods of SP500 decline with no yellow highlighting and no analysis around associated Fed raising/cutting regimes, so there are clearly other possible drivers of SP500 increases/decreases besides changes in the Fed Funds rate. My takeaway is that if we see the Fed cut rates next year from either a flatline regime (ie no change in rates at the previous Fed meeting) or a raising regime, then I should get short or buy puts if I don't already have those positions.  Most likely though, if the Fed cuts the rate, we should already have had months of warnings about possible trouble in the economy (hmmm like the warnings we've already been receiving for weeks/months about possible recession next year, warnings like the prolonged and deep inversion of the yield curve (3-month / 10-year inversion at deepest level in >20-years), and warnings like deeping debt levels of the consumer who will at some point soon run out of savings and credit to continue spending so much (consumer spending drives 70% of the economy).

Because of inflation central banks will not be able to support the market like they have in the past.  There will be no Fed Put to backstop this drop.\n\n*\"Recession is foretold as central banks race to try to tame inflation. It's the opposite of past recessions,\" they said. \"Central bankers won't ride to the rescue when growth slows in this new regime, contrary to what investors have come to expect. Equity valuations don't yet reflect the damage ahead.\"* \n\n *\"What worked in the past won't work now,\" the strategists said. \"The old playbook of simply 'buying the dip' doesn't apply in this regime of sharper trade-offs and greater macro volatility. We don't see a return to conditions that will sustain a joint bull market in stocks and bonds of the kind we experienced in the prior decade.\"* \n\n *A* [*slowdown in the housing market*](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-housing-market-home-mortgage-buyers-inflation-interest-rates-redfin-2022-11?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets)*, delays in corporate investment plans, a decline in consumers' savings and deteriorating CEO confidence are early signs of the oncoming economic slump, according to BlackRock.* \n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/a09bd3b3-1188-47d1-a2ae-645c04ab3d11](https://www.ft.com/content/a09bd3b3-1188-47d1-a2ae-645c04ab3d11)\n\nThis is why asset managers have sold the majority of their long positions and are day trading 0dte options like WSB regards.\n\n*While options trading has risen broadly since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Goldman Sachs strategist Rocky Fishman said ultra-short-dated options have been \u201cthe strongest area of volume growth\u201d. He estimated that roughly 44 per cent of S&P 500 index options that have been traded in the third and fourth quarter of this year had less than one day to expiry.
