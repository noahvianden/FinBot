{"title": "A leaked document from Google shows they believe Wall Street is too bullish on Microsoft\u2019s Azure business", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/google-leaked-doc-microsoft-azure-losing-money-on-29-bln-in-revenue.html\n\nGoogle has for years been playing catch-up in the cloud infrastructure market, where it\u2019s seen in the industry as a distant third in the U.S., behind Amazon and Microsoft. The challenge for investors is that the three companies don\u2019t report cloud infrastructure metrics in a way that makes them easily comparable. However, an internal estimate assembled by Google employees, based on a leaked Microsoft document and some extrapolation of other market statistics, suggests Google believes it\u2019s closer to second place than analysts think.\n\nGoogle\u2019s document estimates that Microsoft generated under $29 billion in Azure consumption revenue in the latest fiscal year, which ended June 30, reflecting the value of cloud infrastructure services used by clients. That\u2019s several billion dollars less than what Wall Street analysts had forecast. Bank of America was the most bullish, predicting Azure would pull in $37.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Cowen predicted revenue of $33.9 billion and UBS said $32.3 billion. The document from Google has Azure ending the 2022 fiscal year with an operating loss of almost $3 billion, down from a loss of more than $5 billion the prior year. It claims that Azure\u2019s sales and marketing costs approached $10 billion, accounting for 34% of consumption revenue. Microsoft said sales and marketing costs for the whole company equaled 11% of revenue over the same period.\n\nOne analyst dismissed Google\u2019s bottom-line tally. \u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019s that big of a loss,\u201d said Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock. His research shows Azure boasting an operating margin above 30%, compared with Google\u2019s estimate of a -10% margin.
