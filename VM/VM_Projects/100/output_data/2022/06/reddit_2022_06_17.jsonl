The wage pressure is mostly driven by negotiating power of both the firms bidding up rates and workers having real better alternatives.  \nSo while many firms will have hiring freezes, those firms will likely suffer far more than the firms that continue to bid away the most productive workers.  \nUltimately, the rate hike will accrue top talent to the most lucrative firms and promote the failure of firms that can't source the right talent.
