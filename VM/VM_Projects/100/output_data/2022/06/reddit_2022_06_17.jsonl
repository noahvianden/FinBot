The wage pressure is mostly driven by negotiating power of both the firms bidding up rates and workers having real better alternatives.  \nSo while many firms will have hiring freezes, those firms will likely suffer far more than the firms that continue to bid away the most productive workers.  \nUltimately, the rate hike will accrue top talent to the most lucrative firms and promote the failure of firms that can't source the right talent.

But not necessarily the point. We'll see if production starts for the truck 2023, like we've been told. I believe to be true due to the gigacasting being delivered as we speak to giga Texas, you know the factory that they are producing the cyber truck at. \n\nSaying it's a piece of junk is subjective.

I dont see how stating \"facts\" off teslas website is any different. I'd argue the 2 most expensive and saught after teslas never being out isnt something to go unconsidered. Same goes with the bs twitter deal, he gonna need to sell tesla stock to get the money. As I said, the dream only continues so long as people like you believe the lies (and may I add: stay away from the truth)\n\n1.) You buy an ev because it saves emissions\n\n2.) Ur gas car that u sold for it is still producing emissions\n\n3.) You're now 2x polluter\n\n4.) You gotta replace you're battery pack (you're 3x polluter)\n\n5.) Yes the coal power plants make up a ton of emissiom and is the highest polluting energy.\n\n6.) Your shitbox is built in china so it makes pollution far worse, 80% of their energy is coal.\n\n7.) You gotta recycle the batteries (more like throw em in Africa with the rest of our tech junk and batteries) (nobody has any real information of what is actually reused)\n\n8.) You crash the trashcan while using \"FSD\" (more like lane assist) like an idiot, or, you simply catch on fire, well now ur a 4x polluter.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the control arm issue plus the extra weight eats tires like no tomorrow, or maybe, lets go as you watch the wheel roll by itself.\n\n I get you're trying to turn this into a political arguement but frankly, I dont care. I'm here to state the facts as they are,  and you cant keep those eyes shut forever. \n\nHad a tesla, sold the tesla, made profit during covid. In the end the shitcan saved me around 10 a month, couldnt make it upstate without wating 3 hours, and on top of it, had considerable problems, to which i said no, it wasnt worth the hastle. Especially after waiting 2 weeks for my battery replacement only a few months after getting it.\n\nAlso, stop cherry picking 1 single fact neither of us know the true problems of. It's clear the numbers are skewed everywhere you look and it can only be seen when you do your own calculations. Theres a lot of variables when dealing with EVs and from my calculations, until our energy is mostly nuclear, theres no use to them. \n\nLastly, I'm pro nuclear energy, pro fuel cell, pro ev, pro hybrid, pro solar, pro green energy and I consider myself a progressive.
