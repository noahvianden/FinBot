Critically, and contrary to popular conception, an index fund does not automatically buy more of a security simply because it has gone up in price, given that it already holds that security. But if the fund takes in new money, then that will go into securities according to their shifting size, and that can in theory disproportionately benefit stocks that are already on the up.\n\n>For instance, over the past four decades, on average 14 cents of every new dollar put into the Vanguard 500 fund or State Street\u2019s SPDR would have gone into the five biggest companies. A decade ago it was closer to 10 cents. Today, it is over 20 cents\u2014the highest on record. Although those bigger companies are, well, bigger, those extra cents can have a disproportional market impact, according to a 2020 study. In other words, size can beget size, a dynamic that could contribute to the tendency of financial markets toward bubbles, according to critics.\n\nthe 2020 study is \u201cTracking Biased Weights: Asset Pricing Implications of Value-Weighted Indexing,\u201d by Hao Jiang, Dimitri Vayanos, and Lu Zheng. https://www.nber.org/papers/w28253\n\nthe study's summary states:\n\n>We show theoretically and empirically that flows into index funds raise the prices of large stocks in the index disproportionately more than the prices of small stocks.\n\nyou can potentially avoid this problem by investing in things that are not cap weighted for at least part of your portfolio. for example, SPYD takes 80 higher dividend stocks from the S&P 500 and weights them equally at 1.5% of the portfolio, then adjusts 2x a year IIRC. a stock might go up to 1.8% or down to 1.1%, but no one company will dominate SPYD with 5-6% like Apple or Microsoft. and SPYD is doing better this year than the S&P 500 because it organizes the stocks differently and isn't subject to the major run-up of the last few years.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for this", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0004655552329495549}], "tickers": ["msft", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This is the phenomenon where when a company gets added to sp500, sp400 or sp600 they go up.

Assumedly the economy will continue to increase over time as population grows, because more population means more transactions. So to take a macroeconomic view of things, to keep the value of the money the same over time, we would need to keep printing money over time. However on the micro scale, we    have to first measure what is happening in the economy, before we can change our monetary policy to reflect, so changes to the rate of printing money always lag behind the changes to the economy itself.

It is not the fault of the model, or the economists who worked on the model. \n\nJust like healthcare, energy, housing, and basically any type of resource that is limited, monetary policy is sensitive. Some people, especially rich / powerful people, will try to influence how the system is regulated.

Different candidates have different ways to handle economics, especially during a crisis. \n\nI live in Denmark, one of the most equal societies there is. That is because the Danish people choose to elect politicians who will implement policies that are widely in favor of equality. The welfare state is so widely accepted here that basically all the parties want to have a welfare state - the question is who receives that welfare, and how much. Of course, it has side effects. People are not encouraged to work very hard or pursue stressful careers, because ultimately they will not make much more money. Housewives are virtually inexistent, because two salaries are necessary to raise children - even if you have a very good job on paper. \n\nAs a senior engineer with a demanding job that requires to be on call and work odd hours, even after 12 years of experience, my base salary is around twice the minimum wage after taxes. This is why very few people in Denmark want to pursue engineering careers. When we want to hire experienced engineers, we usually have to find someone from abroad. And people from abroad don't stick around for too long, because they don't like paying 56% income taxes on top of 25% VAT and all the other taxes. \n\nIt is definitely possible to tax the 99% and preserve the modest citizen.

In a nutshell it\u2019s because of the way human psychology works.\n\nI\u2019ll breakdown your question into 3. Why is inflation good (growing money). Because the fundamental way economies work is through consumption. The size of an economy is defined either by aggregate demand or supply (please read that up) and consumption is a factor in aggregate demand. If your money is worth less tomorrow it encourages you to spend today and not save for tomorrow. More spending means profits for business means growth means higher wages the whole uptick cycle.\n\nWhy not strive for 0 inflation? Because the human psychology generally strives for progress be it in wages standard of living and goods. If you want more, you\u2019ll try to work harder or be more efficient. For a 0 inflation example, just see Japan. No one is in any urgent need to do anything because wages and prices are extremely stagnant for the past 30 years. It does make travelling there cheaper and cheaper though\n\nWhy the interference? Because capitalism on its own and taken to the extreme is bad. How so?

The only reason we do... anything... is because we get more out of it than we put in.\n\nSo even with a stable population, the economy should keep growing. This means that even with a completely static money supply and a birth rate of precisely one birth for every death, the value of things will change. Of course with a growing economy, this perfectly stable population will end up making and buying more stuff. The supply of some things might go down, leading its price to go up. (See e.g. lumber; oil.) Or we might figure out how to make more of something, more easily and cheaply, and its price might go down. (See e.g. computers, televisions; oil.) Even with a perfectly static money supply things will constantly change. And of course there can be supply shocks (a forest fire burns down half the lumber supply, or a bacterial infection could shut down a manufacturer of baby formula) and demand shocks (everyone who's cool has to follow the trend of filling their houses with tulips... for one summer).\n\nThis means that with a static money supply, you can get inflation, *and* you can get deflation. Deflation is devious, and really damages economies. I understand we used to have deflationary recessions and depressions fairly regularly, in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A number of factors combined to get us out of that cycle, including the massive fiscal stimulus effect of WW2, massive population growth, the rise of the use of household debt to fuel economic activity, the rise of antibiotics and modern medicine which improved productivity, the rise of computers which *massively* improved productivity and importantly, moving away from a static money supply to fiat currency. This basically meant that we could still be subject to inflation, but would not be stricken by deflation. (And yes that's a wildly huge oversimplification but, for purposes of inflation talk, true.)\n\nDeflation is bad, but a little inflation is okay! It can even be healthy, especially in a country with lots of growth and the steady increase of debt. But, you have to manage it. There are still freak things that occur and the growth of population, technology, productivity, etc. cannot be perfectly predicted. Economic shocks can lead to stagflation, where prices inexplicably keep rising even when people's ability to pay those prices does not. (The 1970s, yeah, but also real estate in the 2010s?) You can somehow also end up with de facto deflation, which is a bit weird and scary when you think about it.\n\nEconomists are not perfect but they try to learn from these things and we try to keep this big unwieldy ship on an even keel. Because, at the end of the day, you gotta look at the big picture of why we're even talking about this stuff. What's the point? I think it's something like, create economic and political circumstances in which people can grow up and live their lives and determine who they want to be and what they want to do. Not just for a select few, but for as many people as possible. And for that you need 1) basic rule of law, and 2) a basic functioning economy. \"If it all burns so be it\" is fine and dandy for someone who has grown up with all manner of options and a bunch of nice stuff.

{"title": "High Oil Price Causes Inflation?

However, if we look at relative importance, shares of energy service + energy commodities were lower than 10%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2evzv7rhd491.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f7f81d860c1e33c7bfd2793b13f3aa2db4a84a2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0r0ycdeuhd491.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e7315cef0bc81115bc5dfb5fd891f615e93fff9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f1mlajcshd491.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69a5206669beaa4076063fe8ab13b6a3b3ca8116\n\nHere's another common view: oil price not only influences these items but also costs many products/services. Plus, I often hear that oil price is highly correlated with CPI. That's why I'd like to run a regression.\n\nData: WTI spot price and CPI index. First, I used the data since 1947. The correlation is high: 84%. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xp6bi4p2id491.jpg?width=627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8c01076e033e2094ae328c1f318092f786f0787\n\nHowever, the problems are:\n\n1. Regime Change: percent of oil to disposable income or interest rates were different in different periods. \n\n2. CPI YoY forecast of this time interval is as high as 17.9%, apparently deviating from the reality.\n\nInstead, I used data since 2020/04. Although the sample is much fewer, the regime is closer to now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a772uwi4id491.jpg?width=664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd366a8844451ba8cadf10dcf995def7e75cb65e\n\nThe mean forecast of 7.85% is closer to the mainstream forecast of 8.3%. When analyzing statistics, we make confidence intervals as well.
