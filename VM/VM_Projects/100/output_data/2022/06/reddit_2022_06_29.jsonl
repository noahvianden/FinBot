{"title": "I thought I was a stock picking wizard until 2022 came", "selftext": "Going into 2022 with portfolio pretty much full of growth tech / biotech hasn't been pretty so far. \nLost about half from that glorious top last year. Better than Cathie Wood though, yay! BTW remember 2020? Everyone loved Cathie. Genomic revolution, yada yada. Now everyone hates Cathie of course. ARK will probably be around for a while, but Zoom is not going to $1500 by 2026. Are you kidding me, Cathie?! Fire those interns aka \"analysts\" asap. \n\nOk, enough about Cathie. So after 20/21 marvelous returns (around 100% combined) I thought..holy s***, this is great, I got this...going to pay off my wife medical school loan earlier (a tip: *don't marry anyone with medical school loan debt*), maybe we will get bigger house, you know, man can dream (well now at 6% interest rates plus houses being ridiculously overpriced this is not happening regardless of how stock market is doing).  \n\nThen 2022 came... Well, I shifted a good chunk of portfolio into GOOGL/AMZN from growth last year, about 20% allocation, but that didn't help much. Biotech in particular has been in BRUTAL bear marker ever. Btw average investor should NOT touch biotechs, especially small cap ones. But if you want to gamble and lose money anyway in the end, sure, go ahead and invest in biotechs, especially development stage ones. \n\nWhat I learned though during this bear market, *well energy or big pharma bros would say, what bear market are you talking about*, that your conviction absolutely helps you to hold on to equities during steep corrections. If you did enough due diligence and know what you own, you most likely will stick around even after > 50% decline. If you bought something on borrowed conviction, then most likely you are shaken out by this time. \n\nHang in there folks, better times will come, unless of course you bought oversized position in Teladoc or Carvana on top \ud83d\ude2c\nBear markets are unavoidable. We just need to be mentally prepared for those. Macro bros / FCF \"experts\" / perma bears think we are going way lower. The thing is that *nobody* knows. I continue DCAing at this point. I won't catch a bottom and I don't need to honestly. Also all sectors do NOT decline equally as well. If SPY corrects other 20% from here that does not necessarily mean that XBI for instance will follow. \n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk. \n\nTop 3 holdings: GOOGL, NET, AMZN (praying for the rest).\n\nEDIT: it's pretty amazing how I'm getting blamed in the comments for giving people \"advices\" \ud83d\ude44Are you kidding me?

Take the excess capital away (like the fed has done over the past three months --- they have actually been cutting M1 & M2 money supply) and you have a recipe for overvalued assets to significantly pull back with some going into bankruptcy. \n\nAdd in the fact that interest rates are on a steady path upward and you have two factor significantly working against equities. \n\nPeter Lynch, who I am particularly fond of in the investment world, once said that his best investments are the ones that are 10-15-20 years old, why? Because time appreciates the value of money when it is being pushed into solid companies and solid total market or world market ETF's. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that the young investors out there shouldn't be playing with Bitcoin, or Zoom or Gamestop, rather, they should build a centralized position around the S&P 500 ETF (VOO or SPY) where, in normal times, you can reasonably expect 7-10% annualized returns.

I think Amazon has significant headwinds, especially since e-commerce growth has significantly pulled back (Amazon actually reported contraction in e-commerce in Europe). Same goes for Apple and MSFT, where I believe you are going to get solid pull backs in all of these names because, again, there is now only so much money to go around, there is clearly going to be a market contraction due to high interest rates (usually it takes 3-6 months for each rate hike to fully take grip btw). \n\nBottom line: Take your time, investing is a journey and it is fluid.

I'd like to think I smartened up a little, but I still just do weird gambles and don't take the easy wins.\n\nMy greatest successes have been exploratory bets.  Funnily, my best gains were from crypto and biotech, lol, but both were easy reads.  My biggest losses were chasing runs and then forgetting about it for like a month thinking they'll just keep going and not getting out of the market when the market went bear.\n\nOut of around $40k invested to play with, if I full-on followed the bets I was hesitant to take, I would have been at around $250,000 by the end of the bull run and at about $400,000 now.  But I wasn't willing to go all-in on anything.  And I lost a lot leaving money in bad spots assuming they'll flatten or turn.  I'm at about $20k now with that original investment, but the money is in good positions when the market shifts again.\n\nI have found certain data is decently telling for general trends, and I either make the choice to follow that data or not.  When I don't, I tend to lose money.  When I work with the data, I do pretty good.  However, the data never tells you how much potential is available, and the big gains come from the crazy bets.  For data, I'm very simple.  I watch weighted moving averages and direction indicators.  These tend to be decently reliable on behavior on a macro level.  And if you're not doing day stuff, it flows pretty well.  There are few surprises following this data.  And it can be decent enough to indicate larger trend changes a week or two in advance.\n\nThere are plays where you can double your money overnight, but it's a bit of guessing if the market will bite and generate anything actually appreciable.  One bet on a stock might see 20%, but the same kind of bet following the same metrics for another might yield 200%.  You throw your money behind one and not the other, and sometimes you bet on the wrong one.  You walk with 20% and watch the 200% come and disappear.  I still have no clue how the market reacts so differently.  There's a stock just recently that I was watching that was in a good position for big gains.  I didn't put any money in and saw it double.  But I've also doubled other bets and watch others do nothing.  It's a big faff kind of, and I more so find the reliable plan is to sort of work a spread and pull any gains early and then manage any stagnant/loss stocks.  With those you're either waiting for the jump or backing out when they don't.  Then again, I've waited two months on a stock before, to back out after two months of nothing, and then watching it jump 200% the week after.\n\nThe day trading (or nearly) is just a lot of busy work where I find it to be a lot of fuss over little value.  Sometimes it's easier just to dump money in reliable stuff and just let it ride.  That also turns sour when the market becomes a bear.  Oh well...  Still, you just buy the sales and watch it all rise again on market change.\n\nNow where's that bull?\n\nI'm assuming we have at least a few more months.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": ">My biggest losses were chasing runs and then forgetting about it for like a month thinking they'll just keep going and not getting out of the market when the market went bear.\n\nI've had some like that.

I don't believe it will ever grow to achieve this valuation on fundamental principles but it could easily 10x just by being the prettiest girl at the ball. It is high risk and high reward at this high price, not my personal style of investing. \n\nQualcomm, however, is one that I have my eye on. They have a stable business and the particular types of chips they make are well-suited for self-driving applications, a direction they are actively leaning in. However, I want to see prices drop a bit more before I personally open a position. If they drop to around $105 then I'm getting a *lot*.\n\n> Are you buying Intel then? Or TSM? Or is there some other foundry you like?\n\nI am DCAing into Intel. I fully expect them to drop as low as to low 30s and hover before they start to bear fruit. I will say though, with Intel expanding factory space in Oregon, Arizona, Ohio, Magdeburg; TSMC building in Arizona; and Samsung building in Texas, the semiconductor equipment companies LRCX, AMAT, KLAC are going to *have* to sell a lot of equipment. All of the big fabs are more or less locked in for making huge equipment purchases at this point; but those facilities need to be complete first so there's still some time before that windfall. \n\nAs for TSM, the geopolitics with China scares me. That's first and foremost. The Chinese Communist party has the power to drop this stock 80%, maybe outright destroy the company. I know of a large fab of TSMC's in Singapore so that's why I doubt that company completely dies if the island falls into war. So there's that sword of damocles risk hanging over them. But assuming that doesn't happen, it is getting increasingly difficult for anyone to maintain a sizable lead over competition at this scale of feature. And TSMC's advantage comes with substantial caveats that the general public often doesn't know, such as the fact they have failed to turn a miniaturization advantage into a transistor densification advantage. So their superior performance has mainly taken the form of more efficient chips -- a signature of a smaller transistor -- but not really noticeable raw performance advantage -- a signature of densification and *many* different contributors that cap how quickly it can operate. My personal guess for the future is that TSMC, Samsung, and Intel will trade off process crown between each other in the coming decades. If TSM drops to $50, I'm a buyer for a bit of it as well, but my fear over its geopolitics and my doubt that any fab holds an uncontested lead for any substantial period of time in an age of ever-increasing-difficulty of cutting edge process nodes makes me think that its status as the darling foundry will fall.
