Economists at Barclays BARC, -3.69% and Jefferies backed up the shifting expectations, by indicating they expect policy makers to deliver a hike of that magnitude at their June 14-15 meeting.\n\nBeneath the issue of where the Fed goes from here is a much more fundamental and serious problem: Some observers fear the U.S. central bank has already effectively lost control of inflation. May\u2019s price gains were broad-based \u2014 hitting everything from shelter to gasoline and food, as well as the narrower gauge, the so-called core reading, that excludes food and energy. The data were \u201ccatastrophically bad\u201d for both the Fed and Americans, said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer of Nashville-based Laffer Tengler Investments, which oversees $1.1 billion.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw in this report which was disappointing and a little alarming is that the core reading, excluding food and energy, came in hotter than expected and that\u2019s after we dropped off from a very high number for April 2021,\u201d she said via phone. \u201cThis is a much more persistent and stickier kind of inflation that takes years to work through the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Fed has been wrong at every single turn and we should be seeing a 75 basis point hike at the June meeting,\u201d Tengler said. \u201cThe question is whether they can surprise and I don\u2019t think we are going to see that. Every time they delay, that allows inflation to run rampant and this raises the odds of recession.\u201d Equity markets will be \u201cugly and choppy through summer because inflation numbers are not going to improve.\u201d\n\nIndeed, traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings have expected a string of annual headline CPI readings that rises to as high as 8.8% in August and September, before settling to 8% for October. Meanwhile, U.S. consumer sentiment plunged to a record low this month.\n\nSeptember outlook\n\n\u201cAll in all, the report should be of great concern for the Fed given that price gains in both the headline and the core measures show no signs of abating, and we expect prices to continue to register firm gains in the near term,\u201d TD Securities strategists Oscar Munoz, Priya Misra and others wrote in a note. \u201cWe expect the Fed to maintain its aggressive tightening bias in the months ahead, look for the Committee to hike rates by 50bp both next week and in the July FOMC meeting, and believe a 50bp hike in September may not be out of the question.\u201d\n\nA team at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -5.65%, led by Jan Hatzius, agreed with TD\u2019s September assessment, by saying \u201cwe now expect the Fed to hike the funds rate by 50 bps in September (vs. +25bp previously), in addition to +50bp moves in June and in July.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s report should extinguish any pretense that a \u2018pause\u2019 in rate hikes will likely be appropriate by the end of summer, as the Fed is clearly still behind the eight ball on bringing inflation under control,\u201d said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede.\n\n\u201cInvestors should expect the Federal Reserve to continue on its 50-bp rate hike path next week and beyond until inflation shows meaningful signs of decelerating toward the Fed\u2019s 2-3% target range,\u201d Pride said.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s CPI report was a doozy,\u201d said Tom Graff, head of investments at Facet Wealth.\n\n\u201cWhile we knew the headline number would probably come in high due to food and energy prices, consensus was that the month-over-month Core CPI would slow sequentially,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cUnfortunately that didn\u2019t happen. Headline CPI came in a full 1% for the month and a 40-year high 8.6% for the year, and core stayed steady at +0.6% for the month and 6.0% for the year.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe most concerning part of this report was its breadth. The monthly number wasn\u2019t driven by a few items. Most of the major categories actually accelerated price increases month-over-month. Most observers agree that broader inflation is more likely to persist.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriday\u2019s inflation data suggests the \u2018peak inflation\u2019 debate may be premature,\u201d said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management. \u201cThe idea of peak inflation assumes that our supply chain disruptions are over and won\u2019t recur anytime soon and I\u2019m not so sure we can be confident of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cInvestors remain too confident that the Federal Reserve will be able to control inflation,\u201d Davis said by email. \u201cWe should not take the Fed\u2019s ability to control inflation as a given.\u201d", "id": "vaqrmh", "created_utc": 1655054702.0, "score": 416, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "This is why I think we'll see downward action in the first half of this week.

Going to these are just pure gambling and throwing away money for a hit of gamblers high. \n\nIn the stock market you have immensely better odds. There are literally just two option directions. One is up or increasing number. The other is down or decreasing number. That sure sounds like a 50/50 shot to me. I would play those odds anytime.

Even if you are Terrible at guessing or predicting the direction, you are bound to get lucky eventually. \n\nI know the automatic rebuttal will be a third direction, flat. Of course this accompanied by Theta says hello. How long does flat truly last? A stock or ETF will undoubtedly go one of two ways or both. Up or down. \n\nI ask myself all the time if I'm truly just throwing away money and gambling. I ask if I have a gambling problem. I say no.

I personally know quite a few people who have opened a home equity line to build pools, buy toys or gamble with options.\n\nPeople look at the value of their home and they feel like the equity is like money in a bank account.

It may be viewed as the opposite of failure. The criteria for success depend on context, and may be relative to a particular observer or belief system. One person might consider a success what another person considers a failure, particularly in cases of direct competition or a zero-sum game. Similarly, the degree of success or failure in a situation may be differently viewed by distinct observers or participants, such that a situation that one considers to be a success, another might consider to be a failure, a qualified success or a neutral situation. For example, a film that is a commercial failure or even a box-office bomb can go on to receive a cult following, with the initial lack of commercial success even lending a cachet of subcultural coolness.\r\n\r\nIt may also be difficult or impossible to ascertain whether a situation meets criteria for success or failure due to ambiguous or ill-defined definition of those criteria. Finding useful and effective criteria, or heuristics, to judge the failure or success of a situation may itself be a significant task.\n\n\n\nWant more info?

{"title": "Jesse Livermore. The most legendary trader you never heard of.", "selftext": "At the age of 14, his father pulled him out of school to help with the farm; however, with his mother's blessing, Livermore ran away from home. In 1891, at the age of 14, he secured employment, as a board boy, posting stock quotes at a Boston, Massachusetts branch of Paine Webber stockbrokerage, at the rate of $5 per week. \n\nIn 1892, at the age of 15, he bet $5 on Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad at a bucket shop, a type of establishment that took leveraged bets on stock prices but did not buy or sell the stock. He earned $3.12 on the $5 bet.\n\nAt the age of 16, he quit his job and began trading full-time. He brought $1,000 home to his mother, who disapproved of his \"gambling\"; he countered that he was not gambling, but \"speculating\".\n\nFrom 1895\u20131897, age 18\u201320, he accumulated $10,000 trading profits, a 1,000 per cent net return in three years of trading.\n\nOn September 14, 1900, age 23, he moved to New York, arriving in time for a strong bull market in stocks. He traded successfully, on the long side, at Harris, Hutton & Company stockbrokers, turning $10,000 into $50,000 in five days. In May 1901, he anticipated a correction and went short, using 400% margin. He lost his entire stake.\n\nHis first big win came in 1901 at the age of 24 when he bought stock in Northern Pacific Railway. He turned $10,000 into $500,000.\n\nIn the Panic of 1907, Livermore's huge short positions made him $1 million in a single day. However, his mentor, J. P. Morgan, who had bailed out the entire New York Stock Exchange during the crash, requested him to refrain from further short selling. Livermore agreed and instead, profited from the rebound, boosting his net worth to $3 million.\n\nIn 1908, he listened to Teddy Price, who told him to buy cotton, while Price secretly sold. He went bankrupt but was able to recover all of his losses. \n\nIn 1915, he filed bankruptcy again.\n\nIn 1924\u20131925, he engaged in market manipulation, making $10 million trading wheat and corn in a battle with Arthur W. Cutten and engineering a short squeeze on the stock of Piggly Wiggly.\n\nIn early 1929, he amassed huge short positions, using more than 100 stockbrokers to hide what he was doing. By the spring, he was down over $6 million on paper. However, upon the Wall Street Crash of 1929, he netted approximately $100 million. Following a series of newspaper articles declaring him the \"Great Bear of Wall Street\", he was blamed for the crash by the public and received death threats, leading him to hire an armed bodyguard.\n\nEventually he lost his fortune and filed bankruptcy for the third time in 1934, listing assets of $84,000 and debts of $2.5 million.\n\nOn November 28, 1940, just after 5:30 pm, Livermore fatally shot himself with an Automatic Colt Pistol in the cloakroom of The Sherry-Netherland hotel in Manhattan.\n\nInfo from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Livermore", "id": "vaojua", "created_utc": 1655048321.0, "score": 428, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|20|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|339|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vaojua)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vaojua)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow.
