{"title": "Here\u2019s why Larry Summers wants 10 million people to lose their jobs", "selftext": " Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says there needs to be a surge in unemployment to curb inflation, which Federal Reserve policy makers say doesn\u2019t need to happen for price growth to cool off. According to Bloomberg News, Summers said in a speech on Monday from London that there needs to be a lasting period of higher unemployment to contain inflation \u2014 a one-year spike to 10%, two years of 7.5% unemployment or five years of 6% unemployment. Put a different way, Summers is calling for the unemployed rolls to swell to roughly 16 million from just under 6 million in May.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he spoke with Summers on Monday, with Biden \u2014 echoing his Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, the former Fed chief \u2014 maintaining that a U.S. recession can be avoided. The way Summers framed the numbers suggests he\u2019s talking about what\u2019s known as the Sacrifice Ratio, which is the link between unemployment and inflation.\n\nAccording to Jason Furman, the former chair of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economics Advisers, the Sacrifice Ratio in the 25 years before the pandemic has been six percentage points \u2014 meaning one year of a six-percentage-point jump in unemployment or two years of a three-percentage-point increase in the jobless rate would be required to knock down inflation by a full percentage point. \n\nIn May, the unemployment rate was 3.6%. What Summers is basically saying is he wants the unemployment rate to rise to a level that would knock a full percentage point off inflation. The Fed-favored core PCE price index cooled to 4.9% on a year-over-year basis in April. \n\nCurrent Federal Reserve officials don\u2019t accept that there needs to be such a stark trade-off. The Fed\u2019s forecasts call for the unemployment rate to rise to 4.1% next year in a way that would cool core inflation to 2.3%. Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said the trade-off was less between inflation and unemployment than between inflation and job openings. \n\nJerome Powell, the Fed chair, also said such a stark trade-off wasn\u2019t needed. \u201cTake for example in the labor market, so you have two job vacancies essentially for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level and you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that\u2019s consistent with 2% inflation,\u201d Powell said at the last post-Fed-meeting press conference.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-larry-summers-wants-10-million-people-to-lose-their-job-11655800397?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-larry-summers-wants-10-million-people-to-lose-their-job-11655800397?mod=home-page)", "id": "vhf9sb", "created_utc": 1655823492.0, "score": 281, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 289, "comments": [{"body": "Well, Baby Boomers are still retiring at a rate of 10K PER DAY, but if Mr. Summers thinks that unemployment needs to go up, who exactly is going to DO THE WORK?", "score": 220, "replies": [{"body": "Too much money in economy, better take jobs away from the people that control 20% of America's wealth\n\nWhat better way to bring down prices than to swing a bat to the knees of the already crippled poor and middle class.\n\nHow to decrease rent, food, and car prices?

We allow companies (and individuals) to carry over negative tax liabilities. they spread it out over multiple years, and eventually, there will be years where they are profitable and pay little tax, but that doesn't last forever.  \nThe government also gives tax incentives to businesses that are using capital to grow.  I.e. Amazon has been using profits to grow their logistics and distribution to a massive scale.  This is beneficial for the government because a 1 time tax break pays dividends as the business grows and generates more revenue in the long term.   It's good for the business because they could either pay taxes and get nothing, or reinvest profits and to make more profits (and thus pay more taxes) in the future.  You can do this with some profits,  but certainly not all.  \n\nWe don't have a taxation problem, we have a spending problem. \n\nOf course the media narrative only points out the 1 year they didn't pay enough and they use it to go after those evil billionaires.  They purposefully leave out WHY (the net loss that they carried over, and reinvest so they pay more later) to prove their point.  \n\n\nAs for oil companies, they are making rexord profits on existing wells....  They've already paid to drill the wells and they're already producing oil.  When oil goes from $30/barrel to 5x that, their profits will go up as well.  It's a very simple equation. \nThe individual oil producers don't control the global price of oil.  They're producing a product and selling on the open market.  \nThe Russian oil sanctions means roughly 20-30% of the global supply is off limits, which means the remaining global supply is in short demand and prices go up. \n\n Meanwhile, we have an administration that has been actively trying to destroy the fossil fuel companies. They've blocked pipelines, They've cut drilling on federal lands, cut tens of thousands of leases, they have shovel ready projects that havent been approved in over a year.  They're allowing the environmental groups to hold up new projects with red tape, beauracrcy, and law suits.  \n\nWhy would the oil companies reinvest in drilling new wells when the government is actively making it more difficult to do so?

The only thing preventing free health care in the US is the utter unwillingness of the US executive branch and the Democratic Party to make it happen. The US Department of Health and Human Services has a discretionary budget of $151 billion per year, as of the current fiscal year. **The government doesn't want to offer Health Care as a government service.** They want to prop up new and exciting insurance schemes that increase the kickbacks for their paymasters. M4A failed in Congress not because it was a bad idea *per se* (even though it was), but because there wasn't enough graft to find broad donor support, and Medicare reimbursements decrease every single year without Congressional overrides.\n\nBuild some hospitals and clinics in every state in the nation and every metro area; hire doctors and nurses; open the doors to free government health care for all. Let private providers and money-skimming insurance middlemen try to compete with FREE care. All it would take would be the stroke of the executive pen: Congress has already authorized the expenditures.\n\n[Rationing of care is a stated public policy goal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1173526/) of most nationalised health care systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized that [rationing is a **prerequisite** to universal health coverage.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5804460/) However, since \"rationing\" is an unpopular term, the WHO prefers to call it [\"priority setting\"](https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/118582/E60144.pdf) instead....which is just a euphemism.\n\nPlease bring nationalized health care delivery and rationing to the US. We've had a system for far too long where we are capable of obtaining whatever care we need or desire, simply by paying for those services. \n\nLet's give every American the experience our veterans enjoy, with free government health care from government hospitals and doctors. There are hundreds of millions of people on the government health insurance plans already. [64.4 million are enrolled in Medicare](https://www2.ccwdata.org/web/guest/medicare-charts/medicare-enrollment-charts), the US's federal health plan for the elderly. [87.3 million people are enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/report-highlights/index.html), the US federally paid-for/state-administered health care system for low-income families. [9.1 million military veterans each year receive health care service from the VA](https://www.va.gov/health/aboutvha.asp) (Veteran's Administration).  [87% of the 10.7 million people who purchased health insurance on the Marketplace received ACA premium subsidies.](https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/resources/affordable-care-act/aca-obamacare-subsidies)\n\nThe US population is roughly 330 million, and about half of everyone is already receiving federally subsidized health insurance or federally-provided health care. Most of these people live in cities. [There have been vast areas of the nation with only one or two ACA insurers in recent years](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/13/15762066/medica-obamacare-nebraska-iowa), so we can't forget about rural citizens.\n\nWhy was I unable to keep my doctor after I was told if I liked him, I could keep him? (Hint: See those areas with only one provider? He's not on their program. He no longer takes Marketplace-insured patients.)\n\nMedicare-4-All is dead on arrival with doctors because Medicare doesn't pay enough to keep the lights on at a private doctor's office, and Medicaid pays even **less**. [29% of medical providers do not accept Medicare for new patients, and 55% did not accept new Medicaid patients.](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/primary-care-physicians-accepting-medicare-a-snapshot/) What good is M4A and expanded Medicaid when you can't get in for a doctor's visit with it?\n\nThe problem with Medicare and Medicaid (other than the fact that they are just insurance schemes) is that \"cost containment\" is built into them. By design, [rates paid to providers decrease every year, unless Congress overrides the decreases](https://www.hfma.org/topics/news/2021/11/2022-rule-for-physician-services-adds-to-a-significant-looming-p.html). In other words, while inflation rips along at 6+%, Medicare-accepting doctors are taking an annual 10% haircut on the services they provide to Medicare/Medicaid patients.\n\nAbolish Medicare/Medicaid.
