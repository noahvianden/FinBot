Look at their results, to what they're actually delivering. Then compare this business model to Tesla's, firmly in control of its future through verticalization.\n\nBeyond cultural and business aspects, there is the need to fund this race. Tesla is a money-making machine that is/will generate plenty of cash to sustain its growth till the end of the decade, while the other automakers will need external capital, that in a high-interest rate environment will demand that they are more profitable than Tesla.

The change to electric is basically a reset on a 100+ year old business model, so don't look at the past for guidance.\n\nAnd by the time automakers are (optimistically) catching up to Tesla in 2030, electric cars will be just a low-margin commodity and a platform. Tesla will already have developed other strong revenue streams that are beyond the reach of existing automakers, such as FSD (that most automakers won't be able to develop in-house and will outsource), and maybe even an intelligent robot that will chauffer other makers' cars for you.

{"title": "Fed tightening will need to be far greater than current projections - Research paper", "selftext": "Very interesting paper from Larry Summers and a couple other economists I'm not familiar with.\n\nBasically it argues that current inflation is nearly as bad as the late 70s and 80s. And that inflation is not nearly as responsive to Fed policy as many optimists believe. The takeaway being that Fed policy will need to approach Volker Fed levels of restrictive, far in excess of the 3-3.5% rates that the Fed currently projects.\n\nYou've probably heard people say that if we measured inflation now the same way we did in before 1983, inflation would be more like 15% rather than 8.5%. That's true. Inflation now is about as bad as the early 80s. This paper attempts to create comparable metrics for various inflationary periods in US history. It also demonstrates that inflation is not as responsive to Fed rate hikes as some would believe, by showing how the pre-Volker CPI was artificially high and artificially came down more than it would if we measured it as we do today in response to Fed policy.\n\nAll suggesting that the Fed is still wildly behind the curve and much more restrictive policy will be required to tame inflation. Perhaps as restrictive as the Volker Fed, which sent the US into a severe recession. Strongly encourage everyone to give this a read. Worth noting that Summers has been correct so far in this inflation cycle and the optimists all have egg on their face.\n\nAs for the impact on stocks if Summers is correct - Bad, very bad.\n\n[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\\_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf)", "id": "v9ki29", "created_utc": 1654903656.0, "score": 265, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "I mean if bond rates hit those kinds of numbers then I\u2019m dumping my cash into that shit bruv", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Locking in 20% interest rates would b glorious.

A lot of people have upgraded salaries due to the great resignation and a lot of businesses can't even find workers for Wendy's dumpster jobs. Consumers are absorbing the greater cost of goods with their new salaries. Same goes for gas prices; if you factor the rate of inflation between 2008 and 2022, the cost of $1 in 2008 is $1.34 in 2022. Everyone and their mother's boyfriend keeps talking about 1987 and the inflation then but what didn't happen in 1987 was a pandemic coupled with one of the best job markets for employees in history. Ever. Just look at the unemployment rate. With the Russian stupidity going on in Europe, and everything reopening because no one gives a shit about COVID anymore, you have high demand for fuel AND it's summer time where everyone wants to travel. When everyone settles down for the fall, there will be automatic demand destruction, and coupled with the rate hikes, and high gas prices, inflation will fall organically. The market didn't shit it's pants when inflation went from 5.0% to 7.0% between May and December 2021. So why now? What does 1% matter when we had seen inflation jump from 1.4% in 2020 to 7.0% in 2021? \n\nRent is high due to COVID rent freeze for two years plus eviction moratorium in place until recently.

You don't know when exactly the recession will hit, you don't know when the market will be at it's lowest. Generally speaking, you don't really wanna overextend too early, although chances are it will still work out if you can stomach it. Likewise, you probably don't just wanna hold onto all of your money waiting for prices to go deeper and deeper until the point where, well, they rise again and keep rising.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Being able to stomach what happens. Think about your goals as well as your risk tolerance and act accordingly. That in addition with having everything set up outside of investing should make you sleep much easier.\n\nAs for plays, my opinion is that one should refrain from higher risk, (borderline) speculative plays. Basically from cash burning companies at high valuations that will need to dilute or take on debt just in order to survive for a couple of years. While there may be chances in there, the risk is even higher than usual, and I believe those companies should be treated accordingly unless you know something almost no one else knows. My belief is that one should preferably look at healthy balance sheets and cashflows, ideally expanding, especially in a situation like this. But, again, it probably depends on your goal.\n\nAs for getting ahead, you may be slightly late for that. Technically you could have rotated into stocks/sectors that historically do well in times of recession, but a lot of rotation has already happened and many of these don't look particularly attractive to me. You arguably still could go for that, but the risk reward balance has shifted, the expected reward is lower while the risk is higher than a couple of months ago. But if your goal is to preserve your wealth as well as possible rather than set yourself up for creating wealth, perhaps that still is a viable option.\n\nIf you want to set yourself up for future gains at the cost of seeing significant red for some time, your strategy will be different and you'll have to stomach a lot more.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "There is one company which has a short interest of over 226% mentioned in a recent SEC report to Congress.

Remember that everyone else is in this mf boat and I am not alone. Everyone is feeling the pinch (except for the couple of guys who \u201csaw it coming\u201d and cashed out/went short). \n\n3. End most/all automatic recurring investment (except for paycheck 401k contributions) and build up as much cash as possible. \n\n4. Deploy the cash when close to bottom (for me that means at the very least that unemployment needs to shoot up to 7%+, the market needs to fall around 40-50% from ATH, and the Fed needs to go back to being dovish eg lowering rates). So with inflation the way it is, that *could* be literally years out before all that happens. Time will tell.\n\n5. Watch Stranger Things before I cancel Netflix (sorry NFLX bag-holders) - seriously, there\u2019s a lot more to life than stocks. You can enjoy life while your stocks plummet. Life is easier/better when you do.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s reason to celebrate. I think so anyway. Sure most of us aren\u2019t 100% cash, but recession brings opportunity. Only time recession really blows is if you have to sell stocks (low!) to pay the bills. Otherwise, you build up cash and either buy a house on sale, buy stock on sale, or earn decent $ on a high yield savings account/money market fund (especially if interest rates get to double digits).\n\nIt\u2019s funny how many people here are worried about double digit interest rates. All my debt is locked in at 3.25% or less, and if I could earn 10-15% on cash entirely risk-free I\u2019d be over the moon. My stocks will recover in time. Plus, the lower the stock market goes, the more stock I can buy. It\u2019s literally a win win. And what if things get so bad that the world ends/I starve?

And however long it lasts, the recovery won't be synchronized exactly with the market. So the market might start recovering say a month to a quarter or even more in advance. So we need to start investing while things are looking bad. Average recession lasts 15 months. If we hesitate and wait for the economy to confirm a recovery, the market will already rip.\n\nI think the key earnings will be the airlines & banks in whichever quarter the recovery is confirmed. They will report first, calendar-wise, and show the leading indicator first, in consumer credit activity, travel, before the retailers like Walmart and Target confirm it.\n\nKind of like how in this last quarter those sectors confirmed the recession even before any uptick in the layoffs happened and bad earnings started trickling in; we didn't actually have to wait for the retailers to post terrible numbers.\n\nMy approach is to follow the earnings of \\~3-4 companies within the sector you're considering investing in. Their guidances should be consistent with each other. It's important to see that multiple CEOs in the industry are on the same page - one may be bullshitting but if everyone is still bullish even now, that's a stronger sign. I would say this describes cybersecurity, having followed the earnings for Crowdstrike, Fortinet, and Palo Alto networks. If they have good billings and revenue growth and forecasts, in spite of the deteriorating macro situation, that's reason for confidence - it means that as budgets are tightening and companies are spending more, these products are not seen as discretionary. If you don't see this, then these are formerly darling areas within tech that you can avoid.\n\nSecondly, how close they are to GAAP profitability, and if not, understanding their cash runway/balance sheets. It's ok if they're leveraged if their debt matures in say 2027+, they locked in good interest rates somewhere in 2021 before yields started rising. If they're burning lots of cash still -> then are they close to positive EBITDA? And if not EBITDA, are they positive free cash flow?\n\nThe companies that are still heavily dependent stock-based compensation (some major culprits being RBLX, LYFT, PLTR and yeah, actually even AMZN) I think are vulnerable. If they are not able to retain talent with stock-based compensation, and it shifts to cash-based expense, then their FCF margin will be erased (and EV/FCF is one of the most major multiples used right now by Wall St in all the non-profitable SaaS/meta/cloud companies).
