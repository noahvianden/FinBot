Look at their results, to what they're actually delivering. Then compare this business model to Tesla's, firmly in control of its future through verticalization.\n\nBeyond cultural and business aspects, there is the need to fund this race. Tesla is a money-making machine that is/will generate plenty of cash to sustain its growth till the end of the decade, while the other automakers will need external capital, that in a high-interest rate environment will demand that they are more profitable than Tesla. Hard to imagine how they'd accomplish that.\n\nPut all of that together and Tesla has a clear advantage in cars at least till the end of the decade.  The change to electric is basically a reset on a 100+ year old business model, so don't look at the past for guidance.\n\nAnd by the time automakers are (optimistically) catching up to Tesla in 2030, electric cars will be just a low-margin commodity and a platform. Tesla will already have developed other strong revenue streams that are beyond the reach of existing automakers, such as FSD (that most automakers won't be able to develop in-house and will outsource), and maybe even an intelligent robot that will chauffer other makers' cars for you.

{"title": "Fed tightening will need to be far greater than current projections - Research paper", "selftext": "Very interesting paper from Larry Summers and a couple other economists I'm not familiar with.\n\nBasically it argues that current inflation is nearly as bad as the late 70s and 80s. And that inflation is not nearly as responsive to Fed policy as many optimists believe. The takeaway being that Fed policy will need to approach Volker Fed levels of restrictive, far in excess of the 3-3.5% rates that the Fed currently projects.\n\nYou've probably heard people say that if we measured inflation now the same way we did in before 1983, inflation would be more like 15% rather than 8.5%. That's true. Inflation now is about as bad as the early 80s. This paper attempts to create comparable metrics for various inflationary periods in US history. It also demonstrates that inflation is not as responsive to Fed rate hikes as some would believe, by showing how the pre-Volker CPI was artificially high and artificially came down more than it would if we measured it as we do today in response to Fed policy.\n\nAll suggesting that the Fed is still wildly behind the curve and much more restrictive policy will be required to tame inflation. Perhaps as restrictive as the Volker Fed, which sent the US into a severe recession. Strongly encourage everyone to give this a read. Worth noting that Summers has been correct so far in this inflation cycle and the optimists all have egg on their face.\n\nAs for the impact on stocks if Summers is correct - Bad, very bad.\n\n[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\\_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf)", "id": "v9ki29", "created_utc": 1654903656.0, "score": 265, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "I mean if bond rates hit those kinds of numbers then I\u2019m dumping my cash into that shit bruv", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Locking in 20% interest rates would b glorious.

A lot of people have upgraded salaries due to the great resignation and a lot of businesses can't even find workers for Wendy's dumpster jobs. Consumers are absorbing the greater cost of goods with their new salaries. Same goes for gas prices; if you factor the rate of inflation between 2008 and 2022, the cost of $1 in 2008 is $1.34 in 2022. Everyone and their mother's boyfriend keeps talking about 1987 and the inflation then but what didn't happen in 1987 was a pandemic coupled with one of the best job markets for employees in history. Ever. Just look at the unemployment rate. With the Russian stupidity going on in Europe, and everything reopening because no one gives a shit about COVID anymore, you have high demand for fuel AND it's summer time where everyone wants to travel. When everyone settles down for the fall, there will be automatic demand destruction, and coupled with the rate hikes, and high gas prices, inflation will fall organically. The market didn't shit it's pants when inflation went from 5.0% to 7.0% between May and December 2021. So why now? What does 1% matter when we had seen inflation jump from 1.4% in 2020 to 7.0% in 2021? \n\nRent is high due to COVID rent freeze for two years plus eviction moratorium in place until recently.

Also, a lot of people decided to sell their houses at all time highs and rent apartments to \"ride out the storm\", then buy back into the market after a crash. There is new construction happening all over the place and once it's finished, people will flock back to houses and rent prices will crater.
