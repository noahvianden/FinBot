Do they leave it up when it's probably illegal on the small chance it isn't? How do they separate a scam from marketing?

Free speech is a complicated issue, yet it's used as a marketing slogan.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Right now when it comes to bird site this is what I understand:\n\n- his first focus is on getting rid of bots. Both scammers (as far as I know he does not care about human \"spammers\") and bots being used to manipulate ratings, likes and subscriptions. Current hickup is Twitter failing to provide adequate numbers on how many bots there is on the site and failing to provide a concrete method on how they number them. Elon explaining that the best case is just them being clueless and the worst is them being intentionally malicious.\n\n- humans are allowed free speech within the boundaries of the law. Now what law apply is VERY unclear and it's not like this is unique. Normally the law apply to the country it's domiciled on but countries have often put unbearable pressure on foreign sites to see something removed. It's simply logical that Elon is not quite sure which approach to take, only being sure that Twitter must obviously remain lawful. Essentially anything you could say in a public place without being thrown behind bars is fair game, would be my guess. Obviously the issue is raised with countries that officially enforce censorship, but those are usually dealt with either a separate client or just them blocking access. Elon seems focused to deal with covert manipulation before dealing with open manipulation.\n\n- It is likely moderation will remain however everything will be transparent, tra\u00e7able and quantifiable via an open source of the application's algorithm. The idea being to raise trust and provide accountability now and in the future (perhaps the most important thing) any change or manipulation would be visible.\n\n- marketing is actually a big part of the bot problem. Exposure is rated by how many people supposedly see ads on the site and if you count bots in it, the value drops greatly.\n\nMarketing is done primally through official channels, and more often through main Twitter accounts of brands. People talking and promoting a product is not harmed in any way.\n\nHunting for fraudulent links and scam bots is what he wants to do.

Get in and out before the split's effective date, at least with respect to options contracts. Holding shares would be fine.\n\nWhy? Even though it is an N for 1 split, that can still result in oddball contract adjustments that may harm your liquidity. For example, it's a 20:1 split, so any strike that doesn't divide evenly by 20 will end up fractional, like 1 x 2345 = 20 x 117.25. Unless all the other strikes also end in .25, new traders will tend to steer clear of the oddball strikes.\n\nFor the strats themselves, I would break down the opportunities into two parts.\n\nPart 1 - 4% rise 1 month before split. You want a bullish play that doesn't expect large changes in IV. There are a number of strats that can take advantage of that, but the most common are a long call (debit strat) or a short put (credit strat). You can pick a 45 DTE expiration that ends before the effective date of the split.\n\nPart 2 - Price increases after split. Once the split is effective, you can repeat the same trades, though perhaps with 60 DTE expirations that you roll every 30 days until you capture most of the expected price move. Or, you could sell calls with the oddball strikes on the assumption that people will want to dump out of them as quickly as possible, depressing prices.

As soon as you hit 9k from selling the calls, your outs are paid for and you have the rest of the two years to continue selling ATM/ITM calls for pure profit while your investment is completely covered 100% from any downside and you bank no matter what happens to the underlyings price. \n\nAm I missing something?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your stock may be called away, now and then on a price rise; or you may have to pay to close the short call (and issue a new call for a higher strike, perhaps for two weeks or three week expiration, for an overall net credit on rolling the short call).  \n\nThe stock may fall, and stay down.  \n\nYour total capital at risk if the stock falls:  \n6.10 shares  \n3.30 puts strike  $6 (at the ask) (Jan 2024)  \n9.40 capital  \nNet risk: 9.40 less 6.00 strike of puts  for $3.40 \n\nCalls weekly at $6,  0.60.  \n\nIf the shares rise, and calls are exercised at $6, you do not gain on selling the shares, though you do obtain the premium.

That is the $3.40 risk; you may be able to sell the puts for better outcome than exercising, harvesting both extrinsic value, and intrinsic value, and selling the stock, toconsider re-setting a follow-on position. \n\nWith lower implied volatility stock,    \nSome traders may buy a put at a strike higher than the cost, say, at $7, lowering the net capital at risk, for a price, and sell calls at a higher strike, say, 0.30 delta, around, say, $8, to pay down the cost of the position and puts over time, and to have a gain on the stock being called away, and reduce the risk of loss when the stock is called away.    \n\nWith a high IV stock like LABU, that is harder to do.   \nImplied volatility is an astronomical number, above, around 130% to 150% 100 on an annualized basis.  \n\nTypically collars, which is what your position is, entail working with steadier, and lowe IV stocks. \n\n---\n\nExploring the situation with LABU, with a put higher than the basis cost of the stock: \n\nExamples, for simplcity, pricing for single contracts.  \n\nLABU shares at $6.12    \nPut at strike $7.00 for 4.80 (ask)   (bid 4.30) (Jan 2024 expiration)  \nNet cost: $10.92 (at the ask)       \nAt risk:   10.92 less 7.00 strike on puts: 3.92    \n\nYou want to get your net basis on the position either  \n below $7 strike price over time, or pay for the puts at $4.80 over time. \n\nSell calls weekly or perhaps monthly at  0.25 delta more or less.    \nFor June 17, $7.50 strike call (delta 0.23) is bid at 0.15.    \nFor   July 15, $8.00 strike call (delta 0.33) is bid at 0.40    \n\n---", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

With a CSP, the entire amount required to meet your obligation as the contract writer is held in reserve until your short position is closed. For example, if you were to write a $30 strike put (with a 100 share multiplier), $3,000 would be held by your broker to ensure you can meet your obligation to purchase 100 shares at $30/share. If you were to write a 350 strike put on SPY, it would require $35,000 of collateral and currently pay about $550 with 31 DTE.

I don't know the details of how the buying power required is determined, but the key point is that it's significantly less than the full amount to secure. This provides additional leverage to enable greater rates of return, but can also lead to larger losses and margin calls as more contracts may be written than the account currently has the cash to fulfill.\n\nThe call side works the same way except that shares of the underlying are used to secure a call rather than cash which leads to a different risk profile. Since you don't know how much you would need to purchase the shares for in the event of assignment, the risk is unlimited as the share price is unlimited. This is a neutral to bearish position as you will be short delta. Owning the shares to \"cover the call\", is a bullish (long delta position).

This is the first time I have seen Yuan and Rupee weakening in lockstep, while the Ruble keeps bouncing back.   They had been more independent of each other before.\n\nIf the dollar strengthens too much in anticipation, but not against oil, a rate raise may actually make inflation worse.

Elastic consumer goods were already coming down before the hikes.  The economy was not overheated there was just a wealth effect and a hoarding effect.   Stalling growth to fight inflation during GDP contraction makes little sense.   If inflation by their number is running high and we have a negative growth rate then it is contracting by the inflation rate in addition.

It just hasnt been made into a space-commercial successful yet. Hence why everyone is making space stuff now. We are coming to the end of the utility for normal wireless tech. Its going to get harder and harder to improve on it as is. The next obvious way to improve on it is satellites. This has been well known for a long time as well but again, risk and cost. Elon and Bezos just had the money to do it without much help thus got off the ground running. Everyone else is having a harder time to raise money and push through from R&D and regulatory approval to production and launch.
