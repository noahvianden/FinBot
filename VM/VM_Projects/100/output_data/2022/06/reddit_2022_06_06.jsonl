It could be argued that if they have been made aware of the illegal speech and allowed it to stay up, that is a crime in itself. Do they leave it up when it's probably illegal on the small chance it isn't? How do they separate a scam from marketing?

Free speech is a complicated issue, yet it's used as a marketing slogan.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Right now when it comes to bird site this is what I understand:\n\n- his first focus is on getting rid of bots. Both scammers (as far as I know he does not care about human \"spammers\") and bots being used to manipulate ratings, likes and subscriptions. Current hickup is Twitter failing to provide adequate numbers on how many bots there is on the site and failing to provide a concrete method on how they number them. Elon explaining that the best case is just them being clueless and the worst is them being intentionally malicious.\n\n- humans are allowed free speech within the boundaries of the law. Now what law apply is VERY unclear and it's not like this is unique. Normally the law apply to the country it's domiciled on but countries have often put unbearable pressure on foreign sites to see something removed. It's simply logical that Elon is not quite sure which approach to take, only being sure that Twitter must obviously remain lawful. Essentially anything you could say in a public place without being thrown behind bars is fair game, would be my guess. Obviously the issue is raised with countries that officially enforce censorship, but those are usually dealt with either a separate client or just them blocking access. Elon seems focused to deal with covert manipulation before dealing with open manipulation.\n\n- It is likely moderation will remain however everything will be transparent, tra\u00e7able and quantifiable via an open source of the application's algorithm. The idea being to raise trust and provide accountability now and in the future (perhaps the most important thing) any change or manipulation would be visible.\n\n- marketing is actually a big part of the bot problem. Exposure is rated by how many people supposedly see ads on the site and if you count bots in it, the value drops greatly.\n\nMarketing is done primally through official channels, and more often through main Twitter accounts of brands. People talking and promoting a product is not harmed in any way.\n\nHunting for fraudulent links and scam bots is what he wants to do.
