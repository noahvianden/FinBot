Like you said, they got money and are highly profitable now. Intel plans to build new foundries and expand existing foundries, and even if it's subsidized, Intel will burn billions on capital expenditures, which will depreciate once the fabs start mass production. Intel has a limited amount of time to make the big profits before they switch to the improved node. More R&D and capex will drive down net profit margin.\n\nAlso, Intel is stuck in their run of delays. The constant delays of 10nm started the joke of Intel's 14nm+, where they keep adding plus signs. In 2012, Intel believed they would have 10nm ready in 2015, which got delayed year after year. The first official 10nm chip (codenamed Cannon Lake) was one limited run laptop SKU in 2018. Intel's real 10nm launch was laptop-only Tiger Lake in late 2020. The full 10nm laptop/desktop Alder Lake launched in 2021. Now, they delayed Sapphire Rapids, their next gen server CPU, into October 2022 (earlier rumored to launch in Q1 2022). With Pat Gelsinger as CEO, he, an engineer, will lead Intel to catch up on their years of foundry failures, but playing catch up is expensive after years of cost-cutting.\n\nAt the end of the day, Intel will always be profitable with their existing server contracts and laptop/desktop OEM contracts.
