Every stock could theoretically go to zero.\n\nBut the point I made about the limited risk at these levels still holds because of the supply/demand dynamics that drive stock prices. Once a stock has dropped 70 or 80%, there is very little selling pressure left in the stock. Most investors who wanted out already got out. If you bought a stock at $100 and held it down to $20, you're not going to suddenly sell if it drops to $15 or $10. At these levels most people left holding the stock are planning to hold for a rebound, possibly add, and other investors are looking to get in.\n\nAnd my other point is certainly not irrelevant. That's how stock indices work. They are reflections of the prices of the stocks within those indices. While high growth stocks could drop more from where they are, they don't make up enough of the indices to cause another 20-30% drop in the \"broader markets.\" The only way the indices drop that much from here is if investors flee the \"safe\" stocks that have held up and drive those prices down another 20-30%.

They have also lost about 40% of their armored vehicles, expended most of their missiles, a big chunk of their air force and several major naval vessels including their biggest one. Plus there is growing resistance from the public to support the war in any way.\n\nRemember also that the sanctions severely restrict Russia's ability to repair and replace sophisticated equipment and components.  Meanwhile Ukraine is freshly supplied with weaponry that is superior to Russia's. According to General Petraeus Ukraine just received over 260,000 artiller rounds, some 20, 000 miles, all kinds of killer drones, air defense systems and anti ship missiles capable of sinking Russia's Navy.   Putin is afraid to bring out his Navy but he needs to try.  Ukraine will be ready.   Likely the US and NATO are also giving Ukraine excellent intelligence including real time targeting intel. \n\nSo yes, if Putin is insane and wants Ukraine at any cost he could maybe keep this thing going for a year, but winter is coming soon, the Russian economy is collapsed, and Putin's oil=-gas money is about to be cut in half.\n\nWhat Xi in China is thinking is anyone's guess but it largely has to do with if he wants to end up like Putin.

When an entire market goes down, it takes everything with it. The business doesnt matter at all when there is a major market crash.\n\nCase and point.\n\nDuring the financial crisis, residential REITs were near 100% safe and anyone with knowledge of real estate could have told you that. The reason is when there is a recession, housing sales and startups fall and demand for rentals goes up. Add to that, people losing their homes due to the crisis and bam, residential REITs had a field day. Though its true they had less access to financing, interest rates were falling (also a plus) and given how far property value fell, they could just buy things with cash anyway.\n\nSo yea, you would think that people with a brain would have piled into those REITs... but nope. None of the fundamentals mattered. Stocks like AIV went from around $40 to about $7 even though their dividends were 100% solid and both rent and interest changes were positive for them. The yield on their common share was stupid... like 15% (lol). Oh and thats just the tip of it. Their bonds and fixed income issues of some REITs.... wow. Those were even safer than the common shares and they all dropped from $25 to about $10 for residential stuff. The yield on those was like 20%. I was buying fixed income for even less than that during the major dip. I had stuff paying 40%-50% yield on basis (bought them fro like $3-$5 on $25 issue price) and they were near 100% safe because their business operations were not in peril.\n\nSo in other words, when a major crash happens, your share price and business performance dont matter nor does your current valuation. None of it matters. This is probably because of funds. People pulling their money from funds causes them to sell stuff systematically, not selectively. This takes everything down. This is probably even more acute for bond funds since those are so low volume thus their prices drop a ton when they are forced to sell.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Stocks have not, and will not hit their bottom until the Fed starts alluding to lowering rates and performing quantitative easing, both of which are inflationary tools for economic growth \n\nLearn about inflation and what tools the Federal Reserve needs to bring it down.
