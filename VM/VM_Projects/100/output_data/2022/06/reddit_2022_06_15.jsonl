He opposed it and now look how exactly what we said would happen has played out. Today he sent letters begging for solutions and threatening us at the same time. What a joke.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "What reforms, in the face of a sharp drop in demand for refined oil, would have kept refineries from closing? It seems like falling rig counts and refinery closures were already in the works before he ever stepped foot in office.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s complex so going to simplify, please bare with the length. \n\nThis problem will not go away even with more extraction the same way lumber and meat was expensive despite dirt cheap lumber and cattle prices. It\u2019s all about the middle of the supply chain and the capacity shortage and inability to expand it there. Demand destruction with a recession would certainly help, but it\u2019s a trend that will continue until it becomes a constant even with low demand for gas. \n\nIn the Northeast there are many independent refiners meaning they\u2019re not major oil companies with full integration. In other words they only refine, they don\u2019t extract upstream or blend and market downstream. Strictly in the business of refining. The equivalent would be a company that only owns a sawmill and doesn\u2019t farm timber or transport and market it after the sawmill.\n\nBecause of that, they\u2019re subject to ethanol blending requirements even though they do not blend gasoline. To fulfill the requirements of the program, they instead need to purchase credits called RINs to comply, which were a couple cents when the program started and are now at $1.50-$2.00. The total cost to independent refiners is hundreds of millions of dollars per year, causing losses some years and preventing that money spent on credits from being spent on capital projects and turnarounds. This amounts to an expense every year higher than the cost of purchasing a refinery in many cases. \n\nBiden had a choice to reduce the RVO under this program, which would have reduced the cost of these credits by lowering the blending requirements for ethanol. Instead, he raised them which spiked the cost of credits and the pain will only continue. \n\nThis hurts independent refiners who largely supply the Northeast (PADD 1) and are already at a disadvantage. Since they physically can\u2019t blend ethanol because they don\u2019t market and sell gasoline to consumers which is where blending occurs, they are being pummeled from both sides. \n\nA couple already closed or decreased capacity, which is significant for the region. By lowering the RVO (blending levels in the total gasoline pool) or even just not increasing it, he could have stopped the cause of what has already closed some refineries and caused this capacity shortage. \n\nAnd for those saying I\u2019m claiming this is only Biden\u2019s fault- not the case. Trump sided with ethanol and refused to help as well. But it\u2019s no secret that the left has opposed pipelines running to the East which would help make the economics better for refineries supplying the densest part of the US. Beyond obstructing permits, simply being vocal about being anti fossil fuels is enough to prevent investment. That\u2019s why this problem won\u2019t go away without demand destruction in the short term and a comprehensive energy policy, reforms (like permitting), and investment in the long term. There is no stomach for long term investment in refining because of the political conditions which means capacity will only continue to decrease. \n\nWe did this to ourselves by pushing for a transition without a comprehensive plan. Biden attacks refiners for having a good quarter because there is less fuel than people who want it, yet they have been lagging and losing money the last 15 years.\n\nEdit: WSJ Editorial Board put out a piece yesterday, one of a few they have done, about this issue. The American Petroleum Institute also released a 10 point plan yesterday listing some general things that can be done to improve our domestic energy strategy and supply.

Our current issues with inflation differ greatly from the stagflation period of the 70\u2019s, mainly the fact that we experienced a once in modern history total pause of nearly all global economic activity for three months.\n\nSupply chain issues are still a real problem that many people are forgetting about. It\u2019s still an active issue that is continuing to ripple through. 20 years of conversion to JIT inventory management has made us dependent on the continual availability of new products, the manufacturers and distributors of which are all attempting to get 90%+ utilization out of their lines.

The production capacity is inelastic as the equipment to make those commodity semiconductors is largely legacy and it\u2019s not economically viable to invest in new lines. Those chips are used everywhere, and the absence of those items has an effect on products that don\u2019t even use them directly. I know of a lumber mill that has several lines off line right now because they are missing replacements components for the motor controls that run their machinery.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that there is any parallel for our current situation. \n\nI\u2019m no economist, but I think this inflationary period could go either way.

Most people found the UI pretty clunky and not as intuitive as Zoom which I agree with. Teams looks like it was designed by engineers for engineers.

In the end, Teams is a front end collaboration tool for O365 and Zoom is a conferencing, chat, and now a phone/uc as a service app. A lot of overlap but still not super easy to compare them. If we are comparing just the conferencing aspect, I think Zoom will win every time with it's ease of use and fantastically simple ui. I also like the Zoom chat but it's still nothing of note. It's just what a simple cloud chat app should be. Easy to use, easy to search, good balance of back end settings (enough Office integration to make people happy as well). But Zoom is definitely not a front end for 365 and if collaboration and SharePoint type stuff are the most important to your business, Teams is of course going to be the best option. We use a different document management system that has all of our collaboration and 365 integration built into it so we don't really utilize all of the Microsoft tools (usually because they are more frustrating!) In the end, aside from some of the bugginess that we would experience in Teams meetings (mute not always working, video and sound sync issues that weren't ever present in Zoom or WebEx, etc.), the biggest issues always seemed to be with external parties being able to join a meeting and have a good experience. That is where the bulk of complaints came from and it was usually a result of an external user trying and failing to join a Teams via the web whether they were on pc or iPad, then trying to download the Teams app which also wouldn't work for them because their office either didn't have Teams licensing or didn't have it setup properly, or they did and the user's device wasn't managed or something like that (so they could never use Teams associated with their office email address). Ultimately, they would not be able to get connected and everyone would blame it on Teams being garbage. And in a way they weren't wrong but I can also see how this isn't exactly the fault of Teams.
