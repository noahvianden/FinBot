{"title": "A market environment where indexing does not work?", "selftext": "I've been contemplating this for a while, and I'd love to get some other thoughts.\n\nOver the past 40 years, we've had a macro environment where interest rates have steadily decreased for a number of different reasons. In addition to structurally lower interest rates, the last 12 years were also an environment with effectively infinite QE.\n\nThis low inflation, QE supported environment is likely a huge reason why US tech stocks were able to dominate and have outsized returns starting in 2009-10. Money was effectively free, making it easier to grow a business without needing to show immediate profits. This is largely what created the environment to support a Tech boom and higher P/E's.\n\nBut as we know, the top 10 companies of today are unlikely to be the top 10 companies in 10 years from now.\n\nWith the macro environment now shifting away from unlimited QE and a breakdown of globalization, there's a lot of talk of a regime change. I don't have the words for how important this could be for equity investors. A regime change is not a \"good\" thing (at least in the short term), and it could very well lead to a world of structurally higher interest rates, the end of QE, and ultimately, a change in investor perceptions.\n\nIf this regime change does happen (and we are seeing the beginning of it), and QE goes away for the next 40 years and interest rates \"normalize\" to 5%+ as they used to be before the 08 financial crisis, I'm wondering what that will mean for investors.\n\nWhy buy a stock at a 20+ P/E when you could buy a Bond that pays 5%+ guaranteed? All of a sudden, the average P/E we've been accustomed to for the last decade+ is completely  unsustainable. An example of this, during the inflationary bear market in the 70's, the stock market got down to P/E's below 10x. Could you imagine what would happen to SPY if it went to a P/E of 10? People would say it's the end of the world and investing is dead. I don't anticipate this will happen, I'm just putting into context what higher interest rates for longer will do to stocks, and the higher interest rates get, the lower P/E's have to go.\n\nSo, if we are going through a regime change due to higher for longer inflation, and the last 40 years of low interest rates is over, what happens to equity valuations, and does it still make sense to index to something like the S&P?\n\nWould it make more sense to Index specifically to cash flowing dividend payers that are already priced below 15x P/E on average? When there's a real cost of capital and money is no longer \"free\", it seems to me that investors will prefer return of capital rather than return on capital.\n\nThe idea of a regime change away from structurally low interest rates could make stock market investing extremely unattractive, and the fact that broad market ETF's have become such a crowded trade over the last 2 decades, in addition to the macro environment we had, it just makes me think indexing won't be the free lunch it used to be.\n\nThat doesn't mean I think we should all become stock pickers or bond investors. But, it does make me think that the way ETF's are currently structured (with high P/E Tech being the biggest weighting), returns will be severely muted going forward.\n\nAll of this of course is speculation on the idea that we are going through a regime change, and interest rates will \"never\" be as low as we've seen them recently. It's easy for people to anchor to what the world used to be (we saw this when Covid happened, people thought we were just a 1-2 week lockdown away from the world going back to normal, but it never did.)\n\nI find it difficult to believe one day everything will just go back to 0% interest rates and markets will continue to grind up like nothing ever happened. I find it much more likely that interest rates are higher for longer, and investors start to prefer different types of equities than the ones we've seen over the last 20 years, which ultimately could lead to broad market ETF's being a \"dead\" investment for a long time, at least until a new group of \"leaders\" emerges like the FAANG stocks.", "id": "vki8bd", "created_utc": 1656173171.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "There\u2019s a reason why people were recommending a 60/40 stock and bonds allocation back in the days.

E.g. future QE, market crashes resulting in a flight to safety (which is the real use of treasuries in a portfolio - to hedge equities). Nonetheless, I hope it illustrates my point a bit more clearly. Treasuries are not useless if used appropriately for the right goal. In this case, hedging against equities, providing a return above CDs/HYSA with relatively low risk - if held until maturity or for an appropriate duration if using ETFs/funds.\n\nI do hope you have read it fully as this took quite a while to write lol.\n\nIt's not investing advice.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "15 years to break even is absurd though?\n\nSo saying \"bond investors can just hold on\" is not very helpful, everything goes up... eventually.

First, I didn't say we need *high* unemployment, I said unemployment is currently at record lows.

Second, while Reddit has falsely repeated that myth about the so-called definition of a recession, it's completely wrong. There is no agreed-upon definition of a recession, but NBER describes it as: \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\" Since unemployment and new jobless claims continue to be very low, it's not possible for this to be a recession. Finally, the recent negative quarter was likely an aberration as it was largely due to two, temporary, specific exogenous factors (trade imbalance caused by Beijing Olympic broadcasting rights and retailers hoarding inventory due to a shift from \"just in time\" to \"just in case\" management)\u2014 which I described in [my other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/vkm5z6/on_june_29th_the_usa_gross_domestic_product_third/idqh3dm/) in this thread.  \n  \nEdit: \"definition\" of a recession from [NBER](https://www.nber.org/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions)  \n  \n>**Q: What is a recession? What is an expansion?**\n\n>A: The NBER's traditional definition of a recession is that it is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months. The committee's view is that while each of the three criteria\u2014depth, diffusion, and duration\u2014needs to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions revealed by one criterion may partially offset weaker indications from another. For example, in the case of the February 2020 peak in economic activity, we concluded that the drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that the downturn should be classified as a recession even if it proved to be quite brief. The committee subsequently determined that the trough occurred two months after the peak, in April 2020. An expansion is a period when the economy is not in a recession. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief. However, the time that it takes for the economy to return to its previous peak level of activity may be quite extended.  \n  \n>**Q: Why doesn't the committee accept the two-quarter definition?**  \n  \n>A: There are several reasons. First, we do not identify economic activity solely with real GDP, but consider a range of indicators. Second, we consider the depth of the decline in economic activity. The NBER definition includes the phrase, \u201ca significant decline in economic activity.\" Thus real GDP could decline by relatively small amounts in two consecutive quarters without warranting the determination that a peak had occurred. Third, our main focus is on the monthly chronology, which requires consideration of monthly indicators. Fourth, in examining the behavior of production on a quarterly basis, where real GDP data are available, we give equal weight to real GDI. The difference between GDP and GDI\u2014called the \u201cstatistical discrepancy\u201d\u2014was particularly important in the recessions of 2001 and 2007\u20132009.", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "Totally wrong about the literal definition of a recession?

It's literally 2 quarters of negative GDP growth, that's it.   \n  \nAgain, you're wrong. As you can plainly see from NBER, it is *not* \"literally\" anything you just claimed. I have no idea who you just quoted, but it's not the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/business-cycle-dating-procedure-frequently-asked-questions). They decide what is, or is not an economic recession. Two negative quarters of GDP is sometimes used as a rule of thumb, it's not the definition of a recession or a definitive rule.    \n  \nHere's a video of Mark Zandi recently [refuting your claim](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/16/the-amount-of-jobs-being-created-shows-theres-not-a-recession-says-moodys-mark-zandi.html) as well. \n  \n>Also there are tons of companies laying off workers or right now.

I just showed you that new jobless claims are at a 54-year low. I am obviously paying attention.
