{"title": "Elon one step closer to closing on Twitter deal, passed Antitrust review", "selftext": "from Matt Levine at Bloomberg, important part at end.\n\n\"No, come on, stop it. Six weeks ago, Elon Musk [signed a merger agreement](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMjcvYmlsbC1od2FuZy1hcnJlc3QtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS12aWNpb3VzLWN5Y2xlLW9mLWFyY2hlZ29zLWNvbGxhcHNlP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bBb47860cf) in which he made a legally binding promise to\u00a0buy Twitter Inc. for $54.20 per share. A few weeks later, he decided he didn\u2019t want to pay $54.20 per share anymore, perhaps because he had grown\u00a0bored of Twitter, or\u00a0[perhaps\u00a0because](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDUtMTcvZWxvbi1tdXNrLWRvZXMtbm90LWNhcmUtYWJvdXQtc3BhbS1ib3RzP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bBeb0f7533) the prices of social-media stocks, and of Musk\u2019s company Tesla Inc., had fallen, and $54.20 looked pretty expensive.\n\nThe merger agreement does not, however, allow Musk to walk away because he changed his mind. He needed some pretext for walking away. He [came up with](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDUtMTMvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXRyb2xscy10d2l0dGVyP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bBd2685b11) what he thought was a good one: Twitter says, in its public filings, that no more than 5% of its \u201cmonetizable daily active users\u201d are \u201cfalse or spam\u201d accounts, and Musk has a vague sense that there are more spam bots than that. (To be fair, a lot of *his*\u00a0followers [are bots](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9lbG9uLW11c2tzLWJvdC1wcm9ibGVtLW9uLXR3aXR0ZXItaXMtZXh0cmFvcmRpbmFyeS0xMTY1NDQyNjgwMD9tb2Q9aHBfbGlzdGFfcG9zNA/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB69c9827b).) He floated the idea that he could walk away from the deal because Twitter was lying about the spam bots.\n\nTo a non-lawyer I suppose this looked like a good pretext, but it was not. It was not for at least three reasons:\n\n1. Musk had not a shred \u2014\u00a0not even the tiniest bit \u2014\u00a0of evidence that Twitter\u2019s estimates are wrong, and it [seems very likely](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5jb20vMjAyMi9tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItYW5kLWJvdHMtYm90LWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtYm90LXNjaWVuY2Uv/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB18835419) that they are right.\\[1\\]\n2. Even if Twitter\u2019s\u00a0estimates are wrong, Musk could not get out of the merger agreement unless the error was likely to have a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d on Twitter\u2019s business, and it absolutely would not.\n3. Musk has been talking about Twitter\u2019s bot problem forever, and in fact he originally said that he wanted to buy Twitter *in order to*\u00a0fix the bot problem, so no one could possibly believe him when he said that he wanted to walk away from the deal because he just discovered that Twitter has a bot problem.\n\n...\n\nWell. I guess he set his lawyers \u2014 led by Mike Ringler of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP \u2014\u00a0to work finding a pretext that they could stomach. And they found one, and today they filed it with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, in the form of [a letter to Twitter threatening to call off the deal](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTEwNDY1OTIyMDY4MzQ3L3RtMjIxNzc2MWQxX2V4OTktby5odG0/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB40cca94c).\n\nTheir pretext is sort of the lawyer version of Musk\u2019s pretext. The problem, say the lawyers, is\u00a0not that Twitter has too many spam bots. The problem is that, when Musk asks for *information*\u00a0about the spam bots, Twitter doesn\u2019t give him the information he wants. From their letter:\n\n>Twitter has, in fact, refused to provide the information that Mr. Musk has repeatedly requested since May 9, 2022 to facilitate his evaluation of spam and fake accounts on the company\u2019s platform. Twitter\u2019s latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company\u2019s own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk\u2019s data requests. Twitter\u2019s effort to characterize it otherwise is merely an attempt to obfuscate and confuse the issue. Mr. Musk has made it clear that he does not believe the company\u2019s lax testing methodologies are adequate so he must conduct his own analysis. The data he has requested is necessary to do so.\n\n...\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s asking for, but in general I can understand why Twitter would be nervous about sharing user data with Musk. For one thing, there are all sorts of regulatory and risk reasons to be nervous about sharing user data with someone who, for now at least, does not work at Twitter. For another thing, Musk has been publicly trolling Twitter about the bot problem, and about everything else, for weeks now, and there\u2019s no reason to think he would be particularly responsible with\u00a0*this*\u00a0information. His lawyers write:\n\n>Mr. Musk will of course comply with the restrictions provided under Section 6.4, including by ensuring that anyone reviewing the data is bound by a non-disclosure agreement, and Mr. Musk will not retain or otherwise use any competitively sensitive information if the transaction is not consummated.\n\nBut this is not much comfort, because Musk has constantly ignored the restrictions of the merger agreement, including by [tweeting disparaging things](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMjcvYmlsbC1od2FuZy1hcnJlc3QtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS12aWNpb3VzLWN5Y2xlLW9mLWFyY2hlZ29zLWNvbGxhcHNlP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bCb47860cf) about Twitter.\u00a0He himself has [boasted publicly](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9lbG9ubXVzay9zdGF0dXMvMTUyNTYxNTg0OTE2NzU4OTM4MA/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB85ee1a5d) that he violated a non-disclosure agreement with Twitter by tweeting about Twitter\u2019s bot methodology!\\[7\\] If you give him sensitive user data he is just absolutely going to tweet about it, and trusting his promises not to would be dumb. And if he does break his promises, what can Twitter do? Sue him to call off the deal? Twitter doesn\u2019t want to call off the deal. Musk does!\n\n...\n\nI mean, to be clear, it isn\u2019t\u00a0a\u00a0*good*\u00a0pretext. It is, for instance, very hard to imagine that Musk\u2019s banks are clamoring for detailed information about spam accounts to line up their financing; Twitter has raised debt financing in the past with its existing bot disclosure. Nor is it clear what Musk\u2019s \u201creasonable business purpose related to the consummation of the transactions\u201d is. And because it is so clearly part of Musk\u2019s broader trolling operation, it is hard to imagine him\u00a0*winning*\u00a0if this ends up in court: If he refuses to close because Twitter won\u2019t humor his bot-fishing expedition, it seems unlikely that a Delaware court will side with him. But it does raise the *risk*\u00a0for Twitter,\u00a0which gives him a bit more leverage to try to renegotiate the price. It is all going to get so much dumber.\n\nIn other Twitter M&A news, on Friday the deal\u00a0[cleared US antitrust review](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTIyMTY3MzExL2QzNDY1MjJkZGVmYTE0YS5odG0/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB0793fdac)with no problems. One possibility is that Musk will keep sending nasty letters and tweets about bots, and the people \u2014\u00a0including the ones working for him \u2014\u00a0whose job it is to get the deal done will keep working to get the deal done, and one day Musk will be mid-sentence typing a nasty tweet about Twitter and find out that he owns it.\"", "id": "v76t3j", "created_utc": 1654633935.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|159|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v76t3j)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v76t3j)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "These reports are really, really cool.
