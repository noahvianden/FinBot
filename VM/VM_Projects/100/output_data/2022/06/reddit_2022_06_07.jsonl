{"title": "Elon one step closer to closing on Twitter deal, passed Antitrust review", "selftext": "from Matt Levine at Bloomberg, important part at end.\n\n\"No, come on, stop it. Six weeks ago, Elon Musk [signed a merger agreement](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMjcvYmlsbC1od2FuZy1hcnJlc3QtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS12aWNpb3VzLWN5Y2xlLW9mLWFyY2hlZ29zLWNvbGxhcHNlP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bBb47860cf) in which he made a legally binding promise to\u00a0buy Twitter Inc. for $54.20 per share. A few weeks later, he decided he didn\u2019t want to pay $54.20 per share anymore, perhaps because he had grown\u00a0bored of Twitter, or\u00a0[perhaps\u00a0because](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDUtMTcvZWxvbi1tdXNrLWRvZXMtbm90LWNhcmUtYWJvdXQtc3BhbS1ib3RzP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bBeb0f7533) the prices of social-media stocks, and of Musk\u2019s company Tesla Inc., had fallen, and $54.20 looked pretty expensive.\n\nThe merger agreement does not, however, allow Musk to walk away because he changed his mind. He needed some pretext for walking away. He [came up with](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDUtMTMvZWxvbi1tdXNrLXRyb2xscy10d2l0dGVyP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bBd2685b11) what he thought was a good one: Twitter says, in its public filings, that no more than 5% of its \u201cmonetizable daily active users\u201d are \u201cfalse or spam\u201d accounts, and Musk has a vague sense that there are more spam bots than that. (To be fair, a lot of *his*\u00a0followers [are bots](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NqLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9lbG9uLW11c2tzLWJvdC1wcm9ibGVtLW9uLXR3aXR0ZXItaXMtZXh0cmFvcmRpbmFyeS0xMTY1NDQyNjgwMD9tb2Q9aHBfbGlzdGFfcG9zNA/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB69c9827b).) He floated the idea that he could walk away from the deal because Twitter was lying about the spam bots.\n\nTo a non-lawyer I suppose this looked like a good pretext, but it was not. It was not for at least three reasons:\n\n1. Musk had not a shred \u2014\u00a0not even the tiniest bit \u2014\u00a0of evidence that Twitter\u2019s estimates are wrong, and it [seems very likely](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5jb20vMjAyMi9tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItYW5kLWJvdHMtYm90LWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtYm90LXNjaWVuY2Uv/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB18835419) that they are right.\\[1\\]\n2. Even if Twitter\u2019s\u00a0estimates are wrong, Musk could not get out of the merger agreement unless the error was likely to have a \u201cmaterial adverse effect\u201d on Twitter\u2019s business, and it absolutely would not.\n3. Musk has been talking about Twitter\u2019s bot problem forever, and in fact he originally said that he wanted to buy Twitter *in order to*\u00a0fix the bot problem, so no one could possibly believe him when he said that he wanted to walk away from the deal because he just discovered that Twitter has a bot problem.\n\n...\n\nWell. I guess he set his lawyers \u2014 led by Mike Ringler of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP \u2014\u00a0to work finding a pretext that they could stomach. And they found one, and today they filed it with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, in the form of [a letter to Twitter threatening to call off the deal](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTEwNDY1OTIyMDY4MzQ3L3RtMjIxNzc2MWQxX2V4OTktby5odG0/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB40cca94c).\n\nTheir pretext is sort of the lawyer version of Musk\u2019s pretext. The problem, say the lawyers, is\u00a0not that Twitter has too many spam bots. The problem is that, when Musk asks for *information*\u00a0about the spam bots, Twitter doesn\u2019t give him the information he wants. From their letter:\n\n>Twitter has, in fact, refused to provide the information that Mr. Musk has repeatedly requested since May 9, 2022 to facilitate his evaluation of spam and fake accounts on the company\u2019s platform. Twitter\u2019s latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company\u2019s own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk\u2019s data requests. Twitter\u2019s effort to characterize it otherwise is merely an attempt to obfuscate and confuse the issue. Mr. Musk has made it clear that he does not believe the company\u2019s lax testing methodologies are adequate so he must conduct his own analysis. The data he has requested is necessary to do so.\n\n...\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s asking for, but in general I can understand why Twitter would be nervous about sharing user data with Musk. For one thing, there are all sorts of regulatory and risk reasons to be nervous about sharing user data with someone who, for now at least, does not work at Twitter. For another thing, Musk has been publicly trolling Twitter about the bot problem, and about everything else, for weeks now, and there\u2019s no reason to think he would be particularly responsible with\u00a0*this*\u00a0information. His lawyers write:\n\n>Mr. Musk will of course comply with the restrictions provided under Section 6.4, including by ensuring that anyone reviewing the data is bound by a non-disclosure agreement, and Mr. Musk will not retain or otherwise use any competitively sensitive information if the transaction is not consummated.\n\nBut this is not much comfort, because Musk has constantly ignored the restrictions of the merger agreement, including by [tweeting disparaging things](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDQtMjcvYmlsbC1od2FuZy1hcnJlc3QtaW5zaWRlLXRoZS12aWNpb3VzLWN5Y2xlLW9mLWFyY2hlZ29zLWNvbGxhcHNlP2NtcGlkPUJCRDA2MDYyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDYwNiZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bCb47860cf) about Twitter.\u00a0He himself has [boasted publicly](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9lbG9ubXVzay9zdGF0dXMvMTUyNTYxNTg0OTE2NzU4OTM4MA/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB85ee1a5d) that he violated a non-disclosure agreement with Twitter by tweeting about Twitter\u2019s bot methodology!\\[7\\] If you give him sensitive user data he is just absolutely going to tweet about it, and trusting his promises not to would be dumb. And if he does break his promises, what can Twitter do? Sue him to call off the deal? Twitter doesn\u2019t want to call off the deal. Musk does!\n\n...\n\nI mean, to be clear, it isn\u2019t\u00a0a\u00a0*good*\u00a0pretext. It is, for instance, very hard to imagine that Musk\u2019s banks are clamoring for detailed information about spam accounts to line up their financing; Twitter has raised debt financing in the past with its existing bot disclosure. Nor is it clear what Musk\u2019s \u201creasonable business purpose related to the consummation of the transactions\u201d is. And because it is so clearly part of Musk\u2019s broader trolling operation, it is hard to imagine him\u00a0*winning*\u00a0if this ends up in court: If he refuses to close because Twitter won\u2019t humor his bot-fishing expedition, it seems unlikely that a Delaware court will side with him. But it does raise the *risk*\u00a0for Twitter,\u00a0which gives him a bit more leverage to try to renegotiate the price. It is all going to get so much dumber.\n\nIn other Twitter M&A news, on Friday the deal\u00a0[cleared US antitrust review](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/27964259.209811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VjLmdvdi9BcmNoaXZlcy9lZGdhci9kYXRhLzE0MTgwOTEvMDAwMTE5MzEyNTIyMTY3MzExL2QzNDY1MjJkZGVmYTE0YS5odG0/5f80bec4a07c693c735e6a3bB0793fdac)with no problems. One possibility is that Musk will keep sending nasty letters and tweets about bots, and the people \u2014\u00a0including the ones working for him \u2014\u00a0whose job it is to get the deal done will keep working to get the deal done, and one day Musk will be mid-sentence typing a nasty tweet about Twitter and find out that he owns it.\"", "id": "v76t3j", "created_utc": 1654633935.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|159|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v76t3j)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v76t3j)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "These reports are really, really cool.

{"title": "Target shares fall as it expects squeezed profits from aggressive plan to get rid of unwanted inventory", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/target-markdowns-plan-to-cut-inventory.html\n\nTarget warned investors Tuesday that its profits will take a short-term hit, as it marks down unwanted items, cancels orders and takes aggressive steps to get rid of extra inventory. The retailer slashed its profit margin expectations for the fiscal second quarter to account for a wave of goods winding up deeply discounted or on the clearance rack. Shares fell more than 9% in premarket trading following the news. \u201cWe thought it was prudent for us to be decisive, act quickly, get out in front of this, address and optimize our inventory in the second quarter \u2014 take those actions necessary to remove the excess inventory and set ourselves up to continue to be guest relevant with our assortment,\u201d CEO Brian Cornell said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nBy taking swift action, Cornell said Target can fend off further pain and make room for merchandise that customers do want, such as groceries, beauty items, household essentials and seasonal categories like back-to-school supplies. He said the company\u2019s stores and website are seeing strong traffic and \u201ca very resilient customer,\u201d but one who no longer shops popular Covid pandemic categories. \u201cWe want to make sure that we continue to lean into those categories that are relevant today,\u201d he said. Target anticipates its operating margin rate for the second quarter will be around 2%. That\u2019s lower than the outlook it gave less than three weeks ago, when it anticipated its operating margin rate would be roughly around its first-quarter operating margin rate of 5.3%.\n\nIn the back half of the year, Target anticipates profit margins will be in a range around 6% \u2014 better than its average performance for the fall season in the years before the pandemic began. The company said it still expects revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits for the full year and to maintain or gain market share in 2022. Retailers from Walmart to Gap face a glut of inventory as inflation-pinched shoppers skip over categories that were popular during the first two years of the pandemic. Gap, for instance, said customers want party dresses and office clothes instead of the many fleece hoodies and active clothes the company has. Walmart said some families are making fewer discretionary purchases as the prices of gas and groceries rise. Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters both reported a steep jump in inventory levels, up 46% and 45%, respectively, from a year ago from a mix of items not selling and supply chain delays easing. The extreme shift in consumers\u2019 spending habits comes as retailers start to get back to healthy in-stock levels. That means some have an abundance of sweatpants, throw pillows and pajamas just as consumers search for swimsuits and suitcases. Plus, some shoppers are trimming back on spending due to inflation or putting more of their dollars toward experiences like dining out and traveling.\n\nCornell said Target decided to roll out its new inventory plan after hearing retail competitors had similar woes. He said the company also wanted to get ahead of key sales seasons, such as back-to-school and the holidays, when stale merchandise could clutter stores and drive away customers. Target said it had nearly $15.1 billion of inventory as of April 30, the end of the fiscal first quarter. That\u2019s about 43% higher than in the year-ago period. Target shocked Wall Street on May 18 with a wide earnings miss for the fiscal first quarter, as it got hit by fuel and freight costs, higher levels of discounting, and a rotation away from items like TVs, small kitchen appliances and bicycles. Its shares fell nearly 25%, marking the company\u2019s worst day on Wall Street in 35 years.\n\nWalmart missed earnings expectations, too. Its inventory levels were up about 33% compared with a year ago. Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said at an investor event on Friday that about 20% of that is merchandise the retailer wishes it did not have. Roughly a third is additional inventory to help the retailer restock key items. He said it will be \u201ca couple of quarters to get back to where we want to be.\u201d That company\u2019s shares also fell after Target\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. Walmart\u2019s shares were down about 4% in premarket trading.

I'm just saying that limiting oil production is one way to reduce hydrocarbon consumption when people are failing to curtail their own energy consumption.

Apparently, the masses of cheap houses that have been built there lately are not suitable for deep South climates and mirrors glued to bathroom walls fall off & the houses turn into heat boxes. But even apart from the shoddy construction, the idea that people should learn to live with higher temperatures if they move to Texas instead of blasting their ACs all Summer, was deemed to be a barbaric, pre-Civilization idea on my part. But you know, the hundreds of millions of energy hogs in America who equate civilization with never having to acclimate to colder temps in Winter and hotter temps in Summer, can cut back if energy costs enough, and high prices may be the ONLY way to force them to do that. \n\nHigh prices are the inevitable result of a climate mitigation policy of forcing a reduction of hydrocarbon production.

So yes, many companies in many industries are using this as an opportunity to increase their profit margins by hiding behind inflation and inability to solve the supply side issues. Not every industry (like retail) can do it however but many industries are having the opposite of a price war because said industry can\u2019t meet total demand.\n\nSo yes one solution to this problem is causing a recession and literally having people too poor to push any demand.

{"title": "World Bank warns global economy may suffer 1970s-style stagflation, Risks of further deterioration are mounting", "selftext": "BY DAVID J. LYNCH\n\nThe global economy may be headed for years of weak growth and rising prices, a toxic combination that will test the stability of dozens of countries still struggling to rebound from the pandemic, the World Bank warned Tuesday.\nNot since the 1970s \u2014 when twin oil shocks sapped growth and lifted prices, giving rise to the malady known as \u201cstagflation\u201d \u2014 has the global economy faced such a challenge.\nThe bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent from January\u2019s 4.1 percent and said that \u201csubdued growth will likely persist throughout the decade because of weak investment in most of the world.\u201d\nFallout from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has aggravated the global slowdown by driving up prices for a range of commodities, fueling inflation. Global growth this year will be roughly half of last year\u2019s annualized rate and is expected to show little improvement in 2023 and 2024.\nThis will be the sharpest slump after an initial post-recession rebound that the global economy has suffered in more than 80 years, the bank said. And the situation could get even worse if the Ukraine war fractures global trade and financial networks or soaring food prices spark social unrest in importing countries.\n\u201cThe risk from stagflation is considerable with potentially destabilizing consequences for low- and middle-income economies,\u201d said David Malpass, president of the multilateral development institution in Washington. \u201c \u2026 There\u2019s a severe risk of malnutrition and of deepening hunger and even of famine in some areas.\u201d\nIf the worst outcomes materialize, global growth over the next two years could fall \u201cclose to zero,\u201d he added.\n\nWith few exceptions, the economic outlook is troubled.\nIn the third year of pandemic, the global economy this year has been hit by what the World Bank labels \u201coverlapping crises\u201d \u2014 fallout from the war in Ukraine, recurring coronavirus lockdowns affecting Chinese factories and the highest inflation rates in decades.\nFor now, the greatest areas of concern lie beyond U.S. borders. A recession in Europe is a real possibility, as the continent struggles to accommodate nearly 7 million Ukrainian refugees and deal with upheavals in energy markets. Elsewhere, the interruption of grain exports via the Black Sea is hurting countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and Somalia. China is suffering from its rigid zero-covid policies and battling costly property market weakness.\nThough the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of the year during the omicron variant surge, growth is expected to rebound in the current quarter, according to economists\u2019 estimates. Financial market gauges of future inflation rates have declined since late April, easing \u2014 though not eliminating \u2014 fears of a prolonged price spiral.\nNathan Sheets, global chief economist for Citigroup, called the chance of a significant stagflation outbreak in the U.S. \u201cremote,\u201d in a recent client note.\n\nPolicymakers must act quickly to mitigate the Ukraine war\u2019s consequences, help countries pay for food and fuel, and accelerate promised debt relief, while avoiding \u201cdistortionary policies\u201d such as price controls and export bans, the bank said.\nThe World Bank\u2019s Malpass said the global economy is being hampered by inadequate production capacity for key goods. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to increase supply massively to really try to get at inflation directly by more production. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t signs of that very much yet,\u201d he said.\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted global energy markets, threatening Europe with recession and straining the budgets of countries that import large quantities of oil, natural gas, coal and fertilizer, the bank said.\nAs Europe weans itself from Russian energy products, its purchases from alternative suppliers competes with orders from existing customers, limiting available supplies.\n\nInvestors also could take a beating from a repeat of \u201870s-style stagflation. The S&P 500 stock index, already down more than 13 percent this year, could lose an additional 20 percent or more, according to a recent client note from Bank of America.\nLed by the United States, the world roared out of the pandemic downturn with its fastest growth since 1973, a 5.7 percent gain. The global economy was expected to struggle this year as it adjusted to the loss of pandemic-era government spending and ultralow interest rates. But Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and continued coronavirus flare-ups \u2014 have made the situation tougher.\n\nThe price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has jumped to nearly $120, up almost 50 percent this year. And wheat has staged a similar rally, leading the bank to call for urgent action to ease \u201cworldwide food shortages.\u201d\nThe World Bank\u2019s downbeat forecast adds to concerns about global weakness. Most major stock markets, including those in the United States, are in the red so far this year. And the bank\u2019s sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, lowered its global forecast in April.\nWith the U.S., and most other major economies suffering the highest inflation in 40 years, many economists in recent months have cited the danger of a 1970s rerun.", "id": "v7acpd", "created_utc": 1654642670.0, "score": 1184, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 346, "comments": [{"body": "The 80s were the best decade up to that decade in the history of the stock market, so the 2030s should be lit.", "score": 321, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cYou will own nothing and eat ze bugs\u201d", "score": 219, "replies": [{"body": "*vill", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Vill Veaton?

We currently have two groups of people moving into peak earning periods of their lives. Millennials and Gen Z. Millennials put off buying homes for a very long time, and starting families. Those people have been in peak earning years for a bit now, but are just now starting to settle down. Gen Z coming up behind them will compound that. Millennials \u201cfailure to launch\u201d has caused a sort of \u201csuper demographic\u201d in terms of spending which will play out over the next decade or more. \n\nStarter homes: There has been a criminal under supply of starter homes being built over the past 30 years. This has caused existing home to jump, you are correct, but the rising interest rates will only slow the growth of existing home sales. Eventually manufacturers will see the $$$ in the demand for starter homes and that trend will pick up again. Building newer but smaller square footage properties. However this doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Also with inflation driving raw materials higher, this may take some time for the money to be right. \n\nInflation: Inflation and higher borrowing costs will also drive some retired people back into the workforce. It is already happening.\n\nInterest rates: true there is generally an inverse relationship between increase in housing prices and interest rates. If people can\u2019t afford the monthly payments on the average home, sellers will lower prices to make the sale. However this isn\u2019t absolute. Someone who sells their home also has to either buy a other or rent from someone. Rental rates are also skyrocketing, which makes that choice more difficult. If I refinanced my house at 3% to take out my equity, and I have to lower the price just a bit to sell it, and then I either have to get a new loan for 5.5% or pay rent much higher than I was paying on my low rate mortgage, I\u2019ll probably just sit there and not sell. \n\n\nI think what we are seeing is just the tail end of people trying to cash out high. Eventually either rates will come back down, or houses will come off the market. People will decide to stay where they are until they are sure they can 1) sell for enough to cover their costs of moving and buying a new place or 2) can sell for enough and are sure they can get a rental that makes sense.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "I like the way you're trying to explain the madness that has occurred over the last 2-3 years logically.

Once things start moving in a downward trajectory , people who once felt so wealthy start losing money in stocks/crypto/nfts, homebuyers see their precious asset they bought at the peak of the market underwater in value, it's anyones guess where things go and how bad things get.

Now that inflation (probably reason they all rushed to buy all the property) is setting in, rates are rising and the avg person can\u2019t afford the new payments . What was a $1300 mortgage a couple years ago is now a $2800 a month mortgage in same neighborhood. Most ppl in working class don\u2019t have the debt to income to qualify for that high of a monthly payment. That\u2019s $33,600 per year in mortgage as opposed to $15,600 per year mortgage. Now these families are being forced to rent at the higher price at a time when inflation is at very high levels and prices are continuing to rise. This means less money being spent outside of those huge corps that own the homes. On top of that, Biden\u2019s new tax structure is having people pay back money given by the gov during Covid with their tax return\u2026\u2026 if this is not market manipulation, corruption, and a huge push for socialism and the elimination of the middle class then what is it?
