And that\u2019s a very good question I keep asking myself. Would the world tank it\u2019s economy to win a war?\n\nWe\u2019ve got to look at who is \u201cthe world\u201d to answer that question. The world is really two camps: \n\n\u2014politicians and their followers in one camp (would not want the pain of tanked economies) \n\n\u2014are led subtly by news (quoting think tanks) who are funded by money interests in the other camp (make money during tanking economies and war times). \n\nNone of us in US want to see democracy defeated by invading tyrants. Democracies across the globe are United in this sentiment  \n\nHow long will the war continue?\nAs long as the sentiment among voters and politicians is in agreement with the news feeds that get their data from the think tanks who are funded by Defense Contractors. \nIt\u2019s in Defense contractor\u2019s best profit interests to prolong the war. Interestingly, the think tanks they fund are the best data sources on the war, the sources news reporters quote. So our news is Fed to us by Defense Contractor-funded data. Folks with profit interested in prolonging the war. Folks whose children and families do not live in Europe. Folks who can afford nice vacations and who do not feel the pain of higher food or gas prices. \n\nThen, consider the issue of who are really going to feel the most pain as the war continues into winter 2022-2023: European voters. Will they cave to Putin? Putin is betting that Europe will cave in. Russian media characterizes Europeans as lazy snd spoiled and soft, not willing to endure hardships. Will Europe cave in? Europeans say they have enough reserves to last the winter. Europeans do not want Putin\u2019s war machine pushing westward into democratic nations. Maybe Europeans will have the Will to ration food and fuel if they need to do it to get through the tail end of winter 2023. \n\nConsider US voters: US is self sufficient in energy and food. We are right now the worlds largest exporter of energy. We are a top exporter of wheat and corn. So why are our food and energy prices so high? Because we are exporting a LOT of what we produce. When voters realize this fact, US voters might start clamoring to reduce US exports in order to reduce US domestic food and energy prices. \n\nAs Blackrock\u2019s Larry Fink, and JPMC\u2019s Jamie Dimon both say, the world is moving toward increasing isolationism. \n\nIndia capped wheat exports. Malaysians capped palm oil exports, though both were weak caps. Yet that\u2019s the trend. Other nations, even Ukraine, have said, \u201cin scarcity, we\u2019ll feed our own people first before we export.\u201d\n\nConsider populace of developing nations (excluding China and India) who do not produce enough food and rely on wheat and corn imports: they are going to have hunger riots. Egypt will likely raise fees for ships passing through Suez Canal to raise money to escalating prices, to buy food imports. What will African nations do? Africa has always been a site of struggle between democracy vs Russian influences, depending on which country donates the most to them. US will donate food we grew ourselves. Russia will donate food it stole from Ukrainian grain silos and confiscated from Ukrainian ships in the Black Sea. \n\nLloyd\u2019s of London plans to stop insuring freighters carrying Russian oil, beginning in September. How is that going to affect Putin\u2019s war efforts? How will Putin retaliate?\n\nWhile it is true that Russia is exporting less oil due to sanctions and more expensive shipping work-arounds, but on the other hand it is also true that Russia is making a lot more money on oil they are selling to India and China, even though selling at 30% discount to what Europe and nations who sanction Russian oil are paying to US and OPEC. \n\nI am asking the same questions you\u2019re asking and am thinking about  positive reinforcing loops, versus negative reinforcing loops in this global economic model. \n\nWhich influential reinforcing loops are strongest? \n\nI am thinking one of the most influential weightings is the US consumer. Of the entire global consumption, if you look for a single most impactful consumer, US consumers consume the most, so I assign US Consumers with the strongest weight in this model.  China\u2019s workforce of producers are also a strong weight. And the producer/consumer dynamics are really interesting. If US pursues isolationism, we can produce and consume what we need. Our laborers are more expensive, so US Consumer prices will be higher in such a scenario, but we have natural resources to do it. China cannot keep growing its economy unless we buy the stuff it produces. China needs oil it gets from Russia but Chine needs to sell its production to US and Europe, mostly China sells to US Consumers. \n\nWhat do US consumers want most right now? Not so much the goods that China produces. US consumers want Services and Experiences. Experiences. Driving, flying. That\u2019s mostly the middle to top income brackets in US. \n\nBut we can\u2019t limp all US Consumers into the \u201cspend-spend-spend- for-fun\u201d category. Because the majority of the US population is not able to go in vacations, those living in multi-person households with household incomes under $50k/yr. \n\nUS Consumers who are starting to use their credit cards more snd more to make ends meet do feel the pinch of higher food and energy prices. It\u2019s the multi-person households making less than $50k/year who feel it most. Heads of households who are working two shifts, two jobs. People who will be first to get laid off in the upcoming slowdowns. \n\nWill the people who are hit the hardest around the world clamor for their governments to DO something to ease the pain? Will that population influence be stronger than the influence of the Defense Contractors?\n\nWhich world will tip the decision scales?\n\nWe want the war over unless we are invested in food and oil and Defense Contractors. And those are the sectors where stock prices are rising. \n\nWhether Powell is weakening Putin by QT is another discussion: look at the global money flow. US banks are loaning money (they don\u2019t have to loan on the Fed banking margin rates \u2014they\u2019re loaning at rates that are whatever the market will bear. \n\nGoldman Sachs just issued a line of credit to Peabody (BTU) at 10%) \u2014lending to fund commodity & commodity domestic & seafaring transportation. The funds flow from US banks to pay for delivery to energy importing countries where the payments are not always in USD, even though loans are repaid yet now the profits  do not come back directly to the US. Fewer buyers of US treasuries. Also, Blackrock (China puts money in Blackrock) is \u201clight on Treasuries\u201d right now. Blackrock (China is big investor) is lending to commodities brokers. \nQT is reducing US bank liquidity. \nFed is rolling back it\u2019s Treasury investments, banks and foreign investors (Russians, OPEC, China)  are not showing up as much any more for Treasury auctions. Nobody wants their US assets seized. So Treasury yields go up to entice investors to Treasury auctions because investment in US Treasuries is down. \nHow is this hurting Putin?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["blk"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.033836621791124344}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3595297634601593}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3720729351043701}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4854230284690857}, {"body": "Demand destruction.\n\nIf ppl lose their jobs and income they don't have places to drive to and can't afford gas.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way, sadly.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11132258921861649}, {"body": "Future expected layoffs will not be affecting  summer vacation plans that people have already made. \n\nPeople are sticking with their vacation plans\nThe layoffs have only started, \nAnd who will be laid off in the future is still uncertain\nBut people feel like now is the time to grab that vacation after two years of being cooped up", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2624780833721161}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3383517861366272}, {"body": "Oil will only come down if legislation is passed at this point.
