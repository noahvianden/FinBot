{"title": "Goldman Sachs says the meme stock revolution is over. U.S. retail investors have sold most of what they bought over the last two years", "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meme-stock-revolution-over-goldman-165449356.html\n\nRetail investors flooded into so-called meme stocks like AMC and GameStop during the pandemic hoping to net quick profits in a market that just seemed to keep on soaring. In 2022, with interest rates climbing and the stock market struggling, it\u2019s a different story. Goldman Sachs analysts, led by David J. Kostin, revealed in a Tuesday research note that retail investors have sold most of their U.S. stock purchases from the last two years. And over the last seven weeks alone, $26 billion has flowed out of U.S. equity ETFs and mutual funds, which are often traded by retail investors. Rising stock prices, stimulus checks, and near-zero interest rates led investors to rush into the stock market like never before during the pandemic. In fact, U.S. investors sank more than $1 trillion into stocks in 2021 alone, the Financial Times reported in December. That\u2019s more than the prior 20 years combined, and three times more than the previous annual record. On top of that, the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of investing due to the expansion of low-cost trading applications like Robinhood, and the birth of large online communities of traders on forums like Reddit\u2019s r/wallstreetbets, spawned a meme stock revolution in 2021.\n\nMeme stocks are equities that gain a cultlike following on social media platforms. Typically, these stocks are targeted by retail traders due to their high short interest, which means that a large number of short-sellers\u2014traders who bet a stock\u2019s price will fall by borrowing shares and then selling them at market price hoping to buy the shares back at a later date for less\u2014have shorted the stock, making it susceptible to something called a short-squeeze. A short-squeeze happens when short-sellers are forced to buy shares (i.e., cover their shorts) in order to exit their positions as a stock rises, pushing the stock even higher. The meme stock era propelled the share prices of formerly unloved, and mostly unprofitable, names like GameStop to new heights in the first few months of 2021. The video game retailer eventually saw its shares jump over 2000% to a short-lived record high of $483 by Jan. 28. Leading up to that record, the number of unique accounts trading GameStop on a given day increased from fewer than 10,000 at the beginning of the year to nearly 900,000 by the end of January, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission report.\n\nNow, though, with a slew of macroeconomic headwinds from the war in Ukraine to sky-high inflation hurting stock market returns, the retail crowd has all but abandoned its meme stock heroes. Shares of GameStop are down over 50% in the past year to around $120, and AMC has fared even worse, with shares plummeting nearly 60% to $13 over the same period. Goldman Sachs says the rise of retail investors and the meme stock movement was largely a result of a narrative they call TINA, or \u201cthere is no alternative.\u201d The idea is that because interest rates were so low, savings accounts, government bonds, and other interest-rate-sensitive investing alternatives just didn\u2019t pay enough to be worthy of investment by the retail crowd. As a result, there was record investment into risk assets like tech stocks, meme stocks, and cryptocurrencies as investors hunted for stronger returns. \u201cSince 2020, fiscal stimulus, near-zero interest rates, and record-high equity allocations supported TINA \u2026 But investors are now facing rising interest rates and recession concerns,\u201d the analysts wrote, adding that there has been a sharp reversal of the TINA trend over the past few months. It\u2019s now the age of TARA, or \u201cthere are reasonable alternatives,\u201d Goldman says, and that\u2019s reversing households\u2019 aggressive stock purchases, which have significantly contributed to the recent stock market selloff.", "id": "v42x8z", "created_utc": 1654272986.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "Can\u2019t get retail to sell, so just lie and say they all already sold XD", "score": 123, "replies": [{"body": "I didn\u2019t sell", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4671005308628082}, {"body": "Is trading volume zero?

Then Ryan Cohen entrred the picture, became one of the largest investors in the company, became chairman of the board and threw out the old execs and hired new ones. Now suddenly gamestop begins transformation into a modern e-commerce business with modern social media marketing and a not so grim future outlook. \n\nThis is REALLY REALLY and I cannot stress this enough REALLY bad for the aforementioned financial organisations who have spent years profiting off of (and consistently growing) their short positions against gamestop. Essentially their short positions against these cellar boxxed tickers are usually multiple times larger than the total number of shares that actually exist, by use of loopholes in market law, short positions against ETFs containing the symbol and a very toothless and complicit SEC. \n\nThis means the price per share going up has a huge negative impact on their portfolio, which is how a company like Melvin Capital (a small fry hedge fund in the grand scheme of things) had to close down after reporting losses in excess of four billion dollars, reported by them as being a result of their short position on Gamestop, a company with a market cap less than half that four billion number AFTER the January 2021 craze. Melvin lost more money than gamestop is worth. \n\nNow gamestop has used this investment boom around their stock as an opportunity: they've paid off all debt and are launching new services and building vast amounts of infrastructure to aid in their strengths as an e-commerce business. This means that the aforementioned financial organisations (the ones still alive) are REALLY hurting, and despite entering into these 'sure bet' short strategies with fairly low interest rates... There's STILL interest, and the cost of administration with maintaining and continuing to grow these positions in a opaque and technically legal way. As there is no conceivable way for them to actually close the short position and stay afloat (see:Melvin capital) the only real choice is to short the ticker more, hopefully creating enough sell pressure to bring the price back down to the sub-$10 it was in 2020. \n\nBut that's not happening. The price fluctuates for sure but it's not going down that far. Closing a short position, even now would solidify tens of thousands of percentage loss, also creating a huge amount of buying pressure which would raise the price higher, creating a positive feedback loop (which we saw just a taste of  first hand in 2021) and that is enough to destroy even the most affluent and hearty of financial organisations.\n\nSo to answer your question: holding and refusing to sell shares in certain companies can indeed put a significant hurt on 'the man' and when 'the man' holds 99% of the world's wealth, yes: you get to watch the world burn", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Nice fanfiction", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Which part is fiction?
