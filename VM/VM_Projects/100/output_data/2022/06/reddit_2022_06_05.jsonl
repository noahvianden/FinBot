They are a no risk investment with a high interest return. I'm surprised that I didn't find out about these sooner. With the stock market fluctuating or even having a downturn and with inflation and even cryptocurrencies having taken a dive, I Bonds are a wonderful opportunity. \n\nThe Treasury Department says the following about I Bonds.\n\n\"I Bonds can be purchased through October 2022 at the current rate.  That rate is applied to the 6 months after the purchase is made.  For example, if you buy an I bond on July 1, 2022, the 9.62% would be applied through December 31, 2022.  Interest is compounded semi-annually.\n\nA Series I savings bond is a security that earns interest based on both a fixed rate and a rate that is set twice a year based on inflation. The bond earns interest until it reaches 30 years or you cash it, whichever comes first.\n\nFor the first six months you own it, the Series I bond we sell from May 2022 through October 2022 earns interest at an annual rate of 9.62 percent. A new rate will be set every six months based on this bond's fixed rate (0.00 percent) and on inflation.\n\nIn a calendar year, you can acquire:\n\nup to $10,000 in electronic I bonds in TreasuryDirect\n\nup to $5,000 in paper I bonds using your federal income tax refund\n\nThe limits apply separately, meaning you could acquire up to $15,000 in I bonds in a calendar year\"\n\nRead about them at: [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res\\_ibonds\\_ibuy.htm](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_ibuy.htm)\n\nThis is my new best advice for investors under the current circumstances.", "id": "v5e3p7", "created_utc": 1654438125.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 77, "replies": [{"body": "If the government gets to the point that it can't  pay the dividends on our bonds, we have much more important things to worry about than the risk of our bonds.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "So you\u2019re saying there\u2019s a chance!\n\n-Lloyd Christmas", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Actually, much more than a chance.

Thanks to u/Ok-Researcher-120 u/throwawayyeetyyeet for the comments. Although it didn't feel like I was at WSB with that quality advice...\n\nI also listened to u/arpatel530 and sold some OTM covered calls during earnings when the premium spiked. Thanks to IV crush, I made a very nice return selling those calls and just bought more shares. But now the premium isn't worth getting called away at the moment. Especially with the 3-4% volatility we can see in one day. I can easily see a scenario where INTC goes up 15% in a week. The premium on options that OTM isn't worth the effort. So I don't think the risk of covered calls (missing out on higher upside above my strike) are currently worth it as I don't want to be stepping over dollars by chasing pennies.\n\nMy thesis on my INTC investment has not changed in the past 8 weeks (as I said in my last post):  \"I am long due to the good fundamentals of INTC (very cheap PE, low debt, high revenue, large market share, great moat, decent profit margins). I am optimistic of their new leadership and the overall market. I believe that the negative sentiment against the company and semiconductor market is too much and is creating a good entry point for a long term play in this very profitable company. I think they can pay for their extensive and expensive upcoming CAPEX (building new fabs) out of free cash flow and spin offs with minimum new debt. I also get a decent 3+% dividend while I wait. The company, in my opinion, has a very limited downside (I don't think it can break below $40-44) and a 3-4x upside ($140-185) by 2025.  If INTC multiple expands to anywhere near TSMC, it wil be a nice increase in share price for INTC. TSMC's PE is 2.5x INTC. Many fab-less players (AMD, NVDA) will diversify their manufacturing for competitive pricing and lower their geopolitical risks (great for INTC). These fabless chip designers (NVDA, AMD, Apple, Google, AMZN, etc) only have TSMC, INTC, and Samsung to choose from. ASML is the king maker in this market and INTC will get ASML latest litho machines for their sub 20A chips in the upcoming years (1H 2024). This will allow INTC to be the most advanced chip designer once again.\"\n\nI got down voted a lot by AMD investors, but don't know why they can't understand this isn't exactly a zero sum game. The entire industry is expanding and most chip companies can also grow. Just like you can have multiple car companies (Tesla, Ford, GM, VW, TM), you can have multiple chip companies. Although I think AMD is priced for perfection and INTC is currently priced for worst case scenario. Furthermore, INTC also manufactures chips and I can see a future where AMD contracts work to INTC. AMD doesn't own fabs, so they can have a mutually beneficial relationship. But all the hate against INTC is good for those of us that want to pick up on a company that has bad sentiment but decent books and long-term projections. Ultimately, I feel this is a safe place to park money for 3-5 years (INTC only has a beta of 0.60), and in my opinion, limited down side (-20%) and great upside (400%).\n\nI also get to collect more than $16.2k/year (3.2% at $1.46 share) in dividends from this investment while I wait to see what Pat can do. I already got my first dividend payment of almost $4k this week and bought more shares.\n\nI was down $15k 8 weeks ago. Since then, I was down over $100k around the end of May when INTC hit its all time low of $40.31. I was down massively due to some ill-timed LEAP options that I bought trying to time the bottom. I was at least degen enough to buy some even more FD options and caught the mean reversion and gained on the upside. I didn't hold the FD options long to be greedy and sold as soon as I was able to get a little higher share count than I previously held. I am now down $36k, but that is only 7% and in this market, I am happy with that. Hell, with the 3% daily moves, I can be back to my cost basis in around 2 days.\n\nI am now at 11,041 shares of INTC with no INTC options in this account.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

It usually goes up for a few days after the large earnings drop, but then breaks through the low. \n\nBut I had a set of criteria and I try to remove emotion.

Mostly stock with more than 12k shares and selling some weekly puts as we bounce around 35. Well see if that works out next week if the decline breaks through 35. It might be look out below if it breaks 35 as I am not sure where the next support is, probably around book value of 25-28. I really have a hard time thinking it will get that low, but I also didn't think it would get to 35.\n\nIn the week I have been out of INTC, I made a nice profit day trading Citigroup options, mostly luck as the price stayed the same for the week, but I was able to buy in the mornings when C crashed about 30 minutes after open and sell in the afternoon almost every day. I still like C and am keeping a position in them with other funds.\n\nRegarding INTC, I did a little more research and dived into their 10Q and once the emotion impulse wore off from the terrible earnings, I decided that I should continue to stay invested. I'm partially thinking Intel sandbagged their earnings due to them at the same time asking for billions in tax payer money. I think they might have pushed some profits into next quarter while recording expenses early. Make no mistake, the quarter still sucked. But Pat said this was the bottom, so I have decided to stick it out a little longer to see if it is, or if he makes another excuse. If next quarter doesn't improve and he lied about this being the bottom for his earnings, then I am out. But I will give him credit of pushing through the CHIPS act. Very impressive in this Congress and lots of money to mostly INTC. So that is definitely a win and I will excuse him if he neglected the company while he was getting congress to give us some tax payer billions. One thing that gives me confidence is that even with the macro stuff, the balance sheet of INTC is really phenomenal. Almost irrelevant debt, decent cash position, and decent cash flow (ignoring some one time charge offs). They have doubled book value per shared in the past 7 years. Even this past 12 months, they have significantly increased it. This has caused an all time low on the book value/share price ratio. I am still really concerned about the decline in revenues, and the really bad rumors of them potentially canceling or delaying a lot of chips (eg Arc). But I will still take Pat at his word where he said that all the other nodes are on schedule or ahead of schedule.
