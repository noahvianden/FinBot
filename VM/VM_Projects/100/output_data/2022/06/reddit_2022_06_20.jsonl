Obviously no one wants to catch a falling knife, however, the fomo is real.   \nIf I zoom out a little bit, the growth case for TSLA is still very much far from peak and the current macroeconomic/ environmental policy conditions are still unrealized catalysts to be priced in. (Ie, the recent decision of the EU body to ban the production of cars that run on fossil fuel from 2030 onwards). \n\nWhat do you folks think? If I'm long on TSLA is this a good time to start DCAing or should I seat on it for a couple more months?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jknj4qgdos691.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=202dc5d080464f12a19d968f67c459f06fcb8e1e", "id": "vgo4id", "created_utc": 1655738974.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|14 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vgo4id)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vgo4id)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06353335082530975}, {"body": "On WSB, if you're at least 10% sure your thesis is correct then it's yolo time (it's a rule that I totally didn't make up and stuff).

{"title": "u/hoopmbb6279 asked me to post my positions and prove that my account is up about 50% in the last few weeks from $26k to $40k", "selftext": "In another post someone commented that everyone is losing money right now. I claimed that I was up around 50% in the last few weeks. u/hoopmbb6279 joked that making $0.50 on your last $1 isn't that hard. I responded that I've gone from about $26k to about $40k, and he asked me to prove it. So here we are.\n\nFirst of all, it turns out I was slightly wrong. I thought I had gone from $32k to $26k (IRA contribution) then up to $40k, which is where I got the +50% number. It turns out I went from $32k to $35k on some calls, then IRA contribution down to $29k, then up to $40k. So, similar but different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Here's the current value of the account](https://preview.redd.it/07xeih2bns691.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=bae985cdb034aa90fbbd2071cf96d4b3b05cb419)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[And here's the chart over the past month](https://preview.redd.it/z4pashgins691.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa9af36117539630810a634810d5e3c1a11e8606)\n\nSo you can see, the account had basically nothing it in, about $300. Lucky for me, my wife's boyfriend gave me my allowance for the year all up front so I stuck the $32k in this account. I made a little money at the end of May, made my IRA contribution a week later, and then have made about $11k in the last two weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p5zk8jcps691.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=5104d72c38732a62b53796d7387a1374c6f5b3eb\n\n[First thing I did was buy $ULTA call ahead of earnings.
