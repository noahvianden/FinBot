If I'm long on TSLA is this a good time to start DCAing or should I seat on it for a couple more months?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jknj4qgdos691.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=202dc5d080464f12a19d968f67c459f06fcb8e1e", "id": "vgo4id", "created_utc": 1655738974.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|14 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vgo4id)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vgo4id)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06353335082530975}, {"body": "On WSB, if you're at least 10% sure your thesis is correct then it's yolo time (it's a rule that I totally didn't make up and stuff).

{"title": "u/hoopmbb6279 asked me to post my positions and prove that my account is up about 50% in the last few weeks from $26k to $40k", "selftext": "In another post someone commented that everyone is losing money right now. I claimed that I was up around 50% in the last few weeks. u/hoopmbb6279 joked that making $0.50 on your last $1 isn't that hard. I responded that I've gone from about $26k to about $40k, and he asked me to prove it. So here we are.\n\nFirst of all, it turns out I was slightly wrong. I thought I had gone from $32k to $26k (IRA contribution) then up to $40k, which is where I got the +50% number. It turns out I went from $32k to $35k on some calls, then IRA contribution down to $29k, then up to $40k. So, similar but different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Here's the current value of the account](https://preview.redd.it/07xeih2bns691.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=bae985cdb034aa90fbbd2071cf96d4b3b05cb419)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[And here's the chart over the past month](https://preview.redd.it/z4pashgins691.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa9af36117539630810a634810d5e3c1a11e8606)\n\nSo you can see, the account had basically nothing it in, about $300. Lucky for me, my wife's boyfriend gave me my allowance for the year all up front so I stuck the $32k in this account. I made a little money at the end of May, made my IRA contribution a week later, and then have made about $11k in the last two weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p5zk8jcps691.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=5104d72c38732a62b53796d7387a1374c6f5b3eb\n\n[First thing I did was buy $ULTA call ahead of earnings.

I noticed something, on its face, that doesn't make sense to me - **As you increase DTE, holding delta constant, your annualized percent premium return (% of notional value received as premium, annualized) goes down (see table below).**\n\nI know, roughly, Delta approximates chance of being ITM at expiration. So I would've thought that for a 30% risk of being ITM at expiration (regardless of DTE), you could expect to be equally compensated across time. Obviously, theta decay is non-linear (mostly for ATM strikes - more linear OTM) so you'd expect a much larger percent of extrinsic value to fall out in the days closest to expiration - thereby accelerating returns.\n\nI guess my question is - WHY? I haven't found a good explanation of why theta decay is non-linear. Is it because longer DTE allows for more time for underlying to bounce around, so less \"risky?\" Does that mean Delta as a prob%ITM metric is less accurate closer to expiration?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|6/24/22|||||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPY=387.31|||||||\n|PUT EXP|7/1|7/8|7/15|7/22|7/29|8/5|\n|DTE|7|14|21|28|35|42|\n|Strike|380|378|375|374|372|371|\n|Delta|\\-.294|\\-.304|\\-.295|\\-.304|\\-.3|\\-.302|\n|Gamma|.024|.018|.014|.012|.011|.01|\n|Theta|\\-.304|\\-.225|\\-.194|\\-.171|\\-.157|\\-.143|\n|Vega|.198|.274|.328|.381|.423|.463|\n|IV|24.632|24.572|25.998|26.048|26.757|26.665|\n|Premium|2.67|3.835|4.76|5.725|6.495|7.17|\n|Notional Val|38000|37800|37500|37400|37200|37100|\n|Trade Premium|267|383.5|476|572.5|649.5|717|\n|Trade%|.7%|1.01%|1.27%|1.53%|1.75%|1.93%|\n|Annualized%|36.64%|26.45%|22.06%|19.95%|18.21%|16.80%|", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "As someone who trades the wheel, I don't think it is best for \"optimized\" returns.

What in the Black-Scholes model accounts for this? Or is it that markets are fickle, and longer-term, you have a better chance of being able to recover - so the markets price this in across DTE?

Still I wonder if there is a kind of order that would do what I have in mind. I have googled and read the section on stop loss orders in the FAQ here, but I can't find the answer.\n\nImagine you have an option worth 2. You want to sell it for 6 or more if the option continues to rise. So with an increase to 6.50 and then drops to 5.50, it would be sold at 6, sticking to the limit. And if the price goes to 7.50 and then falls back to 6, then it will be sold at 6.50, following the trail. The idea behind it is that if the price reaches the limit, you have the guarantee that the reward is 3:1, while you still have the potential upward.\r  \n\r  \nA *limit order* is not a possibility, because it does not follow the rise in price above 6. If you set it to 6, the sell order will be executed when the price reaches 6. The potential upward is lost.\r  \n\r  \nA *trail order* is also not a possibility, because you cannot set it up in such a way that the sell order is executed from 6. If you set a trail of 4 so that it follows the price to 6 and follows the price from there, the trail will also follow the price down and the order will be executed for at least 2. And if you set the stop at 6, the order will probably be immediately executed after creating the order, because the current price is below the stop.\r  \n\r  \nI don't think a *trail limit order* will do either. You can set the limit to 6, but the order will not be executed if the stop is not hit. And just like with the trail order, I don't think you can place the stop above the current price because it would be executed immediately.\n\nIs there any order that will do what I would like?\n\nI'm with \rInteractive Brokers.\n\nThanks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Short answer: No, and as you already noted, even if you could the volume on option trades is often too low for stops to work effectively, however ...\n\nLong answer: If you still insist on trying, you could get close with *two* orders in an OCO contingency.\n\nDo some reading on [One Cancels the Other](https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/tws/usersguidebook/ordertypes/ocotws.htm) orders on IBKR. I'll assume you have already done that.\n\nOrder A: stop-limit STC with the stop set at $6.00 and the limit set at something lower, like $1.00, to catch a gap down below $6.00.\n\nOrder B: Trailing stop limit with the stop set at least one increment above the other stop, so like $6.05, but it could also be higher. Set the trailing limit at whatever interval you want to sell at. Could be $.05, could be $.50, could be 10%, up to you.\n\nIn almost every case, Order B will trigger first, canceling A. But A is your backstop. If for whatever reason, the price makes a huge gap down that skips over the trailing stop, order A will save the day. \n\nOrder A can't guarantee an absolute floor of $6.00 (nothing can, apart from buying a put at $6.00), but it will get as close as it can. For example, if B is $6.05 stop with $.50 trailing limit, and the stock worked it's way up to $7.50 without triggering either order, but then gapped open at $5.90, Order B's limit will be stuck at $7.00 and won't fill, but Order A with a $1.00 limit will fill at $5.90.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

The payouts and amount at risk might be the same, but the movement in the underlying will affect these trades differently. Also the greeks are different. The wider spread more closely approximates a naked put than the narrow spread. Time decay will be slowed down by the long put being so close to the short put in the narrow spread. Also, you'll have much more conservative overall delta (closer to 0) for the narrow spread vs the wide spread. All in all, the narrower spread won't change in price as quickly as the wider spread (could be good or bad, depending on how the underlying moves).\n\nMaybe most importantly, you have to think about breakeven and probability of max loss. Your narrow spreads have a breakeven of 370.67, and the wide spread has a breakeven of 367.03. Ultimately this affects your probability of profit, but also contributes to where you will have a max loss. The long leg determines the point at which you suffer max loss - so that would be 370 for the narrow spread and 361 for the wide spread. So you in essence have a \"riskier\" trade for the narrow spread - higher prob of max loss, higher breakeven. And you're being compensated more to do it - $330 for narrow vs $210 for the wide. The P&L diagram is near vertical for the narrow spread, but more gradual for the wide spread. \n\nLastly, there may be a drag with commissions if you pay by the contract - you may have 10x commissions trading 10 contracts on the narrow spread vs the 1 contract on the wide spread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the info!

A market order means **fill my order at any price ASAP**. Actually, it is at whatever price is the best offer on the order book at the time the order is on deck to be filled. But since the best offer can change from millisecond to millisecond, you are taking a chance that it will not be a price you will like.\n\nConsider a shallow order book that only has 10 contracts at .43 bid at the top of the book. The next order down is 1 contract for .10. Since you are only trading 1 contract you think your market order is fine, but what if an order for 10 contract slips in ahead of yours? Now the top of the book is the .10 bid and that's what your market order will fill at.\n\n>I notice on some weeks certain strike prices are completely unavailable. Does that mean that the market makers aren't liquid enough on that particular week to have that particular strike price?\n\nNo, it just means the stock price has not moved through that level since the expiration was offered. The further strikes are from ATM, the bigger gaps you will find. Near ATM are popular strikes and exchanges will add additional strikes closer together near ATM to provide more contracts in the popular zone. So the big gaps are actually the normal interval for strikes. The strikes that are closer together were added later. Usually. It doesn't always work the way I described. Sometimes it can be kind of random, like when GME broke above $80 for the first time, when the highest strike at the time was $50.

Price action may have nothing to do with it. What you see in the order book is only what people have *publicly* bid in the auction (mostly market makers, but could be some organic traders). There are also bidders off stage with eyes glued to the order book looking for a price they will trade at. They enter an order *only when* a matching offer is on deck. Since this happens in milliseconds, it's usually a computer that is doing the searching and entering the orders in a flash.\n\nTechnically, the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp) would have been adjusted to meet that .50 bid, but the order would have instantly been disposed of in a fraction of a second, so you don't see the quoted bid change, it stays at .43.
