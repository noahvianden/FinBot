Tesla depreciation is so low, that you should have a much better outlook under your assumptions.\n\nfor example, a 5 years M3LR will  depreciate 15k$ (for me this is very high considering current market conditions), the car has 50k miles ( 10k/year is about standard in the US). You did not spend any money for gas or public transportation , and  at 25 mls/gal you have a about 13 k$ saving, leaving you with a cost of service for 50k miles of only 2k$ or 0.04 $/mile or 400$/year for 10k miles.\n\nNot even public transportation can compete with this. But I think the point you were trying to make is that we have a capital of 60 k$ locked into a car/investment and not everybody has the initial capital to afford such investment.\n\nThis is a very legitimate point, and is the reasoning behind  many economists and companies are thinking that the future is transportation as a service (TAS) in which corporation invest the capital in the fleet and get the return from the difference between the cost per mile and the price per mile they charge users.\n\nAs you can see, the math is intriguing for the TAS model, with prices around 0.15 to 0.25 $/mile  the cost for using a TAS is about 2.5 k/year for 10k miles of service that is less or equal to average cost of financing current purchase or lease of new cars.\n\nOf course, this becomes really applicable only with Full Self Driving - aka robo-taxi. If Tesla pulls that  out of its hat, the revenue for TAS has the potential to be simply insane, hence a stock valuation with crazy multipliers.\n\njust to give an idea, a 1M miles robo taxi will produce revenues between 150k and 250 k  over 10 years of operation or 15-25-k per year.  With FSD, a tesla uses about 34 MWh for 100k miles  and considering an average 0.15 $/kWh the cost of operation is about 5.1 k$/year. Adding another 2.4 k$/year of maintenance/operation cost  (probably too much) we have 7.5 k$/year cost. Adding also pro-rate for the initial investment in the car of 5k/year (50 k robo taxi - again very high price)  we are at 12.5 k$/year or between 25%-50% gross margins per year!!!\n\nIt is very likely that, under better deployment conditions, the gross margins may be north of 100% of the investment per year!!!!!", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Really?

I can't see it getting much better in the short term. Combine that with the PFOF (Payment For Order Flow) ban, and you might be asking why anyone would buy this stock.\n\nRobinhood doesn't have any debt. Check the [balance sheet](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Robinhood-Exhibit-99.1_3.31.22_FINAL.pdf), it's pristine. They have a book value (total assets - total liabilities) around $8.22 per share according to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&ty=c&ta=1&p=m), I checked it and got $8.40 but I might've gotten the number of shares incorrect. It's currently trading around $7.20 a share after hours, meaning that if the company gets liquidated, that's the value returned to shareholders. \n\nNot only that, but Robinhood has $6.19B in cash on hand as of their last earnings report, but is trading at a market cap of $6.15B. I bought some shares today, meaning I am straight up buying cash for less than it's worth. If someone told you that you could buy a $20 bill for $19.95, you'd take that deal as many times as you could get it.\n\nMarket fear over banning of PFOF, retail trading dying out, and a general market hatred for the boy from Bulgaria who runs it have created this insane opportunity for a short squeeze.\n\nAccording to [fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood), HOOD currently has a short interest of 11.28%. FTX [recently](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-ftx-ceo-reveals-stake-trading-app-robinhood-2022-05-12/) bought up 7.6% of their float. This means there are less shares being traded, a low float is key for a squeeze.\n\nMy thesis is that it will just take one piece of positive news regarding a potential buyout or hedge fund purchase, which is very likely at these levels, to cause a big short covering rally in the stock.
