So what does this mean? If the market in 2030 really is 100m vehicles per year, that either means a massive amount of it is not gonna be EVs or that the average EV price will have to come down a lot - and naturally there will be more competition as more companies adapt. Both of which likely means margin compression for TSLA at some point.\n\nAnd no, you don't have to compare EV to EV when talking about a company playing in the luxury space or not. There are Ford models you can get for 15k-20k, there are VW models you can get for like 13k. And then there are obviously several smaller brands playing in the lower price segment, whereas brands like VW and Ford traditionally play in all segments with focus on middle class and some exposure to upper class luxury. Tesla is exclusively that with the cheapest model being what, 45k? And the range goes up to 150k if I'm not mistaken.

That's gonna take money out of bank reserves, which is designed to slow the expansion of lending, but the Fed's intentionally not taking all of the capital out of the system, and they're not taking it out of the market for the most part. \n\n80% of the market is institution money, and they flex leverage based on the prospects of going long. What we've seen this year is not a reduction of addressable liquidity, but rather a deleveraging due to fear and because profit calculations suggest equities may not pay as much while rates are rising. So they reduce exposure to compensate... but it's not because they don't or won't have the money, and eventually to report back to investors, they have to find that money a home.\n\nSo they short, but short positions accumulate as hedges against an underlying long position. But instead of thinking of the market as a rational actor (it isn't) what you need to do is think about it as clouds of buying and selling pressure. \n\nWhat's happened is that the market found a significant amount of buying pressure in the roughly 3900 S&P 500 range, and that built up buying power that previously existed in the 4100 range, which is what's impacting us this week. As the market goes up, short positions have to cover in order to hedge against losses in their hedges, and that amplifies the buying creating a volatile and violent bear market rally.\n\nVolume has dropped this year, but if you look at On Balance Volume charts, what you find is that we're starting to see a softening of the declining trend of volume, which indicates the market has found a short term bottom. Note: I'm not saying the market has found a bottom, just that recent investor behavior reflects a short term period of buying pressure, allowing for a run up.\n\nAnd the institutions have the money to feed these rallies.\n\nForget all of the stuff people say about there having to be a big capitulation crash here or there being a reversion to pre-COVID index numbers or anything like that... those are all just qualitative rules people use to decide when to buy in, and corrections and crashes in the past don't all have those features, and markets often revert to the mean but the flaw in this thinking here is that the indexes have already reshuffled, and the capital still exists in the market to keep valuations up higher than pre-COVID levels, so while it may be possible for them to revert down to that level, it's not at all required or guaranteed like people suggest.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for a big flashing sign saying \"now is the right time to buy\" you're not going to find one. There isn't going to be a clear moment... and if there were, institutions would lose their shirts. \n\nOne of the functions of these rallies is to shake out puts, as the market heading in one direction becomes a cost for market makers who make money in part from dealing expiring options. If the market only heads in the trend direction, then puts become ultra-profitable and they become overweighted in the market and that results in losses for market makers who are often holding large long positions. \n\nThe market makes a lot more sense if you start thinking about it as a profit engine for institutions.

All these TA charts that people are posting making a case for a crash is useless. As long as that debt market is stable a rebound from any correction (which is what we had, never entered a bear market) is possible. The US 10 Year Treasury  DROPPED during this time to below 3%. If it was rising sharply that would signal concern to a crash. I beleive even if we go above 3% (which we should) we will still be fine because the Fed is raising their rates but the balance sheet is still $9 trillion. And I don't buy all the Quantitative Tightening talk because crisis' keep popping up and the answer is to always throw money at it which we don't have (have to keep borrowing). So with the debt market stable what you are witnessing (IMO) was the market pricing in the rate hikes coupled with panic selling. But since the debt market is stable along with no black swan events happening the market can continue to rebound which again we are currently witnessing. Pay attention to the pull backs. Don't panic when there is a pull back or correction. These are normal which people aren't used to because on 2020-2021 stocks only went up. But if we pull back BUT DON'T GIVE AWAY ALL GAINS, the US 10 Year Treasury stays stable, and no black swan events I see us continuing to rebound and potentially hitting higher highs. But not so much in the high growth stocks that people tend to focus on. When it comes to tech, I'm talking about big tech such as Apple as you stated.
