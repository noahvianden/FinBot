So what does this mean? If the market in 2030 really is 100m vehicles per year, that either means a massive amount of it is not gonna be EVs or that the average EV price will have to come down a lot - and naturally there will be more competition as more companies adapt. Both of which likely means margin compression for TSLA at some point.\n\nAnd no, you don't have to compare EV to EV when talking about a company playing in the luxury space or not. There are Ford models you can get for 15k-20k, there are VW models you can get for like 13k. And then there are obviously several smaller brands playing in the lower price segment, whereas brands like VW and Ford traditionally play in all segments with focus on middle class and some exposure to upper class luxury. Tesla is exclusively that with the cheapest model being what, 45k? And the range goes up to 150k if I'm not mistaken.

That's gonna take money out of bank reserves, which is designed to slow the expansion of lending, but the Fed's intentionally not taking all of the capital out of the system, and they're not taking it out of the market for the most part. \n\n80% of the market is institution money, and they flex leverage based on the prospects of going long. What we've seen this year is not a reduction of addressable liquidity, but rather a deleveraging due to fear and because profit calculations suggest equities may not pay as much while rates are rising. So they reduce exposure to compensate... but it's not because they don't or won't have the money, and eventually to report back to investors, they have to find that money a home.\n\nSo they short, but short positions accumulate as hedges against an underlying long position. But instead of thinking of the market as a rational actor (it isn't) what you need to do is think about it as clouds of buying and selling pressure. \n\nWhat's happened is that the market found a significant amount of buying pressure in the roughly 3900 S&P 500 range, and that built up buying power that previously existed in the 4100 range, which is what's impacting us this week. As the market goes up, short positions have to cover in order to hedge against losses in their hedges, and that amplifies the buying creating a volatile and violent bear market rally.\n\nVolume has dropped this year, but if you look at On Balance Volume charts, what you find is that we're starting to see a softening of the declining trend of volume, which indicates the market has found a short term bottom. Note: I'm not saying the market has found a bottom, just that recent investor behavior reflects a short term period of buying pressure, allowing for a run up.\n\nAnd the institutions have the money to feed these rallies.\n\nForget all of the stuff people say about there having to be a big capitulation crash here or there being a reversion to pre-COVID index numbers or anything like that... those are all just qualitative rules people use to decide when to buy in, and corrections and crashes in the past don't all have those features, and markets often revert to the mean but the flaw in this thinking here is that the indexes have already reshuffled, and the capital still exists in the market to keep valuations up higher than pre-COVID levels, so while it may be possible for them to revert down to that level, it's not at all required or guaranteed like people suggest.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for a big flashing sign saying \"now is the right time to buy\" you're not going to find one. There isn't going to be a clear moment... and if there were, institutions would lose their shirts. \n\nOne of the functions of these rallies is to shake out puts, as the market heading in one direction becomes a cost for market makers who make money in part from dealing expiring options. If the market only heads in the trend direction, then puts become ultra-profitable and they become overweighted in the market and that results in losses for market makers who are often holding large long positions. \n\nThe market makes a lot more sense if you start thinking about it as a profit engine for institutions.

All these TA charts that people are posting making a case for a crash is useless. As long as that debt market is stable a rebound from any correction (which is what we had, never entered a bear market) is possible. The US 10 Year Treasury  DROPPED during this time to below 3%. If it was rising sharply that would signal concern to a crash. I beleive even if we go above 3% (which we should) we will still be fine because the Fed is raising their rates but the balance sheet is still $9 trillion. And I don't buy all the Quantitative Tightening talk because crisis' keep popping up and the answer is to always throw money at it which we don't have (have to keep borrowing). So with the debt market stable what you are witnessing (IMO) was the market pricing in the rate hikes coupled with panic selling. But since the debt market is stable along with no black swan events happening the market can continue to rebound which again we are currently witnessing. Pay attention to the pull backs. Don't panic when there is a pull back or correction. These are normal which people aren't used to because on 2020-2021 stocks only went up. But if we pull back BUT DON'T GIVE AWAY ALL GAINS, the US 10 Year Treasury stays stable, and no black swan events I see us continuing to rebound and potentially hitting higher highs. But not so much in the high growth stocks that people tend to focus on. When it comes to tech, I'm talking about big tech such as Apple as you stated.

Rising prices are always caused by substantial increases in units of currency, the money supply.\r  \nCommodities are a very clear example. In 2022, investors have been purchasing commodity-related products to protect themselves from inflation and generate real returns. However, rising commodity prices are not a cause, they are a consequence of excessive money printing. With increased inflationary concerns, the likelihood of rising interest rates, and elevated geopolitical concerns, commodity-focused funds have seen record inflows in 2022.\r  \nThis happened at the same time as central banks injected unprecedented quantities of money into the economy. Between 2020 and 2021, the balance sheets of the major central banks rose by more than $10 trillion. Furthermore, broad money supply (M3) growth rose at an astronomical rate in 2020 and 2021 in the major economies.\r  \nOil and gas prices will be used as the scapegoat for inflation, as long central banks keep interest rates low, and continue to print massive amounts of currency. But the reality is that sharp increases in money supply actually causes commodity prices to increase, because this excessive money printing debases the currency, making it worth less.\r  \nNow the increase in broad money supply has finally translated to an explosion in all prices. Some will blame wages, others will blame the Ukraine war, and others will blame high demand due to economic recovery. The fact is that currency debasement is at the heart of generalized price rises everywhere. Rising prices are the consequences of inflation, not the cause.\r  \n\r  \n**Milton Friedman - Only Government Creates Inflation**\r  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F94jGTWNWsA", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Enough with the meth or Adderall.

With my improvements I will have a good profit next year \n- or the property will continue to grow in value beating inflation and I make more profit\n- if it does crash, I will hold for 5 years get my 4% + probably get it all back as the price goes up again", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "It could very well pan out for you, but I think best case scenario for you at this point (no crash) is we\u2019re almost guaranteed to see rates rise another 2 points which will drop value roughly 20k, you\u2019ll have to pay a realtor when you sell (5% = 18k) and then add the cost of your improvements. You basically need 30-50k in appreciation to break even. Of course, you could FSBO and you control what you spend on improvements so you have some control over this number. \n\nIf a crash happens and it drops 100k and you can rent for $1500/mo (hope u can get more than that for a 400k house!) I think it would take more like 7-8 years to break even.\n\nMy biggest fear would be opportunity cost. It would suck to have a housing crash while watching the stock market go on a tear and having that much money tied up. Obviously things could go the opposite way too.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m selling RE at the moment because I think we\u2019ve peaked and am hoping to buy back in cheaper and to reclaim some of that principle tenants have been paying down over the years. \n\nI don\u2019t know the future though, just my 2 cents.

The differentiation will come in the form of their supercharger network, FSD, and software advantages. \n\nFord plans to release the F150 lightning and there is a reason why they are hastily doing so. They are known for pickup trucks. The issue is pickup trucks will require more batteries than a standard range vehicle. IMO, Ford will be losing money on their EV's for at least 3-4 years. It's the same with Rivian. HUGE losses. What Ford has going for them is the infrastructure in place to continue their profitable ICE margins. But make no mistake about it, until they can make a profit on their EV's, the more they produce, the more it will hurt their financials. How much of that people are willing to accept is another discussion. Every Tesla vehicle Tesla manufactures is profitable.

It's possible that Ford can take market share based on raw numbers but Tesla still grows.\n\nIf the market for EV's is 1 million vehicle sales per year and Tesla sells 800k and Ford sells 200k, that's 80/20%.\n\nIf the market for EV's grows to 2 million vehicle sales per year and Tesla sells 1.6 million and Ford sells 400k, that's still 80/20.\n\nBoth are growing but the issue is one becomes more profitable while the other is still losing a shit ton of money. How much longer can Ford hold on at that pace?\n\nSo Ford can sell more while Tesla still benefits. The only time market share matters here is if the market is stagnant. When the demand is consistently growing, everyone has room to grow.\n\nSelling EV's for these legacy automakers will be actively losing them money for the foreseeable future. But they will continue doing so because they have no choice: The markets are taking shape and people want EV's > ICE.\n\nYou seem to think people don't understand your point. Your point, which you aren't articulating very well is that the stock performance of Ford is not the same as Ford as a company and how they operate and that even if Ford loses money, their ability to compete with Tesla will still affect Tesla's valuation.\n\nThe problem is the market for EV's, as I've stated, is growing at a rapid rate. It's just a matter of who can survive the longest to where they can be profitable. And that is why people are investing heavily into Tesla because as of now, they are the only profitable EV maker with higher margins than traditional ICE manufacturers. Even if Ford manages to become profitable, the shit Tesla is coming out with in terms of software, insurance, AI being used for robotics, FSD, etc., has immense value. I don't see it as just vehicles so that's a separate discussion.\n\nReally, the point here is that Tesla can still grow with or without Ford's success because the market for EV's is still in its early stages.

If Ford goes bankrupt tomorrow because they state they can't fund their EV operations, of course that would boost Tesla's market valuation. It will send a signal that legacy automakers can't turn a profit selling EV's, which will eventually outpace ICE sales.\n\nBut Tesla also has other areas where they can capitalize on that I don't believe Ford will come close to in the near future outside of just selling EV's. How useful were iPhones before apps and services became a thing? Not as useful. EV's will eventually be differentiated by services and Tesla is ahead by a wide margin there.\n\nAnd for every EV Ford sells, they will lose money and take away an ICE sale from their own lineup.
