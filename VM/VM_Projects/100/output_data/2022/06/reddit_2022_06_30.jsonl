{"title": "The Autists guide to Inflation", "selftext": "**Listen Up,**\n\nbefore you pop your morning dose of Adderall and give your wife's boyfriend a foot massage, let me clue you in on something really important.  The masters of the Economy (And hence the master of the remains of your tech portfolio) are shit scared of inflation. **Jerome Powell, The Fed, Charlie Munger, Biden**, Wallmart, Wallstreet and everybody else is shit-scared of inflation. **Your mother is scared of inflation** (How will she pay for your Wetabix and XBox games tomorrow?).\n\nWhat is inflation though? Common knowledge is, that **it is the increase of price levels by a surplus of money or a shortage of things**. Too much money, chasing too few things = stuff gets more expensive, too little money, too many things: stuff get cheaper.\n\nSo far so easy, there is however a psychological component to it. Companies adjust prices and production preemptively based on their future expectations. In order to protect their inventory and shield themselves from compressed margins they might produce way more than forecasted or adjust forward pricing based on their expectations on their rising cost and higher sales prices. Producers might start hoarding parts as they might be more difficult to obtain down the road. The great chip shortage appears to be greatly intensified due to the fact that everyone and their mother order way more than than they need just to ensure the other guy is not snatching their inventory.\n\nThis is a really hard problem to tackle in times of super intricate global supply chains that try to get everything just in time because warehouses and inventory are surprisingly expensive. (This is also why Amazon will rather burn your returns than deal with them with any degree of intimacy). So as a business owner you have to predict the demand for your stuff, the availability of the stuff you need, the prices of the stuff you need etc. **SUPER HARD**. Remember, everybody has to do it for themselves and the guess what the others are doing. So like when people are rushing into a stock, you have these self-reinforcing systems. (George Soros calls this \"Reflexivity\"). This worked surprisingly well for the last 30 years. There is only one issue, the whole organism of global trade is much more fragile than anyone expected. So when this happened:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The shitshow that was the last two years](https://preview.redd.it/548iovzlfq891.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc962dc0e58710f5f1e1445b70e537cb509376e)\n\nThe models did not really capture the dynamic nature of reality completely. The infinite money glitch from the fed was just the icing on the cake. So what we got was a perfect chaos and weird, hard to predict effects like:\n\n* Negative Oil Prices\n* Liquidity bubbles in Housing, Stocks, Sneakers etc.\n* Weird shifts in demand due to work from home and 7 Billion people changing their lifestyle completely, all at once.\n* Used cars costing more than new cars,\n* GPU's retailing for 3x the normal price.\n* A global shortage of Toilet paper.\n* An insane shortage and price bubble in Lumber and construction prices.\n\nThis send shocks up and  down the supply chain. As today prices very dependent on expectation of tomorrows prices, it caused a lot of distortions. Very similar to how the stock market works where future expectations make up 90% of the whole valuation. So with everyone guessing hard what will happen next, you can end up with something like this:\n\n[The bullwhip effect \\(https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Bullwhip\\_effect\\)](https://preview.redd.it/lzcp3idsfq891.png?width=1875&format=png&auto=webp&s=da4714ea3f260649e489936e4cf4ef4544438199)\n\nAs our good friend Michael J. Burry points out here so nicely is, that the dog has a really long tail, and that the predictions of all the market participants when it comes to inventory, prices and supply drive a really, really long tail.\n\n**This brings us to the problem of measurement.** As you might have heard, the means to measure inflation predate the second world war and not really doing a good job or even attempt to model the chaotic nature of reality described above. You buy a couple things that are roughly the same each month (**CPI**), you try to smoothen it a bit by  excluding strongly fluctuating (Food, Energy) items (**Core CPI)** you ask about of producers how the are feeling about the economy (**PPI**) and then you can estimate where you are **right now.** You can try to make a prediction by drawing the line a bit further out but this is as helpful as technical analysis on penny stocks that we all are so tired off.\n\nOne should keep in mind that these are simplified mental model based on our incomplete information of the parameters involved and the inability of the human mind to grasp the incredible complexity of large scale, chaotic systems. Or as my good friend Jerome Powel uttered on yesterday\n\n[We overshot a tiny little bit, maybe.](https://preview.redd.it/15jexiqvfq891.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a859f20c5b60f96bfce983473aaa6d75ac5c035)\n\n>**Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell admits 'we now understand better how little we understand about inflation' and insists 41-year high prices were 'unpredicted'**  \n>  \n>[**https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html**](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10966165/Jerome-Powell-admits-understand-better-little-understand-inflation.html)\n\nSo what that all really means is that the inflation we are measuring today, is something that potentially is caused by effects that are long past us. Due to the nature of long, intertwined supply chains and relatively comprehensive disruptions of shipping and transportation markets, we really have no clue when and how today's numbers where actually made.\n\n**So, if nobody knows anything at all,** why am I even even reading this?\n\nThe answer is, **that there are clues of what happens next.** In order to get a feeling where we are right now, lets have a look of the start of any (physical) supply chain, commodities:\n\n[Coming down good already. ](https://preview.redd.it/dt59g0u8gq891.png?width=2629&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3d01abacc2bc2f5dcbeb4defb2125ebd88cc7d5)\n\nAs you can see, these are **not charts of runaway prices.** There are of course spikes, for instance in lithium but commodities as a whole have relaxed quite a bit from the recent peaks.\n\nLets have a look at some shit people are actually buying instead of some made-up basket from the last century.\n\n[GPU Prices are coming down hard. https:\\/\\/www.techspot.com\\/article\\/2465-gpu-pricing-update\\/](https://preview.redd.it/xrx10uxdgq891.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=954f1504a7d924985258db902f90f1b416ea8c23)\n\n[Retail shelves are full again.](https://preview.redd.it/cjewvcdhgq891.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=23127f5626f2ddd06ad22e7142d20611a7c48bd4)\n\n[Used car prices have leveled off: https:\\/\\/www.cargurus.com\\/Cars\\/price-trends\\/](https://preview.redd.it/e2x3b9pjgq891.png?width=1411&format=png&auto=webp&s=8eac76f7868585e40c44f3af631c70a950b7fbaa)\n\nAnd everyone's darling investment, homes:\n\n[Prices start coming down in some areas as a result of quickly increased lending rates.](https://preview.redd.it/9pzgl6cngq891.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=12d0527d864b01e6468d07a813e36b5503b7711e)\n\n[Shipping cost is on the retreat too \\(https:\\/\\/fbx.freightos.com\\/\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wmg94b4pgq891.png?width=1771&format=png&auto=webp&s=44c485bb7ec8b9bf0b2f28bf3b3108b0907297f6)\n\nSo these are just some isolated (and of course cherry picked) examples but it should illustrate that things are a little (**a lot**) more nuanced than the red-hot monthly readings are suggesting. It might actually be, that inflation **has already peaked and the worst is behind us**. Which leads us to the most interesting question:\n\n**Should I buy calls or puts now?** Well, this really depends. As you maybe know, the fed uses interest rates to accelerate or brake the economy by making money cheaper or more difficult to borrow (in simple terms). This works because the more money you have,  the more shit you can trade and make and buy. Less money is taking the oxygen out of the room. Lets overlay the fed balance sheet (which is a reasonable benchmark for money supply) with the SP500 to see if we can spot any correlation (how much two lines like each other)\n\n[A little bit of overlap, maybe \\(https:\\/\\/www.currentmarketvaluation.com\\/posts\\/2021\\/07\\/Fed-Balance-Sheet-vs-SP500.php\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/zscck4ovgq891.png?width=1928&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3baab1ae3556e87b0bfebdd9a92252e310e90e4)\n\nAs we can see they are somewhat correlated. So to summarize:\n\n**When inflation numbers are high**, the Fed raises rates in order the choke the economy a bit. As a consequence the price of shit goes down or at least does not raise anymore.\n\n**When inflation numbers are low**, the fed can push the pedal a bit more and make money more widely available. This makes everyone a bit richer and stimulates the economy. This is desirable as it means more jobs and more shit to buy, in general.\n\nHistorically the markets are relatively resilient. They survived the great depression, world wars, oil shocks and what not. Generally investors are fine as long as they have a feeling where things are going. Right now, nobody really knows shit and these inflation readings are the number everyone is focussing on because it will in last consequence mean the difference between another bull mania or a long and painful bear market.\n\n**So should I buy puts are calls now for fucks sake?**\n\nEasy.\n\n**If you take the blue pill** you are on **Team Bear Gang**, you submit to the great uncertainty and you are scared of runway inflation. **You buy PUTS** because you believe it will be necessary to kill the economy for a quarter or two to bring down inflation.\n\n**If you take the red pill** you are on **Team Burry** and make the bold contrarian bet that inflation has already peaked and it is likely that we see a nice reversal, especially in the battered down tech sector (Zuck, I still love you). **You buy CALLS** because you buy when there is blood in the streets and the worst is already behind us.\n\n**It you take the pill with the Mitsubishy Logo** you are team smooth-brain and believe it does not matter, because we will have a strong reaction either way and the **VIX** at **29** is super low (EDIT: for how shit the market is), considering the uncertainty that we are facing currently. **So you buy PUTS and CALLS** because the market will either go to shit like 2008 and we did so nothing yet, or we have another face-ripping rally like in 2020.\n\nEDIT: To time your bets better please consult the BLS Calendar [https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news\\_release/cpi.htm](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm)\n\nThe next CPI reading is on **Jul. 13, 2022**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Nobody knows what is going to happen but there is opportunity in guessing how wrong we are about inflation.\n\n**Position:**\n\n* 110 Shares of VOO @ 261\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: I have no idea about any of this shit and this DD is just prose. So check everything and invert yourself. This is a casino.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Repost as first one was deleted for accidentially mentioning a banned ticker.

Both are part of Tier-1 of the G-SIBs, or Globally Systematic Important Banks (alongside Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and others, just to give some perspective on size and importance. The G-SIBs rankings were established in 2011, and mean that these banks are essentially to big to fail, until they do.\n\nWe will start with the big picture. European banks in general are under critical stress. The Euro is collapsing, energy prices are skyrocketing, and assets held within Russia are largely lost forever.   On top of this, the European Central Bank (ECB) is raising rates for the first time in over a decade. Let me make it clear that there was a reason Europe decided to go to negative rate territory. If they had not, there would have been mass defaults, a major recession, and there would have essentially been no recovery from the Financial Crisis. The whole Euro Zone would have been decimated. Maybe something positive would have come out of this, maybe not, but leaders in Europe and the ECB decided to sacrifice the future for the present, and unfortunately now we are in the future.\n\nSocGen has always had significantly risky practices, ala Lehman Brothers[. In fact, Lehman said in January 2008 that the fraud uncovered at SocGen was \u201ceveryone\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-socgen-lehman-1/socgen-case-everyones-worst-nightmare-lehman-ceo-idUSFLE43779720080124) Irony abounds. Following this, [SocGen absorbed a bunch of ex-Lehman staff](https://www.fx-markets.com/people/1555950/ex-lehman-fx-sales-team-reunited-at-socgen) and continued what they do best: overleveraging, defrauding, and [money laundering](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2021-11-30/u-s-ends-societe-generale-sanctions-case-after-bank-complies-with-agreement) for the world\u2019s elite criminals. This kind of business model works well when it is working, but when a perfect storm hits, it\u2019s an absolute fiasco. \n\nCredit Suisse is not much different. [This article from February pretty much sums up everything you need to know about Credit Suisse.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-secrets-leak-unmasks-criminals-fraudsters-corrupt-politicians) As if we are living in a sick joke, they named Axel Lehmann their head of their risk committee last year, who is now their chairman. Unlike US banks which recovered after the financial crisis, Credit Suisse is still down 92% from the highs and is down over 40% this year. SocGen has had a similar downwards trajectory.\n\nNow, onto the perfect storm. Since January 2021, the Euro is down 12% against the USD. That may not seem like a lot, but you must understand that currency markets move very slowly until something is fundamentally wrong on one side of the currency pair.  Currency traders use significant leverage (sometimes as much as 1000:1) to make trades, and multi-percent moves can cause a lot of collateral damage. Fast-forward to 2022 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Credit Suisse, SocGen, and essentially every other bank in Europe had significant risk exposure to Russia and Russian banks, as they all had done business on a regular basis. The sanctions that were put on Russia caused significant FX volatility along with a massive spike in energy prices, which both contributed to the energy inflation Europe is seeing which far outpaces the US. There was already some restructuring going on at Credit Suisse, which did not help. Here is a table for bank comparison:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3fghfz7vt891.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba414dd2dd9b875335525092dfbc644f406217dd\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/credit-suisse-risks-losing-business-amid-overhaul-8211-analysts-70621128](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/credit-suisse-risks-losing-business-amid-overhaul-8211-analysts-70621128)\n\nAnd here is a more ominous chart:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ghq2lo8vt891.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=c625a586c255e176ab9d9a22ee6d3247a4eaa626\n\nSaid bluntly, Credit Suisse is ALREADY operating at a deficit, before the ECB raises rates. The ECB raising rates will cause significant loan defaults. \n\nNow, for SocGen. I work with UHNW individuals and constantly price out structured products. Structured products are largely a game for the wealthy to ensure an income while limiting significant risk in the markets, but there is always counterparty risk. What this means is that banks write these structured products, and the risk premium is in part determined by the ability of the counterparty bank, the bank that is writing the note, staying solvent. When Lehman was nearing the end and internal employees knew it, they wrote a ton of notes such as principal protection notes that \u201censured\u201d investors could not lose, unless Lehman, a prestigious bank of over 150 years, went out of business.\n\nFastforward to last week. This hits my inbox at work. A note, written by SocGen, essentially guaranteeing a return over 20%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2znqwav9vt891.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3462e44af8cf0d727ca6bd36c8125a3d394a79b\n\nHere is what was written alongside this note:\n\nHighest Max Return: **31.25%**\n\nLowest Max Return: **24.30%**\n\nUnderlying: **SPX**\n\nIssuer: **Soc Gen**\n\nStrike Date: **6/16**\n\nNotional: **$1,000,000**\n\nI have never seen a note like this hit my inbox, and I have already written previously about SocGen and its risky structured note behavior. It is coming full circle.\n\nThese businesses are going to get crushed over the next three months. What Europe is facing is much more dire than what the United States is facing; There are countries in Europe that can\u2019t pay back their debt, never mind businesses and consumers. The ECB has to raise rates, if they do not inflation will topple governments. The challenge will be if the result becomes so unstable that the entire European Union collapses, and countries such as Germany return to their own currencies, sending the Euro spiraling downwards.\n\nThere are hundreds of other data points that should be in this report, and please feel free to comment with them because this is all beyond fascinating. \n\n**Puts, shorts, and anything else betting against Credit Suisse and SocGen are good plays, especially over the next six months.** \n\n***We are going to see some fireworks ladies and gentlemen.***", "id": "vojmtj", "created_utc": 1656625094.0, "score": 537, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|25|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|37|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vojmtj/lehman_20_how_socgen_and_credit_suisse_will_bring/) \n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vojmtj)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vojmtj)\n    \nHey /u/3xinvesting, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32483571767807007}, {"body": "That is not how a structured note works.

I work risk management at a commercial bank ($50B<$100B). We recently acquired a bank that had some European exposure and I was tasked with assessing the counterparty risk of these European banks. Funny enough, SocGen was one of them..\n\nI\u2019m relatively new to the field and have limited experience (I write up an analysis and my manager reviews them for accuracy). What I noticed right away is that these banks aren\u2019t under the the same reporting requirements as US banks. We get most of our financial information (tier 1/risk based capital ratios, NIM, etc.) from a platform similar to Bloomberg\u2019s Terminal and these banks were missing most of the metrics we use to analyze as per our typical analysis. As we never had any European exposure, we didn\u2019t have a process for evaluating these Banks. I had to develop a new methodology with tons of missing information lol. Long story short, we had difficulty evaluating these banks. I don\u2019t want to go into further detail, but I just remember looking at banks like SocGen and feeling I must be missing SOMETHING considering the vast size of the bank and how risky it seemed to be operating based on their financials. Maybe I wasn\u2019t far off.\n\nEdit: Just did some research on PPNs and I think the \u201clowest max return\u201d is a bit misguiding. From my understanding, it seems that if you choose to participate at minimum exposure, your potential max return would be the 24%. If the SPX has a negative return from now until maturity (36 months), an investor would receive their principal only. Seems like a shady way of raising debt without bearing interest imo and the \u201clowest max return\u201d is just a way for sell side to make it sound like a less shitty investment. The only purpose I can think of for investing in these notes would be if your firm wasn\u2019t allowed to directly invest in equity, like a commercial bank. However, I guarantee regulators wouldn\u2019t allow a commercial bank to buy these notes lol", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5311805605888367}, {"body": "buttcoin here we come.

Not a single company in the S&P 500 has negative earnings otherwise it gets removed, and that index essentially is the US public stock index, it covers like 75% of market cap.

No it hasn't not materially.  \n\n2001 1Q:  GNI 10.5T, GDP 10.5T\n\n2022 1Q: GDP 24.6T, GNI 24.4T\n\n>GNI and comparing to corporate profits makes no sense to begin with.\n\nYes it does completely.  All corporate profits show up in GNI.  This is why even the largest and best companies in the world *cannot possibly outgrow GNI indefinitely*.  Why?  Because that would imply that a single company can continue stealing ever larger share as a % of profits from all other companies in existence until they are all bankrupt.  It is arithmetically impossible.  \n\nSimilarly, all companies cannot permanently outgrow GNI it is mathematically impossible.  While a secular downward 40 year trend in interest rates gave mild credence to the idea that the disconnect could persist temporarily due to \"justified\" higher valuations, that is no longer the case.\n\n>compared to the risk free rate\n\nExcept dot plot shows 3.5% and FFR futures confirm this.  And yet MC / GNI has doubled in the past 6 years while rates were at historical lows and it is still incredibly elevated.  Markets most definitely have not absorbed historical global tightening across the world and MASSIVE QE4 but in reverse QT at 100B/mo.\n\nCAPE ratios which are highly predictive also show that a massive speculative boom has taken place.  #1 highest Dotcom peaked at 44, #2 meme era 38, and #3 highest Great Depression peaked at 30.  Statistically speaking we still have a long way to go and 10 year real returns are likely negative from here.\n\n>Not a single company in the S&P 500 has negative earnings otherwise it gets removed\n\nThis is completely incorrect again.  S&P 500 needs consistent positive earnings to enter the S&P 500 but having negative earnings does not remove it.
