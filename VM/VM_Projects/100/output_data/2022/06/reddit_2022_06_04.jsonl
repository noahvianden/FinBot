He was specifically referring to the roadster in the interview, which was hand built from a Lotus and used Panasonic camcorder batteries.  Rivian has been designed from the start for mass production, the Roadster really wasn't.  Rivian also has value add services either available or in the pipeline.  They have an insurance service, roadside assistance, subscription charger access, etc.  They are trying to create presumably higher margin value add services under the Rivian brand that will, hopefully, make them more profitable.\n\nThat said, they currently have an EV around $10B, and it was as low as $2B going into earnings.  It's not a very valuable company today, no one currently expects them to achieve Tesla level 30% ROIC.\n\nWill they ever be profitable?  I don't know.  The DTC model is just objectively better than the current dealership model in America that all other major manufacturers use.  It is a structural advantage for both Tesla and Rivian.  Yet, economies of scale are so important in auto manufacturing, Rivian might not be able to scale with their available capital.  They say they'll reach positive cash from operations before they run out of money, but that's hard to predict and no CFO is going to come out on call and say \"it's over, our run rate is too deep in the red, we're fucked.\"\n\nI don't think $30 is a bad price point for Rivian, though.  Ford trades at 1.2x book value, Tesla at 25x, Rivian at 1.6x.  You really aren't paying an extreme premium for Rivian's current assets.

Of course Rivian is not gonna trade at a high book value, since they're burning money like crazy. Likewise Ford is making very little money and is investing billions into switching to EVs which they haven't made profitably yet.

Him mentioning Rivian was to demonstrate that Rivian is selling their vehicles for far below what it costs them to make and that volume in-itself won't solve that problem. For example, for the year 2021, Rivian earned $55 million in revenue. The cost to generate that $55 million was $520 million. That means they incurred a loss of $465 million GROSS PROFIT. That means, before the operating expenses are included which in Rivian case, generated a loss of $3.75 billion dollars. So Rivian's issue isn't just related to scaling. The problem they have is every truck they build is costing them way more than they are selling for and scaling alone won't make up that difference.\n\nCan Rivian be profitable? It really depends on battery improvements, scaling, supply chain remedy, and whether or not they can price their vehicles accordingly. Rivian struck gold selling their IPO shares at the price they did. Without that, I'm not sure if they would be capable of last another year. The issue is, it is quite unlikely that Rivian will be profitable for at least another five years considering the fact that pickups require large battery packs, thus, making them much less profitable than light vehicles. For Rivian to breakeven on their vehicles, they will basically only be selling them to wealthy individuals. Certainly, no average person would be able to afford it.\n\nWhat Rivian does have going for them is Ford/Amazon's involvement. Perhaps they can get funding and expertise from those two that Tesla didn't quite have in their early stages. Still, you have to wonder just how much of a role Ford or Amazon will play when the losses start racking up and they themselves are having their own separate issues. Ford, for example, is rapidly trying to dominate the pickup EV category because pickup trucks are their specialty and best selling vehicles. The issue is, F-150 lightnings will be bleeding money. The estimated range is horrible when you consider what is being towed. Expect at least half of what the estimated mileage of the vehicle would be if you're towing something. Since pickup trucks require much more battery cells to operate than light vehicles, unless Ford can price them accordingly, the crowd that purchased their F150 ICE models may be priced out. This is why Tesla hasn't really focused much on their cybertruck. It would be less profitable and they wouldn't even have the batteries and materials to mass manufacture them in a way that wouldn't take away from their existing Model 3 and Y sales. \n\nAs for Tesla's software, that isn't really playing a role for them in terms of profitability at this moment. I believe you will start seeing huge software and services potential when FSD is finally released.

One big advantage tesla still has are their super charger network. It's fast, it's one of the fastest wildly available charger network out there. Porche has the fastest super chargers but these aren't wildly available and they do have a deal with tesla to use their network. Another reason why Tesla has a strong position (in europe at least, don't know for the usa or china) is that their super charger network is privately owned and build on private land. They don't have to deal with all the stupid time intensive regulations that you have to deal with in the EU. We don't have a clear vision or rules for a super charger network in the EU, in some countries it takes even 2 years of paperwork to just get a few chargers down next to the highway.. Tesla however works with privately owned land from for example hotel resorts. They are able to expand, upgrade and maintain their network pretty well because they just use private space in exchange for some royalties I assume. Paperwork and regulations are way better by this approach by tesla. Using our tesla is definitely less stressful than using our other electric cars. You're absolutely right about the build quality. Our other german electric cars are insanely detailed and build with care, you just can't compare the quality of the tesla in comparison with those cars. Tesla also tends to have a bit more issues in software or damaged/missing car parts than the other cars we have however their service is very good and most of the time not that expensive or even free while the other car manufacturers would make this an expensive occurence..

{"title": "There is no guaranteed recovery", "selftext": "Everyone in the country knows that there is a risk of a recession. Assuming a recession happens, a lot of people are talking about how the recovery will eventually happens because apparently \"markets always recover\". \n\nI have been watching several videos and reading a few articles about previous recessions and I do not really think a recovery is guaranteed, at least not in the next 10 years. Most economies do not recover from a crash, even though the US has recovered several times. \n\nEven for the United States, some crashes take more than 10 years to recover e.g. most Technology stocks took more than 10 years to recover from the dotcom crash. Stocks have three times trades lower than the previous decade in the United States.\n\nIt is true that the bubble in Japan in the 80s was bigger than the bubble in the US currently but the US economy might still suffer the same fate. The Japanese stock market has simply never recovered since the crash. The reality is that those who bought at the peak in early January or late December might walk away with losses no matter how long they wait.\n\nMy reasoning for this is as follows:\n\n1.  What helped economic recovery in the united states previously was industrial production since US companies eventually produced things to sell. Right now, as more and more American companies produce things abroad and face stiff competition, the outcome might be very different. \n2. Americans no longer like to work as evidenced by the \"great resignation\" and increasing appetite for jobs that are basically effortless. This corresponds to what happened to the Netherlands before collapse, the French before collapse , and the British in the late 1800s. The difference is these countries simply went abroad and acquired colonial territories to do the job - an option that Americans do not have in the modern age. Even the dutch and French still had their economies collapse despite the colonial wealth.\n3. There are new upcoming countries with very low costs of living leading to very low labour costs. These countries can supply the world with food and industrial goods for very cheap. This is making American producers suffer due to the high costs of living in the USA meaning high cost of labour. \n4. American politicians are not willing to take corrective measures to fix the economy out of fear of being voted out ( basically proving Socrates was right in his analogy - people always choose the sweet poison over the bitter medicine hence failure of democracy).  Corrective measures would be abolishing minimum wage and instead looking for ways to reduce cost of living by increasing production, encouraging people to save money other than spend aimlessly, deregulate the market to make it easy for new businesses, etc. No politician will ever do this because of fear of being voted out (the immediate effect will be terrible but the long term effect will be desirable). \n5. Increasing sovereign debt means the more countries find other places to buy products for cheaper, and hence the less the demand for the US Dollar, the more the American economy is in danger. Other countries are also finding alternatives in response to the US freezing Russia's foreign currency reserves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I think these factors might make it so that the American economy finds it very difficult to undergo any kind of economic recovery after a recession. The conditions needed to recover successfully from a recession are simply not in good supply in the United States.\n\nAnyway, this is just an opinion like any other and I would love to listen to what you guys think about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR ; the economy might never recover after the crash.", "id": "v4pout", "created_utc": 1654351881.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|10 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 day|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v4pout)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v4pout)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02344641461968422}, {"body": "TLDR: this could be the big one boys. \n\nI'm gonna go all in on Pelton.

We\u2019re already seeing some downtick as a result of the fed raising rates. Home prices will come down. Supply chain issues are resolving, gradually, oil prices are high, may remain high, but there\u2019s nothing that can be done about that and it\u2019s a primary driver of inflation right now, not some systemic issue in the market. \n\nIndeed, there isn\u2019t a liquidity crisis like in 2008, and corporate balance sheets are strong, very strong, they can easily ride out this present tough times. \n\nAnd the Economy tho, is strong. Employment good. Earnings may dip a bit, but so what? A couple quarters, does not a summer make. Maybe we see a recession, maybe we don\u2019t, but this isn\u2019t going to somehow collapse the us market. There\u2019s just no reason to conclude that will be the case. \n\nSecond, the us stock market is the only game in town.  Fed isn\u2019t going to raise rates back to 1970s level, that\u2019s never happening again, so bonds are never going to be the asset class they were then. There\u2019s just nowhere else to put money to work, especially because ostensibly every other market i the world is less attractive than the US stock market \n\nFinally, look at the companies. Google apple Microsoft Amazon, these companies have grown massively in the past 2 years; it\u2019s not all inflation, it\u2019s not just free govt money, they really are earnings fuck ton more money.

From 1995 to 2007, GDP fell from $5.33 trillion to $4.36 trillion in nominal terms,[7] real wages fell around 5%.\u201d  - wiki\n\nBut, US GDP has grown, on average, well more than 2-3x the GDP growth of Japan since 1990.\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting chart, from 1990 to 2018, US median hourly wage of all civilian prime-age workers (25-54) (in 2018 dollars), has risen 7%.\n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/10/are-wages-rising-falling-or-stagnating/\n\nAnother thing that I rarely see discussed when people bring up Japan (or really China, or Russia, or other similar nations), is the massive demographic differences between the USA and Japan.\n\nJapan had / has an aging population, their actually seeing a decrease in population right now and has seen a relatively flat or downward sloping population growth since really the 1990s, or earlier.\n\nThat\u2019s just not the case here.
