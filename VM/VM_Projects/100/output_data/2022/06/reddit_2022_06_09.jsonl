Interest rates will barely affect it, because it's not primarily a demand-side problem. There are 2 major structural issues, and a third issue that isn't structural per-se.\n\n1. Logistics chains are still screwed. Getting both raw and finished goods is difficult and expensive. Additionally, geopolitics has had a big impact here beyond the mess in ports\n   1. The COVID shutdowns in China have made the existing snarl ups worse, and also caused hold ups in both raw materials and finished goods,\n   2. The invasion of Ukraine has caused oil prices, and thus transport prices (which impact everytihng), to spike. It is also making a mess out of fertilizer and grain prices, noble gases, and a pile of other things.\n2. Suppliers have not recovered from COVID shutdowns. They were absolutely screwed over at the start of COVID and many of them had to shut down plant and laid off staff. They're now finding that it's hard to re-hire the staff and getting the plant going again is hard. Increasing interest rates will make this worse because that makes it more expensive both to hire staff and to take on the capital to increase production capacity.\n   1. Because of the reduction in production capacity, supply chains that had slack allowing production to scale with demand have absolutely none left. They're all going flat out. You can't call up your supplier and increase your order without giving multi-annual lead times in many sectors\n   2. \u200bAs things are ramping back up their customers are over a barrel and they're not feeling particularly charitable after having mass cancellations thrust on them. Why, after all, invest in expansion now when you can just raise prices on the people who dicked you two years ago.\n3. Retailers have jacked the shit out of their prices. The $120 barrels of oil haven't been delivered yet but that hasn't stopped petrol prices hitting the moon. Supermarket chains, food providers, hardware makers, auto makers, oil companies, timber suppliers - all are reporting record profits, even when sales are flat or declining.\n\nOf course there are demand side factors as well, as well as issues such as the relative lack of trained tradespeople and huge pent up demand for accommodation coupled with very low inventory because of two years with little building - but will increasing interest rates help any of this?", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Rising rates will create demand destruction.

It means slower or no expansion from suppliers that are trying to recover from 2019's demand destruction requiring even greater downstream demand destruction.\n\nThis is why the Fed waited so long to raise rates.

But that was a mistake that missed the mess that the supply side was in. Production is still down, and choppy. Logistics are still snarled up. And now we have a war on top of it. Without the invasion of Ukraine it is likely that oil and food prices would have settled (oil prices were pulling back before it).\n\nIt's pretty clear that there are supply-side, logistics, and demand-side issues right now. Interest rates hikes will depress asset prices somewhat and will dampen demand, but a good portion of that demand is in places that aren't particularly elastic, particularly food and accommodation.  So, as I said in response to another comment, the interest rates are a shorter lever than usual. Until supply steadies and starts to grow, and until logistics get un-screwed, inflation will continue at these high levels.\n\nThe discussion on here is often absolute but the economy is much less so.
