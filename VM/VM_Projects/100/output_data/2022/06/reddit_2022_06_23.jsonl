{"title": "Retail traders haven\u2019t given up on the stock market \u2014 and that could mean it has further to fall", "selftext": "As investors search for potential signs of investor exhaustion to gauge whether the bear market in U.S. stocks might have more room to run, a team of analysts warned that retail traders likely still have scope to get more negative on stocks. This in turn may suggest that a full-on market \u201ccapitulation\u201d might still lie ahead, even as U.S. stocks extended a rebound on Wednesday from last week\u2019s slump.\n\nAnalysts at Vanda Research led by Marco Iachini said in a weekly research note that while retail interest in U.S. stocks reached its lowest level of the year so far on Tuesday, they still haven\u2019t reached levels of \u201ccapitulation\u201d on par with what was witnessed before stocks turned around in December 2018 and March 2020.\n\nWhat might retail capitulation look like? The Vanda team said that during the last two major selloffs in 2020 and late 2018, total \u201ccapitulation\u201d didn\u2019t arrive until retail traders had become net sellers of stocks. Using a pair of charts, the Vanda team showed that retail investors became net sellers of stocks for at least a few sessions just before the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.13% began to rebound in both 2018 and 2020.\n\nTo be sure, retail investors are a much bigger force in markets today than they were four years ago, as average daily trading activity by small-time traders has increased substantially, according to flows data collected by Vanda from several of the most popular discount brokerages used by retail traders, including Charles Schwab SCHW, +0.10%, TD Ameritrade and others.\n\nAnd retail interest isn\u2019t the only measure of market \u201ccapitulation\u201d, a term that represents signs of exhaustion that typically emerge before stocks bottom out. For example, when it comes to popular market-based measures of capitulation, it\u2019s worth noting that the CBOE Volatility Index, the Wall Street \u201cfear gauge\u201d that reflects expectations for market volatility over the coming 30 days based on activity in options markets, has yet to flash its most closely watched exhaustion signal.\n\nAs MarketWatch pointed out in a story from May, investors typically associate a reading above \u201c40\u201d on the VIX with capitulation. The gauge topped out above 80 in November 2008 and again in March 2020. But it has yet to cross this threshold so far this year. Then again, every selloff is different. During the selloff in March 2020, the S&P 500 fell 34% in just 23 trading days. This year\u2019s selloff has been drawn out over a much longer period with the S&P 500 falling more than 20% over a span of almost six months. Still, U.S. stocks appear headed for the worst first-half performance since 1932, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\n**To read the full story and to view charts-** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-u-s-stocks-rebound-analysts-warn-signs-of-genuine-capitulation-remain-elusive-11655922860?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/as-u-s-stocks-rebound-analysts-warn-signs-of-genuine-capitulation-remain-elusive-11655922860?mod=home-page)", "id": "vir3lt", "created_utc": 1655968995.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "Retail has been constantly bombarded for years now about time in the market, investing, don't sell in downturns etc. We've all seen 2 or 3 crashes in the last 20 years and rich people scooping up cheap shares and become wealthier and wealthier.

I don't think China will actually do 'special military operations' in Taiwan until we get our stateside fabs. They're incenticized to wait knowing, or being reasonably confident in, the prospect of a US that's no longer forced to care about TSMC. Unless things deteriorate for the CCP to the extent they get so desperate they feel they can't wait for us to get our shit together.\n\nSemiconductor dependency is the biggest reason we're so connected with Taiwan. There are other facftors, but otherwise they're only the 10th biggest trading partner, and we don't want China to have Japan and East Asia more directly within its sphere of infuence. Without having to care about TSMC, American policy leaders, at the end of the day don't care about the other things enough to go to war with China.

I think oil and gas have a very long term bullish path before them which Buffet also sees, but he is known to not care about timing.\n\nBear case for oil and energy stocks in the short term is currently: \n\nRate hikes and inflation pushing the economy into a recession. This destroys demand and the supply demand balance for oil is very very sensitive as both sides are fairly inelastic.\n\nRussia is still exporting an enormous amount of its sanctioned oil to mainly India and China, so its hard to even estimate how much the war is impacting supply. The total supply could barely be impacted if India and China now just have to buy less from the global market. \n\nPending Iran nuclear deal. Recently talks have been picking up again to lift the oil embargo set upon Iran which could add to global supply (then again, their sanctioned oil might have been hitting black markets all along just like russias is now, so this could be a non issue)\n\nMassive amounts of speculation into the sector. Very few people were positioned for higher oil prices and markets tend to overprice. Its hard to know how much of the current prices are held up by momentum traders and speculators vs long term investors. Adding to this, long term holders that were well positioned in the energy sector have started taking profits. Rebalancing factor portfolios also adds sell pressure as energy is the only thing that has done well this year. **Be very wary when everyone is bullish at the same time.** At any time, an end of the Russia Ukraine war could trigger a cascade of selling in energy stocks and completely reverse momentum.\n\nTo add to the last one: there have been record amounts of insiders selling in the energy space. They probably see the same as all the factors above, *or* they see a first opportunity in years to capitalise.\n\nOil and gas companies remain non ESG and thus attract a lot less capital currently that ESG compliant companies. Regardless of my or your disagreement with this, this means a lower earnings multiple will remain the case for these companies. Additionally, they remain highly cyclical stocks that many people consider on their last stretch.\n\nWindfall tax profits being discussed globally.
