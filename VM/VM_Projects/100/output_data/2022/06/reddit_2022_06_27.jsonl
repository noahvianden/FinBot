From what I've heard, Russia is benefiting from the high oil prices and now selling to India/China in roubles and so you have oil transactions in non-USD which isn't good for the USD as a dominant reserve currency. \n\nAlso an interesting point brought up on the All-in-podcast was about how Russia has gotten money for free by freezing investments in Russia. I think Blackrock holds a lot of Russian assets and now that's effectively worth nothing...so Russia has gotten free financing. \n\nAbove are all short-term gains for Russia but on the flip side it's messed up EU climate goals (whether or not one cares about ESG) which has a domino effect on capital flows. Then you have talks about re-starting coal production to make up for banning imports from Russia which is also hypocritical as it applies to oil imports via ports/sea - so not all oil. \n\nSo answer the question you had - CCP - can't really do much about their covid policy - their eco growth has been impacted - they've realized their folly of their anti-tech drive, zero covid policy so it will course correct.\n\nRussia - could have thought through it a bit better and controlled the sudden spike in oil prices and food.
