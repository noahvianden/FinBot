From what I've heard, Russia is benefiting from the high oil prices and now selling to India/China in roubles and so you have oil transactions in non-USD which isn't good for the USD as a dominant reserve currency. \n\nAlso an interesting point brought up on the All-in-podcast was about how Russia has gotten money for free by freezing investments in Russia.

It's only a matter of time until more people are spending on necessities and not on new apps on their phone, or a new phone, or a new case for that phone, or downloading new songs, or paying that monthly subscription to Netflix.  Sure the haves will still be consuming like they always do, but the economic indicators will surely point to a slowdown and soon the bigger companies will have to cutback on the people that aren't really doing any work while they claim they are working from home.

And since price is discovered, two contracts with different rates of discovery will have differing accuracy in defining the market price, and thus IV.\n\nLet's fill in some of the blanks.

I mean, what is the price of the 450 June/2024 call? Can you say with confidence that it is 23.37? Or is it 27.77? Or something in between? There's over $4 of difference between those prices, which means $4 of inaccuracy in calculating IV. Compared to the $.01 of difference for the July 2022 call.\n\nSo the moral of the story is, if you want to compare two IVs to confirm an expected pattern or evolution of IV, you need to have some confidence that the two market prices are comparable for accuracy.\n\nEDIT: fixed transcription error in the quotes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "OK so what I was noticing  is just an artifact of large spread/illiquidity for further out options.\n\nThanks for mentioning the spreads its very obvious in hindsight I should have noticed that I just assumed spy options would be so liquid it wouldn't matter even that far out but that was very incorrect.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> OK so what I was noticing  is just an artifact of large spread/illiquidity for further out options.\n\nIn my opinion, yes.

Regardless, the bullish outlook for TSLA is \u201cis amplified\u201d given the company's strong positioning, he wrote.

Although Giga Shanghai is underperforming in Q2, the analyst expects a sharp rise in the second half of the year.

Let me guide you.  January 6th was a fascist coup.  Putin is fascist, the new Hitler and rigged trump into office, desantis too.

But what is the opposite of an enviromentalist?  Putin, Bolsonaro, trump, Desantis and 75% of republican leaders. So now Musk gets pissed at Elizabeth Warren and AOC for telling him he should pay more taxes, and fears a union, so he moves tom Texas and now declares himself a probably Republican. he flew to Brazil to meet Bolsonaro. That helps Bolsonaro right before a key election. he quips that he'd vote for desantis and would let Trump back on Twitter, and the SEC is about to bust the fraudulent scam Truth Social so trump desperately needs to spread his nefarious lies on Twitter.   To top it off, Musk calls democrats \"haters\", a false statement of course, unless he saying we hate Nazis maybe.   and who are 80% of tesla buyers?  Probably liberal democrats.  The #1 market for Teslas is California, few other places even have the charging stations. and Biden wants to put a charging station every 50 miles on our highways and Musk is against Biden, I guess because he is pro union.\n\nPut this together with Musk's shenanigans with Twitter, lying about their bots to try and default, and also his manipulations of Dogecoin promotion of cryptos and you have to admit, Musk is suffering from poor judgement, and maybe fascism.  It is no mistake to say that industrialisms who side with a dominant fascist regime so make out like bandits. see the Russian oligarchs or Hitler's industrial war machine.

And Desantis, Rand Paul, Tucker Carlson and many others too?   \n\nYou probably think the Steele dossier is a hoax and Hunter Biden is to blame.  You think Mueller found nothing, the FB I had no reason to be wiretapping Russian agents in Trump Tower, the Durham Investigation proved Hillary was to blame, and the 22 year funding of trump by Putin never happened even though all the Trumps admitted it and boasted about it prior to 2016.\n\nI'll leave you with my favorites.  First circa 2015, Michael Cohen reports Trump just heard some mysterious Russian overpaid for a ramshackle Florida mansion he had for sale by a whopping 50 million.  That is the Russia paid 50 million above asking.  Trump winked to Cohen and said \"that was Putin\", and trump was very proud of getting that bribe. A 50 million bribe is more than enough to buy Trump especially back then and you know it.\n\nI advise you also study the strict barriers and rules Mueller had to contend with in his severely limited investigation where he convicted 44 Russians and Trump 2016 top officials.  1) He wasnt allowed to indict Trump even thoug he caught tyrump with Stone lying ab out talking to Wikileaks   2) He could not look at the Trump Org and their financing and Russian money laundering which Steve Bannon said in 2017 was what would land Trump in prison.   3) He could not follow Russian money back prior to 2016    3) He could not investigate anything not directly linked to the 2016 campaign   4) He had to close and end the investigation with \"only\" 44 convictions before the midterm season began.\n\nPutin also openly admitted yes of course he intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump. In Helsinki, google it.  It was no secret. Mueller and others detailed the 10 million Russian trolls they created to act as disinformation agents from 2016 to the present day.  If you had ten million fans on the internet lying for you don't you think you could make headway in whatever it was you were trying to do?  Mueller also confirmed Putin gtried to hack every single election in 2016 and only succeededonce, in Florida, which was never fixed because Rick scott didn't want it fixed. and that is how we got Desantis. desantis's righthand aide was just ougted as a Russian-georgian agent by the DOJ. Sgtay tuned on that one.\n\nRead the Steele Dossier. It is almost all proven facts. It is exactly how it went down. See Jill Stein and Michael Flynn celebrating with Putin in Moscow right after the election, Both were Russian agents along with Tulsi Gabbard.  Stein alone made the difference in the election when trump had no Green fake Russian candidate in 2020 he tried to make one up with Kanye West. Putin also ran twpo candidates in 2016, Rand Paul as well who McCain twice called a Russian agent.\n\nRead the Trump Tower meeting transcripts. Openly soliciting election help and lovin it from Russian agents and trump was on speakerphone.    Or how about Deripaska oligarch jet following trump to every campaign appearance in 2016?   Or Marina Butima an arrested Russian agent as a fake journalist asking Trump questions about Putin and Russia, kn owing trump would suggest an alliance with his master?  Or trump celebrating with Labvrov and the Russian ambassador in the Oval Office after firing Comey precisely because he wouldnt promise to close the Russia investigation. or McCain walking the steele Dossier into Comey and finding out they'd never seen it but it matched their own intel exactly?\n\nOr here is a doozy, google the 2016 audio of McCarthy Ryan and Jordan discussing and agreeing that TRUMP IS A RUSSIAN AGENT, then agreeiing with the Treason Caucus listening  to cover it up and lie about it.\n\nHillary lost by 35,000 in seven key precincts targeted because Russia hacked the DNC got all their polling data, while manafort also shared GOP date with Russian agent Kilimnik, then it all went to Cambridge Analytica (a Russian intelligence op co-run by Steve Bannon) where it weaponized the trolls to attack and bombard those seven districts right before the election to smear Hillary and suppress the vote.\n\nHillary would have won if not for Putin's running Trump's internet, trolling, blackmail and bribery campaigns. Any one of Putin's many attacks on Hillary would have made the difference. PLus Putin did many victory laps after that in Russia everyone boasting that he had rigged the US election and now had an \"agent\" in the Oval Office. and now they call desantis \"our new agent, the next trump\".\n\nNow you tell me one piece of what I just wrote that isn't fact.
