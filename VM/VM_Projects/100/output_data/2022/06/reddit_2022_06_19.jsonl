This was literally the best opportunity ever because the fed went into QE and lowered rates to basically zero. At the time there were plenty of Reits providing over 5% in dividends.

Now REITS are in hot water again because the broad market is selling off, there are fears of a recession, and interest rates are going up meaning people can find a safer return elsewhere. It's in this type of environment that you will want to purchase reits again at the bottom to lock in a solid dividend return.

{"title": "The market has not bottomed yet unfortunately.", "selftext": "This was my comment on a thread but thought it should be a post. Why is the market not at a bottom yet? It\u2019s the fed. Plain and simple. For the first time in almost 15 years money isn\u2019t free; that free money inflated valuations to absurd levels and when it had no place to go, it actually created entirely new speculative asset classes (digital currency\u2026.). The house of cards is coming down and unfortunately I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over yet because credit markets have yet to really crack. They\u2019ve been pressured for sure but credit spreads are not at levels that signify a true problem\u2026.yet. That will come when quantitative tightening starts (QT). QT is quite literally the process of destroying money and probably has a way larger effect than the fed raising interest rates because it drains liquidity from the system\u2026..that same liquidity that created this asset bubble in the first place. More pain to come, but me and my personal account hope it\u2019s getting towards a bottom.\n\nIn short, when credit spreads finally blow out and all hope is lost (legit no one is positive and have all capitulated)\u2026.that will be the market bottom.

During that 10 minutes i saw probably 8-10 cars come to get gas and immediately turn around because of how long the lines are. They are now losing customers because 20 pumps is not enought to handle their demand. And those customers still have to pay their annual membership fee.

They're not losing money selling gasoline. I'm pretty sure the reason they can beat out other places is pretty simple:\n\n-Lower infrastructure cost due to large high volume locations (Compare the volume of a costco gas station to a regular grocery-store 4 pump one for example)\n\n-Large lots that already have high traffic, but typically lower land/lease costs - compared to your regular corner-store gas station\n\n-Some subsidization by membership, offset IMO by increased traffic to stores\n\nAlso, with the recent *spike* in gas prices, I would not be surprised if they net out a large gain simply due to the volume of inventory they have (purchased at lower prices). While it would be temporary, and likely noted as such in a financial report, it would make their next set of earnings really nice looking.\n\nGas is 9% of their net sales (2021). They're not doing this at a loss lol.\n\nEdit:\n\nWas curious, looked into it more:\n\nAccording to their annual report, they hedge energy & currency risks.

It also has lower SG&A expenses\nas a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business. A higher penetration of gasoline sales\nwill generally lower our gross margin percentage. Rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly\nimpact our near-term net sales growth. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which,\ngiven the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A\nexpenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. \n\n--\n>The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and\nother commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate\nthrough the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the\nU.S. and Canada.
