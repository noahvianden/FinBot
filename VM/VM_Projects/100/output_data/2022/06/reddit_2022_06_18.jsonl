I am sharing mine below.\n\n(W1 = 1 Week candlestick timeframe)\n\nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks - W1 SMA(200) (blue on the picture) and min/max price from last 200 weeks - W1 MIN(200), W1 MAX(200) (both yellow on the picture). All these indicators are used for is to determine ultra conservatively what is the \"cheap\" price.\nYou can see them in the picture: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ynHSQyQ8/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ynHSQyQ8/)\nAdd up new investment money every 6 months - as much as comfortable.\n\nHow to use?\n\n1. Split ur total investment money into 4 equal piles.\n\n2. Invest one pile per crossing critical weekly structure (3 descibed below) - weekly structures are meaningful in moves many years across\n\n3. No matter how much you invested, sell 1/2 of the investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line - after this you can again buy from the initial place - W1 SMA200. You can also choose to sell the half when you are at 80% or more profit (early).\nNotice that you should pick stocks on which you have at least an 80-200% target if the price goes back to the MAX(200).\n\n4. Invest 1 pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line\n\n5. Invest the 1  pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line\n\n6. Invest 2 piles when the price goes under the W1 MIN(200) as far as it is to the MAX(200) from the W1 MIN(200) - orange rectangles used for measurement on the image.\n\n7. Hold 1/2 of the position in profit until you are happy with the profit (up to you, I recommend at least 3 years more after crossing W1 MAX(200) upwards).\n\n\nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-10 years. Never sell a losing investment!\nIf you stopped liking the stock you invested in fundamentally after you invested, just go with it and try to take profit when the price bounces from one of your buy orders and overall you did profit from the stock.\n\nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:\na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a few years\nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have the balls to ignore them\nc) with this strategy you will rarely get fully out of cash - this may be hard to stand.\n\nThis should be used on assets that are growing forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).\nI really advise buying something that is traded publicly for at least 5 years.\n\nProfits can be reinvested.\n\nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media.

I get it. As they say, \"it works until it doesn\u2019t.\u201d I've learned a valuable and expensive lesson.\n\nTo summarize, I sold some puts on margin, got caught when the market started tanking, rolled out the expiration dates a few times trying to avoid assignment and hoping for a turnaround in the markets\u2026 and now I\u2019m stuck with some seriously ITM puts and I\u2019m getting margin maintenance calls each time the stocks fall further south.\n\nHere are the options positions I\u2019m in:\n\n* AAPL: Dec 16, $165 Put (X4)\n* BITO: June 30, $35 put (X1)\n* TNA: Oct 21, $69 Put (X1)\n\nThis portfolio also includes:\n\n* AAPL: 330 shares\n* SPY: 50 shares\n* \u2026and a few others of less significant value.\n\nWhat are some of the options I have to manage this and minimize the pain and losses?\n\n1. I could wait it out, sell calls on the AAPL shares I own, and keep feeding the account with cash and hope things turn around. But that\u2019s unlikely in the timeframe I have on these contracts. Eventually these puts are all most likely going to expire ITM leaving me with a large margin debt balance and I\u2019ll be underwater on all of the shares. I can then try selling calls on the newly acquired shares, using the call premium to pay the margin interest\u2026 but that could be a long uphill, losing battle.\n2. I could 'buy to close' the puts now, taking on that expense as margin debt. This would result in less margin debt than the first option of taking assignment of the shares. But I also have to consider that buying to close the contracts leaves me with nothing. I won\u2019t have the underlying shares, so I can\u2019t sell calls or generate any cash from that scenario.\n\nWhat other ideas/options should I consider? How have you managed trades that have gone against you?\n\nLet me know if you have any questions that would help you evaluate the situation.\n\nThanks in advance for any wisdom and advice you can share.\n\n\\----\n\nEDIT to focus on main topic.", "id": "vfgcbq", "created_utc": 1655589361.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Bro, you have a margin call. You're **already** up shit creek. I can't tell you what to do, but I can tell you what I would do in your position.\n\nIf I were you, I'd get right out of these positions and start over.  Optionally cover 3 of your AAPL puts with your shares.  But that's me.  I would absolutely not take assignment of shares, especially if you have to buy them on margin.\n\nSecond, you seem to have a misunderstanding of theta - you're not and can never \"lose\" theta if you're short an option.  Value will always flow from a buyer to a seller of an option. Read up on intrinsic and extrinsic value of options.  For example AAPL is $131 a share today, but a December $165 put is $35 when. Why 35 when it only provides $34 in value? That is the extrinsic value that will flow to you as the option seller, and you still receive it whether your option is in the money or not.\n\nThird, as is often said around here - you already took this loss every time you rolled forward.  Rolling is closing the current position at a loss, and opening a new position already in the money. Rolling is saying \"I still believe in my thesis, even stronger than before.\"\n\nFinally, if you **really** don't want to close your positions, I'd at the very least hedge, which would require more capital but protect for more downside risk.  The easiest way to do this is to buy puts at or near the money to match your current short contracts and days to expiration. This will cost you a significant amount, but would limit any further downside. **This will be expensive and could end up losing even more money than you have, but will create a maximum loss.** There are many other hedging options, and I'd encourage you to look at all the options.\n\nIf it were me, I'd just close these out and take your loss, then re-evaluate.  We're in a bear market, with interest rates skyrocketing and you're in tech stocks. Do you think APPL has short term upside?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I wanted to add, if it makes you feel better or worse - the delta of your puts is -.87. You basically already own the shares.

I'll spell it out for you in Hope's you know the alphabet since, apparently, you don't know how to do your own research or read a fuckin history book.\n\nLet's go way, way back in time to the Dutch. They became the economic powerhouse and military powerhouse for a long time. Their currency was the western world's reserve currency. They had exchanges and everything else we have today without computing or electricity.\n\nInflation, competition, et al. occurred. Their wealth disappeared as did their power. Next was the English. Same shit. World's greatest navy, strongest economy, pound sterling as the reserve currency. Then gone after WW2: Electric Boogaloo.\n\nNow is America's turn. Greatest economic power the world has seen, strongest military, best tech, most pronounced exchange, USD is the world's reserve currency. I know people don't want to hear it or believe it... some may even not believe it's possible. \n\nIt is. The Dutch thought it couldn't happen to them, as did the Brits. It did. Nobody stays in control forever.\n\nNow, let's backpedal to 2008 - the systemic housing crisis. How did they \"fix\" it?\n\nInflation. \n\nWe had around a 5% interest rate as opposed to a 3.84% inflation rate in 2008. For every year past 2008, the annual average inflation rate has increased about 2% whereas the interest rate has decreased with minimal \"hikes\" which have not been even a single percent. What this did was provide an economic environment where there was more money to lend (so average joe can secure a loan for a house or whatever) and incentivized the banks to lend *more* because they *had* to lend more in order to make the same amount of money to years prior. A house of cards built upon debt. Not to mention the government bailouts for these \"too big to fail\" institutions.\n\nTo make things worse, recently the pandemic happened. The global economy nearly ground to a halt. This is very bad for a nation when their currency is the global reserve currency because now people will start calling in \"bets\" on your currency - and if your economy is in the shitter - things go from bad to worse.\n\nThat is what the current economic environment of America is currently - a house of cards built upon debt that was caused by over lending/over borrowing and was triaged by inflation. We had the chance to default - which would've hurt our credit rating and fucked our shit up for a little while - but we wouldn't be where we are now: Sprinting towards a sheer cliffside with no more road in front of us to run on.\n\nThat is what I mean by \"kick the can down the road\" and \"put band aids\".
