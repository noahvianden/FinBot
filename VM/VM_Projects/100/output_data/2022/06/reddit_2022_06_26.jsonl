If you haven\u2019t paid attention, then I\u2019ll probably reveal some of the chips in this matter to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, now almost all American invest. banks are taking out significant upsides on oil (they say that the potential for oil growth can be up to $ 150 - 170 per barrel), but moreover, this annoys me from the side that this message is addressed to the broad market. Since the \"crowd is not worthy of profit\", and it is always fooled by the market. I refer to the fact that before the future fin. crisis, oil is unlikely to cost $170 per barrel. Maybe $130 - 140 will show on the pull up, but higher growth potential seems unlikely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, there will soon be a significant bias in favor of supply in the oil market (that is, many market participants will sell more oil than is required), thereby the price will be dumped down. China and India are the main movers in the oil market in the next 6-8 months. But then everything will settle down and return to normal, thus oil will continue to grow after the crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThirdly, if the TADAWUL index falls and the price of oil rises, this is at least a signal that huge market participants are dumping positions to ordinary investors who fall for the trick of investing. banks and buy shares of oil and gas companies and other commodities at mid-term highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill there be a collapse in oil prices? Yes, it will be within the framework of the future financial crisis! Will there be a decrease in inflation in the world? Yes, it will be, indirectly the market is already betting on this event by selling shares of oil and gas companies. But will the decline in inflation be long-term? No, this is a local crisis phenomenon marked by the economy entering a deflationary (crisis) spiral, that is, commodity prices will fall as part of a recession, and thus inflation will decrease in the short term. It should also be borne in mind that the Fed is sleeping and sees how to launch economic stimulus programs as soon as possible as part of a loose monetary policy so that US stock indices again begin to desperately grow in the financial. doping, so the growth of inflation in the future on the factor of an inherent increase in commodity prices is doomed!\n\nAlso, pay attention to the new cover of The Economist, they noted in it that in the near future the whole world will experience all the negativity of the energy crisis. IMO this is a clear sign of the top.\n\nWhat all this will lead to? Inflation will be tamed for a while, but since the economy will be limping there will another round of QE which lead to even greater inflation and the oil prices will go up even higher. The coming years will be brutal.\n\nFor now, for the love of God do not go long on energy, it is extremely risky.  \n\n\nP.S.  It is just my theory lol, I don't know anything for sure. I am as retarded as any of you. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8eh82hbky791.jpg?width=973&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e022b8a5c2ee35737c53784b6564739bc6f8b16", "id": "vl3kuo", "created_utc": 1656246162.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|56|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vl3kuo)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vl3kuo)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09323401004076004}, {"body": "the parabolic move in oil doesn't necessarily mean it will \"crash\" like it did in 08. oil can actually stay elevated for years (i.e. crude prices stayed above 100 for 4 fucking years from 11\\~14), which is why simply shorting parabolic moves can fuck you.\n\ni disagree and actually think there's a good chance oil will stay \\~100/bbl for a while  without a crash. demand destruction isn't seen at these prices even with a coin toss of a recession., supply constraint will occur for the unforeseeable future (i.e. rus vs ukraine), china is reopening, hostile US nations will keep it elevated to fuck the US for as long as possible.", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Even at 90 a barrel most large oil and gas companies are trading at a huge discount to valuation right now.

Ten years later, the price had dropped to $7 per ton. Afterward Coal's price increased into the 1900's.

{"title": "The recent Friday rally explained", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/rjpw7y5wpz791.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3881287f2d482261cb00413daf777bec51b47cb\n\nOn Friday we saw a massive rally more specifically at 10 am. The data that came out at 10am was \"bullish\". It was actually expected to be interpreted as bullish based on the futures rising that day and seeing a rally all morning into that period and beyond.\n\nI only point this out because any data that is showing inflation \"topping\" out is being grasped onto for all possible hope. Since there are a ton of shorts in the market, we are witnessing bear market short squeezes rather than rally if you want to understand them better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hruwidzbqz791.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=8facb266718b0eb179ed7c072b35f3bce69aeaed\n\nThe data at 10am showed that consumer sentiment was 0.2 lower (pessimism flattening out) and new home sales rose higher than the expected forecast. So wall street is interpreting this as bullish af. I was pessimistic generally speaking after Thursday but I have noticed everyone has become very pessimistic so the money to be made is by being optimistic even if irrationally.\n\nI personally trade during the day or 1-2 day trades. This said the week overall coming up imo is a do or die for the current squeeze going on. ANY data that comes out not horrendous will continue the pump all week and these are the data that are coming out:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkzbi7yqrz791.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=a02b4e9b893492a2065d618c5a405a91b1c92d42\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qn89750urz791.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c04e348680b129bb91c40c9c0dcea2fadd84f86\n\nMonday imo will just be a continuation of the current rally. With more housing data showing up, considering the housing data that reinforced SPY at 10am on Friday was positive, I would expect a good move higher in anticipation and after having that data. This will set the bullish feel in the air so to speak. Consumer confidence and more housing comes out on Tuesday and these were already interpreted as bullish thus Tuesday continues the rally.\n\nGDP estimates come out Wednesday. As these are just estimates I think the theme will still be bullish here. I just don't see any bombshell data that discourages the FOMO surrounding your typical squeeze for the week.\n\nThursday is where it might get dicey. There is alot of data to digest and its all about the consumer. Is inflation showing a leveling or rising? Does the consumer have extra cash and are they spending it? Is unemployment rising in May? Is manufacturing showing more weaknesses? OPEC is missing from the calendar but they are also meeting on Thursday!\n\nI personally believe Thursday is going to be the turning point day IF there even is one. Historically it pays to bet on the week leading into or during July 4th with the week just ending higher since 2018 (I only went back that far). With it being a major holiday, I don't see the market doing any bad stuff but if it will, they can de risk on Thursday and go about their early vacation to wherever all the rich people go for 4th of July. Friday will just be a continuation of whatever Thursday brings. You have PMI data but you already got that insight from Thursday.\n\nWhats important is you need to keep in mind your timeframe. If your planning on laying down some puts that are 3 weeks out, maybe wait for the crescendo of bullishness to take place on Wednesday and do it 30 mins before the day is over. If you think wall street is out for the bears lunch money, play this week assuming its green all week and get out on any extreme bullishness.\n\nOn SPY there is still a gap to fill at 400. Theres alot of bullish calls out interestingly since Friday as though someone wants the market to rally. One suggested even 7% with the rebalancing. Rebalancing is not going to take a full 5 days to complete. It could be done as soon as the end of Monday and they will rely on retail to jump in and complete the move all week.\n\nTLDR; all data will be interpreted as positive and keep the market rally in tact until at least Thursday where for me its a coin flip. Wednesday near EOD presents the best shorting day and Monday at open or just general weakness through the day  is the entry to ride the bull week. Expect heavy volumes and so up and down moves will mean what they are trying to say. Professionals always control the end of the day and the end of a week. Remember when you see those rug pulls, they just so happen at the end of the day or into the end of a week!", "id": "vl8wam", "created_utc": 1656262022.0, "score": 197, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|33|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1279|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vl8wam)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vl8wam)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08368683606386185}, {"body": "Holy shit.
