There's a couple of different purposes crypto could fill:\n\n**Store of value**\n\nObviously talking about BTC here. A big issue in the world is that 90%+ of people don't have a way to store their wealth.  Real inflation has been 10-20% per year since 2000, so saving money is counterproductive. Until recently people couldn't even invest in the S&P easily, and even then it is at risk of market downturns.\n\nThe other alternatives (mainly real estate and gold) are inaccessible to people without considerable wealth, and cost money to hold (~3% a year for real estate to maintain its value and sub-1% for storage plus 2% inflation for gold).\n\nObviously BTC still has the same problems as the S&P and worse today, but the mistake that people make is that \"because BTC is volatile it's a bad store of value\". That's true, but nobody is buying it as a store of value today. The bet here is that it will become a store of value in 5-20 years as institutional adoption continues to increase, and if that happens it'll appreciate enormously. So essentially it's an investment today on the basis that it will become a store of value one day.\n\n**Smart contracts / block chain / Web 3.0**\n\nThis is a bit of a wide and undefined one, but cryptos like ETH allow people to build application and systems that were previously impossible. These are systems where the Blockchain, which is a neutral decentralised database that cannot be controlled by any person or entity, determines the \"truth\" of a system.\n\nWithout going into the complex details, this allows you to create smart contracts, where instead of doing work and then getting paid at the risk of someone not paying, the system determines whether the conditions were met and releases the funds after the contract was fulfilled.\n\nThis could also allow governments to let people vote digitally without a risk of fraud (no more \"stop the steal\"), allows companies to link digital and physical items with NFTs (e.g. a stolen Rolex or painting is no longer worth anything since you don't have the NFT to prove your item is real and you're the rightful owner), and many much more complex applications.\n\nThis is also what people consider web 3.0, where eventually every company will need to become a crypto company just like in the 90s/2000s every company had to become an internet/software company.\n\n**Digital currencies**\n\nThis is the last and least interesting use of cryptocurrency, and outside of stablecoins, that form a bridge between real currency and crypto, almost all of them add little to no value and/or are a complete scam.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "TY, very much- appreciate the great detail.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.06796673685312271}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.008329923264682293}, {"body": "Bye bye crypto", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, surely crypto is going away now despite all the institutional adoption, and it's not just another crypto winter like the last 5... :')", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6810129284858704}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16284188628196716}, {"body": "Ponzi Schemes went bust?

That can be done both to the upside and the downside, but you've got to be careful where you enter and exit. Here is a strategy that's worked for me.\n\nEveryone says SQQQ and TQQQ shouldn't be held for long periods, and I agree with them, particularly when it comes to SQQQ. But over short durations it can be a profitable strategy.\n\n1) Wait for a few hard days like we've had recently. Layer into a TQQQ position. If the next day is rough again, double down. If the next day is rough too, double down again. This requires very patient and calculated buy ins as well as having a % target in mind for when to sell.\n\n2) If a market bounce occurs, SQQQ is your friend. In this macro environment bounces will be sold off as you've seen recently. Again, doubling down on the days where the market rallies is a bold strategy but it works if you are selective, aggressive, and have lots of cash to deploy. I also wouldn't do this with a large position.\n\nIn either of these scenarios I'm talking about taking maybe a $1,000 position in either TQQQ or SQQQ after a big drop or rally respectively. From there it's about being prepared to double position size several times on the giant swing days if they aren't going your way.\n\nI generally look to sell the bounces in the 10-20% profit area.\n\nIt's bold, it's risky (although not as risky as calls IMO) and for me it has worked. I'm not willing to deploy more than about $20,000 in one go with this strategy, so beginning with maybe a $1,000 position allows me to double my deployment 4 or 5 times on the crazy days.\n\nI'd be excited to hear other specific strategies to take advantage of volatility.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting strategy, and I kinda see the logic here.

At what point do you cut losses if you don't see timing in your favor?\n\nAlso, what macro trends are you using to forecast your exits?

So my starting point is favourable. When I'm doubling down, I'm waiting to see the NASDAQ rip through a 5-15% uptick. 5-15% will get me 15-45% of a gain if things are timed perfectly, and if I hit it on my first try (before having to resort to doubling down). That's unrealistic. Usually I end up doubling down once or twice, and sit at a 10-15% loss before getting a few big green days. From there I exit 10-20% ahead, sometimes more and sometimes less depending on how sentiment is through those days.\n\nOn the other hand, if I hit a 20% loss and sentiment is remaining ultra bearish or if there is anything funky in the news, I'll usually bail.\n\nDue to the fact that it's such an aggressive strategy, it works out in my favor around 80-85% of the time. It won't work if you're timid because you won't be able to pull the trigger on the scary days.
