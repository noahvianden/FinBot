Secondly, Citi is also predicting a recession in a rather abrupt period of time.\n\nI don't really know what to make of this prediction, seeing as how hot the job market and consumer spending appears to be.

I follow 20+ Canadian oil stocks, NONE are increasing production more than 5-10%, with a laser like focus on returning FCF to shareholders as opposed to growing production. Cenovus recently said it will direct 100% of FCF to shareholders once debt targets are reached. \n3. Oil extraction and refining are capital intensive. With the end of the oil era still 10 years away,  investment in large production is not happening. **Fear of peak demand has created peak supply.** There are some new players, but no huge mega projects on the horizon to alleviate even current demand.\n4. OPEC can't fulfill current production quota's, so saudi's to the rescue is highly unlikely. \n5. INVENTORY NUMBERS. The US inventory numbers looks horrrrrribly tight, 15% below 5 the low end of the 5 year average. Cushing is nearly empty.

Lockdowns could do that, as well as high prices. \n\nGovernments will take action against oil revenues. UK is already doing it. FUD will lower oil share prices if not oil price itself. \n\nOPEC doesn\u2019t need to do anything, but individual states can. Iran almost has their bomb. No need to sanction when they have it. Venezuela is dying to start selling, they just need to wait till after midterms because dems are more afraid of GOP than inflation. And then there is Russia. Our shortage is China and Indian gain. There\u2019s no shortage, there\u2019s an artificial market interruption that is temporary in nature. \n\nAnd last but not least, this pandemic is far from over. At some point we are going to have to fight this thing like China does because our new normal is not sustainable. Too many people are sick and that\u2019s the real reason for shortages and consequently inflation. Inflation will not be controlled until Covid is controlled.
