The truth was that all tests used the vial and competitors' equipment, none of the test results were from their own technology which did not work.\n\nTesla sells a product called \"Full Self Driving.\"  But this is just the name of the product basically, it has no standard legal definition.  Tesla's instructions say that the driver must remain focused on the road, hands on the wheel, ready to actively drive the vehicle at any moment.  This doesn't sound like \"Full\" anything to me, sounds like there's a LOT of self-driving-ness yet to be delivered.

{"title": "$SPY - Predictions for the week of 6/13", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/c2jzxqicu0591.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=a99e14cc79d7a8029044dc59b2709c40284e204f)\n\nSimple TA I will be watching\n\nResistance Area \\~432 \\~412\n\nStrong Support Area \\~388\n\nRSI < 10 is very oversold (currently a weak indicator though)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzjz4qkkw0591.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff5c6ffe32014f2be393db93cb1b22d3e153cd1d\n\nAfter $SPY was rangebound for over a week there was finally a breakout led by negative news.  Some people are not realizing how bad the 8.6% CPI report was... the highest analyst estimate was 8.5%.  Our government is not being honest about the current economic situation (not that I would expect them to be).  The federal reserve has been consistently wrong about inflation over the past 2 years.  There is one thing that they are being honest about, inflation needs to be brought down fast.  Jerome Powell already knows he needs to save reserve currency status and bring down inflation as fast as possible.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/l99m90dxx0591.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ac8bd7ba32d355e0f2708a9f72cac2a26df7b74)\n\nThe bond market has always been a very good indicator of what the federal reserve will follow for the effective rate.  The 6-month and 2-year yields are what I like to check.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/9f10iba901591.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ada35e9b96a8b4f2a8975ab47a2d2a61bde5d98)\n\nThe goal is for the effective rate to reach the 6-month yields, a spread of more than 50bp in the 6-month yields and effective rate will most likely signal a rise in rates.  There are 2 possibilities for next week when Jerome Powell decides how much to raise rates (Purple Line - 75bp rise, Blue Line - 50bp rise).  At the current 6-month yield a 50bp rate hike would equal a 46bp spread from the 6-month yield.  I think the federal reserve will be watching what the equity markets are anticipating... shown above if the 6-month price continues to drop and the yield increase to around 2.23% then I will say there is a 99% chance of a 75bp rate hike.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9tgyaf931591.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7de398e8afd784af07e63ebfbd7d1bb8210fd65\n\nThe 30Y - 5Y bond yields were also inverted this week,  the bond market always shows the economy's health... and right now it is warning of a recession.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pht8ks04a1591.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca461acebd5b28e07faafee5ef19ef14c0773ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vuqefvpv41591.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3c37c9a7bb6d75c89c0c0da0e6871a296c2d1b2\n\nAnother problem is that our government thinks the economy is strong, this is because consumers keep spending and spending.  This spending is not lasting though and has started to slow down from inflationary pressures.  People are now borrowing money and using their savings just to keep up with inflation.  This cannot last much longer.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Federal Reserve Calander](https://preview.redd.it/wjuyr99lf1591.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef02627fc8e7e7291768fc110d2675623a4d522b)\n\nAlso, 8:30 AM on Tuesday is PPI\n\n**Recap**\n\n$SPY should be rangebound again this week, there shouldn't be any closing price under 388 or above 400.  If 6-month yields rise to about 2.23% expect a 75bp rate hike, otherwise 50bp.\n\n[5-day outlook is kind of a joke don't take this serious](https://preview.redd.it/c5kbndtvh1591.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f609c770c7d8cbaf806cd193ecdd9204b40901f)\n\nI will respond to every comment!", "id": "va460m", "created_utc": 1654974091.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|31|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|851|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ukkumd/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_59/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skwpds/spy_current_week_analysis_next_week_predictions/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcoh2o/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_314/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/swfwtz/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_221/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7jifc/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_37/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sqwd9c/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_214/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t23ypl/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_228/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/va460m/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_613/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upmtnf/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_516/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tp494n/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_328/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uaa3k6/the_real_reason_behind_the_invasion_spy/) \n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=va460m)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=va460m)\n    \nHey /u/5k4_5k4, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48382580280303955}, {"body": "My dogs birthday is on Wednesday.

I seem to recall Nokia had one a while back as well, but I can\u2019t seem to find proof at this point. Those cameras are becoming more frequent, so at some point the usual big companies will follow suit if it takes off.\n\nNext, you should consider how it\u2019s viewed. The video you linked uses the phone to scan around, but true VR will almost certainly use a headset like the Oculus. VR Web Browsers such as Janus & Firefox Reality have largely been closing down lately, but there are still browsers like Wolvic around.\n\nFinally, it may be worth keeping an eye on sites like PornHub to see what companies start to develop it more & more. Yes, this is a financial excuse to look at porn. If you start to see more trends & more views on a particular company\u2019s style, it\u2019s possible that could be a good company to follow financially.
