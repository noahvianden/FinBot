{"title": "Intel to Acquire Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 Billion", "selftext": "It looks like Intel is looking to increase their custom foundry capacity through acquisition to compliment their current organic fab build-out efforts. Interestingly, the numerous mentions of Tower's deep customer relationships makes me wonder if they were also working to beef up the customer service aspect of the custom foundry side as well (I have heard some talk that Intel has a relative paucity of experience working as a fab for external customers, but I have no evidence one way or another).\n\n\nFrom the press release: https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1527/intel-to-acquire-tower-semiconductor-for-5-4-billion\n\n>SANTA CLARA, Calif. & MIGDAL HAEMEK, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC) and Tower Semiconductor (Nasdaq: TSEM), a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions, today announced a definitive agreement under which Intel will acquire Tower for $53 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion. The acquisition significantly advances Intel\u2019s IDM 2.0 strategy as the company further expands its manufacturing capacity, global footprint and technology portfolio to address unprecedented industry demand. \n\n...\n\n>Tower\u2019s expertise in specialty technologies, such as radio frequency (RF), power, silicon-germanium (SiGe) and industrial sensors, extensive IP and electronic design automation (EDA) partnerships, and established foundry footprint will provide broad coverage to both Intel and Tower\u2019s customers globally. Tower serves high-growth markets such as mobile, automotive and power. Tower operates a geographically complementary foundry presence with facilities in the U.S. and Asia serving fabless companies as well as IDMs and offers more than 2 million wafer starts per year of capacity \u2013 including growth opportunities in Texas, Israel, Italy and Japan. Tower also brings a foundry-first customer approach with an industry-leading customer support portal and IP storefront, as well as design services and capabilities. \n\n\nDisclosure: INTC shareholder\n\nedit: added a section from the press release\n\nEdit 2: I realized I should also disclose than I am an AMD and AAPL shareholder for the sake of transparency.", "id": "stusw7", "created_utc": 1645014764.0, "score": 482, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "As a holder of intel leaps this seems like good news.

{"title": "Google announces privacy changes to Android that will limit user data", "selftext": "[https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-privacy-sandbox-android/](https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-privacy-sandbox-android/)\n\nSummary:\n\n* It's a response to Apple's IDFA change that screwed FB\n* Google had to do something because it doesn't want to look bad and Apple has been touting its change as a user privacy benefit\n* Google's change is less drastic than Apple's, which was announced without giving any developers notice, and without any options\n* Google will focus on limiting the granularity of the user's data available to ads and aggregate more data instead of showing user level data\n* Advertisers will still have data, just less of it, and in more aggregated form instead of individual\n* For example, Google itself will now scan the user's app usage patterns and create an interests profile of the user. An interest could be stocks or pizza. Then Google will share these interests with advertisers. This means Google now controls that data, instead of a company like Facebook that collected this data themselves. This gives a ton of power to Google.\n* Google's change will roll out in 2 years\n* It's more advertiser-friendly than what Apple did\n* But it's still a net negative to ad companies like FB, Snap, etc over what is there today\n\nOne very important thing to note is that Google learned from Apple's change that without cross-platform tracking, advertisers bought more search ads instead because the user's intent was more direct. This led to more business for Google. I [highlighted it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/) why Google was salivating at the thought of doing this on Android too, in order to drive more ad business to its search and weaken Facebook.\n\nFacebook has been renting the penthouse in the Apple Condo building and the Google Condo building. It was a good life. But now the owners of the buildings, Apple and Google, want to take the penthouses back.\n\n**Quick overview of how Apple and Google screwed FB:**\n\nEach user has a unique ID on iOS and one on Android. For example, mine might be 696969.\n\nMany apps use Facebook's ad services. In order to use FB's service, they have to add some Facebook code to their app to track conversions. For example, if I saw an ad for Robinhood on Instagram, I go download the app, I open the app, the little Facebook code on Robinhood will send a message to Zuckerberg HQ that user 696969 has downloaded the app. This allowed advertisers to know how effective each Facebook ad was. Now advertisers have no clue.\n\nIt just so happens that this tiny piece of Facebook code will also know that user 696969 opened this app at 7:02 am. And a finance app at 9:00am. A game at 10am.  And so on. Facebook stores this data and starts building a profile of me, even outside of FB, Instagram, and Whatsapp.\n\nBesides ads on IG, FB, and Whatsapp, Facebook also had the Audience Network. If I made a free app, I could show ads from Facebook and split the revenue with Facebook. Previously, Facebook knew exactly who you were even on 3rd party apps because my ID 696969 was still visible. This allowed Facebook to continue to show relevant ads to users. Not anymore.\n\nOn iOS, FB has no real way of knowing who is who anymore because it doesn't see 696969 anymore. FB is left on its own. Well played, Apple.\n\nOn Android, FB won't see who 696969 is anymore, but FB can request a profile, such as interests, of this anonymous user. But it's now Google that is the one creating a profile of me, and then sharing it anonymously with Facebook. It's a power move by Google. Google is saying to FB, \"you eat what I give you son\".

I'd say most people on this subreddit are bearish or they just hate facebook. Here are some of my reasons. (This is just my opinion by the way)\n\nFor one, if you look at the company's financials, it doesn't tell the tale of a dying company. FB's sales, operating income, and cash flow not only increased YOY but accelerated, meaning the percentage increase in those keys metrics from 2020 to 2021 was greater than 2019 to 2020. FB was able to do this despite the fact that Apple implemented the IDFA change in spring of 2021. How is FB able to do this? I suspect that FB's e-commerce business is starting to take off. This is a bit anecdotal, but small business owners I've met rely on Instagram and/or Facebook to connect with customers. A florist told me that she couldn't possibly run her business without Instagram as it essentially is her storefront. It draws in customers that she couldn't attract otherwise.\n\nThe privacy change in Android is not as drastic and will not be implemented for at least two years. That gives FB, and other app developers, plenty of time to work on a solution. Also, FWIW, Google said that they will be taking their time in implementing the change to ensure that businesses and developers have the tools to succeed on mobile.\n\nAs for metaverse, it is too early to say whether the massive investments will ultimately pay off, but the beginning signs are promising. FB's Quest 2 is the most popular headset, and FB has been increasing its marketshare overall: [https://www.statista.com/chart/11006/vr-and-ar-headset-shipments/](https://www.statista.com/chart/11006/vr-and-ar-headset-shipments/)\n\nEvery business faces challenges. It's how management responds to the challenges that separate the winners from the losers. Say what you want about Zuckerberg's likability, but he has guided FB through difficult times: the Cambridge Analytica scandal, 2020 boycotts, constant blame for causing society's problems. FB continues to grow and reward its shareholders.

So now the company needs to decide do they want to make more shovels but make less money. Or make less shovels and make the same amount of money.
