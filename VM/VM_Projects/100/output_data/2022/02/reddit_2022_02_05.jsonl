{"title": "Amazon Prime's price increase will result in an increase of ~$4 billion in annual revenue for Amazon", "selftext": "Amazon Prime rates are going up for US Customers on Feb 18th. **What that means for Amazon's revenue generated from Prime memberships?**\n\nAmazon had \\~151.9M US Customers in 2021. And its projected to have \\~157.4M by end of 2022. The annual price increase: $119 > $139, will generate an additional $3.8B in revenue\n\n(151.9M @ $119 = $18.07B | 157.4M @ $139 = $21.87B)\n\nBut, only half (48%) of subscribers pay annually. 52% of Prime Subscribers in US who pay monthly (with relatively high loyalty - 97%), their rates are increasing from $12.99 to $14.99, resulting in the following numbers:\n\n(78.98M @ $12.99 = $12.31B | 81.85M @ $14.99 = $14.72B)\n\nAn increase of $2.41B in revenue from monthly members.\n\nAdjusting the annual numbers a bit. For the annual subscribers (48% of total US customer), the updated numbers look like this:\n\n(72.91M @ $119 = $8.67B | 75.55M @ $139 = $10.50B)\n\nWhich would result in an adjusted increase of $1.825B from annual subscribers.\n\nThus, Amazon will generate an additional $4.235B ($2.41B+$1.825B) in revenue as a result of this price increase.\n\nThe higher rates for monthly members, an increase of $24 per year, versus an increase $20 for annual members could see a migration of some monthly members to annual membership.\n\nAnd, maybe that is what Amazon is trying to accomplish here. Remains to be seen if higher monthly costs will cause monthly subscribers to churn or convert to annual subscribers\n\n**TLDR**: Same as title, the increase in Amazon Prime prices will result in an increase of \\~$4.235B in annual revenue for Amazon from Prime memberships.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-prime-fee-rise-180-175155725.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-prime-fee-rise-180-175155725.html)\n\n[https://backlinko.com/amazon-prime-users](https://backlinko.com/amazon-prime-users)[https://reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/](https://reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/)", "id": "slh5fj", "created_utc": 1644096323.0, "score": 218, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Or maybe subscribers, like myself, who have already seen what little good content there is, will be prompted to cancel membership", "score": 327, "replies": [{"body": "I just canceled mine, also my brother is going to cancel his in the coming weeks before renewing his account.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "Just cancelled too!", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "About to cancel mine.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "I am canceling for sure when renewal time comes.

{"title": "Amazon Prime's price increase will result in an increase of ~$4B in annual revenue for Amazon", "selftext": "Amazon Prime rates are going up for US Customers on Feb 18th. **What that means for Amazon's revenue generated from Prime memberships?**\n\nAmazon had \\~151.9M US Customers in 2021. And its projected to have \\~157.4M by end of 2022. The annual price increase: $119 > $139, will generate an additional $3.8B in revenue\n\n(151.9M @ $119 = $18.07B  | 157.4M @ $139 = $21.87B)\n\nBut, only half (48%) of subscribers pay annually. 52% of Prime Subscribers in US who pay monthly (with relatively high loyalty - 97%), their rates are increasing from $12.99 to $14.99, resulting in the following numbers:\n\n(78.98M @ $12.99 = $12.31B | 81.85M @ $14.99 = $14.72B)\n\nAn increase of $2.41B in revenue from monthly members.\n\nAdjusting the annual numbers a bit. For the annual subscribers (48% of total US customer), the updated numbers look like this:\n\n(72.91M @ $119 = $8.67B | 75.55M @ $139 = $10.50B)\n\nWhich would result in an adjusted increase of $1.825B from annual subscribers.\n\nThus, Amazon will generate an additional $4.235B ($2.41B+$1.825B) in revenue as a result of this price increase.\n\nThe higher rates for monthly members, an increase of $24 per year, versus an increase $20 for annual members could see a migration of some monthly members to annual membership.\n\nAnd, maybe that is what Amazon is trying to accomplish here. Remains to be seen if higher monthly costs will cause monthly subscribers to churn or convert to annual subscribers\n\n**TLDR**: Same as title, the increase in Amazon Prime prices will result in an increase of \\~$4.235B in annual revenue for Amazon from Prime memberships.\n\nSources:[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-prime-fee-rise-180-175155725.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-prime-fee-rise-180-175155725.html)[https://backlinko.com/amazon-prime-users](https://backlinko.com/amazon-prime-users)[https://reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/](https://reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/)  \n\n\nEdit: formatting", "id": "sksmkf", "created_utc": 1644019573.0, "score": 406, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 258, "comments": [{"body": "Only using it because i can use my student account.", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "Same here.

{"title": "Am I the only one who thinks the market got FB and AMZN wrong?", "selftext": "If we delve into the earnings reports for both companies, almost 80% of Amazon's EPS came from it's stake in Rivian as of Dec 31 (which at this point is now much lower). They would have missed earnings without Rivian, and they missed revenue estimates (during a time of 7% inflation, that's actually pretty bad). In addition, their profit margins and FCF decreased. FCF was actually negative, to the tune of $-9 billion. \n\nLets compare that to Facebook/meta. Facebook's advertising income grew 20% YoY, and their VR segment grew by 22%. They beat revenue estimates but missed EPS by 4%. However, they only missed EPS because of a $3.3 billion loss in their VR segment. Without that loss, they would have easily beat EPS by over 20% as well as beating on revenues. Their FCF and profit margins also increased YoY. \n\nIf we compare guidance between the two they both reported disappointing guidance of only 2-8% growth in Q2. However, Facebook is valued at ~17 PE currently while Amazon has a PE of ~59. \n\nSo two companies with equal growth rates - however FB has increasing profits and FCF while Amazon has decreasing profits and FCF.\n\nThe only thing I can think that explains this is that the market is completely discounting FB's VR investment and not expecting any profits from this segment, ever. This makes no sense because their VR segment is already making over $2.2 billion in revenues per year (with an appstore that brings in high profit margins) while their losses in VR will slowly decrease as their research & development matures. \n\nIn contrast Amazon has a good AWS business that has 40% annual growth and good margins. However this is heavily offset by a generally low-profit to unprofitable retail business. I'm a little worried about this because other companies that have a high-margin platform/software business combined with a money-losing retail/hardware business (ROKU, PTON) have also been heavily overvalued in the past and fell sharply when they posted even a slight miss in ER. \n\nDisclaimer - I have positions in both FB and AMZN", "id": "skvnqm", "created_utc": 1644027918.0, "score": 246, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 279, "comments": [{"body": "I think the same as you.

For many, the best days of Facebook are behind the company.\n\nIt's interesting how this issue comes up almost exclusively in discussions about Facebook, when among all companies that generate revenue from online ads (hey there, Google), it is the best positioned one in order to handle this change. Why? Because the feature **requires app developers to ask for permissions before they track people's activity across apps or websites they don\u2019t own in order to target advertising to them** and Facebook, given the nature of its business, **still has access to an enormous amount of high quality data**.\n\nIt's obvious that Apple's feature does not allow Facebook to harvest data as effectively as it did before, but you know, you can deny Facebook permission to track your data across apps or websites it doesn\u2019t own as much as you want but if you then log in on Facebook (or Instagram, for that matter) to write a post about how good the Big Mac that you had for lunch was, you're still providing Facebook with a mountain of valuable data.\n\nBefore Apple launched its new App Tracking Transparency feature in iOS 14.5, Facebook had complete control of its game. What about now that this feature is available then? Apple global smartphone market Share is about 30%. Of that 30%, 86% of iOS devices are running a recent enough version of the software to be presented with ATT prompts, according to an October report from AppsFlyer. Of the people who see the pop-up, **38% are still opting-in**, and 62% are opting-out. Being 100% the global smartphone market share, **only about 16% is using the feature**. Yep, the days of Facebook are definitely numbered.\n\nOne of the posts that really stuck with me was the one arguing that now it's just about iOS devices but pretty soon also Android will follow suit.
