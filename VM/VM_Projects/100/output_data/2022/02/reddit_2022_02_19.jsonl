Many like to talk about crash and they bring up 2008 crash, dot com bubble or even 19th centuries decade of bear market to predict similar bear market to come. This is why I say things are different than those time. If you want to compare a crash that suits our current environment then why not simply look at coronavirus crash? Market went down very fast 45 percent ish down and guess how long that lasted ? 21 days. One can say it was fed stepping in but if we have a 45 percent crash then we will have fed stepping in again. My thesis stands that the pace of recovery will be much faster and can\u2019t be compared to old days where it could take years to a decade.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Strange you'd be critical of the fact that I'm not citing sources when you're not citing any. \n\n[\"This time it's different.\" ](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22this+time+it%27s+different%22+stock+msrket&oq=%22this+time+it%27s+different%22+stock+msrket&aqs=chrome..69i57.8125j0j4&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8) is an idiom ubiquitous to every stock market crash. I didn't think you'd need a source as it's widely known. \n\nLet me know what stats you have that demonstrates the covid crash. I don't think it's an apt comparison at all. \n\nThe Covid crash was a black swan event that no one anticipated. There is no black swan event now.\n\nThe markets plunged over 10% on single days in 2020. That is not characteristic of the plunge we have now - which took a month plus to drop 10%\n\nThe recovery was created by massive government intervention across the globe. Here is a chart I did when researching the effects of government checks on the stock market: [Source](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/QQQ/Ibf3xkgt-Effects-of-Stimulus-on-Stock-Market/)\n\nThat isn't happening now and cannot for some time. Government aid has been eliminated and impossible to create now given the debt to GDP ratio, inflation and the fact that Biden can't get bills passed because of lack of support.\n\nTypically, stock markets aren't that affected by pandemics so a speedy recovery is in keeping with that [historical narrative. ](https://www.investopedia.com/the-history-of-pandemics-and-stock-markets-5093256)\n\nNegative catalysts we have now (I'm not citing sources for each, you can easily Google them):\n\nGlobal unrest due to military threats \n\nIncreasing interest rates \n\n40 year high inflation \n\nPotential recession looming \n\nSupply chain issues \n\nJobs numbers and retail sales falling dramatically (go look up the non-adjusted numbers, not the ones that were \"seasonally adjusted\" to prevent panic)\n\nUnprecedented leverage on the equity and crypto markets \n\nRecord Buffet indicator \n\nRecord P/E ratios in the market \n\nDecade low consumer sentiment \n\nRecord high growth in household consumer debt (up $1.4 trillion compared to 2019)\n\nStimulus that suppressed: student loan payments, mortgage payments, bankruptcies, evictions and foreclosures (stimulus which is now gone) \n\nStimulus for businesses,, free money for every person in the U.S. plus increased unemoyment payments which is now gone. \n\nNone of these were present in pre-crash 2020.\n\nThings the current crash has in common with the crashes in 1636, 1929, 2000, 2008 (again go look it up if you want sources - they aren't hard to find):\n\nArtificially inflated asset prices \n\nNew speculative assets (tulips, dot com start ups, housing investments, crypto, NFTs)\n\nRecord high leverage in the market \n\nParabolic growth in stock market (10 years before the '29 crash the Dow went up 500% which is what just happened in the last 10 years)\n\nDramatic increase of new investors with a \"can't lose mentality\"\n\n2000 and 2008 did not happen rapidly. This crash appears to have the same characteristics so far. \n\nEvery crash is different. Suggesting one is exactly like another is silly. But there are common characteristics to each which cannot be ignored. \n\nThere is far more evidence that the Covid crash was not like this crash than there is evidence that supports that. \n\nStaying things move fast so recovery will be fast and the Fed will step in isn't much of an argument. It's no argument without proof. \n\nLikening the 2020 recovery to the current situation doesn't have a lot of logic as an argument.

I said I agree with you most except the point you made about market not coming years or decade using some historical example. I disagreed saying that if such crash were to happen it will be short lived because of the sheer pace money can flow in and out. Covid crash was used as an example for the pace it recovered as a similarity not as like of like macro outlooks. We can\u2019t really use past pandemics as a historical examples either as it didn\u2019t affect the whole planet. However the point still stands that a recovery happened very quick and how market swings up and down now a days was never possible in the past due to absence of computerized trading abilities.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear on thing we don\u2019t have a crash now. We have a correction which is different in nature. My point was if it turned out to be crash it would recover much faster than in the past. There is no black swan event now but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be one. There are lot of cash on the sidelines now and in an inflated economy there is not many places to put that cash to use. Once we see a correction turning in to mini crash will reprice the market enough for the sidelined cash to buy in to the market.\n\nFinally saying things like recovery will be fast and fed will step in when market crashes is a valid argument. Anyone knows fed always steps in when market crashes. 2008 they reversed their course not just by raising rates rather they cut rates as soon as market crashed. They did same in covid crash by changing monetary policy. You saying fed won\u2019t step in in fact is not an argument at all. My point still stands about the pace it will recover if you looked at trend in your historical data then you would notice recovery time got faster over time.

I worked for about 9 months as a investigator in Navalny's Anticorruption Foundation in one of regional branches until it was ruled as extremists organization and was disbanded in May, 2021.\n\nYou have to understand that NATO expansion isn't the reason for putin to be a dick. putin is a dick, that's why countries want to join NATO. If you a an intelligent man, you would keep good and healthy relationship based on trust with your neighbors if you happen to be an elected president.\n\nSecond, nobody in Russia is afraid of NATO intervention. Because west don't have any incentive for it. Current western economics is build around open markets and qualified brains, not around raw resources. There is no way for any country to make profit out of invading Russia, even considering all the natural resources. You will get buried under sanctions, you have to maintain order and fight militia, deal with sabotages and so on. Moreover, many, if not most of the mining ALREADY owned by foreign entities thanks to full tolerance to bribery at any desired level. Another point is the fact that no resource-wealthy countries in Europe got invaded by anyone so far even then they don't have nuclear weapon and other means of preventing invasions. And then there is a popular half-joke then people actually want for NATO to invade and maybe after that life of a regular citizen start to get better.\n\nAll the agenda putin is pushing is ENTIRELY artificial propaganda and never was the real reason for all that putin fuckery. He is more than 21 years in power, he is way out of touch with reality, he uses internet printed for him on paper. His life basically have nothing in common with any of us.\n\nHe have a big complex about his height (he is something like 162cm height) (google \"\u043f\u044b\u043d\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b\" for giggles), he can't stand that he was banned from G8 and other major forums and organizations. No VIPs from other countries visit Russia during national celebrating's as they used to. He want for others to respect him (just because) and accounted with. As a sick person he provoke others to pay attention to him, play games with him, visit him for advice.\n\nAll this military crap is a result of his phobias (being a KGB agent played a big role in how he perceive world order today) and inferiority complex.\n\nAll this might not be 100% true, but at least it's based on many years of analyzing him through his deeds, his friends deeds, witnessing the system he created, countless independent journalistic investigations being read and so on.

And here we are, once again, the consequences for him will be so bad that as an intelligent human being he should back off and never threaten anyone ever again. But backing off will hurt his pride, for him it will look like he is a looser. Still, there was instances then he was a looser. For instance then Navalny assassination failed, it wasn't an option for him to see Navalny alive. The only thing that keep Navalny alive today is the wide international attention (it's sooo easy to kill him while he is in prison), so we can say that there are still things which putin can't ignore.\n\nIn my opinion at first he was certain to invade like it was in the past: organize provocation and use it as a reason. But once again, we maybe being saved by wide international attention. Then others laugh off Biden's or other leaders for talking too much about the war, I'm grateful for their attention, because in the end that's what can prevent the aggression. People would call out Biden for creating panic if putin would back off, but I'd say it probably saved the day.\n\nBut there also a bad signs happening right now.

{"title": "Nobody Cucks the Zuck", "selftext": "Mark Zuckerberg sits alone in his office, trying to grasp what has happened.\n\nHe's used to the mockery, the roasting; it's been his entire life. He can deal with that. He knows what jokes smell like.\n\nBut Facebook? Meta? Up until now they were his shining city on the hill; his magnum opus; his life's greatest achievement.\n\n\"Largest single day loss in history...\" He mutters to himself, eyes glazed over, deep in thought, slowly swirling his shirley temple. His second one this week; somebody's not sleeping tonight.\n\nTim Apple, Muskrat, even that fking cyberboomer Buffett have all been roasting his ass on the daily. On discord no less, they could have at least flamed him on WhatsApp. Not to mention literally everyone in Europe calling his bluff and telling him to gtfo. Even the retards on wsb have been making \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b bank off his misery.\n\nEnough is enough, he thinks to himself.\n\nHe flies into action. His heart is literally beating and he knows it. He loves it. What a rush! He's never felt so alive. Revenge will be sweet.\n\nDescending down the crystal staircase from his office, he makes his way to the past the ball pit and his flat warm rock towards the room he thought he'd never have to open. He never thought it would come to this but he knows that he has no other choice.\n\nHe approaches the door and licks his lips way too much in preparation of speaking the password:\n\n\"Smokin' deez meats.\" He whispers, wetly.\n\nThe door beeps in agreement, a low hiss fills the air as the door unlocks and slowly swings open.\n\nThe room is dimly lit, large and lukewarm; just the way Zuck likes it. And there, directly in the center of the room, an old PC waits patiently for input. The CRT monitor hums ever so quietly from beneath it's very 80's style dust cover; like some shit straight outta Alien.\n\nThere it is. His ultimate weapon. His Doomsberg Terminal.\n\nThere's no turning back now. He rips the cover off, sits down, and slowly types out the name of his first victim:\n\n\"Timothy 'Apple' Cook\". He presses enter.\n\nThe off-white 486 whirs into action, retrieving all Tim 'Apple' Cooks Facebook instant messages, every single one, from back before everyone got wise to Zucks plans of stealing personal data to sell oddly specific t-shirts to fucking idiots. He thought it would make him a billionaire, turns out spreading misinformation amongst the stupid bastards was much more profitable.\n\n(What's that? You thought those messages were deleted when you deleted your FB account? LMAO!)\n\nHe begins searching through the messages, looking for some juicy dirt so he can finally bob this Apple, and for good.\n\nIt's not long before he finds it:\n\n\\[ Tim Cook \\] : So I'm like, \"You're shitting me right, Steve? You're a famous BILLIONAIRE, you could get the best cancer treatment in the history of mankind but instead you're gonna get acupuncture and drink fking Jamba Juice???\"\n\n\\[ Tim Cook \\] : Mfers turtleneck on too tight or something, smh\n\n\\[ Tim Cook \\] : Anyway bb as I was saying, I need access to all ur pics so I can make sure ur not a pedo k thnx\n\n\\[ Some thotty \\] : So can you fix my Compaq or nah\n\nThis is what Zuck has been waiting for. By threatening to expose Tim Apple as a massive douche who also hates privacy (he shudders at the mere thought of the word) he can blackmail him into reversing Apple's pesky ad revenue ruining policy and regain his rightful place back in the top 10.\n\nHe leans back in his chair; revelling in his sheer brilliance. He feels like a big man, not even the biggest congressional booster seat in the world could make him feel this tall. He hasn't felt this good since he saw the Social Network for the first time and asian chick they cast as his future wife was like 1000x hotter than his actual wife and it was confusing but awesome.\n\nHe gets up to leave, he's hard af but he doesn't even notice, all he can think about is who his next victim will be.\n\nKetchup loving boomer Buffett?\n\nTie-dye hippie doofus Dorsey?\n\nPeter \"I'm not a nazi u are\" Thiel?\n\nNo.\n\nHe knows who should be next.\n\nThat autistic twitter tourettes south african retard.\n\n\"Musk\" He says. \"If only you could have known...\" He smiles, bigly.\n\n\"Nobody cucks the Zuck.\"\n\n*Fin*", "id": "swlvz9", "created_utc": 1645310334.0, "score": 1305, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|22|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=swlvz9)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=swlvz9)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Meta to rock bottom after this shitpost.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It didn't need help to reach that...", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Jet boosters past terminal velocity.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10954669117927551}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21418876945972443}], "tickers": ["meta"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3563448488712311}, {"body": "I love this fan fic erotica.
