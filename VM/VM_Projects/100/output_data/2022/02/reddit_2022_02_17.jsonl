But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM.

In five years the person with $100 cash would still have $100 cash but with inflation prices would be higher and that $100 wouldn't buy as much. It wouldn't buy as much food as it did in 2022, it wouldn't buy as much gasoline as it did in 2022, etc.\n\nThe person with 1 gram of gold would still have 1 gram of gold, but the value/price of it went up with everything else so now it is worth $150 and that gold owner can sell his gold for $150 and use the money to buy the same amount of goods he could buy in 2022, even though prices are higher.\n\nThe paper dollars lost purchasing power but the gold preserved purchasing power.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "so then at that point in a bad economy the gold would gradually have a higher price? and when the economy starts doing well again you can sell and be relatively unaffected by inflation?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In my mind it's a better form of savings account.

You need to decide for yourself.\n\nR&D is not \"unnecessary.\" Its optional but its still important for many companies to innovate and grow.

As you say above, they are reinvesting in themselves in the hopes of developing something that will make a lot of money. Some companies are better at it than others.

While there were Russian special forces and intelligence assets ([Like Igor Girkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Girkin)) early on in the 2014 conflict, by far the majority of the rebel footsoldiers were local Russian speaking rebels and Russian adventurer type volunteers. Only after these poorly organized local rebels and volunteers were decimated to the point where control over Donetsk and Luhansk cities was threatened did the Russians intervene on a large scale with regular Russian military units. Thus, the Russians were able to initially show to the world that the rebellion in Eastern Ukraine was an internal Ukrainian matter as opposed to a full blown Russian invasion of Eastern Ukraine. This time its different, the Russians are threatening to take the capital of Ukraine with large conventional military forces, the areas in question have majority Ukrainian speaking populations.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "this is all being done intentionally after Democrat party planning in order to exacerbate inflation and then blame Russia for inflation so Democrats running for reelection this year can deflect all guilt for the trillions they have passed in spending this year", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Don't just blame the left.

Feds will be removing trillions from their balance sheet and will see higher rates every single quarter. Problem is with our debt issues I don't think the Feds can do enough to curb inflation.
