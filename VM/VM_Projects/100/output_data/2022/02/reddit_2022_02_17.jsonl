But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM.

In five years the person with $100 cash would still have $100 cash but with inflation prices would be higher and that $100 wouldn't buy as much. It wouldn't buy as much food as it did in 2022, it wouldn't buy as much gasoline as it did in 2022, etc.\n\nThe person with 1 gram of gold would still have 1 gram of gold, but the value/price of it went up with everything else so now it is worth $150 and that gold owner can sell his gold for $150 and use the money to buy the same amount of goods he could buy in 2022, even though prices are higher.\n\nThe paper dollars lost purchasing power but the gold preserved purchasing power.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "so then at that point in a bad economy the gold would gradually have a higher price? and when the economy starts doing well again you can sell and be relatively unaffected by inflation?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In my mind it's a better form of savings account.

As you say above, they are reinvesting in themselves in the hopes of developing something that will make a lot of money. Some companies are better at it than others.

Thus, the Russians were able to initially show to the world that the rebellion in Eastern Ukraine was an internal Ukrainian matter as opposed to a full blown Russian invasion of Eastern Ukraine. This time its different, the Russians are threatening to take the capital of Ukraine with large conventional military forces, the areas in question have majority Ukrainian speaking populations.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "this is all being done intentionally after Democrat party planning in order to exacerbate inflation and then blame Russia for inflation so Democrats running for reelection this year can deflect all guilt for the trillions they have passed in spending this year", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Don't just blame the left.

{"title": "Facebook Ads Customer Here. Let Me Tell You Why Facebook aka Meta Will Not Be Back. Former IT Worker and Current eCommerce Owner.", "selftext": "First of all, I am writing this from a Facebook Customer (not user) point of view, also someone who was in the IT/TMT industry. I do not invest in the stock market, I don't play financial games, and I have no interest in making bets. \n\nThe reason I am writing this is that I want to give my two cents as someone who works in this field and might know a bit more insight detail about how shitty Facebook has become for advertisers, WHO CONTRIBUTE TO FACEBOOK'S REVENUE. I gave this advice to my buddies back in May and also October of 2021 and they've made some pretty good money when FB crashed (well, I am from NYC and a grad from a business school that's ten minutes away from Wall Street).\n\n**I**.\tiOS 14.5 Update Impact\n\n1.\tBefore iOS 14.5 Update: The obvious reason that everyone knows, is Apple's iOS 14.5 update killed FB advertising ROI, right before the update my friends and I who are all working in the eCommerce field can easily make high return on ads spend (ROAS) because the FB ads algorithm works wonders. we can easily attain a minimum of 300% ROAS, and most of the time it averages 500% for low-medium priced products and 1000%+ for high ticket products. This is the norm for the eCommerce industry using Facebook ads combined with professional marketers and content creators. I was a solo player doing it all myself with no professional help and I was able to get 400% ROAS as well.\n\n2.\tAfter Update: Now, since the update, our ads died, no matter what we tried we never got ROAS over 500%, my average ROAS on ad spend average is less than 200% since the update till today. Most of my friends working in the eCommerce industry quit Facebook ads because it is not profitable anymore, I am not talking about one or two, but hundreds or even thousands of eCommerce advertisers. They are not spending any more on FB ads and moved on to other platforms such as Google, Pinterest, and Tik Tok (I will get to this big part soon). At first, we thought it's gonna take some time for Facebook to catch up on the data lost and eventually get back on our feet, but it's been a year and we sincerely do not see the hope of getting back to what it used to be. Another indicator of this is that Facebook's revenue from mobile ads is much much greater than their non-mobile ads, part of this contributes to the much larger customer base, but another part of this is because mobile ads provide much more user data than non-mobile devices for FB to target better. I tried this personally because Facebook allows us to advertise and target based on devices, non-mobile device users deliver extremely shitty results.\n\n3.\tEffect Across All Categories: The shitty ads ROI not only reflected on the eCommerce field but also one of the major fields that bring billions to FB: Apps and Games. Apps and Games rely heavily on FB for acquiring new users, but since no data is available for FB to target better, it has become extremely expensive to acquire new users and force developers to shift their marketing budget to other platforms (Google/Youtube, Apple, Tik Tok). This is information is provided by my buddy who works at Hypergryph Network Technology Co. Ltd in China, the developer of popular online game Arknights. He was also a former analyzer at ByteDance.\n\n4.\tTLDR: FB ads are shit now, will not rebound. Advertisers are moving away from FB\n\n**II**.\tFailing Attempt On Ecommerce\n\n1.\tFB Knows Nothing About eCommerce: Everyone knows that eCommerce is big for the internet, but not FB. Seriously, for years FB only provides ads service to the eCommerce ecosystem and nothing else. It was super easy money for them because ads spend is the easiest profit to catch and everything else is hard, dirty work that requires a lot of resources, talent, and investment. Facebook only attempted to get into the eCommerce domain seriously right after the iOS update because that is the only way they can save user purchase data on their system. Facebook Shop and Instagram Shop were only available after the update and they did a half-ass job on it, the design, backend, bugs, cross-function coordination is just a nightmare. Shop users facing bugs every day and I was unable to create offers and product launches for months during the peak holiday season.\n\n2.\tFB Cross-function Coordination: This is a big issue here for FB. One of the reasons I warned my friends at Wall Street in October is because FB was rolling out a big promotion for all Shop users, FB was paying for all of the shipping costs and giving big discounts for the customers using FB Shop and Instagram Shop. They cover Shipping up to $20 and discount up to $100. For example, a customer can go on my Facebook Shop and purchase a product for $5, and he will pay $5 for the order. I can set the shipping fee to $20, FB will need to pay me $25 for this order and they only receive $5 from the customer. This is great for eCommerce owners because it will boost sales and acquire a large amount of Shop users for FB. The problem? We have no way to advertise this deal, FB Ads department is like completely in another dimension when this promotion was going on. When we run ads on Facebook, we can drive the traffic to anywhere such as our Business Page, website, or a single post, ads piece, but when they launch the Shop service, the option is not on the FB Ads, aka WE CAN NOT DRIVE TRAFFIC TO FB SHOP USING FB ADS DIRECTLY. This is a complete disaster because we have to drive the traffic first to our FB Page or our Website, and then direct the customers to the Shop page, if you work in the internet industry you know that every step will drive away more than 50% of the users because human is lazy as f\\*\\*k. What this means for Facebook, when the eCommerce department of FB is spending perhaps millions and millions of dollar subsidizing FB Shop owners, their Ads department are wasting millions and millions of dollar driving traffics elsewhere but not directly to FB Shop which will be much more effective.\n\n3.\tSupply Chain and Logistics: The only reason I brought this up is that FB was trying to get into the eCommerce domain. Unlike Amazon, which has supply chain management groups in China to source products and manufactures, warehouses to store inventory, provide fleets to deliver packages. FB has nothing, even Shopify is doing much better than FB, and Shopify is building their logistic warehouse and delivery service (Go Shopify!). You cannot be an eCommerce platform if you have none of these, the only thing FB provides is ads, their agency in China have no communication whatsoever in the supply chain field, they are only there to open new ads account and collect money, period.\n\n4.\tTLDR: Facebook Ecommerce is failing, it\u2019s lacking users, shop owners, logistics, supply chain. The internal issue is also holding it back, FB is only good in Ads. A sign that FB is not good at diversifying its income.\n\n**III**.\tTik Tok Challenge\n\n1.\tUser Challenge: I think everyone knows about this so I am not going into much detail, basically Tik Tok users are growing extremely fast and eating up the market share of Facebook. Not only this, but the users are much younger and spend much more time browsing the videos, which means the future is in Tik Tok\u2019s hands. There is a lot of hating going on on Tik Tok because you cannot change the fact that young users are addicted to it. Instagram comes up with Reel as a response but it is also a half-assed job. Just like they come up with Story in response to Snapchat, they are copycats that cannot challenge the original. According to Al Ries and Jack Trout\u2019s Positioning theory for marketing, once a brand is positioned in the mind of a consumer, it is extremely hard to change. Tik Tok is the king of a short video app, period. If FB run Reels as an independent app instead of an add-on feature on Instagram, it would\u2019ve been much better because a separate app/brand not associated with FB is easier to market than a subsidy.\n\n2.\tAds Challenge: Needless to say, TT and FB are in the same business, they are big on the advertising business. The difference is their algorithm and method, FB rely heavily on user data since day 1 of their inception. They kept it this way and thought that this will not change, but uh oh, Apple just said FU and shoved a middle finger right at Zuck\u2019s face. Google is about to do the same soon. TT, on the other hand, also exploits user data heavily but they have come up with new ways to partner with advertisers. Not only do they provide a platform for advertisers to run ads automatically, but they also have partnerships on running organic traffic challenges across their platform for more viral effects. In other words, Facebook lets the advertisers do all the work, rely solely on their algorithm, but TT gives the option of doing work together, this is a big incentive for big advertisers because it will gain an advantage over small advertisers. You can see a lot of video challenges going on TT and a lot of them are events organized by TT to promote for big customers. TT as a new player in town was actually behind FB because TT lacks the data of the worldwide user that FB has been collecting and using for years, but now the loss of these data would put them in the same position.\n\np.s Google is in the Ads business, too, but their service is inelastic as FB services are more elastic. Also, FB collects data from users, but users provide Google with data voluntarily.\n\n3.\teCommerce Challenge: this is a very important advantage of TT, as you may know, TT has a Chinese counterpart: Douyin in China, they have been exploring e-commerce for years and was wildly successful. Tik Tok Shop is bringing billions of GMV for ByteDance and eating up the market share of top players such as Alibaba and [JD.com](https://JD.com). TT as the global version of Douyin can try and duplicate the success of eCommerce on a global scale. With already established supply chain, vendors, and manufacturer relationship, it\u2019s easy for them to convince these Chinese Sellers to go global (mind you that global eCommerce is a big industry in China, and the majority of sellers on Amazon are also based in China). Their biggest challenge is logistics. In my honest opinion and reliable sources, TT is doing much much better than FB, they may not have as much user data as FB, but I believe they have more consumer buyer data than FB and they can improve their eCommerce algorithm with these. \n\np.s. my former eCommerce partner sells phone cases on Douyin (China) using their Shop and Ads system, their annual revenue is about $30 to $40 million with a 30% net profit margin for years 2019-2021\n\n4.\tOther Fields: this is purely my opinion, I used to work in the TMT industry in Beijing with friends and clients from companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and ByteDance, basically all the big tech companies. ByteDance has a very strong crisis awareness and it is always looking into diversifying its portfolio, they have tried medical, education, gaming, media, entertainment, eCommerce, and enterprise service. Not only do they enter these domains, but also leverage their strength of user traffic to succeed in these fields. In contrast, Facebook purchased Instagram and Whatsapp and contains itself in the social network and advertising domain. Their biggest step out was the purchase of Oculus VR and Meta concept. VR and Meta are nowhere to be profitable soon because of hardware limitations for our era, period (prediction from former executives of Qualcomm, also clients from Huawei, no one in the hardware industry believes in the VR concept, HTC believed in it and look where they are now).\n\n5.\tTLDR: Tik Tok is eating up FB\u2019s market slowly, they are also doing a better job on other domains such as eCommerce than FB did. FB\u2019s only income is advertising and their services are not inelastic like Google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is late here in NYC and I am tired, this is everything I have in mind regarding Facebook. Like I said in the beginning, I am an outsider in the world of Wall Street, I just hope this information I provided can be some help for everyone here. Of course, don\u2019t just take my words for it because these are purely my personal experience and observation around the industry that I am in. I am happy to answer any questions you may have for me, not just for FB. I also welcome anyone who has a different opinion and is willing to explain it.\n\n\n\nEdit 2.18.2021\n\nThis is to explain why FB is in more trouble than others such as Google and Amazon because someone asked in the comment, also explain how Ads Tracking works\ni\n\nFB can have data built into their software, model, AI, or whatever you call it, and use them to profit based on a prediction of how users behave. The advertisers will use the system and bid on ads placement in order to sell whatever they need to sell. The issue here is data are dynamic and it is always changing, what they have today may not work tomorrow. Of course, they have information like your birthday, location, name, and occupation that you provided to FB on your profile. What they do not have are your daily behavior and privacy information, and no they are not able to save it because they never had that kind of access in the first place.\n\nLet me explain it in detail here,\nWhen you allow an app to track for ads, such as FB, your mobile device actually assigned you an Ads-ID to be used by these apps (Apple calls it advertisingIdentifier and Google calls it Advertising ID), and the Ads-ID can be changed, this is why when you search for a pair of Nike sneakers on Google, you start to see it everywhere when you use other app or view other websites. The apps use that Ads-ID to identify you can collect data to build a model specifically on your profile to deliver ads that are relevant to you. You search for Nike on Google using Safari, Safari now knows that Ads-ID 0001 did this, and now FB App received this information that Ads-ID 0001 is interested in Nike, you will start seeing relevant ads because of this. Other apps such as free games or whatever news app also receive this information and they have Ads SDK built to them provided by platforms such as Google or FB and now you start seeing Nike ads on those apps to for retargeting you to make a purchase. \n\nThe Ads-ID was the first step in protecting our privacy, these ads companies only know our Ads-ID and were never able to identify us personally (they could if they really wanted to and be total evil and read the information line to line, but that's not profitable).\n\nFB relies heavily on this type of dynamic data they collect on a daily basis and there is no way they will save this enormous amount of data to their server because old data will not work well anyway after a certain time. Now, what happens after iOS 14.5 update is people opt out of tracking, opting out was always an option, it's nothing new, what Apple did here is making a default option that you are opted out, whereas before the update you were opted in for tracking as default option. This caused more than 95% of users to opt-out which is a total nightmare for FB. What happens here now is that FB cannot identify who we are through that Ads-ID anymore and cannot build models and deliver ads that are relevant to users. You still get the same amount of advertising on your devices but they are just not relevant to you anymore. Take our first example again, you search for Nike sneakers, but all the ads you are seeing after could be a baby diaper, car insurance, beauty products, or pet food even though you do not have a pet. All of this is because FB cannot identify who you are, where you are, what you do every single day, all of a sudden, FB doesn't know who you are and what you want.\n\nThis is the ultimate atomic bomb here because almost 100% of their revenue is from ads, this affects not FB but also Instagram because they are running on the same model, and Whatsapp is definitely not gonna help here because even if they push out something to make money it will be based on the same model. If they charge a fee people just gonna run To telegram or other messenger apps.\n\nNow let me explain why Google and Amazon weren't affected by this and why Google is able to push this anti-tracking policy.\n\nAmazon as an eCommerce website, all of the user data, purchase behavior, and relevant information are all being acted on either their website or within its app, so this information collected daily is being processed and saved on Amazon's side, it does not need the Ads-ID because everything is done within Amazon itself. Amazon can do identifying itself without relying on Ads-ID because it can predict your purchase behavior based on what you are doing within the Amazon app, no need for them to collect outside of their app or website. FB on the other hand is constantly collecting data that is outside of their app, take our old example again, when you search for Nike on Safari, Facebook knows it because it is allowed to track, other information such as where you are at the very moment now, what text you sent, what games you play, or which side-chick you are visiting tonight are all being collected even though these actions are performed outside of Facebook app because it was allowed to track. This is why Facebook was so eager to push their FB/Instagram Shop out and subsidize hundreds of millions into in on October, November, and December last year because they want user purchase data and buying behavior to start being performed within FB/Instagram app in order to improve their advertising performance. I think they failed miserably because they did a horrible job.\n\nGoogle is almost on the same page with Amazon in another way. Everything we need Google for is actually performed within Google's app or website, so they did not need that much data outside of their domain in order to perform well. Especially their main ads category is Search Ads because users actively provide data that is needed by Google by searching everything they need on Google. Google's search ads built models based on the enormous amount of searching data they actively receive every single day, they don't need to go out of their way to collect our personal information in order to sell more ads. Of course, it would help Google if they do collect, but it is not critical for them, unlike Facebook.\n\nBtw, Google and Amazon can identify you and your behavior by your user ID, no Ads-ID is needed for them, especially Google, they can identify you cross-platform such as Google Search, Map. Youtube, Gmail, and any other platform that uses Google Account to log in.\n\nTLDR: Facebook actively collects our data outside of their domain for maximum ads efficiency and now they can't do it, Instagram uses the same model that's why it's no help. Google/Amazon isn't affected much because we actively give data/information to them, they don't need to collect as much data as FB outside of their domain in order to profit so much.", "id": "suiba7", "created_utc": 1645080333.0, "score": 782, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 350, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|11 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=suiba7)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=suiba7)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16199922561645508}, {"body": "Thanks for the info kevin", "score": 276, "replies": [{"body": "Not me scrolling back up to see if his name was really Kevin. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)", "score": 82, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3040853440761566}, {"body": "Fr I'm glad I spent my lunch hour reading this book \ud83d\udc4d now back to tiktok thots \ud83e\udd75", "score": 104, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0403917171061039}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.004426036961376667}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "I discussed this with my pals last year, especially on October 2021 becuase the way FB operating their ecommerce business with no coordination between FB Ads was a big red flag.

FB can have data built into their software, model, AI, or whatever you call it, and use them to profit based on a prediction of how users behave. The advertisers will use the system and bid on ads placement in order to sell whatever they need to sell. The issue here is data are dynamic and it is always changing, what they have today may not work tomorrow. Of course, they have information like your birthday, location, name, and occupation that you provided to FB on your profile. What they do not have are your daily behavior and privacy information, and no they are not able to save it because they never had that kind of access in the first place.\n\nLet me explain it in detail here,\n\nWhen you allow an app to track for ads, such as FB, your mobile device actually assigned you an Ads-ID to be used by these apps (Apple calls it advertisingIdentifier and Google calls it Advertising ID), and the Ads-ID can be changed, this is why when you search for a pair of Nike sneakers on Google, you start to see it everywhere when you use other app or view other websites. The apps use that Ads-ID to identify you can collect data to build a model specifically on your profile to deliver ads that are relevant to you. You search for Nike on Google using Safari, Safari now knows that Ads-ID 0001 did this, and now FB App received this information that Ads-ID 0001 is interested in Nike, you will start seeing relevant ads because of this. Other apps such as free games or whatever news app also receive this information and they have Ads SDK built to them provided by platforms such as Google or FB and now you start seeing Nike ads on those apps to for retargeting you to make a purchase. This was the first step in protecting our privacy, these ads companies only knows our Ads-ID and were never able to identify us personally (they could if they really wanted to and be total evil and read the information line to line, but that's not profitable).\n\nFB relies heavily on this type of dynamic data they collect on a daily basis and there is no way they will save this enormous amount of data to their server because old data will not work well anyway after a certain time. Now, what happens after iOS 14.5 update is people opt out of tracking, opting out was always an option, it's nothing new, what Apple did here is making a default option that you are opted out, whereas before the update you were opted in for tracking as default option. This caused more than 95% of users to opt-out which is a total nightmare for FB. What happens here now is that FB cannot identify who we are through that Ads-ID anymore and cannot build models and deliver ads that are relevant to users. You still get the same amount of advertising on your devices but they are just not relevant to you anymore. Take our first example again, you search for Nike sneakers, but all the ads you are seeing after could be a baby diaper, car insurance, beauty products, or pet food even though you do not have a pet. All of this is because FB cannot identify who you are, where you are, what you do every single day, all of a sudden, FB doesn't know who you are and what you want.\n\nThis is the ultimate atomic bomb here because almost 100% of their revenue is from ads, this affects not FB but also Instagram because they are running on the same model, and Whatsapp is definitely not gonna help here because even if they push out something to make money it will be based on the same model. \n\nNow let me explain why Google and Amazon weren't affected by this and why Google is able to push this anti-tracking policy.\n\nAmazon as an eCommerce website, all of the user data, purchase behavior, and relevant information are all being acted on either their website or within its app, so this information collected daily is being processed and saved on Amazon's side, it does not need the Ads-ID because everything is done within Amazon itself. Amazon can do identifying itself without relying on Ads-ID because it can predict your purchase behavior based on what you are doing within the Amazon app, no need for them to collect outside of their app or website. FB on the other hand is constantly collecting data that is outside of their app, take our old example again, when you search for Nike on Safari, Facebook knows it because it is allowed to track, other information such as where you are at the very moment now, what text you sent, what games you play, or which side-chick you are visiting tonight are all being collected even though these actions are performed outside of Facebook app because it was allowed to track. This is why Facebook was so eager to push their FB/Instagram Shop out and subsidize hundreds of millions into in on October, November, and December last year because they want user purchase data and buying behavior to start being performed within FB/Instagram app in order to improve their advertising performance. Which I think they failed miserably.\n\nGoogle is almost on the same page with Amazon in another way. Everything we need Google for is actually performed within Google's app or website, so they did not need that much data outside of their domain in order to perform well. Especially their main ads category is Search Ads because users actively provide data that is needed by Google by searching everything they need on Google. Google's search ads built models based on the enormous amount of searching data they actively receive every single day, they don't need to go out of their way to collect our personal information in order to sell more ads. Of course, it would help Google if they do collect, but it is not critical for them, unlike Facebook.\n\nTLDR: Facebook actively collects our data outside of their domain for maximum ads efficiency and now they can't do it, Instagram uses the same model that's why it's no help. Google/Amazon isn't affected much because we actively give data/information to them, they don't need to collect as much data as FB outside of their domain in order to profit so much.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4593159556388855}, {"body": "If you are so interested, go check for how long ago Mark have alerted for small businesses and other marketeers, such as yourself, would have a business hurt.
