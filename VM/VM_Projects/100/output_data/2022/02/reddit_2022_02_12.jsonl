Trade flow, disruption fuel cost spikes and spending on cars ?\n\n- Very little economic impact in the US & China - low to moderate impact in the EU.\n- EU impact largely depends on how Russia wants to play the natural gas supply card. (My guess: they don't want to hurt actual sales, but want to 'threaten' the west via supply both to keep sanctions in check, and to keep prices high. It's soon spring in Europe, which reduces the nat gas dependency for months. Temporary disruption to supply is very much possible.)\n- There will probably be a knee-jerk \"WAR!\" bearish reaction in markets next week, once Russia invades Ukraine.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "~~once~~ if", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01940954476594925}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6342856884002686}, {"body": "To be honest, I can't see how other countries get involved other than providing support to Ukraine, I don't think any of the European powers are stupid enough to get dragged into a direct conflict with Russia.  \n\n\nAs far as economic impact, I've been thinking about this throughout the day. Here's a [link](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1079338002/russia-ukraine-europe-gas-nordstream2-energy) showing the relative dependence of Russian natural gas of various European states. It seems unlikely that Russia will fully cut the flow, for the obvious economic reprecussions, however the pipelines in the Ukraine could be disrupted or destroyed in the case of an invasion. In that scenario, gas and by extension, energy prices in Europe will likely rise dramatically in the short term.  \n\n\nThis will likely cause European nations to attempt to wean themselves off Russian energy in the long-term, they could do this by importing more petroleum products from countries such as Australia or the middle eastern states. In the long-run, I expect the European powers try to become more energy independent, like France's recent [announcement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/france-to-build-up-to-14-new-nuclear-reactors-by-2050-says-macron) of building additional nuclear reactors. Russia will likely get even more severe sanctions, maybe the British will have the balls to freeze the oligarch's assets, who knows.\n\nHow this all relates to Tesla, well, neither Russia or the Ukraine are large markets for Tesla, so from a sales perspective it's borderline irrelevant. The market won't be pleased with an invasion so I expect macro will get hit hard. As for the potential energy crisis, it really depends on how bad it is and how long it persists. My intuition tells me it's unlikely to last a long time simply because it's not really in the interest of any of the major players (Russia, Germany, other European states) for it to do so.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "As far as economic impact, we get mainly chicken from Ukraine.

No! I grew up in Europe and forever have we been fearing the Russian invasion, that never ever happens. You know how many times Russia \u201calmost\u201d took over? Yes, never since the collapse of the USSR, to the contrary, the NATO is Inching closer to Russia, then Russia inching towards us, and we are effectively surrounding Russia on all sides.\n\nRussia is powerful, but can never, ever win against the NATO, it\u2019s completely unrealistic. Anybody who believes that Russia starts a serious war against the West has completely lost touch with reality. Not even the fucking COLD WAR turned HOT. So stick your anxiety pills up your butthole and relax.\n\nAnyway, how can you make money with this? Looking at the reaction of the market today, it\u2019s evident, that the entire stock market is completely retarded for contracting due to some White House announcement that\u2019s obvious distraction from the actual problems. Coincidence that record Inflation numbers are coming out, and they push the same ol Russian shit?\n\nThe way to make money is by believing that they will remain irrational, and betting on it.\n\nI made most of my money through Oil, because I knew that environmentalist were gonna shutdown oil supplies, when demand is steadily going up = Oil go up. But people were shorting Oil because Tesla was growing??\n\nOnce you understand how retarded the world is, you\u2019ll make money.\n\nThe smart thing might be to sell Gold, because fed will raise rates, then bearish for gold and commodities right?!?\nAnd buy Puts?!?\n\nRemember to smoothen that brain surface. \n\nThe Fed has constantly been lying about inflation being transitory, why would they tell the truth about raising rates significantly? \nThey are NOT going to cause a recession during an election year, Powell is basically part of the Biden administration. Their 0.25% whatever is going to do nothing against almost 8% CPI and 15% real inflation.\n\nWhile the bears are celebrating because \u201cInflation will crash the markets\u201d they are forgetting that the reason inflation crashes the markets is, that interest rates go up. \n\nThis time is different because the fed is not going to fight Inflation reasonably, during times of unhinged Inflation, everything goes up.\n\nYes, stock market, commodities, prices, everything will go up.\n\nYes, yes, right now we are in a bear market because of expectation of a rise in rates. This ship will most likely reverse as soon as the market realizes that Powell is pluwffing.\n\nSo the shorts that are building up right now are going to get so utterly fucked, in one of the biggest market rebounds since 2020. Im aiming for around March - September, and should probably time calls for next year.\n\nThis time the dollar will take a massive dump, so you better do something with your money, not financial advice.\n\nP.S. \n\nDollar will shortly go up during first hike but eventually shit the bed when investors realize that they are not going to do shit.\n\nHyperinflation is Bullish for everything!\nDon\u2019t listen to \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b", "id": "sqipiw", "created_utc": 1644639621.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|174|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sqipiw)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sqipiw)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1077900230884552}, {"body": "I stopped at hyperinflation is bullish for everything.

Y'all gonna preach that inflation is super fucking high and money is devaluing quick af and also say it's fucking unsustainable that market is up 120% in the last 2 years or so.  \n\n**If it's the currency losing value quick, isn't it unsurprising that the market is going to perform good?** I mean, it's an alternative value holder to currency.\n\nLet me show you a smooth brained example. **Say you are a farmer like 1000 years ago, and you buy a cow for 10 gold coins.** Now, let's say your retarded kingdom faces an inflation so high it causes the price of the cow to go up 1 gold coin each year. Now, after 10 years, your cow is worth 20 gold coins! Did you make money? Fuck no, it's just that gold coins lost value and cows did not.\n\n**You wouldn't fucking talk about \"the imminent crash of cow prices\" if everything went up in price just because the cows did too.**\n\nAnd for those of you who think inflation isn't real? **Two years ago, I bought a cheeseburger at McDonald's for 1\u20ac, now it's worth like 1,40\u20ac.** I would also buy a protein shake at my local gym for 1\u20ac, now it costs 1,40\u20ac. The kebab place I frequented would cost 2\u20ac per kebab, now it's like 2,90\u20ac or some shit. \n\n*If you look past the March 2020 dip, we are only up some 42% at the SPY ATH. Going back to the previous cheeseburger / protein shake / kebab example, those prices are also up some 40%.* This is irrefutable proof that it's not actually market going up, but currency going down and market adjusting. \n\nSo saying \"this growth is unsustainable\" and \"we are in for a correction\" is fucking retarded if you think stocks only go up (which they do) since in theory, stocks have gone up 0% in the past 2 years (going back the the previous cheeseburger example). **Unless the prices of cheeseburgers also correct down, I don't see market correcting itself by a huge margin. If you think stocks only go up, that is.** Which you do. \n\n**This is obviously not financial or investment advice.** If you didn't gather it from the cow example, I'm fucking retarded.

There is absolutely no reason that Putin would want that. He is considered a crazy politician for sure in Europe, but he is also a clever guy. Angelina Merkel (former Rikskahnsler, Germany) was known to be on the humans that really could play the game well against Putin.

Another variable was that the media in USA was flooded with Ukrainian war (which simply is not the case), it\u2019s a political game and media fired it up too much compared to what it really is. And it\u2019s the FED. Normally one can say that the market prices in things, which off course was one of main reasons for the dip. Another thing is that the market is overreacting to something that already was priced in, tough the market right now is flooded with fear. So just relax and take it easy, it will blow over if not during next week. Than the week after.

Consistent with the Scenario Design Framework, under the severely adverse scenario, the U.S. unem- ployment rate climbs to a peak of 10-3/4 percent in the third quarter of 2022 (see table A.5), a 4 percentage point increase relative to its fourth quarter 2020 level.11 Real GDP falls 4 percent from the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 to its trough in the third quarter of 2022. The decline in activity is accompanied by a lower headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate, which quickly falls to an annual rate of about 1 percent in the second quarter of 2021, and stays at that level for another quarter before gradually rising to 2-1/4 percent by the end of the scenario period.In line with the sharp decline in real activity, the 3-month Treasury rate remains near zero throughout the scenario. The 10-year Treasury yield immediately falls to 1/4 percent during the first quarter of 2021 and stays there through the first quarter of 2022, after which it gradually rises, reaching 1-1/2 percent by the end of the scenario period. The result is a gradual steepening of the yield curve over much of the scenario period.\n\n\\*here's the answer on the rate hike, though... likely conservative using the word gradually. monday will be telling of what gradual means.\n\nthe test is all about finding the weakest money masseuse and cutting off their hands. they look at wha their losses may be in a 'severely' adverse situation, doesn't look great.\n\n>Changes in supervisory stress test results across exer- cises reflect changes in\u2022 firm starting capital positions;41\u2022 the scenario used for the supervisory stress test;\u2022 portfolio composition and risk characteristics; and \u2022 models used in the supervisory stress test.Under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, the aggregate CET1 ratio is projected to decline to a minimum of 10.6 percent before rising to 11.2 per- cent at the end of nine quarters (see table 3). In the aggregate, each of the five capital and leverage ratios declined over the course of the projection horizon from their levels in the fourth quarter of 2020, with levels in the first quarter of 2023 ranging from1.0 percentage point to 1.8 percentage points lower than at the start of the projection horizon (see table 3).\n\nnow we're getting to the meat and bones of this bullshittery:\n\n>Projected LossesThe Federal Reserve projects that the firms as a group would experience $474 billion in losses on loans and other positions in the aggregate over the nine quarters of the projection horizon.These losses include\u2022 $353 billion in accrual loan portfolio losses;\u2022 $4 billion in securities losses;42\u2022 $86 billion in trading and counterparty losses at the 12 firms with substantial trading, processing, or custodial operations; and\n\n[not cool](https://preview.redd.it/if8ymgw9hfh81.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=37b0d66c9c694435a2e954985c61eae5858e7301)\n\njust to me this seems like a lot of money, and though this is a severely adverse situation they're describing its in my opinion in reality it's already much worse.\n\n[phenomenal risk management table shit](https://preview.redd.it/ytv0rypchfh81.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f8f04e1cff46bc24be9271c7a18dc100de8f13)\n\nthere are a ton more tables under these that get more specific on each firm and the primary source of their losses. it's pretty interesting stuff considering everyones head in the sand in spite of these glaring issues which have painted them into a corner.
