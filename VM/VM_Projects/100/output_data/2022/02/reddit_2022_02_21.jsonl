In November 21, the fed announced that it would begin tapering asset purchases in December. They did and have since doubled the rate of taper and stated that they will begin raising interest rates in March, once the taper is complete. So far, they've stuck to their word on this.\n\nMany market participants believe the fed will taper and perhaps even raise rates, but will then bail and turn the money hose back on if the market starts to tank. Recent episodes (over the last decade) did go this way. Personally, I believe that \"this time is different\".\n\nThe evidence for this is the rising inflation as reported in the [CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LWoe), PCE, PPI and other metrics. We have the highest inflation since the 1970's, by some measures. \n\nIf you then believe that the fed will actually do its job and fight inflation, the least you would suspect is that they will raise interest rates a decent amount through several rate hikes over at least the next year or two. If rates then continue to rise past maybe 3 or 4 percent, as was necessary with high inflation in the 70's and 80's, equity valuations will continue to fall (stonks will go down). Or, if the fed surprises the market with \"excessive\" tightening measures, it is presumed this would also potentially cause a significant crash.\n\nWithout the easy money support, you then fall back on actual fundamentals and valuations based on financial performance. The S&P 500 [CAPE](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) ratio (currently 35.59) has only ever been higher during the dotcom bubble. The historical average is around 17.\n\nSo my perception is that the bull run you described from the last 8 years was part of the low interest / excessive liquidity mayhem provided by the fed. I believe that era is ending presently due to high inflation. Without the easy money, i believe valuation multiples will continue to collapse. I think if you're buying the S&P at a CAPE of 36, basically your only prayer of profiting in the next decade or so (ignoring \"bear market rallies\" and other temporary events) is if the fed fully reverses their current monetary stance.\n\n[Current Market Valuation](http://currentmarketvaluation.com) is an interesting site for more info on the current market valuation.

The proper interpretation here isn\u2019t necessarily that the S&P 500 will collapse by 72% from its highs. Rather, the implication is that investors should not expect durable, long-term S&P 500 total returns anywhere near 10% annually until valuations approach those norms. \n\n- if we examine the times in U.S. history when 10-year CPI inflation averaged even 4% annually, S&P 500 valuations at the end of those 10-year periods were always at or below their historical norms \u2013 on average more than 30% below those norms.\n\n- Low interest rates can certainly encourage yield-seeking speculation in stocks, driving their valuations higher, and their expected future returns lower.\n\n- Indeed, until the S&P 500 drops below about 2600, I would consider even a Treasury bond yielding 2% to be a higher-return, lower-risk proposition than the S&P 500. (I appreciate the boldness of a direct prediction here!)\n\n- Given that government deficits in the coming quarters are projected to contract further, the combination of smaller deficits and a diminished reservoir of household savings may place surprisingly strong downward pressure on corporate profits in the quarters ahead.\n\n- we should expect corporate profit margins to move inversely with real unit labor costs (unit labor cost/output price).\n\n- It\u2019s clear is that Fed easing amplifies speculation. During the recent bubble, we learned the hard way that, faced with the novelty of zero interest rates, yield-seeking speculation can go beyond any historically reliable limit but it\u2019s also important to recognize that even in recent years, Fed easing has not reliably supported stocks during periods when investor psychology has shifted toward risk-aversion.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I love what Hussman has to say, and it all pretty much seems to be backed up by the statistical analysis.

The larger story is the failure of the JIT manufacturing and stock system (there's an argument that there are good and bad implementation of Just In Time systems for stock, and that's true, but they all have weaknesses like what I'm about to describe, but the difference is in how vulnerable the chain is in a change in interest).\n\nBasically, keeping a bunch of stock undermines business interests by driving up costs and keeping prices down, so pretty much every major supplier (not just in cars) uses a JIT (Just In Time) stock system that seeks to keep active stock as low as possible while still maintaining sales volume.\n\nThis works out great until something like a pandemic rolls along and cuts buying for 6-12 months and then you see a massive spike once the condition which caused the buying slowdown to turn around, which is exactly what happened in 2020. So the JIT market ses a downturn, cuts orders, cuts production, etc... then tries to scale up once demand comes back. In Capitalist Economics this is called \"market efficiency.\" \n\nNow if you're a profiteer, this is great because cutting supply and then seeing a huge demand increase gives you buying power. If you're a consumer or care about the health of the market or the country or the people, this sucks. But Capitalism doesn't exist to solve those other problems... just to make profit, so this is basically a great example of how Capitalism solves problems:\n\nIt doesn't. Problems are something other people solve. \n\nAnyway, since all the buying and ordering is happening in the midst of a gap-up in demand, in the JIT system the fact that demand gapped down is taken into account variably. If a car dealership, for instance, is convinced that it won't slow down, then orders remain up and car prices will remain up with it.\n\nBut the market for cars is finite, and right now the differential in used car prices (up 40+% year over year) is much greater than the price differential for new cars (up 12%). This has given people a pretty good opportunity to change out used cars at a premium for an upgrade if what they want is in stock. In May of 2021 I sold a 10 year old used car with over $5,000 in work that needed to get done for basically $8,000 in direct cash and incentives. In a normal market I'd be lucky to get $2,000 for that car, but they threw money at me just to get access to the used car because they could make another 50% off of it easy. The car I bought new is actually worth more now than it was when I bought it LOL.\n\nEventually that'll turn around and when it does, the JIT system will likely fail to reverse course quickly enough just like it failed during the pandemic, meaning that there's a period of time when orders will be up and inventories will likely be up in \\*some\\* sectors of the market relative to where they would have been in a normal market... so yes, expect that when the situation reverses, it'll probably be a disinflationary event.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Calls on weaponry and electronics, puts on everything else for the short term. Puts on SPY for smooth brains who cant diversify.\n\nStarting off with the simplest thing. [Putin Approval rating](https://www.statista.com/statistics/896181/putin-approval-rating-russia/) while not at an all time low, is still low. It was at its highest right after Invading Ukraine and taking Crimea. So the first benefit of invading Ukraine is a big boost in the approval rating and sanctions doesn't effect that a lot.\n\nWrinkle Brain stuff. Russia has been preparing for this for very long. Starting with  [De-dollarising](https://think.ing.com/snaps/russia-to-fully-de-dollarise-its-sovereign-fund-with-little-implication-for-the-market) sovereign fund and further reducing it in its reserves.

They have plenty of options to stabilize the Ruble as well as borrow money without de-valuing it. They are also at a point where their debt to GDP ratio is less than 30%. They have also been through a big sanction and are much resilient to it now. The next step is trade deals, [China gas deal to be settled in Euros](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-russia-china-agree-30-year-gas-deal-using-new-pipeline-source-2022-02-04/). China backing them gives them even more comfort as China will trade in tendies instead of dollars if given the option.\n\nThe last piece is current economy of the USA and Europe. Sanctions on gas are going to hurt the EU big time, everyone has over inflated economies recovering from a pandemic. No one wants to risk it over Ukraine. Everything above is well known by the US too so they will be reacting appropriately, how they will do that is beyond my scope. At the end of the day, Russia will have to use the dollar somewhere somehow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this very clearly points towards Russia invading and getting what they want, as they have been preparing for a long time for it. It's gonna be a short party for the bears, Russia will get a slap on the wrist because think about the economy. And we will be back to Bull territory in no time.

The land is rich with resources that they lack to decrease Russias dependence on other countries, which in turn decreases the effects of sanctions on their economy.
