When investing, look into the history of the sector you\u2019ll be putting your money into. As for the internal combustion auto, in the US at the onset of the era there were several hundred thriving producers of automobiles- by the 80s you had basically 4. The onset of the electric vehicle has seen a similar trajectory- especially in the era of the SPAC. The history tells us that a bunch of people are going to lose their shirts while a handful of folks lucky or diversified enough strike gold.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a more sensible long-term approach you\u2019ve got to look at the bigger picture around the sector. It doesn\u2019t matter which of the hundreds of electric car producers \u2018win\u2019 to the mining companies who are supplying the rare earth minerals, copper, and steel that all of them will use as consumables in their process. Not to mention the copper required for a new charging infrastructure. Same for the tire manufacturers- which companies look best positioned to create the new rubbers of the next generation of vehicles, which ones are moving ahead on recycling old rubber and reducing the environmental impact of new rubber production- even if we eliminate fossil fuels the number of cars on the road is going to increase by a lot, and all of them will need tires. And every so often they\u2019ll have to replace those tires with brand new ones. Which material science firms are best positioned to supply the new market with carbon composite body panels, upholstery fabric for interiors, plastics, adhesives, and fasteners for a post petroleum world. How about all the semi conductors we\u2019ll need to make all the computer systems. How about those computer systems themselves, or the software IP that runs them- what about the companies that make the machines that make the machines to produce semiconductors, or cable, or stereo speakers? It\u2019s fun to imagine you\u2019re on a mythic quest to find the next Tesla- but the smart money looks at the historical data and tries to find common threads that make sense over time as the sector matures.

I'll explain why:\n\n* Tesla: They've already proven they can hit margins with EVs that no other automaker can with ICE or EVs. Even if they continue growing margins and grow to 10-20M EV sales per year by 2030, they won't justify a valuation higher than $1.5-3T by the end of the decade. So best case you're getting a 3x, but that's absolute best case. The real opportunity in Tesla is in robotaxis, Tesla Bot and AI in general.\n*  Legacy automakers: EVs are a negative for them. They can't produce them profitably yet, retrofitting existing factories to build EVs leaves them at a huge disadvantage to Tesla, and their balance sheets heavily rely on loans backed by ICE vehicles as collateral. If EVs continue do well, many of these companies will go bankrupt and the rest will have to go through multiple years of unprofitability. They're not investable until they get through that.\n* Start-up EV companies: These are not investable at all. They have yet to go through the two most difficult phases of a car company; ramping to mass production and getting to profitability. Both of these are almost impossible, as cars aren't profitable without economies of scale and a car company has trouble getting to profitability without the income that legacy OEMs have from service (having millions of cars on the road that need repairs). And the most important factor of all, unlike Tesla back in 2012-2019, they are not priced for bankruptcy, so the risk-reward is simply not there.\n\nSo ultimately, if you really want to invest in EVs, your only option is to go with Tesla. But that only makes sense if you're not looking for outsized returns or you believe they will succeed in the AI space.\n\nThe only real opportunity I could see that's still being overlooked is battery recycling.

{"title": "Russia could hit U.S. chip industry, White House warns", "selftext": "For those like me wondering why semis are getting hit particularly hard today.\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The White House is warning the chip industry to diversify its supply chain in case Russia retaliates against threatened U.S. export curbs by blocking access to key materials, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe potential for retaliation has garnered more attention in recent days after Techcet, a market research group, published a report on Feb. 1 highlighting the reliance of many semiconductor manufacturers on Russian and Ukrainian-sourced materials like neon, palladium and others.\n\nAccording to Techcet estimates, over 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon supplies come from Ukraine, while 35% of U.S. palladium is sourced from Russia.\n\nPeter Harrell, who sits of the White House's National Security Council, and his staff have been in touch with members of the chip industry in recent days, learning about their exposure to Russian and Ukrainian chipmaking materials and urging them to find alternative sources, the people said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the specifics of the conversations, but a senior official reiterated that the administration was prepared if Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"Part of that is working with companies to make sure that if Russia takes actions that interfere with supply chains, companies are prepared for disruptions,\" the person said.\n\n\"We understand that other sources of key products are available and stand ready to work with our companies to help them identify and diversify their supplies.\"\n\nJoe Pasetti, vice president of global public policy at the chip and electronics manufacturing suppliers group SEMI, sent an email to members this week gauging exposure to the vital chipmaking supplies, according to a copy obtained by Reuters.\n\n\"As discussed on today's call, please see the attached document ... regarding Russian/Ukrainian production of a number of semiconductor materials,\" he wrote, referencing a summary by Techcet on C4F6, Palladium, Helium, Neon and Scandium from the troubled region. \"Please let me know if potential supply disruptions to any of them are a concern for your company.\"\n\nNeon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, is a biproduct of Russian steel manufacturing, according to Techcet. It is then purified in Ukraine. Palladium is used in sensors and memory, among other applications.\n\nThe Biden administration has threatened to impose sweeping export controls against Russia if it invades Ukraine. Russia, which has massed over 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border, denies it plans to attack.\n\nSome chipmakers have been reviewing their supply chains to scan for potential fallout from conflict in Ukraine. One person at a chipmaking company who declined to be named acknowledged that it has been looking into its supply of neon and other gases, some of which originate in Ukraine.\n\n\"Even if there was a conflict in Ukraine it wouldn't cut off supply. It would drive prices up,\" the person said. \"The market would constrict. Those gases would become pretty scarce. But it wouldn\u2019t stop semiconductor manufacturing,\" he added.\n\nAccording to one power chip design startup executive, unrest in Ukraine has caused rare gas prices to increase and could cause supply issues. Fluorine is another gas that has a large supply from that part of the world and could be affected, the executive added.\n\nWilliam Moss, a spokesperson for Intel Corp , said the chipmaker was not anticipating any impact to neon supply.\n\nBut the issue is still concerning, because global chip supplies are tight and chip orders are only expected to pick up. Techcet estimates demand for all the materials will rise by more than 37% over the next 4 years, pointing to recent announcements by Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan's TSMC in Ohio, Arizona and Texas.\n\nNeon prices rose 600% in the runup to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, since chip firms relied on a few Ukrainian companies, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/)", "id": "sq62oa", "created_utc": 1644604035.0, "score": 330, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 161, "comments": [{"body": "so buy the discount or wait ?", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Your call, could be nothing.

{"title": "Why Tesla investors need to believe in FSD - what will happen if FSD don't succeed by 2025", "selftext": "*The short version:*\n\n**To catch the wave of EV adoption I believe is coming 2025 - 2026, Tesla needs to announce 3-4 new gigafactories specifically intended for 25k car by next year at the latest so they can be up and running by 2025. Tesla needs to unveil the 25k car 2024 at the latest so they can begin production 2025. But since Elon is a rather risk inclined person we won't see this, instead Elon prioritizes a project like Tesla bot over the 25k car, he is leaving a near-certain profit to hunt a bigger uncertain profit. By focusing on both FSD  and the Bot Elon made the stock much riskier. I believe it would be much better balanced if 25k car took precedence over the Bot.**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The background:*\n\nAfter last conference call and after prioritizing the tesla bot over the 25k car, tesla stock became a stock with higher risk but also higher potential reward. Assume you are investing in a 5-year time horizon. You would at least hope for the stock to go up to 1600 by 2027 when you presumably cash out your investment. If Tesla FSD succeeds, meaning fsd reach level 4 automation, the tesla stock would surge above 1600 no doubt, especially if Tesla is first with level 4 automation. I dont think I need to write the enormous benefits if level 4 automation happens. With FSD tesla dont need 25k car because the demand will be near unlimited.\n\nBut what if FSD don't succeed? Then it doesn't make sense to invest in tesla here is why.  By 2027 Tesla main streams of profit would most likely be, energy storage, cybertruck, model 3 and model Y. Without 25k car I dont believe there is a demand for more than 3-4m cars. I expect following scenario to roughly play out:\n\nBy 2024 I expect the luxury segment (60k+) to be dominated by BEVs, but in cheap cars less than 30k, the BEV will only be a small minority 10-15% of all sales due to battery and chips shortage. However, by 2025 I expect the chip shortage to be solved at the latest, 30+ fabs will have begun or begin their construction 2021/2022 and most of these will produce wafers by 2024/2025. When it comes to battery cells constraints we have 50+ new battery plants that are coming online assumingly around 2024/2025 in Europe and US alone: [https://insideevs.com/news/517931/europe-plans-38-battery-factories/](https://insideevs.com/news/517931/europe-plans-38-battery-factories/) [https://electrek.co/2021/12/27/13-battery-gigafactories-coming-us-2025-ushering-new-era/](https://electrek.co/2021/12/27/13-battery-gigafactories-coming-us-2025-ushering-new-era/)\n\nSo 2022 and 2023 will be rather unimpressive EV sales for legacy automakers, but Tesla should see nice increase in sales in 2022, 2023 should be an exciting year for Tesla assuming no further delays of cybertruck. 2024 will be the year Tesla sell around 3m cars and also the year Tesla finally meet demand. Though we probably see good numbers 2024 for Tesla, but with no success in FSD, tesla bot, solar, Tesla growth is in jeopardy and I wouldn't be surprised if the stock is below 500 in 2024. Then we finally arrive to 2025, the year we will see a great supply of chips and batteries, the perfect year for mass adoption of cheap EVs. I project a big wave will come 2025 and 2026. If we compare the global BEV sales in 2024 with 2026 I believe we will see a double in sales in two years. Roughly I believe BEVs will do roughly 20% 2024 and at least 40% in 2026 thanks to mass adoption of cheap BEVs 18-28k.\n\nSince Elon is not prioritizing the 25k when can we expect 25k to be unveiled? Well Elon has said to make a compelling 25k car, Tesla need to work on the card diligently for 3 years. I think its fair to assume that Tesla started to work on 25k car seriously sometime in 2020 and dropped the project sometime in 2021. That leaves tesla with two more years of work before they can unveil the car. Tesla certainly wont begin working on the 25k car in 2022, they probably either will begin working on 25k car in 2023 or 2024. Lets assume they start working again on the 25k car sometime in 2023, this mean they will unveil the car at the earliest 2025 with production earliest 2026. Realistically speaking we wont see any real mass production until 2027. Tesla will miss the wave. the legacy automakers will share the cheap car segment between themselves 2025-2026 and as Tesla arrives in 2027 they will need to give up a sizeable chunk of that segment to Tesla. However Tesla would have grabbed a much bigger share if they arrived two years earlier. I believe if Tesla worked hard  they could have unveiled 25k car by 2023 with production already in 2024!

Tesla doesn't \"lose\" if a competitor brings a car to market before it. Telsa is doing fine in China and competitors already have perfectly good cheapo cars available. \n* As a thought example, lets say Tesla's suppliers can only produce 4 million FSD chips in 2025 and that is the bottle neck for Tesla, do you seriously think they should be taking half those chips and stuffing them into 2 million cheapo cars if the market will support 4 million model Y's? No they should not. \n* Even though the Toyota Camry can only sell 1.5 million cars, that is not going to be the case for electric cars.

Must have a f up broker.\n\nI don't feel like you understand the risk in this scenario. This is not a problem with early assignment. They were liquidated on the day of expiry. This is pin risk, where you do not have the luxury of seeing if you can exercise the long option, and the broker is unwilling to take on the risk on behalf of the client.\n\nOP is holding a put credit spread at 840/845. If the broker ***thinks*** there is a chance that TSLA ends the day between those strikes, OP is obligated to purchase those shares with capital he doesn't have. The long put expires worthless so it doesn't matter. Since OP doesn't have enough capital, broker liquidates for them before they can get into a situation where they have a large negative cash balance.\n\nNow add to it the scenario where TSLA drops after hours, to whatever, say 800. Because TSLA closed above 840, there is no automatic exercise of the long option you're relying on as protection. A savvy trader might look at the after-hours movements and call in to exercise their long as a protection (since they have an hour and half after market close to decide to exercise), but the broker doesn't know if OP will do that. Therefore, a trader caught in that position can absolutely lose more than the width of the spread. Once again, the broker is unwilling to take that risk.\n\n[This actually happened before specifically to TSLA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVFj9nRRDo) On expiration day news came out that TSLA won't be included in the S&P500, and the stock tanked, leading exactly to the scenario I described above. People relying on automatic execution got burned.\n\nThis is very standard risk management practice by all brokers.

When taxes are adjusted to offset the increase in aggregate demand, deficit spending is not inflationary. \n\nRemember, taxes and the raising of interest rates act as the brakes on the economy; spending and expansionary monetary policy are like the gas pedal. The \"debt\" has little impact on our situation, because the vast majority of our debt is denominated in dollars. The Treasury Department, in cooperation with the Federal Reserve, could wipe out that debt tomorrow by issuing a flood of new dollars. The inflationary effect of such an action could be countered immediately by contracting the supply through interest rates and taxes.\n\nA balanced budget is fine, but that is a much better plan when the economy is healthy, standing on its own two feet, and producing growth independently. In times of crisis, recession and recovery, deficits aren't just good for the economy, they're necessary. Government spending is what drives the economy when it collapses, and it is paid down later through currency manipulation which has the effect of taking the training wheels off. Government debt is very different from consumer debt. It's not like balancing a checkbook at home. The entire system revolves around controlling the money supply. \n\nTo solve this inflation, I think it is prudent to examine what the actual effects of this inflationary period are. It has boosted wage growth at the fastest rate in recent memory, it is stimulating growth due to the large amount of currency in the system, and it is filling up the holes left by COVID. The cause is more supply disruption than it is deficit spending. Many goods and commodities are in short supply and therefore soaring in price, not because of an actual shortage, but because of labor shortages, which are indeed transitory. This means prices will normalize over time as COVID becomes less disruptive. If the Fed decides to raise rates aggressively, they risk choking a fairly healthy economy that has just started to stand on its own. That could cause a severe recession that would rival the GFC.

None wanted to cut spending or raise interest rates and keep debt low.\n\nCurrent US debt is like this: \"Going with your parents and grandparents to a very nice restaurant, where your parents & grand parents order big and when it becomes time to pay the bill, they leave the table and leave the bill to the kids.\"\n\nYour \"parents and grandparents\" were past politicians.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is the only answer I know of that doesn't lead to hyperinflation and crash of the Dollar.
