{"title": "Serious question for Retail Tech Investors", "selftext": " So I've been thinking, Is the reason that the majority of retail traders are so overleveraged tech stocks is because that's all that they know? Obviously new things are exciting. But the majority of the USA work force today are likely office workers. And they know how Microsoft, Apple, AMD, etc work cause they use those products everyday??? And they are okay buying those growth stocks at very high valuations. But as a blue collar guy I have never bought heavily into any of those tech stocks with what I thought were nose bleed valuations. And I've always bought stocks that I can understand. That's why I own stocks like $CLF, $BP, $KMI, $WNC, $GT, and other manufacturing & commodity stocks. And I am not against tech as I am fine buying & holding stocks like Intel that are used in everything that have cheap valuations.\n\nBut my question is, do we all have bias based on the bubble we live in? And is the younger tech office generation not diversifying because tech is all they know?

This individual might even seek \"proof\" that further backs up this belief while discounting examples that do not support this idea.\nConfirmation biases impact how people gather information, but they also influence how people interpret and recall information. For example, people who support or oppose a particular issue will not only seek information that supports their beliefs, they will also interpret news stories in a way that upholds their existing ideas and remember things in a way that also reinforces these attitudes.\u201d\n\n\nNo where in my post does it say or do I show any evidence of only wanting to hear good news about NVDA\u2026.
