A great example is if you use sentry.     If you do everywhere but home it is possible that they car really only fully sleeps after you have charged at home.  So essentially the BMS might only be getting a narrow set of data points to calculate capacity.  So by letting the car sleep at different states of charge you can get the BMS to better estimate the capacity of the pack.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I recognized this immediately after having my MY for about 4 months and mostly only driving my 50mi daily commute and charging to 80%.

So something like sentry didn't exist when the car was first made so this adds in complications.    Sentry doesn't let the car sleep.    So it is possible that many cars don't actually sleep that often if they use sentry mode most of the time.  I know that is the case for me.   Sentry is usually only off when I am at home.
