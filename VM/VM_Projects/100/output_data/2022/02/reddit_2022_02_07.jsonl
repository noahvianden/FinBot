A great example is if you use sentry.     If you do everywhere but home it is possible that they car really only fully sleeps after you have charged at home.  So essentially the BMS might only be getting a narrow set of data points to calculate capacity.  So by letting the car sleep at different states of charge you can get the BMS to better estimate the capacity of the pack.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I recognized this immediately after having my MY for about 4 months and mostly only driving my 50mi daily commute and charging to 80%.

So something like sentry didn't exist when the car was first made so this adds in complications.    Sentry doesn't let the car sleep.    So it is possible that many cars don't actually sleep that often if they use sentry mode most of the time.  I know that is the case for me.   Sentry is usually only off when I am at home.

I continued researching and I found out the direction things were going is that Intel missed smart phones blowing up, which Apple kicked off around 2007-8, so they didn't have a flagship chip optimized for mobile available to sell. \n\nIt takes about 5 years to go from R&D to mass production of chips. That meant it'd have been 2015-16-ish at the soonest before they'd have a competitive product if everything went well, and they'd had a not so great generation of processors recently. And then by mid-decade, smart phone processors would be more like commodities, and other companies' chips would be in 2nd or 3rd generation by then, so not a huge amount of money to be made. So Intel wouldn't be having another Pentium situation with smartphones.\n\nThe stock I bought, the price went down after that for a few months and then started rising again and I sold it when it came back to the price I'd bought it at. I learned a very good lesson about research before I get involved with a company and it didn't cost me much in the end.\n\nVerizon--I'm a long term customer of theirs and haven't ever had problems so I like them too. It's been on my shortlist for a few years. Looks like the stock has been largely horizontal the last several years.\n\nOn top of that I work at a utility and the utility industry is switching to smart meters. Smart meters communicate to consolidator-type equipment and those have cell modems inside them and send all the meter reading data back to the utility servers over cell data. That means other companies' data is moving thru telecom networks. Seems like the business idea is to build a network then fit as much usage onto it as possible and charge everyone tolls. There being more and more smart devices and cell connections all the time seems like this should be a gold mine.\n\nSounds like a good idea to get involved with--the thing about not being a prospector but being the store on the way the prospectors buy their equipment at. On top of this, it makes sense to me that eventually people's internet at their houses will be largely wireless back to a tower rather than running fiber everywhere, since the most expensive part of a fiber network is the service drop to each house so doing wireless off towers will be cheaper.\n\nIt turns out the cell companies don't own most of the towers, they just lease them from other companies. Additionally, utilities are starting to build their own private cell networks so the trend will be toward in-housing the wireless data in the next generation of metering infrastructure.

Today was definitely not a great start to the week and set my [identical play from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skf2dd/zucks_going_to_make_me_a_millionaire/) back by almost 50%. I used it as an opportunity to bring down my cost basis, though, by adding an additional 225 contracts for $3.50.\n\nUnderlying justification for the trade remains the same. I'm anticipating that by 2/18 FB will gain back a third of what was lost during Thursday and Friday of last week. That would put us at $265. It would also bring us back to the previous support established in 2020, and would be a gravitation much nearer the max pain of $300.
