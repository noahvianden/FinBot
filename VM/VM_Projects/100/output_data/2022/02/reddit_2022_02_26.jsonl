In 2022, they have a chance to come close to that production growth again(possibly exceed). Their revenue growth should be even higher (higher ASP due to more expensive environment + more S/X sold this year).\n\nThey tripled earnings last year and should double them this year (last year they tripled because their 2020 earnings were very low, this year they will double because their 2022 earnings will be high, if that makes sense).\n\nTesla has a chance to become the most profitable US headquartered automaker in 2022. \n\nSo looking at their P/E ratio, they are at currently at 151.5 trailing 12 month P/E.

What risks did I overlook? Is my criteria above too risky or too conservative?\n\nYou can get 30% *average* (more than your 20-30%) by buying and holding UPRO.  You're probably taking on more risk than buying and holding UPRO too, so your strategy could be better when it's not beating index funds.  Best of all, with buy and hold you can get LTCGs which is nice when your account size is larger or you have a high 9 to 5 income.  It's also less work to just buy and hold.  Brokers will auto do it for you, so you can have it auto setup with a paycheck deposit so you don't even have to look at it.  Less of that dopamine thrill, but a lot more relaxing.\n\nMy advice: Only trade options if you have alpha.  The best alpha an options trader can get is the same alpha found in value investing.  Learn how to identify what stock is good and bad based on what company is good and bad.  Eg, COIN's initial statement to investors was blatant like, \"We're a scam, but here is our offering.\" level of obvious.  Anyone who had any basic level of value investing skill would have seen this and would be, \"This is a great time to short COIN at its IPO or wait a month and then sell calls against it until it dies.\" milking it.  Or HOOD, less obvious, but same sort of deal.  Or AMD, looking at the company's offerings when the Zen 2 came out made it obviously bullish.  Options lets you leverage seemingly anything up.  Only use options when you're sure of a direction and you can only be sure of a direction with value investing skills on companies or macroeconomic skills on the larger economy.\n\nLETFs will only let you level up index funds.  Though if you don't have the value investing alpha, index funds will pay you better in the long run, so again LETFs win if you don't have alpha, doubly this time.\n\nIn short, if this is the best you got, buy and hold UPRO.  DCA incoming paychecks.  Automate it if you want.  Walk away for a few years.  You'll make more than your current strategy and take on less risk.

Options and leverage can turn 1% of your portfolio into 20% of your portfolio in one day. But you lose that 1% you still have 99% of your cash. If you reverse that it takes one false move to lose everything.\n\nYou really have everything to gain from playing small and consistent. Look at the WSB players who have turned $10k to $100k or even a million. The smart players have gradual but consistently large gains. The worst ones have one MASSIVE spike and than back to zero.\n\nThe world rewards patience and gradual movement. Even if the movement is relatively large, it must come in steps.
