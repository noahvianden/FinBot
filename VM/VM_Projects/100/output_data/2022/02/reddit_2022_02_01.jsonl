{"title": "AT&T to Slash Dividend (from $2.08 to $1.11) After Spinoff of WarnerMedia", "selftext": "AT&T Inc. T 1.15% said it would roughly halve its dividend payout and divest its WarnerMedia division through a spinoff that will give shareholders 0.24 shares for each AT&T share they own.\n\nThe company is picking a simpler method to complete its planned deal with Discovery Inc. DISCB -3.47% that will make the transaction easier for individual investors to digest, but will still leave the telecom company with about 7.2 billion shares outstanding. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.\n\nAfter the spinoff, AT&T said it expects to pay an annual per-share dividend of about $1.11, down from its most recent $2.08 level. The new payout would cost the company just under $8 billion a year, down from the roughly $15 billion it paid out in 2021.\n\nAT&T said the change accounts for the media-asset distribution and supports the telecom company\u2019s plans to boost investment in 5G wireless and fiber-optic service. Reducing the size of the dividend will also allow the business to more quickly whittle down debt.\n\nAT&T executives had said they would cut the dividend to reflect the company\u2019s smaller size once the media business is carved out into a separate company. The stand-alone telecom company stands to get about $43 billion in cash from the transaction, subject to certain adjustments.\n\nAT&T in May agreed to shed its media business after struggling to convince investors that a telecom-and-media giant would be worth more than the sum of its parts. The Dallas company had acquired the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studios in 2018.\n\nCompany leaders have since said that hiving off the media unit and merging it with smaller rival Discovery will give the stand-alone entertainment company even more heft to battle Netflix Inc., Walt Disney Co. and big tech companies racing to capture the streaming video market. WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO unit reported 73.8 million world-wide streaming subscribers at the end of 2021.\n\nAT&T has spent the past year reassuring shareholders that the remaining business will keep growing while paying a smaller dividend that reflects its diminished size. Existing shareholders are in line to get a roughly 71% stake in the entertainment company, which will be called Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe company said Tuesday that the new media business will trade under the stock ticker \u201cWBD.\u201d\n\nAT&T Chief Executive John Stankey last week said that the company was debating the best way to separate the two businesses. He said during a conference call with analysts that splitting the shareholder base would help lower the number of AT&T shares circulating\u2014boosting its stock price\u2014though such a complex move would be unprecedented for a company of its size.\n\nThe telecom chief said the company wanted to keep in mind its large base of individual shareholders who might not \u201cgo as deep on the puts and takes and ins and outs of things as the institutional base does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure it\u2019s transparent and clean for everybody involved in this,\u201d Mr. Stankey said last week.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-to-slash-dividend-after-spinoff-of-warnermedia-11643716166?mod=hp_lead_pos3", "id": "shvaz6", "created_utc": 1643723155.0, "score": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "AT&T is one of the worst managed companies in history", "score": 120, "replies": [{"body": "And it's even getting punished for trying to redeem itself.

Like ZERO many days. There are still market makers putting out bid/ask spreads, but those spreads are going to be pretty wide. If you are sued to trading short term AAPL or SPY options with spreads of a few pennies\u2026get ready for spreads of $10-$20 on leaps for something like GOOG. \n\n- daily pricing in the leaps in your brokerage account (ie the value that your broker is going to calculate for you) can sometimes - due to the wide spread - not really reflect what the true \u201cmarket\u201d price is for that contract. Especially if someone puts in a bid/ask way outside of where the market makers are setting the spread. (Sometimes your broker will value the contract right on the highest ask or lowest bid, depending on whether your position is long or short, and a wonky bid or ask can really give you a weird temporary value). \n\nAll that said - my guess today is that the leaps I hold will go up 50-70% of the underlying price move. The deeper ITM contracts will be closer to 70% and the ones ATM will go up closer to 50%. (Hopefully im a bit off and they go up more\u2026but I haven\u2019t had a day yet where GOOG went up 10%, so im just making an educated guess based off what happens on smaller price moves). \n\nRight now, GOOG is up $281 per share pre-market (6:36am est). So I\u2019d expect my contracts to go up about $196 on average. That translates to about $110k for my 6 contracts.\n\nI\u2019ll give you one of my contracts as an example. \n\nIt\u2019s a Jan 2024 GOOG call with a $3,100 stroke price. I bought it Jan 7 at $310 ($31,000 for the 100 share contract). Yesterday it had ZERO volume. (Which is kinda typical). It\u2019s last actual trade was on 1/31/22 at $295.95. At close yesterday, the quote was $322.50 bid and $341.50 ask. My broker, pricing it at the bid, assigns a $32,250 value to my account, even though I probably could have sold it for a little\nabove that bid. (However - not always. In these illiquid leaps, if there is only one market maker, and they want to sit on the bid/ask\u2026.you sometimes do have to cave and sell for the bid. So you don\u2019t get super efficient pricing.)\n\nAnyways, on yesterday\u2019s market move of $43.60, that LEAP went from a trade of $295.95 to a bid/ask of $322/$341. So it went up at least $26 on a $43 market move. Which is 60% and where I\u2019m getting my 50-70% estimate for today\u2019s moves. \n\nThis all ignores changes in pricing due to changes in underlying volatility, and that can happen after key earnings reports and guidance changes\u2026but that won\u2019t dramatically affect leaps due to their long term nature. \n\nHope that helps, it\u2019s the best quick and dirty I can do while sipping my first coffee.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I applaud your effort!!  \n\nI play weeklies now and then short term\u2026but ~75% is in 2024 leaps.

{"title": "U.S. lawmakers traded an estimated $355 million of stock last year. These were the biggest buyers and sellers", "selftext": "Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades, buying and selling shares of companies based in the U.S. and around the world. At least 113 lawmakers have disclosed stock transactions that were made in 2021 by themselves or family members, according to a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures and MarketWatch reporting. U.S. lawmakers bought an estimated $180 million worth of stock last year and sold $175 million.\n\nThe trading action taking place in both the House and the Senate comes as some lawmakers push for a ban on congressional buying and selling of individual stocks. Stock trading is a bipartisan activity in Washington, widely conducted by both Democrats and Republicans, the disclosures show. Congress as a whole tended to be slightly bullish last year with more buys than sells as the S&P 500 SPX soared and returned 28.4%. Republicans traded a larger dollar amount overall \u2014 an estimated $201 million vs. Democrats\u2019 $154 million. \n\nSo who were the biggest traders? The table below, based on a Capitol Trades analysis, shows the 41 members of Congress who made stock buys or sells in 2021 with an estimated value of at least $500,000 \u2014 or had family members who made such trades.\n\nAt the top of the list of the biggest traders on Capitol Hill by dollar volume is Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, who disclosed an estimated $31 million in stock buys and $35 million in stock sales. He\u2019s followed by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California with $34 million in estimated purchases and $19 million in sales, GOP Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee with $26 million in estimated buys and $26 million in sells, and Democratic Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state with $15 million in estimated buys and $31 million in sells.\n\nCongress\u2019s more than 500 members are required to file disclosures within 45 days for any transactions involving stocks and other securities due to 2012\u2019s STOCK Act, though many lawmakers have been late with their filings. The decade-old law, which aims to help prevent politicians from profiting from nonpublic information, is viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups, especially given how a divided Washington united to weaken the law in 2013 by removing provisions such as one that required putting the disclosures in a searchable database. Independent analysis firms have ended up offering such databases, with 2iQ Research, for example, launching Capitol Trades last year. For the table above, Capitol Trades estimated the value of buys and sells using the midpoint of the declared range for the transaction. Lawmakers aren\u2019t required to disclose a transaction\u2019s exact value, but rather give ranges such as $1,001 to $15,000, or $15,001 to $50,000. McCaul\u2019s biggest disclosed trades in 2021 include sales by a child and his spouse of shares in Cullen/Frost Bankers CFR, a bank headquartered in McCaul\u2019s state, as well as sales by his spouse of shares of China\u2019s Tencent Holdings TCEHY, according to filings aggregated by Capitol Trades.

Why?\n\nI personally don't sell on rumours or herd mentality, but rather when there is a fundamental change in the company's milestones. Today, PayPal showed that it's failing to deliver. Massively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: Having spent quite some time looking into today's Earnings, along with past releases, I'm beginning to think that the EPS decline is not as bad as it seems.\n\nWith any investment, Quarterly updates serve as a benchmark for you to decide whether there's fundamental shifts in the company's execution and/or strategy that could shift the **why** you invested in the first place.\n\nThe reality is that (see the latest Investor Update deck from PayPal's website) [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q4/PYPL-Q4-21-Investor-Update.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/PYPL-Q4-21-Investor-Update.pdf)\n\n(1) TPV and Revenue are (excluding eBay) expected to grow at roughly \\~20% for FY22 (2022: TPV growing to $1.5T and revenue to exceed $29B)\n\n(1i) Revenue growth includes an eBay decline of $600Mil, which is actually very impressive\n\n(2) Free Cashflow is expected to grow by approximately \\~11% for FY22 to $6Bil. This is similar but stronger guidance than the year before.\n\n(3) FY-21 Venmo volume increased 44% to $230Bil\n\n(4) Net income was impacted by:\n\n(4i) Volume-based expenses grew 22.5% and non-transaction related expenses grew 10.4% \u25e6 Sales and marketing expenses increased 9.6% and technology and development increased 19.1%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Verdict**\n\nAfter relevant research, I firmly believe that after a near 50% correction, a further 10-15% drop is indeed an overreaction to this news.

Same story for just about every tech company during the dotcom bubble. That's not one company being run into the ground.\n\nAMD's decline around 2006 wasn't just their fault. There were 3 main factors. 1. AMD's new Bulldozer (Phenom CPUs) architecture was hot garbage. 2. Intel abandoned the decade-long dumpster fire that was Netburst (Pentium 4/D) and leapfrogged themselves and AMD by dusting off P6 (Pentium Pro/II/III/Core/Core2/i7).\n\nAnd 3-- the biggest one yet-- Intel paid off manufacturers to embargo AMD chips. Intel ended up losing a billion dollar lawsuit to AMD for it, but that was a slap on the wrist considering it bought Intel 10 years of market dominance and is still paying off to this day.\n\nSuperficially, Ryzen vs Core looks similar to Athlon vs Pentium 4, but the sitaution's different today. Intel could probably still cripple AMD again with an embargo, but today, it's nowhere near as dominant as it once was and ARM chipmakers would be salivating and ready to close in if Intel tries it. So it's a safer bet today to believe that if AMD keeps delivering, they'll keep growing. And they sure are delivering.\n\nNow I'm a lot less bullish for Intel. They definitely have the money to turn it around, but as history has shown, time and time again, throwing money at the problem doesn't necessary make you the best chip. But to really compete, Intel might have to expand their capex. They might need to try something new, instead of just iterating yet again on what's fundamentally a quarter-century old CPU design. And they better hope that next new thing is not another Netburst.\n\nThere's also the fact that Intel's market share and market cap are both much much higher than AMD's, and this works against Intel in terms of growth. They could clinch the entire server market and the stock price might only go up 30%. But if AMD did that, their stock price could easily double or triple.
