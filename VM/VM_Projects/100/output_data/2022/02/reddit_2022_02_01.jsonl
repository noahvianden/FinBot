{"title": "AT&T to Slash Dividend (from $2.08 to $1.11) After Spinoff of WarnerMedia", "selftext": "AT&T Inc. T 1.15% said it would roughly halve its dividend payout and divest its WarnerMedia division through a spinoff that will give shareholders 0.24 shares for each AT&T share they own.\n\nThe company is picking a simpler method to complete its planned deal with Discovery Inc. DISCB -3.47% that will make the transaction easier for individual investors to digest, but will still leave the telecom company with about 7.2 billion shares outstanding. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.\n\nAfter the spinoff, AT&T said it expects to pay an annual per-share dividend of about $1.11, down from its most recent $2.08 level. The new payout would cost the company just under $8 billion a year, down from the roughly $15 billion it paid out in 2021.\n\nAT&T said the change accounts for the media-asset distribution and supports the telecom company\u2019s plans to boost investment in 5G wireless and fiber-optic service. Reducing the size of the dividend will also allow the business to more quickly whittle down debt.\n\nAT&T executives had said they would cut the dividend to reflect the company\u2019s smaller size once the media business is carved out into a separate company. The stand-alone telecom company stands to get about $43 billion in cash from the transaction, subject to certain adjustments.\n\nAT&T in May agreed to shed its media business after struggling to convince investors that a telecom-and-media giant would be worth more than the sum of its parts. The Dallas company had acquired the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studios in 2018.\n\nCompany leaders have since said that hiving off the media unit and merging it with smaller rival Discovery will give the stand-alone entertainment company even more heft to battle Netflix Inc., Walt Disney Co. and big tech companies racing to capture the streaming video market. WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO unit reported 73.8 million world-wide streaming subscribers at the end of 2021.\n\nAT&T has spent the past year reassuring shareholders that the remaining business will keep growing while paying a smaller dividend that reflects its diminished size. Existing shareholders are in line to get a roughly 71% stake in the entertainment company, which will be called Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe company said Tuesday that the new media business will trade under the stock ticker \u201cWBD.\u201d\n\nAT&T Chief Executive John Stankey last week said that the company was debating the best way to separate the two businesses. He said during a conference call with analysts that splitting the shareholder base would help lower the number of AT&T shares circulating\u2014boosting its stock price\u2014though such a complex move would be unprecedented for a company of its size.\n\nThe telecom chief said the company wanted to keep in mind its large base of individual shareholders who might not \u201cgo as deep on the puts and takes and ins and outs of things as the institutional base does.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure it\u2019s transparent and clean for everybody involved in this,\u201d Mr. Stankey said last week.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-to-slash-dividend-after-spinoff-of-warnermedia-11643716166?mod=hp_lead_pos3", "id": "shvaz6", "created_utc": 1643723155.0, "score": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "AT&T is one of the worst managed companies in history", "score": 120, "replies": [{"body": "And it's even getting punished for trying to redeem itself.

Like ZERO many days. There are still market makers putting out bid/ask spreads, but those spreads are going to be pretty wide. If you are sued to trading short term AAPL or SPY options with spreads of a few pennies\u2026get ready for spreads of $10-$20 on leaps for something like GOOG. \n\n- daily pricing in the leaps in your brokerage account (ie the value that your broker is going to calculate for you) can sometimes - due to the wide spread - not really reflect what the true \u201cmarket\u201d price is for that contract. Especially if someone puts in a bid/ask way outside of where the market makers are setting the spread. (Sometimes your broker will value the contract right on the highest ask or lowest bid, depending on whether your position is long or short, and a wonky bid or ask can really give you a weird temporary value). \n\nAll that said - my guess today is that the leaps I hold will go up 50-70% of the underlying price move. The deeper ITM contracts will be closer to 70% and the ones ATM will go up closer to 50%. (Hopefully im a bit off and they go up more\u2026but I haven\u2019t had a day yet where GOOG went up 10%, so im just making an educated guess based off what happens on smaller price moves). \n\nRight now, GOOG is up $281 per share pre-market (6:36am est). So I\u2019d expect my contracts to go up about $196 on average. That translates to about $110k for my 6 contracts.\n\nI\u2019ll give you one of my contracts as an example. \n\nIt\u2019s a Jan 2024 GOOG call with a $3,100 stroke price. I bought it Jan 7 at $310 ($31,000 for the 100 share contract). Yesterday it had ZERO volume. (Which is kinda typical). It\u2019s last actual trade was on 1/31/22 at $295.95. At close yesterday, the quote was $322.50 bid and $341.50 ask. My broker, pricing it at the bid, assigns a $32,250 value to my account, even though I probably could have sold it for a little\nabove that bid. (However - not always. In these illiquid leaps, if there is only one market maker, and they want to sit on the bid/ask\u2026.you sometimes do have to cave and sell for the bid. So you don\u2019t get super efficient pricing.)\n\nAnyways, on yesterday\u2019s market move of $43.60, that LEAP went from a trade of $295.95 to a bid/ask of $322/$341. So it went up at least $26 on a $43 market move. Which is 60% and where I\u2019m getting my 50-70% estimate for today\u2019s moves. \n\nThis all ignores changes in pricing due to changes in underlying volatility, and that can happen after key earnings reports and guidance changes\u2026but that won\u2019t dramatically affect leaps due to their long term nature. \n\nHope that helps, it\u2019s the best quick and dirty I can do while sipping my first coffee.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I applaud your effort!!  \n\nI play weeklies now and then short term\u2026but ~75% is in 2024 leaps.
