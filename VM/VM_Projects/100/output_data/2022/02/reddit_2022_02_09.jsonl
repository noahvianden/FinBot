Any excess use gets billed.\n\nIn the winter, the days being shorter and the sun being lower in the sky, generation is also lower. So your power use at night will probably exceed it. When you have a battery, you can prioritize charging it with excess production during the day over giving back to the grid. Then at night, you can draw on the stored energy as much as possible instead of pulling from the grid. This buffer can further cut your energy bills. Add in a heat-pump for home heating, and you are saving money on your gas bill too (if you have a gas-fired furnace). \n\nYes you are still generating the same lower amount, but it is cheaper to use it directly instead of giving back to the grid and then buying it back at retail rates.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3136414587497711}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22156023979187012}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Other way around.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ho ok.

{"title": "Meta isn't going anywhere", "selftext": "Meta falls by 33% and lo and behold, like clockwork this sub is filled with high IQ geniuses explaining that facebook is finished, that Zuckerberg is going to end up selling metaverse handjobs behind a metaverse dumpster for meta money in the near future, that this is it, this time facebook will be replaced by x y or z competitor. Here's why that is insanely stupid:\n\n**Instagram and facebook are the best place to spend money on ads, the only competitor that comes close is Google/Youtube.**\n\nIf you want to grow a business or start a side hustle, a couple hundred bucks gets you massive exposure to whatever target audience you want. You are basically given the power to put a billboard on the front door of anyone who you think might be interested in your product. Other social media sites offer this, but not even close to the same scale as meta does, instagram/facebook gets you exposure to every demographic in the world. Other social media sites, like snapchat, or tik tok, are limited to a specific demographic, such as young people, and there are significantly less options for your ad types and metrics around the ads.\n\n**Metaverse**\n\nIt's kind of amazing to me how someone will have faith in Elon Musk building economically feasible transportation to Mars but not in ZUCC taking over the VR industry with an ambitious MMO.\n\nI mean just the word \"metaverse\" was brilliant, ZUCC could have just made an \"MMO\" like Amazon tried to and called it such, but instead he made people believe he is coming up with something different and not just a rehash of any of the number of online chatrooms that involve created avatars that have come and gone since the 90's.\n\nThat's what ZUCC does, he might not have invented social networks, but he made them into what they are today. Likewise he didn't invent \"metaverses\", but if there's someone out there that can get the average person wearing a VR headset and performing all their social functions virtually without ever leaving their houses like some sort of dystopian nightmare, it's the ZUCC.\n\n**It is literally impossible for Facebook to not grow**\n\nFacebook has 2.89 billion users worldwide. Instagram has over a billion users worldwide. The global population is 7.75 billion. At 3.89 billion accounts, somewhere in the ballpark of half of the entire human population uses a meta application.\n\nKnowing that, I can understand being skeptical of Meta being able to capture more ad revenue from it's users. But if you think facebook is going bankrupt, or even that it won't grow at all, when it's already consumed close to half the earth in it's social media cesspool, you are literally retarded. Several continents would have to be destroyed to seriously harm Meta's userbase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't know if I am going to buy Facebook just yet, I don't know what it's fair valuation is right now. It could be that this is a fair correction. But on a fundamental level, it's definitely as solid as any tech giant is, and any moron here spouting drivel about how this is the end of Meta is a clown, Facebook and Instagram will not only exist in 50 years, they will likely be several times as big.", "id": "snzuw6", "created_utc": 1644367351.0, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|19|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|419|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4nsuz/ups_is_the_next_gme/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=snzuw6)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=snzuw6)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2280576080083847}, {"body": "Have you heard of LIGMA?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "No what\u2019s LIGMA", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Ahh, I'm glad you asked, sir.\n\nLIGMA balls Lol \n\nAlso Loopring ImmutableX GME Microsoft Apple", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Instructions not clear.
