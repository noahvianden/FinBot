As of Monday, the stock is down about 31% year to date.\n\n> The news of Foley stepping down comes ahead of Peloton\u2019s fiscal second-quarter results, which are set to come after the market closes on Tuesday.\n\n> Peloton told the Journal it expects to cut roughly $800 million in annual costs and reduce capital expenditures by roughly $150 million this year.\n\n> The company also said in the report that it plans to wind down the development of its Peloton Output Park, the $400 million factory that it was building in Ohio. It said it will reduce its delivery teams and the amount of warehouse space it owns and operates.\n\n> William Lynch, Peloton\u2019s president, is also expected to step down from his executive role but remain on the board, Foley said in an interview with the Journal. Erik Blachford, a director since 2015, is expected to leave the board. And two new directors will be added, the Journal said: Angel Mendez, who runs a private artificial intelligence company focused on supply chain management; and Jonathan Mildenhall, former chief marketing officer of Airbnb.\n\n> Roughly a week ago, activist Blackwells Capital \u2014 which has a less than 5% stake in the company \u2014 sent a letter to Peloton\u2019s board urging Foley to quit his role as CEO, and asking the company to consider selling itself.\n\n> Reports have since circulated that potential suitors could include Amazon or Nike. However, Foley along with other Peloton insiders had a combined voting control of roughly 80% as of Sept. 30, which would make it practically impossible for any deal to go through without their approval.\n\n> Foley, 51, founded Peloton in 2012. He previously served as the president at Barnes & Noble.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/peloton-ceo-john-foley-to-step-down-transition-to-executive-chair-as-company-cuts-2800-jobs-says-report.html", "id": "snhagh", "created_utc": 1644316943.0, "score": 391, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "Don't feel bad for him, [he cashed out nearly $120m during the entire bullrun](https://finviz.com/insidertrading.ashx?oc=1789085&tc=7) while misleading investors that PTON could somehow capture the momentum into long term growth.\n\nGuy got paid, classic pump and dump on shareholders.", "score": 323, "replies": [{"body": "He also just bought a $55M Hamptons crib.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "I always wonder how the uber rich purchase mega mansions like that.

Is it the CEO, or the investors, or a combination? I think it's a combination. A blind man could have seen that the growth of PTON was due to people not being able to go to a gym and that this was always going to be temporary. If the CEO and the rest of the executive at PTON thought otherwise, they were fools. If investors, and I'm not talking about people buying 100 shares, I'm talking the fund managers, didn't see this for what it is, they should be out of a job as well. All this stock was ever good for was catching it at the right time in the early days of the pandemic and selling after doubling or tripling your money. I have owned a Peloton bike for 5 or 6 years now and I was not foolish enough to buy into the idea that this growth was limited for a number of reasons, the smallest being the pandemic. I think the cost of the bike and the monthly fees are bigger inhibitors than people being stuck inside for the better part of a year. \n\nThe other nail in their coffin is remote work. I initially purchased my PTON bike because of my schedule. I used to get up for work between 4:30 and 5:00 AM, to catch a 5:30 train to NYC, and then get home around 6:00 PM. Last thing I wanted to do was get changed and go to a gym at the same time everyone else was, then eat dinner at 8:00 PM. So I got the bike. But I've been working remotely for going on 2 years.

Spend that time with your kids or doing whatever else. Remote work also makes it easier for a lot of people to exercise, over the lunch hour or whenever it may be so they may actually be harder to keep. \n\nThe other market is people who want a premium spin class regularly but don\u2019t want to spend $25 three times a week to attend in studio.

Rather than confining the subject and discussion to one place (say a sticky thread) for a few weeks to let most of us get it out of our system, it seems that automod has been updated to go after most discussions on the stock in question.  When I got hit with an automod removal this evening, I got the following message:\n\n> Sorry your comment in /r/stocks was automatically removed becausee it contains a keyword not suitable for /r/stocks. **Common words prevalent on WSB or other security-specific subs, hate language, or derogatory political nicknames are not appropriate here.** I am a bot and sometimes not the smartest so if you feel your comment was removed in error please message the moderators.\n\nMy first reaction was \"what did I say to get a message like that?!\"  I'm a pretty level-headed guy, and after learning that it was because I had mentioned the stock in question (one of the largest megacaps traded on the NYSE), that ticked me off a bit.  I'm thankful that the poster above my prior response linked me to the wiki, because otherwise I would have zero idea why it got removed.  I looked at the rules in the sidebar, and nothing immediately jumped out at me.\n\nOn the question as to whether this meets the standard of being a \"meme stock\" - I don't think so.  Is it a subject that's being excessively discussed in this sub?  Let's be real, yes it is.

But we're nowhere close to that yet.  For what it's worth, as a casual user, all the discussion I've seen regarding the stock in question is (mostly) legitimate back and forth conversations about the fair value of the stock, how negative perception of it diminishes the market value, discussions about how much it can/has/will innovate, etc.\n\nAre there some poor, low-effort posts?  I'm sure of it.  Have the mods been removing a good number of them that we don't know about as normal users?  Very likely.

One of the reasons is that it can't beat TikTok?", "selftext": "Recently, Meta announced its first financial report after its name was changed, followed by a \"Tragedy\" in which the share price plunged by 26.39%.\n\nUnder the share price collapse, Meta's market value evaporated $237.6 billion.\n\nAccording to the financial report, Meta's revenue in the fourth quarter was US $33.671 billion, a year-on-year increase of 20%; The net profit was US $10.285 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 8%.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, Meta's \"reality labs\" business had an operating loss of $10.193 billion and a revenue of $2.274 billion.\n\nThroughout the weak performance of Meta in the fourth quarter, there are three main reasons.\n\nFirst, the privacy policy changes of platforms such as Apple and Google have a huge impact on advertisers' income.\n\nOn April 27, 2021, Apple IOS 14.5 was officially released, accompanied by the strongest privacy rules in Apple's history. Under this privacy rule, if the app or company wants to stay on the IOS system, it must study its own attribution scheme and cooperate with Apple's skadnetwork for technical docking.\n\nAfter the introduction of the new privacy policy, advertisers face two challenges. First, the accuracy of advertising positioning decreases and the cost of advertisers increases. Second, it is difficult to measure the effect of advertising.\n\nThis also means that under the shackles of Apple's new privacy policy, many of Meta's revenue businesses will also be affected to a certain extent.\n\nSecond,  Metaverse\u2018s business is still in the money burning stage, and its contribution to Meta's income is limited, which will even drag down the development of overall performance for a long time.\n\nZuckerberg also warned of this situation. In July 2021, Zuckerberg mentioned in his vision description of Metaverse that \"in the next three years at least, Meta's  Metaverse business needs long-term capital investment, and the possibility of profit is very small, which will compress Meta's profit space and put pressure on meta's cash flow.\"\n\nThe release of the four seasons newspaper mentioned that Meta's \"Metaverse\" strategy is in continuous loss. The development department realitylabs had a revenue of less than $2.3 billion in 2021, but a loss of more than $10 billion. It is the loss of this department that has dragged down Meta's overall profitability.\n\nThird, the growth of Facebook users in Meta's traditional business stagnated, facing the impact of competitors represented by tiktok.\n\nAccording to the financial report, Facebook has 1.93 billion live users in the four seasons, a year-on-year increase of 5%, but lower than the 1.95 billion expected by the market; Monthly live users reached 2.91 billion, a year-on-year increase of 4%, lower than the 2.95 billion expected by the market.\n\nIt can be seen that the growth momentum of Facebook's number of users is obviously insufficient. An important reason is that short video products seize the users of traditional social products.\n\nAmong them, TikTok poses the greatest threat to Facebook. Zuckerberg admitted on the earnings conference call that \"TikTok is such a powerful competitor that it can continue to grow at a fairly fast speed on the basis of having a large user base\".\n\nRich Greenfield, a partner of lightshed, a consulting firm, said frankly that meta is facing a life and death threat from TikTok.\n\nIn fact, the \"catch-up\" between TikTok and Facebook began as early as 2017.\n\nIn November 2017, byte beat acquired music, which Zuckerberg spent six months still unable to reach Ly, accompanied by musical More than 200 million users of the ly platform, as well as the accumulation of technologies, products, operations and other capabilities, are all incorporated into TikTok.\n\nThe rapid trend that TikTok has maintained since its launch has also triggered frequent \"provocations\" by Facebook.\n\nDuring the sale of TikTok in 2020, Zuckerberg repeatedly \"instigated\" TikTok to the local regulatory authorities that there were various unsafe vulnerabilities and data disclosure behaviors, so supervision should be strengthened.\n\nAt the same time, when tiktok fell into the dilemma of \"blocking\", Facebook quickly increased its investment in instagram and launched reels, a short video function with 15 seconds or 30 seconds, copying the short video playing methods and functions similar to TikTok, waiting for the opportunity to seize the market.\n\nHowever, in this battle after battle, tiktok still strongly maintained its top position in the industry, and even jumped to the top of the global list of popular mobile app downloads.\n\nLast September, TikTok announced that its global monthly active users had exceeded 1 billion, and it took only four years to achieve this feat. Facebook, as the global social overlord, spent eight years.\n\nAccording to the mobile app report for the fourth quarter of 2021 released by sensortower, TikTok's download volume ranks first in the world of mobile app, maintaining an overall leading position in 2021.\n\nTo sum up, Meta is indeed in danger and in a dilemma. On the one hand, the advertising revenue is hit by the privacy rules of IOS platform. On the other hand, the Metaverse business is in the early stage of development and has little contribution to revenue in the short term.\n\nThe biggest threat is the rise of TikTok in the world. The rapid development of the latter further highlights the decline and dilemma of Meta, the global social overlord.\n\nMaybe the grand vision of the Metaverse described by Zuckerberg will eventually come, but before that, meta still needs to free up more resources to resist the challenge of TikTok.\n\nAfter all, Meta has to consider the current \"threat of life and death\" before telling the story of the distant Metaverse.", "id": "snflid", "created_utc": 1644310180.0, "score": 79, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|40|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|27|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=snflid)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=snflid)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2603802978992462}, {"body": "Meta worths $1.5T?
