Furthermore, the environmental fallout from this war will spike renewed conversations about improving our environment. As a result, more money and more policies will be put into place that will benefit Tesla in the long run. \n\nIn the short run, stocks will be in a world of hurt. Please take care of your mental, physical, and emotional health.\n\nI pray that this war between Russia and Ukraine resolves as soon as possible.
