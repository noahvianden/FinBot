This is obviously not true as he has murdered many people including his own citizens. But it's not hard to surmise that Trump has an ego problem and is easily persuaded with some pampering to his ego, so by Putin saying nice things to and about Trump he can create a persona in Trump's mind of a nice and wonderful man.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that when the Soviet empire collapsed it was a huge embarrassment to the Russian government, Putin went through that and emerged from it and he is looking for respect and fear from the rest of the world.
