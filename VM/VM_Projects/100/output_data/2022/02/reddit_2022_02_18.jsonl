{"title": "Good companies you bought too high", "selftext": "We all know that, by choosing our own stocks, we\u2019re bound to make some of these mistakes. We research the company, we know they\u2019re profitable and stable, but we end up paying too much for their stock. Which companies in your portfolio are you holding that you entered at too high of a price? I\u2019ll start\u2026\n\n1) MMM - I grabbed 10 shares at around 178 after it came down from 200 alongside AMGN and JNJ. Of the three purchased at the time, only MMM hasn\u2019t printed. It\u2019s a \u201cforever\u201d hold for me, but man, why did I think the high 170s was a decent price?\n\n2) DIS - Bought on my first day in the market back in April of 2021. I had no clue how to value stocks at the time, and I grabbed them at 187. It\u2019s only returned to that price once since then (August earnings beat), but otherwise it\u2019s a permanent red mark.\n\n3) INTC - Same as Disney. Day one purchase, just happened to buy when it was at 67. Have since added more at 47 to bring my average down, but wow, why the rush to buy?\n\n4) CI - Not a day one buy, but I bought based on its up trending chart, hoping to continue riding the wave. Little did I know my 259 entry would be near the top of the wave, because CI since then dipped as far down as the high 190s.\n\n5) RIO - Lured in by its dividends, I happened to buy at 90 when commodity prices were near their peak. It climbed to 97 before quickly tumbling into the 60s. It\u2019s climbing again though, but I need to sell it and buy back in when commodities drop again.\n\nYours?", "id": "sv3hcb", "created_utc": 1645142760.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a mistake but i do wish i bought MSFT now rather than two months ago", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "Better than the leaps I bought @ 330$.

{"title": "$DKNG + $ARKK - Cathie Woods has LOST IT!!", "selftext": "I personally find it absolutely frightening the way the interview yesterday unfolded on CNBC with Cathie Woods. Valid counterpoints were made to her investment strategy that were basically undeniable, and she blew smoke and quoted statistics and tried to make it sounded like she was absolutely competent.\n\nCathie Woods getting into $HOOD has to be the ABSOLUTE bottom for her funds. That stock is an absolute dumpster fire, the worst stock I can think of owning (off the top of my head). $DKNG + $ROKU being the two latest dumpster fires she's hoarding. She's going on about her 5 year strategy (funds won't exist in 5 years I hope for everyone else's sake) while selling Twitter when she bought the position in Nov. '21.\n\nI have five premises here:\n\n**1)** Cathie Woods is NEVER wrong. Even when she's wrong, she's not actually wrong, the MARKET is wrong.\n\nThis reminds me of a person who buys a lottery ticket and claims it's the winning ticket, before the numbers come out. Well, the numbers finally do come out and not a single one match! Hah! You're wrong!! Well, the ticket holder digs in deeper, instead of acknowledging his failure, he instead says that the numbers are the winning numbers, however, the lottery draw was rigged. It will be investigated and the true winning numbers (on his ticket) will then be drawn, and he will be a millionaire. You have to understand there are people throughout history who will deny the truth until their death, creating their own alternate reality, and **these people are the most dangerous people of all.**\n\n**Cathie Woods reminds me of a near perfect mirror image of Elizabeth Holmes with Theranos.** Elizabeth Holmes was extremely well spoken, and she absolutely never waivered publicly in regards to her thoughts on performance, the company, the future, etc. She had people believing against their better judgement because of how charismatic she was. **Avoid these people!**\n\n**2)** She's a money grabber!! Look at that expense ratio!! .75!?! I could see that being justified if you took a yearly or monthly draw of .75 annualized based on total returns of the entire fund since the beginning, never taking draws when the funds are in a loss territory. You think she's going to do that?\n\nShe's also STARTING NEW FUNDS!!! Her flagship fund has nothing but bagholders, and she wants to start NEW FUNDS! The gall!!!! She's cashing out on her image before it blows up in smoke. She'll be relaxing on a hand-built super-yacht, rest assured, when it's all said and done.\n\n**3)** This follows a bit of #2, but she has absolutely no personal risk, except for the future income stream if her funds shrink into nothing. Her management fees are locked in whether you lose 99.999% of your money with her. It's her money, forever. Car salesmen are compensated on sales. They are paid if they successfully sell a car (make the fund above-market gains). The callousness of getting paid regardless of fund performance is to me, ruthless.\n\n**4)** I remember, after losing quite a bit on the buy-button-removal fiasco with $HOOD related to $BB calls / $BB stock price being in the WSB discord telling people my story. The ones who actually believed I could have lost that much money decided they would fix me. \"Just invest in Cathie Woods $ARKK. She's the kingmaker! You just don't know what you're doing. She will carry you across the finish line.\" Must have been 20 people in that chat room and all agreed.\n\nHowever, I had a quick look at $ARKK's holdings and realized that at that time, February 2021, every stock she'd invested in had gone moon-shot and to make it worse, they all looked like pretty ridiculous stocks to me at the time. Well, after voicing my opinion, I was mocked heavily to the point I began to question my own decision making.\n\nPoint being is that someone who has so much charisma, is so well spoken and sounds knowledgeable (Elizabeth Holmes again) are ultimately the ones who convince others to drink the Cool-Aid. They stop thinking rationally about the investments; it becomes cult-like. Be extremely wary when people don't heed your counterpoints regarding stock trades; if they aren't open to obvious holes in their logic, they aren't thinking rationally.\n\n**5)** Finally, she's a religious fanatic. Now, for full disclosure, I am a Christian as well (apologies for bringing up religion), however, she takes it to a dangerous level. I don't care how good my surgeon was, but if I was about to undergo surgery, and my surgeon said he's \"fulfilling the will of God\" by operating on me, I'd be off that table before he finished the sentence. She named her fund after the Ark of the Covenant. Have you guys read what happened to the priests who touched it to prevent it from falling to the ground?!\n\nMoney isn't created in a vacuum. In the stock market, there are winners and losers. If you win, someone else lost, for the most part. I don't necessarily want to get into M1 creation by FED pushing up money supply, etc, but basically, if your fund is beating inflation, you took the money from someone(s). How can that be the \"will of God.\" Chuck, I know you're my best friend and all, but you have to give me your house and sign over the deed. It's the \"will of God.\" God told me!\n\n**TL;DR: Be scared of Elizabeth Holmes #2, Cathie Woods.

When everyone universally believes something is a bad trade you can bet that trade is generally going to be miss-priced considerably. This is why legendary investors advise buying into fear and selling greed. When fear is high assets are generally mispriced to the downside, and when investors are overly confident assets are generally mispriced to the upside. Now, investors like Buffett and Benjamin Graham would probably advise you buy and hold blue-chip companies with low earnings multiples during these periods, but Cathie invests in growth tech and right now growth tech is historically cheap and universally hated. If there was ever an incredible buying opportunity for these stocks in the last several years, it's probably now. Why? Because now seems to be the absolute worst time to go all in on growth tech. Cathie Wood for all her flaws is the only investor in the market right now with the balls to actually disagree with the sentiment and buy. This is precisely why she won so big in 2020-2021. When everyone thought TSLA was going bankrupt Cathie Wood was getting mocked for saying it was going to $4000.\n\n* Secondly, I really don't think it makes much sense to judge Cathie Wood's performance on a year-by-year basis. She clearly doesn't give a crap about what happens in those kinds of time frames so if she's not investing for returns this year, why judge her on them? The reason I'm pointing this out is because it's entirely possible inflation concerns are gone by the end of the year and the FED begins to ease their hawkish stance. If we're currently overestimating how high inflation will be for the duration of 2022 and then how high it will remain in the years to follow it's possible this whole rotation into value has been an overreaction. Perhaps the FED won't be as aggressive as the market fears and perhaps growth stocks shouldn't be trading at their lowest valuations in years and will actually recover quite well over the next 2-3 years. From 2021-2025 she may not beat the market, but from 2022-2025 there's certainly a chance she will. What we know for sure is that when everyone was buying ARKK at all time highs last year it was a huge mistake. Now it's down 60% and is so hated that everyone is shorting it there is a chance now is the time to buy.\n\nBut who knows.
