We're giving a few borderline posts a bit more breathing room to see how the comments turn out. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. But would you expect the mods of WSB to be anything but gamblers?\n\n---\n\nThis is exactly why I made News flaired posts have to be text posts, not links. They require that you write additional text beyond just linking an article.\n\nLooking at the first page or two of WSB, the vast majority of posts contains \"actionable advice\". Often it's explicitly spelled out in the title or body, but sometimes it's very obvious what the implication is.\n\n>I don\u2019t care if Germany says they will go fully green for the 1000th time. It isn\u2019t going to happen and this isn\u2019t actionable advice.\n\nGood thing markets don't care about your feelings. Cleantech rallied hard today.

That's why [no one makes money trading on inflation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/an-obscure-corner-of-wall-street-is-making-billions-trading-inflation/wcm/aaaa73b0-21b8-49ba-b114-d9658f7cfa63/amp/). \n\nBut really this should be seen as a half meme, half discussion post. \n\n>\u201cZelensky says Ukraine will meet with Russia for peace talks. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8ebro!

It has now been removed.\n\nBut again, this is the one post on the front page or two that is truly off topic.\n\n> If your post isn\u2019t actionable advice, take it somewhere else. If you didn\u2019t put your money on the table, you have no skin in the game, and therefore have zero credibility as a trader or in finance.\n\nI agree with you. Adding positions or actionable advice makes posts that much better. \n\nHowever, requiring them makes the sub feel like a 24/7 infomercial.\n\nAnd that's because a much better heuristic of post value is the quality of the discussion in the body or comments.\n\nIt's entirely fair to do a bunch of research, or post some market moving news, but not find an investable idea yourself. That has value, and if you do the groundwork, users will chime in and find a way to make money off the situation.\n\nFinally, a quick word on politics.\n\nIt's really hard to separate politics from markets, they are fundamentally intertwined. In volatile situations like right now, that line becomes even more blurred.\n\nIt certainly doesn't help that the whole world has become military strategy experts overnight.\n\nA priori we have no idea whether a thread will produce quality discussion, or end up like r/politics.
