Write puts to make income and hedge yourself from inflation/opportunity cost.\n\nOptions are part of a strategy of investing, and investing is a strategy of patience, timing, research, and 90% crystal ball/pray the company isn\u2019t retarded.\n\nThat being said, save up some cash, buy some stock, and avoid options. But the worst thing you can do right now is get scared out of the market.\n\nAlso, get the fuck off robinhood.

Omg don't fomo on meme stonks. The volatility is hard to time....wait til a 8% down day on your meme....and then buy a call a month or so out....sell within 2 days if you timed it right.\n\n5.) Don't let people on reddit hurt your feelings, most of them are idiots anyway. Crayon eaters. Lol\n\n6.) Find what works for you....hey people told me options are risky....but I couldn't even make a dollar buying Apple shares...I'm too impatient for LONGS.....so I trade options but I trade them on the SPY and QQQ....its smallest increments in p&l are dollars (not pennies)\n\n7.) Learn about moving averages, macd, and what a timeframe is... we have long term (>6months), intermediate (monthly) and short term (weekly and daily). When in doubt, zoom out friend.\n\n8. I know a 98% loss is devastating so take some time for yourself and try to come up with a strategy that works for you....try making trades that involve less than $50. A bunch of em. \n\n9.) Cut your losers, hold the runners.\n\n10.) Don't double down.\n\n11.) Bonus: Learn about treasury yields and where they are at...T10, learn about the current value of the dollar, and know the whole market sentiment before making a play on an individual stock.
