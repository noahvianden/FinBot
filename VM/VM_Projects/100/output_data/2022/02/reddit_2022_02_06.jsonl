{"title": "\"F\" - Ford $50 Price Target!!!! , TSLA - $500 Price Target!!!!", "selftext": "**Product Line**\n\nTesla have limited product line when it comes to EV\u2019s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. \n\n**Margins**\n\nTesla\u2019s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin \u2013 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross \u2013 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that\u2019s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. \n\n**Valuation & Market Share** \n\nThe most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford\u2019s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla\u2019s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That\u2019s changing now!! \n\nTesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that\u2019s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV\u2019s \n\n\u00b7**Moat**\n\nTesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV\u2019s and automation. With time and effort that\u2019s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV\u2019s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. \n\n**Marketing**\n\nTesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!\n\n **High Interest rate Environment** \n\nWe are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. \n\n\u00b7**Team**\n\nLast but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford\u2019s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer", "id": "slndrm", "created_utc": 1644113717.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|50|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/slndrm/f_ford_50_price_target_tsla_500_price_target/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlql2u/buy_aapl_by_eod_11042021_to_receive_the_dividend/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pub4pk/asan_super_short_candidate_with_handsome_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqq3cw/cp3_ai/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlqnv2/buy_aapl_by_eod_11042021_to_get_the_dividend/) [x](https://i.redd.it/v45nbyd7oji71.jpg) [x](https://i.redd.it/n08nace2pji71.jpg) [x](https://i.redd.it/ojci00jmoji71.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf479l/told_you_so_hood_will_fall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf49n0/told_you_so_hood_will_fall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mu5fgk/prqr_has_over_300_upside_go_long_prqr/) \n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=slndrm)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=slndrm)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I believe your name says it all friendo..", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1565796136856079}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2976553738117218}, {"body": "You missed an extra 0 on TSLA...

What this means is that WHETHER OR NOT THE ACQUISITION GOES THROUGH, wall streets perceptions about the stocks future will swing like Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball with her tits out. (Merely a cheap valuation like 2X SALES can be dismissed as a value trap, merely a good business can be dismissed as a bubbly valuation -- yet, the two combined cannot be dismissed without the stock swinging massively upwards. In the upwards direction). \n\nMy feeling is these news stories were leaked but the CEO while he was drunk off his ass shitting off the back of his pickup truck. He doesn't really want to sell the company, he just wants the stock to go back up. Well guess what.

{"title": "How Tesla has conquered EV Batteries whilst the 'competition' struggles ...", "selftext": " ***How Tesla has the best Electric Vehicle batteries \ud83d\udd0b on the market, and they've successfully secured their supply of these batteries for the foreseeable future. Something Competitors HAVEN'T done....***\n\nThe Battery quite literally powers the entire vehicle, it is thus not strange that for the average Electric Vehicle the battery accounts for ***50%*** of the production costs! Despite the market not knowing how to react to Tesla\u2019s 4Q earnings call, there was some hidden gem hidden in the recent news that most people simply aren\u2019t understanding. It is something that is going to be a key factor in determining which companies survive the future in the Automotive industry, and Tesla has already secured their place. Let me tell you\u2026.\n\n**Why are batteries so expensive and important?**\n\nThe future of Electric Vehicles will be constrained by the amount of available high-quality batteries, Elon musk himself even said in a 2018 tweet that:\n\n\u201cTesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.\u201d\n\nThis is still true in 2022 and will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future, until battery production meets the demand for Electric Vehicles. Batteries are so important because they account for such a large portion of the vehicles cost, but why are they so expensive? This is mainly due to the materials that make up the battery, due to the fact that the batteries need to be rechargeable the batteries use lithium-ion or sometimes also Nickel batteries.\n\nThe components that make the cathode (such as nickel, lithium or even cobalt) are the most expensive. This is because they need to be mined, processed into high-purity chemical compounds and THEN they\u2019re set-up to be used in the battery. Although over the last few years battery prices have dropped 81% since 2013, their scarcity remains an issue\n\nThe demand for electric vehicles is simply out-pacing battery production. So you better hope your favourite car manufacturer has enough batteries to supply their vehicles. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the case. Yet Tesla has positioned themselves not only to have the best performing batteries with the new 4680 batteries, they\u2019re also continuously securing contracts for long-term supply of raw materials and batteries to power their 50% YoY volume growth for the fore-see able future.\n\nBefore you continue, Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my independent research and work!\n\nTesla has ensured that they are limiting the battery constraints for volume production whilst competitors are stumbling around the in the dark. Just look at the Fourth Quarter comments (below) made by \u201cmajor-competitor\u201c Ford compared to Tesla\u2019s comments regarding their battery capacity.\n\nNow let me talk about those 4680\u2019s I mentioned and recent developments that have made Tesla\u2019s battery supply even more robust.\n\n**4680\u2019s & New Contracts - Tesla\u2019s Battery advantage**\n\nTesla announced on September 2020 in their Battery Day conference that they where making the new and improved 4680 battery cells. These are currently being built in California but soon will also be built in Texas and are being supplied by Panasonic to help scale Tesla production. What is the importance of the 4680 cells for Tesla vehicles?\n\n\u00b7 Changing from the currently used 2170 cells to the 4680s will increase range by 24% \\*\n\n\u00b7 5 X reduction in electrical path means you will be able to super charge faster\n\n\u00b7 The thermal management of the entire battery pack is improved so the cell cooling will be much more efficient\n\n\u00b7 The dollar costs per kilowatt hour should be reduced by 50%. That is an estimated decreased cost of production of about $7,000!\n\nOk so now you understand how important the 4680 battery cells are and that battery cells will be the main constraint for the production of future electric vehicles, let\u2019s have a look at how Tesla is securing their battery supply.\n\nSecuring these batteries, and specifically the 4680\u2019s is a crucial step that Tesla wants to complete to ensure they maintain the biggest market share of the entire Electric Vehicle industry. Elon Musk said in 2021:\n\n\u201cSo in Texas, we\u2019re building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and we\u2019ll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.\u201d\n\nSo Tesla needs to be able to supply their cars using the 4680s really quickly and at a pace such that the batteries aren\u2019t a bottleneck for production. The 4680 is also incredibly important for 2022 and 2023 when production of the Cybertruck will start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 4680 cells will provide the Cybertruck with the needed strength and power to move the huge truck around. Just recently Tesla purchased a large order with Panasonic to increase their supply of 4680 cells, Panasonic CFO Hirokazu Umeda said:\n\n\u201cTesla has put in an extremely strong request for the 4680, so when we are actually able to deliver the 4680, we plan to put top priority on Tesla. We\u2019ll first prioritize supplying Tesla once the verifications are complete.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile competing auto manufacturers are struggling to provide any significant amount of Electric Vehicles and will continue to struggle and face the brink of bankruptcy whilst Tesla continues to grow volume production just as fast, or faster than the EV adoption grows at.\n\nThis partnership and many similar to it will allow Tesla to pay the lowest amount per kwH for their battery cells because they have generated long-term relationships with their providers and continuously focus on reducing the cost of the battery.\n\n[Support my independent work and checkout similar articles](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/p/how-tesla-has-conquered-ev-batteries?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo2NDkwODA3MiwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDgyMTg2NzAsImlhdCI6MTY0NDA5MjI2OCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTY0OTk4NSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.O4MgcoIHQipPS1QtqBicjVfwjROTXqyzwcyMh7CE1Mo)\n\nTLDR Key-Take-Aways\n\n\ud83d\udd0b \u201cTesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.\u201d\u201c\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Introduction of the 4680 cells could decrease cost of production by about $7,000\n\n\ud83d\udccf 4680 cells could increase range by 24%\n\n\u270d Partnership with Panasonic could secure batteries for an additional 400,000 vehicles", "id": "sm5eth", "created_utc": 1644176318.0, "score": 149, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sm5eth)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sm5eth)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04366089776158333}, {"body": "You really took this much time to do a DD on TSLA?

No one wants to get caught on a peak of a cyclical stock, the performance of this quarter is irrelevant. Paying off the debt cannot be disregarded as it was already promised to shareholders and pushed back once due to acquisition of a scrap provider, and in an increasing interest environment no responsible manager can go into share buybacks in this setup no matter how much he would like to. Furthermore, recently clf slipped to 16 and is now recovered to 19. A reminder that in times when steel prices were growing and automotive was expected to recover in 2022, the price was still around 19,5. Now the outlook is much worse and the price is not much different. \n\nIn my opinion this can bump up a little before earnings due to speculative expectations of retail, and then go down after earnings.
