{"title": "Berkshire Hathaway?", "selftext": "Hey, \n\nI would like to ask you guys, if you would buy BRK.B shares at the moment. \n\nI think, that in general, Berkshire is a no brainer. \n\nStill the valuation might look a little too high at the moment.\n\nWhat I also like, is the exposure to Apple. They own like 40% Apple (% of stocks held).\n\nI think, that the BRK.B seems like an interesting stock regarding current uncertainty. \n\nEverybody says, that the cash on hand is excessive. I think, Cash is king in bear markets.\n\nWith the expected turmoil (Fed, Inflation, Russia etc.) the cash might come in handy.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen many Posts about Berkshire so I wanted to ask you, what is your opinion on the company? \n\nRegards\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all for participating in this discussion.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is the following:\n\nMany of you say, buffet and munger die equals the company losing hard. I don\u2019t agree to be honest.\n\nThey often said, that measures were taken to provide for the success of the company after they pass.\n\nAlso, one of the things Buffet himself said was:\n\n\u201eWe want to buy businesses, that can outlive a (relative) short period of bad management. \u201e (or smth. Like this).\n\nI read this like -> Coca Cola ceo dies? Well, people will still drink coke.\n\nI think the same thing applies here.\n\nThe business was of course very influenced by those two but I personally think, that their influence reduced in the past few years. That is natural ofc. \n\nSo my guess would be short term volatility at most.\n \nBut who knows\u2026\n\nThank you again and have a nice week!", "id": "szgswk", "created_utc": 1645620912.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "I like it, it's basically like a big conglomerate.

We need to get back to that fast, as once inflation becomes expected (by the general populace and businesses, not the fed) then it becomes pervasive.\n\nWe are also looking at the one-two punch of sharply rising energy costs due to the Ukraine-Russia ongoing escalation.  This could likely push the inflation numbers up to double digits, at which point the fed will be forced to make drastic policy adjustments to right the ship.  If they would have raised rates a year ago it would have immediately cooled the economy and allowed the supply chain to fix itself and inflation would have indeed been \"transient\" and could have immediately eased rates after inflation wash checked and the supply chain restored.\n\nNow we have a still severely crippled supply chain with the energy spikes (potential crisis).  Rates need to rise.  Inefficient companies need to go under, that way resources (i.e. people and money) can be reallocated to more efficient processes.  The down part of the business cycle is always painful, but bad investments need to be purged out so we can regrow bigger and better.  Just like a plant needs to be pruned back to promote effective growth, so does the economy.

Putin's speech seemed far more unhinged than usual. The Ukraine situation is obviously something he's been thinking about for a long time and he clearly has very strong, even emotional thoughts about it. The only good thing about the cold war was that both sides had mostly rational leaders. Thankfully Trump is no longer in power, because who knows what he would be doing right now if he was, but this is the problem with irrational unhinged leaders is that you can't predict what they're going to do next. I keep hearing people say he it wouldn't make sense for Putin to authorise a full invasion of Ukraine, but this clearly isn't about what makes senses. For Putin this is about settling a grief he has had with the West and NATO for decades. At the risk of invoking Godwin's law here, Hitler's invasion of Poland was similar in the fact it was emotionally motivated. I guess what I'm saying is that I wouldn't bet on this being the end of the situation in Ukraine.

It's still there but most of the good stuff is paywalled now, the guy built up a client base.\n\nHe had his proprietary formula he called the Affordability Index.  It was regional - calculated per county - and there was some special sauce applied to distinguish certain regional differences in things like property taxation and so on.\n\nBut there were two main ingredients: average housing prices in a region, and average incomes in that region.  It turns out they don't move in lock step at all, but their ratio moves cyclically in rather predictable ways.\n\nWages have just started to come up after being basically flat for 20 years, but in no way have they caught up to housing prices in most regions, which have been on a century-smashing tear since they bottomed in '08. \n\nUnfortunately, mortgage rates are also just off century lows.  As they go up, the same monthly payment buys less house.  Even if house prices come down a little bit to keep up, you're not actually moving the affordability needle with this.\n\nThis is all very intentional on the part of the Fed - the 'wealth effect' of owning a costly house spurs consumption - and there is no way the Fed or Congress will do anything to impair it, as consumption is the healthy way of stimulating the economy, as opposed to lending a bunch of capital at below-zero real rates to be misallocated in stupid IPOs and other worthless projects.\n\nSo I always go back to Scott Adams' concise advice:  \"Buy a house if you want to live in a house and you can afford it.\"  Notice there's nothing there about timing the housing market at all.\n\n[Here is a useful rent vs. buy calculator.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html)  The fun part is in the advanced settings.  Most people will learn that they need to live in a purchased home a minimum of 8-9 years before sale, just to break even; after that, profit starts to accrue.  There is no 'making a killing' in 5 years unless you have a real estate license and can handle the sale yourself.\n\nQuestions like this are probably better dealt with at /r/personalfinance, by the way.

Price will stay high because people want houses. The stellar sales in Q1 is proof (and not caused by a rush of people trying to lock on at lower mortgage rates). Price and demand will sustain while inflation persists, mortgage rates rise and interest rates go up. It won't be a boom but it'll be normal. The housing market is not overbought and building will increase but not enough to meet demand.\n\nThesis B: the housing market became overbought and over priced because of free money and low interest rates. Most people who want (or can) buy a house did. In any economy, there is a pull back after growth. There was explosive atypical growth that will pull back because that's what economies do. There are troubling economic indicators across the board that point to a looming recession. All of these things (plus the stock market) mean housing sales will slow and prices will drop by the end of 2022 unless something big changes.\n\nPeople should be careful with a 5-10 year windows.
