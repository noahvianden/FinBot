{"title": "Berkshire Hathaway?", "selftext": "Hey, \n\nI would like to ask you guys, if you would buy BRK.B shares at the moment. \n\nI think, that in general, Berkshire is a no brainer. \n\nStill the valuation might look a little too high at the moment.\n\nWhat I also like, is the exposure to Apple. They own like 40% Apple (% of stocks held).\n\nI think, that the BRK.B seems like an interesting stock regarding current uncertainty. \n\nEverybody says, that the cash on hand is excessive. I think, Cash is king in bear markets.\n\nWith the expected turmoil (Fed, Inflation, Russia etc.) the cash might come in handy.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen many Posts about Berkshire so I wanted to ask you, what is your opinion on the company? \n\nRegards\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all for participating in this discussion.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is the following:\n\nMany of you say, buffet and munger die equals the company losing hard. I don\u2019t agree to be honest.\n\nThey often said, that measures were taken to provide for the success of the company after they pass.\n\nAlso, one of the things Buffet himself said was:\n\n\u201eWe want to buy businesses, that can outlive a (relative) short period of bad management. \u201e (or smth. Like this).\n\nI read this like -> Coca Cola ceo dies? Well, people will still drink coke.\n\nI think the same thing applies here.\n\nThe business was of course very influenced by those two but I personally think, that their influence reduced in the past few years. That is natural ofc. \n\nSo my guess would be short term volatility at most.\n \nBut who knows\u2026\n\nThank you again and have a nice week!", "id": "szgswk", "created_utc": 1645620912.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "I like it, it's basically like a big conglomerate.

If they would have raised rates a year ago it would have immediately cooled the economy and allowed the supply chain to fix itself and inflation would have indeed been \"transient\" and could have immediately eased rates after inflation wash checked and the supply chain restored.\n\nNow we have a still severely crippled supply chain with the energy spikes (potential crisis).  Rates need to rise.  Inefficient companies need to go under, that way resources (i.e. people and money) can be reallocated to more efficient processes.  The down part of the business cycle is always painful, but bad investments need to be purged out so we can regrow bigger and better.  Just like a plant needs to be pruned back to promote effective growth, so does the economy.

The only good thing about the cold war was that both sides had mostly rational leaders. Thankfully Trump is no longer in power, because who knows what he would be doing right now if he was, but this is the problem with irrational unhinged leaders is that you can't predict what they're going to do next. I keep hearing people say he it wouldn't make sense for Putin to authorise a full invasion of Ukraine, but this clearly isn't about what makes senses. For Putin this is about settling a grief he has had with the West and NATO for decades. At the risk of invoking Godwin's law here, Hitler's invasion of Poland was similar in the fact it was emotionally motivated. I guess what I'm saying is that I wouldn't bet on this being the end of the situation in Ukraine.

It's still there but most of the good stuff is paywalled now, the guy built up a client base.\n\nHe had his proprietary formula he called the Affordability Index.  It was regional - calculated per county - and there was some special sauce applied to distinguish certain regional differences in things like property taxation and so on.\n\nBut there were two main ingredients: average housing prices in a region, and average incomes in that region.  It turns out they don't move in lock step at all, but their ratio moves cyclically in rather predictable ways.\n\nWages have just started to come up after being basically flat for 20 years, but in no way have they caught up to housing prices in most regions, which have been on a century-smashing tear since they bottomed in '08. \n\nUnfortunately, mortgage rates are also just off century lows.  As they go up, the same monthly payment buys less house.  Even if house prices come down a little bit to keep up, you're not actually moving the affordability needle with this.\n\nThis is all very intentional on the part of the Fed - the 'wealth effect' of owning a costly house spurs consumption - and there is no way the Fed or Congress will do anything to impair it, as consumption is the healthy way of stimulating the economy, as opposed to lending a bunch of capital at below-zero real rates to be misallocated in stupid IPOs and other worthless projects.\n\nSo I always go back to Scott Adams' concise advice:  \"Buy a house if you want to live in a house and you can afford it.\"  Notice there's nothing there about timing the housing market at all.\n\n[Here is a useful rent vs. buy calculator.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html)  The fun part is in the advanced settings.  Most people will learn that they need to live in a purchased home a minimum of 8-9 years before sale, just to break even; after that, profit starts to accrue.  There is no 'making a killing' in 5 years unless you have a real estate license and can handle the sale yourself.\n\nQuestions like this are probably better dealt with at /r/personalfinance, by the way.

Price will stay high because people want houses. The stellar sales in Q1 is proof (and not caused by a rush of people trying to lock on at lower mortgage rates). Price and demand will sustain while inflation persists, mortgage rates rise and interest rates go up. It won't be a boom but it'll be normal. The housing market is not overbought and building will increase but not enough to meet demand.\n\nThesis B: the housing market became overbought and over priced because of free money and low interest rates. Most people who want (or can) buy a house did. In any economy, there is a pull back after growth. There was explosive atypical growth that will pull back because that's what economies do. There are troubling economic indicators across the board that point to a looming recession. All of these things (plus the stock market) mean housing sales will slow and prices will drop by the end of 2022 unless something big changes.\n\nPeople should be careful with a 5-10 year windows.

{"title": "FB, INTC, and BABA will be top performers in the next 5 years", "selftext": "I am placing a huge bet on these three stocks, FB, INTC, and BABA as I believe they will yield significant returns over the next 5 years and destroy whatever the market does. \n\nI'm going to give a very brief overview: \n\nFB: HUGE overreaction from earnings, they will continue to grow at  a steady pace as they continue to monetize and grow their platforms while also capitalizing on the emergence of the metaverse. I expect them to hit and exceed the high range of their growth expectation 11%+. Even if FB is not able to execute to perfection their ridiculously low multiples paired with huge moat for their business model makes them an enticing long term buy. I believe this has the best risk/reward ratio compared to the others. Five years from now: **Bear Case: $310.  Base case: $420 Bull Case: $515**\n\n INTC: INTC is somewhat of a similar story, I believe it actually has slightly more risk than FB as their high capital expenditures putting short term margin stress on their business don't pay off properly it will severely harm them but that is unlikely. Intel is doing a phenomenal job investing in themselves as they will start to take the lead in manufacturing, CPU's, and quite possibly GPU's if they execute to perfection. Their excessive amounts of R&D will allow them to regain market share from AMD in many different segments but most importantly the data center segment and with their heavy investments into manufacturing they may be able to take the lead or properly compete with TSMC and Samsung which would be substantial. They are also beginning to produce GPU's that will help fill the GPU shortage in the short term and if they execute to perfection they may dominate that market. Essentially, if Intel is able to execute their plans somewhat efficiently they will begin to grow 10-12% starting 2024-2025 and with them trading at a P/E of 9 they will do extremely well. One common argument is that people don't want to wait until 2025 for Intel to start growing and that theres no point in investing now but it's important to remember that the stock market moves in the future, it won't wait until INTC starts putting up these numbers but when it appears so. Five years from now: **Bear Case: $60.  Base Case: $85 Bull case: $102**\n\nBABA: I've written about BABA before and this may be the most hated but this has the most upside potential but does carry some significant risks. I'm not even going to bother going through their business, which dominates in e-commerce, cloud, and numerous other consumer segments that are essentially concerned. Everyone knows that BABA has great financials but people are simply scared to invest because of China. I think this is a classic overreaction from the market as China will begin to ease regulations on their companies as they view GDP growth and employment to be vital going into the future and as long as BABA complies with the reasonable policies they will do fine. It's simply a matter of being patient, waiting for these short term headwinds to clear, and it will yield great returns. They are reporting earnings tomorrow and I honestly don't know what the fuck will happen but to be honest I don't give a fuck what happens, they are great for the long term but facing some significant short term headwinds. Now, the reason this is the riskiest is if A) the CCP doesn't calm the fuck down and continues to destroy BABA or B) China invades Taiwan which would not only destroy BABA but the rest of the market. Overall, five years from now **Bear Case: $200. Base Case: $390 Bull Case: $510**\n\n**What are some companies you guys have extremely high conviction on? Essentially, what are your core positions? (No VOO, SPY, VTI)** \n\nI own a lot of stocks but these are 3/5 core positions and I think they will dominate going into the future. Thinking about the short term, I could see BABA and FB getting hit even more but INTC will probably recover soon.

{"title": "Russia could hit U.S. chip industry, White House warns", "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The White House is warning the chip industry to diversify its supply chain in case Russia retaliates against threatened U.S. export curbs by blocking access to key materials, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe potential for retaliation has garnered more attention in recent days after Techcet, a market research group, published a report on Feb. 1 highlighting the reliance of many semiconductor manufacturers on Russian and Ukrainian-sourced materials like neon, palladium and others.\n\nAccording to Techcet estimates, over 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon supplies come from Ukraine, while 35% of U.S. palladium is sourced from Russia.\n\nPeter Harrell, who sits of the White House's National Security Council, and his staff have been in touch with members of the chip industry in recent days, learning about their exposure to Russian and Ukrainian chipmaking materials and urging them to find alternative sources, the people said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the specifics of the conversations, but a senior official reiterated that the administration was prepared if Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"Part of that is working with companies to make sure that if Russia takes actions that interfere with supply chains, companies are prepared for disruptions,\" the person said.\n\n\"We understand that other sources of key products are available and stand ready to work with our companies to help them identify and diversify their supplies.\"\n\nJoe Pasetti, vice president of global public policy at the chip and electronics manufacturing suppliers group SEMI, sent an email to members this week gauging exposure to the vital chipmaking supplies, according to a copy obtained by Reuters.\n\n\"As discussed on today's call, please see the attached document ... regarding Russian/Ukrainian production of a number of semiconductor materials,\" he wrote, referencing a summary by Techcet on C4F6, Palladium, Helium, Neon and Scandium from the troubled region. \"Please let me know if potential supply disruptions to any of them are a concern for your company.\"\n\nNeon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, is a biproduct of Russian steel manufacturing, according to Techcet. It is then purified in Ukraine. Palladium is used in sensors and memory, among other applications.\n\nThe Biden administration has threatened to impose sweeping export controls against Russia if it invades Ukraine. Russia, which has massed over 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border, denies it plans to attack.\n\nSome chipmakers have been reviewing their supply chains to scan for potential fallout from conflict in Ukraine. One person at a chipmaking company who declined to be named acknowledged that it has been looking into its supply of neon and other gases, some of which originate in Ukraine.\n\n\"Even if there was a conflict in Ukraine it wouldn't cut off supply. It would drive prices up,\" the person said. \"The market would constrict. Those gases would become pretty scarce. But it wouldn\u2019t stop semiconductor manufacturing,\" he added.\n\nAccording to one power chip design startup executive, unrest in Ukraine has caused rare gas prices to increase and could cause supply issues. Fluorine is another gas that has a large supply from that part of the world and could be affected, the executive added.\n\nWilliam Moss, a spokesperson for Intel Corp , said the chipmaker was not anticipating any impact to neon supply.\n\nBut the issue is still concerning, because global chip supplies are tight and chip orders are only expected to pick up. Techcet estimates demand for all the materials will rise by more than 37% over the next 4 years, pointing to recent announcements by Intel, Samsung (005930.KS), and Taiwan's TSMC in Ohio, Arizona and Texas.\n\nNeon prices rose 600% in the runup to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, since chip firms relied on a few Ukrainian companies, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n_____\n\nThis could explain the recent volatility in the semiconductor industry.", "id": "szfw4q", "created_utc": 1645617933.0, "score": 469, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 292, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|16|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4562|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pdyttq/how_to_bag_hold_this_hurricane_like_an_ape_king/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rql870/its_a_good_time_to_be_in_the_funeral_business/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rql9we/no_one_cheats_death/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=szfw4q)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=szfw4q)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Isn't Idaho the place with the most potatoes in the world?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.01427195593714714}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12845095992088318}, {"body": "The \u201cchip crisis\u201d will never be resolved.
