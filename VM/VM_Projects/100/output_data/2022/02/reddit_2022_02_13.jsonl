{"title": "A long comment I think deserves to be a post, to see the reactions of people to my thoughts that Apple stock is a turd.", "selftext": "  I think Apple will be the hardest hit on this next crash. Apple isn't doing anything new. They don't actually create anything.  I don't see many haters of Apple but let it be known I am one!  The best part is people who are making the real money, will make money all the way to the top. Then they hit the switch and they make money all the way back down to where they want it.  Their growth only looks like 30% yoy because they didnt do anything for so many years.  Apples total assets are only $329 Billion. The market has this one really f'ed up at  $2.7 Trillion!!\n\n \\-\n\n>Apple isn't doing anything new. They don't actually create anything.\n\nCan you elaborate?\n\nSure,\n\n   They don't own factory's that make the components for the phones.  They don't own factories that assemble the phones.  They don't own mass areas of land or skyscrapers downtown. They rent the highest price space for their stores.\n\nI think it's absolutely insane how people think Apple has been successful.  The movies make things look a lot better than it ever was.  The 80s Apple made computers no one wanted.  End up 'giving' them away to schools so I could make a little green turtle draw a star.  Steve Jobs was a con artist. Pixar was the first thing Jobs was involved with that actually was successful.  Even tho it was going bankrupt till the day Disney released 'Toy Story'.  Jobs almost sold Pixar but at the last second, he realized 'Toy Story' was going to be a hit, so he put Pixar up for IPO so he could cash out on unsuspecting investors.  I think its funny that the product that really set Apple apart was the simplest idea. In 2001 portable MP3 players. They didn't create the technology.  They didn't produce the music. It was pretty genius to start iTunes when they did.  So, their best idea was to create a Napster but actually pay the artists.  It was only obvious; they were trying every way to redo the iPad to transform it into a phone.\n\nOnce again very little new technology.  Reverse engineering, stealing engineers from the competition nothing new. 6 years nothing new.  Finally in 2007 they come out with the iPhone. They made it seem revolutionary..... but it wasn't.  But it was a 'sexy' phone that everyone wanted.  They created artificial demand.  So now for 15 years, they have done nothing in my opinion.  Apple does not help people. Apple is a cruel cruel company.  They pay all the execs the same ridicules salaries.  I would say Apple is one of the biggest ongoing scams of all time.  How on Earth are investors ever going to make a profit? Apple makes phones for dollars and sells from for a $1000.  All money goes back into the company.  Is Apples .22 cent dividend how you're going to get rich?  Warren Buffet bought his Apple shares in 2016. Around $24 a share and has since done a 4 to 1 split.  So compared to today's price Buffet paid $6 a share for his holdings.  So, yea it makes sense for him to hold forever. Anyone who gets in at these ridiculous prices will get burned.  Alot of opinion but a lot of truth in here too.\n\nOne contradictory fact is I have extreme faith in the S&P 500.  It is designed to be able to withstand the ridiculous swings and balance the price by adjusting the holdings.  S&P 500's top holding is APPLE. That would make you think it would be going up but once again this isn't a new holding.  Apple has been a major holding for S&P since 2011.  They got the shares for nothing compared to today's price. When you see the S&P 500 reconfigure the fund to lower exposure to APPLE that will be a sure sign to sell as fast as you can.  Buffet could have the same effect if he let it be known he is selling.  I'd say just sell before everyone else does.\n\nBottom line, Apple has assets of $329 billion and divided by 16.323 billion shares 20.15.   So, of the share price of $168 about $20 of that is covered by something real and physical.  This isn't important but it's something to see.  Market Cap of $2,700,000,000.  Haha!

How this wasn\u2019t caught earlier on is beyond me. Zillow still doesn\u2019t seem to know what kind of a ride it\u2019s in for. Q4 results with forward guidance were very optimistic and seemed to downplay the very serious issue of its current inventory. 2021 created a very volatile period for housing with aggressive buyers willing to place bids significantly over asking price. Zillow played into this game purchasing homes at overvalued prices outbidding others. A direct quote from the Q4 shareholder letter:\n\n*\u201cWe\u2019ve made significant progress in our efforts to wind down our iBuying business \u2014 selling homes faster than we anticipated at better unit economics than we projected. The wind-down process is running smoothly and efficiently, and we expect it to generate positive cash flow. We feel even more confident today that exiting iBuying and eliminating the housing market balance sheet risk to our company and our shareholders was the right decision. We remain focused on continuing to grow our core businesses as we deliver innovative new ways to help our customers move.\u201d*\n\nA very quick change of attitude from just 3 months ago in the Q3 shareholder letter: \n\n*\u201cBecause of this price forecasting volatility, we have had to reconsider what the business might look like at a larger size. We have offered sellers a fair market price from the start of Zillow Offers, while also being clear that the business would only become consistently profitable at scale. We have determined this large scale would require too much equity capital, create too much volatility in our earnings and balance sheet, and ultimately result in far lower return on equity than we imagined. This home price forecasting volatility has also contributed to significant capacity and demand planning challenges, exacerbated by a difficult labor and supply chain environment, leading to our announcement 1 two weeks ago to suspend signing new contracts through the end of this year. We judge future significant volume volatility to be an impediment to ramp a scaled operation, and any interruptions in the supply chain like we\u2019ve recently experienced could result in increased holding times, further increasing our exposure to volatility\u201d*\n\nZillow recognized its mistakes in Q3, and downplayed them or even avoided addressing the real issues at hand in Q4 in an attempt to please investors, and it worked. \n\n \n\n[Median days on market increasing by the month.](https://preview.redd.it/pxyf88ynklh81.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4b3b09b875fcbad05203a5b706411f17ed08f4c)\n\n[Number of home sales dropping](https://preview.redd.it/rhjphizpklh81.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=565ae0dd0270b0d5c20915480f1ef800dd929178)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Active listings quickly dropping](https://preview.redd.it/hyux7rasklh81.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=31d1f0417d1120c17b666f6a54d3bbeba73bf24f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Median sales prices declining\u2026slowly for now](https://preview.redd.it/m4n0zsutklh81.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ac6921a043ea9d2ed337a508b9b679e9143dbd5)\n\nSo how is Zillow planning on getting rid of over 10,000 homes in a hurry AND provide positive cash flow when there are fewer buyers, fewer sellers, and homes are stuck on the market for longer. The 8,000 homes sold in Q4 brought negative returns of about 7%. The overpriced homes purchased in Q3 at the pinnacle of the housing market paired with incoming rising rates and significant drop in home prices is bound to have drastic effects on future earnings and balance sheets as time goes on. Current home prices are in a downtrend but appear to be flatlined due to a lack of homes of being sold on the market. There is no demand or supply keeping the price steady where it is. An influx of homes on the market will send home prices into a downward spiral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Anecdotal Evidence: Let\u2019s go house shopping.\n\n# \n\nSo, the market is in an itsy-bitsy gully right now.
