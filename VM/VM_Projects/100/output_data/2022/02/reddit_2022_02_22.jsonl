{"title": "I told you so\u2026 The Great Wheeze is here.", "selftext": "Back in September of last year [I made a call that what\u2019s playing out now, would](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwvrsi/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/):\n\nThe TLDR being: inflation was going to run hotter than expected, bond yields would move up, stocks would have to come down, growth stocks would get destroyed and the fed wouldn\u2019t be able to come to the rescue because inflation tied their hands. I suggested value, shorting bond yields and buying internationally. I predicted this would start soon and accelerate early-mid 2022.\n\nI named this upcoming event \\*\\*\u201cThe Great Wheeze\u201d\\*\\* - a slow slump based on liquidity exiting. \n\nThe response back then was this was crazy talk. Inflation was seen as mostly transitory, it\u2019d peak at 5ish%. Markets were pricing in a couple of hikes (now it's 7 this year). Stocks went on a big Santa rally, value was cheap, NASDAQ was firing on all cylinders.\n\nInvestors, hedge funds, central banks and more didn\u2019t know what was up. But a kid from the bush did. Told you so \ud83d\ude0e\n\n\\-----------\n\nFirst let\u2019s have a look at some of the friendly things people had to say 5 months ago:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I wonder during how many bubbles throughout history has this theory has been suggested and has it ever once played out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ivy league economists: \"yeah we really don't know. Its impossible to predict a timeline for such things with any degree of accuracy. Here is a 500 page peer reviewed book to prove our points.\" Dude on reddit: \" I've figured it out! T minus 12 months. Guaranteed. Here is 2 paragraphs of garbage to prove my point.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You have no idea what you're talking about and are probably watching too many YouTube videos. I don't know what I'm talking about either, so let's both shut up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What an absolute joke of a post. You don\u2019t even understand basic yield formulas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Try WSB for starting your own meme, take your amateur analysis there as well. To everyone else, steer clear of anyone who claims \"certainties\" like this, **ALWAYS**. This guy is leaving out many variables which cannot possibly be predicted and is grossly over-simplifying something as complex as a year+ forecast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>High inflation will not happen. The Fed doesn\u2019t control it and its appearance is absolutely not a certainty ; that is what the market is seeing and you\u2019re not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The inflation we are seeing now is purely aggregate demand based, mostly due to high demand and supply chain issues and shortages and the tell tale sign of this is unequal increases\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You lost me at certain parts but I admire the confidence\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nSo anyway here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen next. This is barring any major black swan. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zad1lu8xqbj81.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50112570ee03af62ab16a2a672006a5745eca58\n\n\\-----------------\n\nKey Themes for 22 and beyond.\n\nWe\u2019re entering into a couple years of stagnant growth, shrinking liquidity, increasing real interest rates and declining multiples. **You can\u2019t price in excess or draining liquidity**, liquidity is the tide that all ships rest on. \n\n**The economy is not strong** like Powell, Biden and much of the media crowd say. Blowout deficits and QE have temporarily plastered over underlying weakness. \n\n**Inflation will peak shortly**, but will stabilise higher than pre-COVID (4-5%) for an extended period of time (years). Interest rates will still be negative in real terms and so much cash is floating out there. Central banks will have to be more hawkish going forward, so if the market crashes they'll do less.\n\nAt the end of the day the Fed and other central banks are in a bind. They won\u2019t be able to increase interest rates above 3-4% to actually fight it. Even if they could, it\u2019d cause a recession. \n\n**So the only solution is for developed markets is to devalue their currency.** This means extended inflation in developed markets, strengthening emerging market currencies. The era of exporting our inflation to the USD hungry 3rd world is over. [You can already see EM currencies starting to edge up](https://au.investing.com/indices/msci-intl-em-currency).\n\n\\----------------\n\nHow to play it?\n\nFirst, **Russia won\u2019t invade Ukraine**, Putin will consolidate his holdings in the rebel regions but won\u2019t go as far as to get hit with real sanctions. A lot of fuss and then things die down. Russian stocks are getting crushed, this is probably close to the absolute bottom so load up on $RSX. Hold for 6 months and make 30%, $RUSL will do better.\n\nWith declining multiples and weak customers almost all assets are going to suffer. I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult for the next couple years to do well in anything. \n\nIf a 30 PE company growing at 10%/year falls to a 20 PE; it will take 5 years to grow back to even. Rapid growth can negate multiple compression if your entry point is attractive enough.\n\nGrowth is going to get oversold, but be careful of what type of growth you buy as most will still struggle. Growth is the answer not value.\n\nEmerging markets are the place to find small, fast growing companies at low valuations. As the inequalities between rich and poor nations are arbitraged away it is a certainty that EM will outperform developed significantly in the long run. Developed markets have mistaken multiple expansion for strength.\n\nEmerging market, smallcap growth in sectors insulated from weaker developed consumption is the sweet spot. Buy in the next 6 months. Look outside China. India, Vietnam, Egypt are all good. India probably the safest but most expensive.\n\nSo anyway, best of luck. If I\u2019m wrong I\u2019ll come back and cop it.", "id": "syg5oe", "created_utc": 1645509960.0, "score": 258, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|12|**Previous DD**|[x](https://i.redd.it/73ra3pa7bte81.png) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syfrhu/i_told_you_so_the_great_wheeze_is_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syfwrh/i_told_you_so_the_great_wheeze_is_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syg5oe/i_told_you_so_the_great_wheeze_is_here/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=syg5oe)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=syg5oe)\n    \nHey /u/ini0n, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Post your positions.

{"title": "Backtesting the most popular investment strategies over the last two decades!", "selftext": "I have a confession to make. Even after all the [analyses and strategies I have created](https://www.reddit.com/user/nobjos/?sort=top), I allocate most of my investments to the S&P500 while keeping some part of it for the moonshots. I have told the exact same thing to everyone who has asked me personally for investment advice.\n\nBut as explained in this [fantastic article](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-problem-with-most-financial-advice/) by Nick, the problem with most financial advice is that it\u2019s biased heavily towards your experience. I started investing in 2017 and have experienced nothing but a bull market (albeit the brief Covid-19 dip). But consider the situation of someone who started investing in 2000 or in the peak of the 2007 bubble. In both cases, it would have taken more than 6-7 years just to break even on their investments. I can\u2019t even imagine waiting more than half a decade just for my investment to grow to its initial value, given the current market conditions.\n\nGiven that there is no one size fits all approach in the stock market, in this week\u2019s analysis, I am doing a deep-dive into the various types of investment strategies, the returns generated, and their limitations.\n\nI should warn you now that this is not about finding the strategy that gives you the most returns. This is more so about finding what type of investment strategy fits you the best. While putting all your portfolio into crypt\\* might end up giving you a 10,000% return (which is fully viable for a 20-something-year-old with a small portfolio), having an 80% drawdown is not something a 50-year-old with a retirement account would be looking forward to.\n\nThe point I am trying to make here is that investing isn\u2019t an absolute game, it\u2019s a relative game. What fits you perfectly might be terrible for others. Your risk tolerance might be way higher. So I am offering you a choice:\n\n[All I\u2019m offering is the truth. Nothing more.](https://preview.redd.it/djttp8bdzdj81.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=72279b8af4bf16dcdacff63120f80f5d514aa008)\n\n>*You take the blue pill, the story ends, you can close the page now and believe that DCAing into S&P 500 is your best bet. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9vxcbcg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ff1c8397b104cdf30d5042a4ec90adbe5038f39\n\nLet\u2019s start with the various types of investing strategies that are out there. Granted, this is not a conclusive list of the various types of investments, but I have tried to cover the popular strategies that are out there.\n\nBefore we jump into the results, now would be the right time to explain some concepts relating to how to analyze your investments objectively.\n\na. **Cumulative Return:** It\u2019s the total return you would have made on your invested amount. Let\u2019s say you invested $100 and over the next two years the investment went up to $200. Then the cumulative return is 100%.\n\nb. **Rate of Return (aka annualized return):** It\u2019s the measure of how much your investment has grown or shrunk in an annualized format. This allows us to compare investments that are active across different time periods.\n\nb. [**Sharpe Ratio**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/sharpe_ratio.asp)**:** Sharpe ratio measures your investment return while making an adjustment for risk. For example, two investors A & B generate a return of 15% and 12% respectively. However, if A took much larger risks when compared to B, it may be that B has a better **risk-adjusted return**. All else equal, the higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better is your investment.\n\nc. **Max Drawdown:** This is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a subsequent bottom of the portfolio. It is an indicator of the downside risk over a specified time period. A 30% max drawdown implies that your portfolio was down 30% from its all-time high at some point during your investment period.\n\n**A quick note on how the investments are made:** I am considering an equal amount invested monthly into every strategy (Since this is the most realistic way of investing for a large majority of investors and lump-sum investing returns are heavily influenced by the starting point) \\[1\\].\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/87uprhj5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c2a247bb54400f0234217d968190395d666a92\n\n**SPY and Chill**\n\nI feel that this is one of the most common types of investment out there with a person investing an equal amount into SPY every month and holding on for a long time. The basic principle behind this strategy is that the stock market as a whole will keep rising over the long period as the national economy grows. Wealth creation would be possible by just tagging along with the index rather than trying to pick and choose winners within the stock market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkv55rsgzdj81.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d896896d6e1ec867c40f2510eee145c537de63e\n\nAs expected, just investing in SPY gave an excellent annual return of 12.3% over the last two decades. On the flip side, since your portfolio is consisting of 100% equity, you would have experienced a max drawdown of \\~40% at one point (Around the 2008 crash). The fluctuations in the portfolio value are also captured by the low Sharpe Ratio of 0.62 which showcases that you are not adequately compensated for the risk that you are taking by holding 100% equity.\n\nIn most statistical tests, it is usually required to set a base rate - To see what is the \u201caverage\u201d rate of success. The SPY\u2019s rate of returns and risk is usually set as the benchmark because it accounts for the bulk of \u201csafe returns\u201d. Any returns outside this are usually accounted to an edge, the \u201calpha\u201d, and finding that edge is what beating the market is all about. \\[2\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5j37cg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a596a3ea3c417089e2585df91847c50d02cb6475\n\n**Balanced Portfolio**\n\n[50&#37; Stocks. 50&#37; Bonds. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.](https://preview.redd.it/pmq1ss4izdj81.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff54e80e963ba1e2a63741d08a6a8acbfbf9ccfa)\n\nThis is the type of investment strategy where you are taking a balanced approach to investment. Having a 50:50 split on stocks and bonds would definitely impact your overall returns, but you can sleep better knowing that even in the case of downturns, your portfolio is well protected.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0n2fxe1jzdj81.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f2857fa8e49866b95a1ffb166f2896fa05c76c7\n\nWhile the balanced portfolio did end up giving lower returns, it\u2019s much better in terms of the max drawdown. Your portfolio would only have had a max drop of 14% when compared to the 40% drop experienced by SPY. Adding to this, the portfolio has an excellent Sharpe Ratio of 1.35 when compared to just 0.69 of SPY during the same period.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i9uzbavjzdj81.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c5fb0c713992ab8f1c69c4d81419b697b4270e8\n\nWhat\u2019s even more interesting is that the portfolio ends up performing better than SPY during crashes\\[3\\]. As you can see from the backtest, during the financial and Covid\u201919 stock market crashes, your portfolio would have done much better than the market. The 2.5% CAGR \\[4\\] you are sacrificing by not going 100% in SPY is rewarded in terms of a better portfolio during the tough times.\n\n>*Harry Markowitz, the father of Modern Portfolio Theory, himself preferred the balanced strategy though his models indicated a more nuanced split. His reasoning was that it allowed him to sleep better at night.*\n\n[Link to the balanced portfolio backtest](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/Vhhi0M0jPwArFBskS258/details) \\[5\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvnj7xg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4f59cf4b939ae34c0a85e8fce4c710c13bec87\n\n**Diversified Portfolio**\n\nIn this type of investment, we are looking to get a piece of all types of companies. I have considered **an equal split (33.33%)** between Large-cap, Mid-cap, and Small-cap funds.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mubz0elzdj81.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e85cda2a6d4ad2adde1a4ee1a9b221b6498570\n\nThe proposed type of diversification lessens the portfolio risk (as can be seen from max drawdown) but at the same time ends up giving a slightly lower return than purely holding the S&P 500. If you consider the Sharpe Ratio, SPY performs slightly better as you would have had similar fluctuations holding a diversified portfolio while generating slightly lower returns.\n\nI expected that the addition of Small and Mid-Cap should have generated better returns than SPY, but my hypothesis here is that the heavy concentration of tech stocks in SPY (\\~25% now) pushed the rate of return higher than that of the diversified portfolio containing small and mid-cap stocks given the recent performance of tech stocks. This brings us to the:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tech Enthusiast**\n\nAnother one of the common strategies that has paid out handsomely over the past few decades. In this, we are allocating 100% of our monthly investments towards Nasdaq-100 (QQQ). \\[6\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcddi21nzdj81.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=f601e9070104eb263d15dbaa59e53105f9dffcf5\n\nWell, would you look at that! Over the last 2 decades, **QQQ has returned more than double the investment return of the S&P 500**. This can be attributed predominantly to two reasons.\n\n1. Tech stocks had an amazing run due to the advances in tech as well as the availability of cheap capital after the 2007 crisis.\n2. Our starting point (2002) is heavily biased towards QQQ. It\u2019s the lull after the 2000 dot com bubble. If we had started the same analysis in say 1990, we would have had a very different result (QQQ dropped 78% from its peak compared to only a 46% drop in SPY during the same period).\n\nHaving 100% of your investment in one sector that performed phenomenally is bound to give stunning portfolio returns. Hindsight 20/20!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogngegh5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=369f61976e26408e095ff061031bae173dd4a4ff\n\n**Growth Seeker**\n\nHere we are only focused on growth. Our investments are towards companies that are fast-growing. Since we are taking a higher risk on these growth stocks, we expect a higher portfolio return over the long run which is exactly what happened over the last 2 decades.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/scesx2yozdj81.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=7acd9d8aa45191844fc7d5cf7a84dedd9c603cae\n\nBut once again this can be closely associated with investing in QQQ. I had considered Vanguard Growth ETF as my growth fund and as of today, their top 5 holdings are Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Tesla. **We are in a very rare time period where the largest companies in the world are considered to be the ones that are growing above the market rate!** Adding to this, going 100% on a growth fund gave us better risk-adjusted returns than just investing in the S&P 500.\n\n**Buying the Dip**\n\nThe idea here is simple. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keep accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash. While this is a risky strategy, the returns do justify that investing during a crash tends to give you the best return.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rr21twpzdj81.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a75fd510135fe3ed1882c452e3a532814723953\n\nI had already done an extensive analysis on Buying the dip that highlights the limitations as well as the nuances around buying the dip that is a must-read in case you are trying to replicate this strategy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21cqpyh5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd2120aa029a185c1054bcb904ffb0b9b18cf69\n\nPhew! That was a lot to digest for sure. As I said in the beginning, this was not about finding an investment strategy that generates the most amount of returns. This was more about finding a strategy that fits you.\n\nMaybe you are still in the SPY and Chill bucket and want the simplicity associated with your portfolio. Or maybe you were swayed by the excellent drawdown protection of the balanced portfolio or the eye-popping returns generated by tech enthusiasts. Finally, you might want to dip your toes in the crypt\\* market after seeing the 10,000%+ returns if you have an above-average tolerance for risk.\n\nWe have barely scratched the surface here and there are many more strategies out there that we haven\u2019t covered that might be perfect for you. The idea here is that there are much better strategies (both in terms of risk-adjusted returns and max volatility) than just investing in the S&P 500. It\u2019s up to you to find one that fits you the best!\n\nIn the immortal words of Morpheus,\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8pwiqj600ej81.gif\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhcg9bj5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c395d2c3d3c5ae3e0577f40ebad10214eee2841\n\nData used in the analysis: [**Here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/untitled-spreadsheet-3-6FxZVmEYa4DNdVYzn4LTZx/live)\n\nLumpsum investment backtests : ([SPY](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/OV3ohHkJ4tKA6HqqSfle/details), [Balanced](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/Vhhi0M0jPwArFBskS258/details), [Diversified](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/aXiDzYzGFlraxOVfSXtL/details), [Tech](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/BOH7t4anTqXMBc2iA78F/details))\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n**\\[1\\]** For example, in case you are considering lump-sum investing, placing the starting point in the dot-com bubble (2000) would give vastly different results than if you consider your starting point as 2002. Case in point, [CISCO stock](https://www.google.com/search?q=cisco+stock&rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN981IN981&oq=cisco+stock&aqs=chrome..69i57.2312j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) still hasn\u2019t breached its dot-com bubble value.\n\n\\[2\\] Though there are a few other factors now that are recognized as adding minor increases to the market returns - Such as value, growth, small-cap, etc.\n\n\\[3\\] Please note that this backtest is made using a lump-sum investment and not a monthly investment. It\u2019s more for the purpose of an insight into how holding bonds can be beneficial in case of a crash.\n\n\\[4\\] While 2.5% CAGR does seem negligible, if you look at the cumulative returns, the 100% SPY portfolio gives 293% vs the balanced portfolio only returning 192%. That\u2019s a difference of \\~100% on your returns! Yeah, compounding is a b\\*\\*\\*h when it works against you.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that this link is for lumpsum and not DCA.\n\n\\[6\\] I know that QQQ is not completely tech but when compared to the 23% allocation towards tech in S&P500, QQQ has more than 70%+ allocated to tech.\n\n\\[7\\] The returns here are calculated using an investment period between 2014 and 2021.", "id": "synpkf", "created_utc": 1645536751.0, "score": 1248, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|81|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|286|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/px5nt4/should_you_invest_in_the_most_reputable_brands_in/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pttfma/should_you_follow_insider_transactions_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1t0yz/i_analyzed_all_the_motley_fool_premium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p9c0zc/onlyfans_the_prn_empire_with_no_prn/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/synpkf/backtesting_the_most_popular_investment/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6wr4/does_index_inclusion_positively_affect_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlscp1/can_wallstreetbets_beat_the_market_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq1mv3/an_unbiased_take_on_the_robinhood_ipo_the_good/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rvuzw8/should_you_listen_to_jim_cramer_i_analyzed_20000/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q9yeo2/why_is_simple_dollar_cost_averaging_still_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otb1wm/a_primer_into_payment_for_order_flow_pfof/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0esdp/do_hedge_funds_beat_the_market_i_analyzed_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4tjye/do_actively_managed_mutual_funds_beat_the_index/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kl4ixe) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1c3r3/should_you_invest_in_sustainable_companies_i/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=synpkf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=synpkf)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09720522165298462}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41294342279434204}, {"body": "My portfolio is 100% TQQQ.
