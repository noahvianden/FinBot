A high growth company shouldn't be paying out dividends because they need all the cash they can to reinvest in themselves and avoid debt.

They performed a 25% increase in profit and now has more capital owned. But a major external event occurs, like a world war. Owners of the Coca Cola stock rush to sell their stocks.

All this gives a company real $$$ value. The lemons, the cups, the juicers, the real estate, the cash customers pay for a refreshing cup of lemonade... there is a dollar value attached to every aspect of my lemonade company. People from Wall Street gurus to individuals with a Robinhood account can do this analysis for themselves, and come to a dollar figure they believe my lemonade company is worth, based on value of the known variables alone.\n\nStock is a way to divide ownership of a company. \n\nIf I'm a sole owner, I have 100% of the stock. I can take a paycheck from my business (dividend) or I can take all my profits and buy more lemons, open more stands (growth). If I want to sell the entire business after I expanded from 1 stand to 500, I can do that, and garner what a buyer is willing to pay.\n\nHowever, if I want to keep control but need more capital to expand, if I want to take some cash out to invest in other businesses or pay for your mother's tit job, I may decide to sell only *some* of my ownership. I do this by selling stock. And just like it would be if I sold the entire business, it will be sold at a price buyer and seller agree upon (which, at a starting point, will be the value of my company now, plus a premium based on projections for the future).\n\nThose interested in owning part of my company should have a pretty decent idea how much that stock is worth because they've done the math. Why would they buy if they're not going to get a paycheck from the earnings? Because they want to do what I did. I took one lemonade stand, turned it into 500, and sold a part of my ownership for a huge profit. They want to buy into a company with 500 stands, watch the company grow to 1000, 10,000 stands, and sell at some point in the future for a profit. Large investors may even get some measure of control over the company's destiny by controlling board seats or commanding voting power at shareholder meetings.\n\nCan prices get out of whack with the intrinsic value? Of course! There's a lot of wiggle room when it comes to forecasting the future part of a valuation. Remember, any buyer isn't only interested in how valuable the company is now, they're also interested in how valuable it could be in the future. A world war, to use your drastic example, would certainly create headwinds for the lemonade industry (lemon shortages, perhaps?) and cause people to see less potential in my company--hence a drop, even if my earnings was spectacular last quarter (stock prices are forward looking). On the flip side, forecasts could be sunny: no war, lemons are hot on tiktok. Whatever the book value of my business now, investors are calculating their return based on what they expect the value to be in the future. \n\nThat value can of course get completely absurd based on speculation and there are countless examples of that, but that's exactly when a smart investor either sells or refuses to buy. Will a lemonade stand business really ever make enough money to justify a $100 Billion valuation? No? Then sell that or don't buy it.\n\nBut to call Berkshire a scam really is embarrassing for a number of reasons. It shows everyone here that you have no idea even how to do the basic math of valuing a business, which is pretty fundamental to anyone who truly wants to understand the stock market. If you did the math, you'd likely realize that Berkshire's stock valuation is actually quite low compared to what you'd expect it to be, given conventional means of company valuation. By some measures, the sum of Berkshire's parts is actually worth more than its stock price *right now*, which could make it a good buy... if you think they'll continue to get bigger and more valuable in the future. A \"cheap\" valuation for a solid company is usually--but not always--a good investment. (My guess is that some hesitation about Berkshire's post-Buffett future is baked into the low valuation at the moment.)\n\nHopefully some of this is sinking in. Stocks have value because companies have value. The value of a company goes up, the price will go up. The value goes down it will go down. Outside factors can throw the stock prices off-- that's usually a time to buy or sell or hold on for dear life until things settle. None of this means stocks that don't pay dividends are scams-- dividend stocks can display the same irrational behavior.

Practically though the future isn't perfectly knowable but people try to make predictions on the cash flows. Some predictions are more probable and plausible than others. For example, it is reasonable to expect that a company like Coca-Cola will continue to make similar amounts of cash as they did in the past given their relatively long history of business performance in doing so (from selling more volume of soft drink and raising prices). It is less reasonable to expect that a company with barely any assets, lots of debt and no history of positive earnings to be able to produce cash in the future (it may in the future but the probabilities based purely on the information given don't look too good).\n\nIf however things do go perfectly with the valuation, the business would earn the exact cash flows made in the valuation and the value of the business would increase at the discount rate (as would the share price). However as the future is unknowable people can have different estimates of the cash flows and there can be disagreements on what the discount rate should be. As such valuations can span a very large range. \n\nHowever, as investors are probably mostly humans they may and generally do suffer from biases and irrationality and these will factor in their valuations. As such many valuations can be extremely optimistic or extremely pessimistic. There is a range of valuations however which are reasonable based on available information. In the short run the competing valuations can send the share price to fluctuate, sometimes wildly. Not to mention the distortions added by other market players such as technical analysts, market manipulators, large institutions buying and selling, speculators, people wanting to sell stock to use the money elsewhere, etc. Over the long term though, the stock price does trend towards the range of reasonable valuations. Sometimes this can take years.\n\nShares are fractional ownership interests in a business and as such a shareholder is entitled to the earnings, cash and assets of the business. If shareholders wanted to access these they could band together and force management to pay a dividend, or sell the assets. Generally though they don't exercise their ownership rights since 1. the shareholders would need a combined majority stake in the business 2. organising and convincing enough shareholders to join in can be a lot of effort 3. shareholders may believe that management will be able to re-invest successfully to produce more cash in the future and hence increase they company's value 4. shareholder's simply can't be bothered to exercise their rights among other reasons.\n\nWhen Berkshire reinvests their profits in places where more even more cash can be produced the company directly becomes more valuable. The share price may not immediately reflect this because the majority of investors being human (mostly) can take a while to process this fact as well as there being distortions caused by non-fundamental analysts.\n\nThe goal of Berkshire is to increase the value of the business on a per share basis. They do this by investing in profitable ventures such as companies which generally have stable earnings, are able to earn high returns on invested capital and are selling at a discount to what they believe is a reasonable valuation (this is to safeguard against possible errors in calculation and adverse events that may occur which can reduce the value of their investment). As Buffett has demonstrably shown over decades that he is capable and successful of achieving this goal, by being not giving out dividends, he will have a massive cash pile ready to be deployed should outstanding investment opportunities arise, increasing the value of the business and hence over time, increasing the share price.\n\nAn investment operation is one which promises safety of principal and an adequate return.

Very heavy on MSFT, I'd echo the guy suggesting taking some out and adding to AAPL. Both are good stuff.

Personally I don't know anyone with a Mastercard and PE and dividends aren't very attractive compared to Visa. Paypal is arguably a third, but it's just different enough I think it'll work with a card company. I'd suggest diversifying into a bank instead of two credit card companies.

Ideally you never have a red day unless the market is having a fit, you just keep growing and growing every day. It helps with sleeping at night and gives you a great opportunity to shore up when the market dips.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that many will tell you to not overdiversify, but I take the opinion laid out in *Random Walk Down Wall Street* that 60 is the maximum that diversification will take you. You can take this two ways since ETFs were not around when that research was conducted, either you can add up the holdings of the ETF toward your diversification total, or you can treat it as a single stock.

{"title": "Federal Reserve Emergency Meeting 11:30AM ET today; Russia Ukraine Geopolitical Crisis; Yield Curve dramatically flattens", "selftext": "**\\*\\*\\*\\* Latest Update on Emergency Meeting \\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-short-term-rate-futures-pare-back-odds-fed-inter-meeting-move-2022-02-14/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-short-term-rate-futures-pare-back-odds-fed-inter-meeting-move-2022-02-14/)\n\nMarkets gave a 30% chance of a rate hike on Thursday / Friday before the March meeting. Now it has shrivelled down to a **2% chance,** after comments from multiple Fed officials late afternoon Monday.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\* Update on 11:30AM ET Meeting \\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**>>> Good news - no press release was released.** [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm). **This means the meeting was considered a \"normal\" board meeting and not a real \"emergency\" meeting.**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* **IMPORTANT EDIT ABOUT EMERGENCY MEETING \\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nAs per further investigation and clarification from commentors, today's meeting is a **planned board meeting**. [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm). A **Press Release will most probably not be made**, as Jan 18, Jan 14. Dec 6, Nov 16, Nov 15 all did not have press releases. (Checked via Wayback Machine). So, this is **90% NOT AN EMERGENCY MEETING**, as what I previously wrote. **If they decided to release a statement, then it will become an emergency meeting. Let's hope not :(**\n\n**By convention, in every meeting, they discuss if they should release details to the public - let's hope this time they DO NOT release anything to the public, and leave it as a normal meeting.**\n\nObviously during the meeting the board will discuss the issues I set at below:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello everyone! Sorry I didn't update you all on my predictions for what the Fed will do in Janurary and my inflation forecast - was a tad bit busy - apologies!\n\n1. Every year February, new seasonal factors for inflation are calculated, causing rebalancing to affect inflation numbers. Used cars (40.5% v 37.3%) and energy prices had larger seasonal factors (though it decreased from 29.3% to 27%), whilst food prices this time again increased (7% v 6.3%).\n2. The Fed will have an ~~emergency meeting~~ (officially an **expedited meeting**) TODAY 11:30AM. They planned this late Thursday afternoon. According to [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm), they're discussing: \"Review and determination by the Board of Governors of the advance and discount rates to be charged by the Federal Reserve Banks.\" Ie they'll be discussing what to do with interest rates. **NOTE**: **Some of you have said this is a planned meeting** **~~- this is incorrect. The next meeting is March 15/16.~~** **HOWEVER, it is TRUE that a board meeting is held every Monday -** [**https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm)**.** **~~However, NO PRESS RELEASES are made after each meeting - except today's one.~~** **\\*\\*\\* It's possible a press release might be made, but unlikely\\*\\*\\*. See** [**https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)**.** The official terminology is a \"**closed board expedited meeting**\", which is not the same as say the COVID emergency meetings, ~~but is still considered an \"emergency\" meeting, since it is outside of the normal schedule.~~\n3. The Russia and Ukraine crisis seems to be more elevated, causing the US to speculate based on intelligence any attack is imminent in the following days. US and Russia talked on Saturday to no avail; France met with Russia Friday; Ukraine has requested an emergency meeting with Russia in the next 48 hrs, and other countries are quickly trying to resolve the situation through diplomatic means.\n4. The yield curve has flattened dramatically. The 10 year yield and 5 year yield are nearly the same number, and both are extremely close to the 30 year yield. The 2 year yield somewhat recovered a little on Friday, but 1.5% is awfully close to 1.955%. The 3 month yield also shot up to 0.338%. Fast flattening generally indicates extreme fear a recession is coming due to excessive Fed action.\n\n~~I'll write up a larger post in the near term on my analysis!~~\n\nIn general, I haven't done too much deep analysis, but presumably:\n\n1. **\\*\\*\\*\\* Important edit: The Fed will discuss these issues, but will most likely NOT release a press release. \\*\\*\\*\\*** The Fed's meeting will be **inconclusive**. The Fed's dual mandate is price stability and full employment, coupled with other secondary goals of GDP growth etc. Powell will most likely cite Russia and Ukraine's geopolitical crisis as a \"wait and see\" issue - ie like last time Omicron was a \"wait and see\" issue. **Oil, gas, defence related commodities, food etc might go up in the short term, due to stockpiling etc, pouring further fuel to the inflation flame**. However, the Fed will probably wait and see if diplomatic solutions can be made, and leave a final decision to the March meeting. They also know the yield curve has dramatically flattened, and any fast rate increase may tip the already fragile and fearful economy into panic mode. **According to even bearish critics, a rate hike in this meeting is extremely unlikely**. A possible scenario is QE stopping earlier by 1 month, which seems possible.\n2. Russia and Ukraine is complicated. Russia is in a tight spot after Putin's comments on **nuclear war being more likely** if Ukraine joins NATO: [https://youtu.be/RJXwLzII278](https://youtu.be/RJXwLzII278) (Bulletin of the Atomic Scentists ie Doomsday Clock). Both US and France's meeting seem to not have worked. Presumably I'm guessing, after these comments, Russia's WW2 generals had a hard long talk about what will happen to Russia, and what next steps they can do to stop a nuclear confrontation. I suspect some top level officials are already preparing to shield Putin away from using the nuclear launch codes in the future, similar to General Milley's actions toward Trump. However these are speculations. **Recently, satellite imagery from WSJ** and other journalists [https://youtu.be/7Hu5FErz1js](https://youtu.be/7Hu5FErz1js) show around 130,000 troops stationed. This shows some concrete evidence after Russia asked in the UN Security Council meeting if there was any evidence on the 100,000 number. The US will probably release further evidence this week. The US speculated based on intelligence Russia will invade anytime. I suspect Russia knows about **WW2's Operation Bodyguard and the Normandy Landings**, in which the allies purposely gave disinformation to the Germans. The US/EU knows Russia knows the EU and US knows this, which further complicates matters. I suspect intelligence was via spys, and Russia is frantically trying to find these spies. In general, Ukraine seems to want to quickly forge a diplomatic solution with Russia, since the US is hesitating on direct physical involvement. Presumaly, Ukraine and Russia will amend the Minsk Agreement in collaboration with the EU, and possibly install an increasing buffer zone (ie Russia moves troops 10 metres, Ukraine minuses troops etc etc). **I suspect this will drag on for some time.**\n\n**~~\\*\\*\\* On Emergency meetings:~~**\n\n~~It is TRUE that a board meeting is held every Monday -~~ [~~https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm~~](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm)~~. However, NO PRESS RELEASES are made after each meeting - except today's one.~~\n\n~~This means today is in fact an extraordinary meeting. Generally:~~ *~~Effective  December 14, 2021, the meeting was~~* ***~~closed to public observation~~*** *~~by  Order of the Board of Governors1 because the matters fall under  exemption(s) 9(A)(i) of the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C.

Currently they only have a strategic lock on the Northern route which is inefficient for them. Russia's economy is mostly a service economy, but about 30% of their population are employed in industrial production, and a massive portion of that is natural resource sales on the market and a sizeable chunk of that is energy production.\n\nIf Russia were to pressure the rest of OPEC+ to curtail production like OPEC did in the 1970s, it would hobble their economy... so while you can expect some wobble in the world market from Russia if things get hairy, the factors are much different than they were in the 1970s where the issue was control of a central resource by an intractable anti-Western force that could flex on economic requirements because they weren't superpowers.

You can expect production to start to gap up then when it becomes clear that keeping prices high is hurting volume sales and that will promote increased production in order to maximize return.\n\nIn other words, by the time the summer comes around the primary factor impacting CPI reporting will likely see a price drop, and the relative year over year costs will start to become relative to 5% inflation in June of 2021 rather than 1.4% in January of 2021.\n\nIn other words, for inflation to remain high, prices would have to start increasing DRAMATICALLY for inflation not to go down, while the rate of inflation is actually decreasing.\n\nThat will give the Fed cover to slow the rate increase curve being priced in right now.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation", "cpi"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "You are truly lost", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1809181123971939}, {"body": "I would rather have low inflation.

{"title": "Inflation Is Already Worse Then The 1980s", "selftext": "Hi retards, i'm sure most of you are familiar with this, but the CPI has undergone massive changes over the decades, to the point people question the validity of the model for inflation specifically. Originally, like 1980s, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. Now, the basket of goods can be changed rather frequently, and has been seen more as a cost of living index within the United States. As we saw in 2021 where they removed poultry and a lot of other goods from the CPI basket.\n\nHowever, if we were to plug todays numbers into the 1980s CPI formula purely looking for an output of cost of goods between two periods. We get [this](https://imgur.com/a/Dmhsqrx), note that this chart only accounts up until December 2021, the CPI has only gotten worse since then. One thing is certain, the Central Banks are dancing with an unknown fire with regards to monetary policy. The outcomes of which absolutely nobody can forecast, but it does look grim for the average consumer.\n\nOn an anecdotal point:\n\nI have a family friend that runs a small hole in the wall pizza joint in a strip mall. They are entirely family staffed by the big Italian family so don\u2019t feel the brunt of labor shortage, more so only cost of goods increases. In 2015, their slices were priced at 2 dollars. In 2019, they increased prices to 2.50 a slice. Last month they just increased prices again to 4 dollars a slice. Obviously this is a single data point, but experience can be telling.\n\n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b checking out", "id": "sshj5b", "created_utc": 1644863184.0, "score": 1035, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 295, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|15|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|141|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sshj5b)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sshj5b)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03288237378001213}, {"body": "Eh, I'm only down 26% overall in my account.
