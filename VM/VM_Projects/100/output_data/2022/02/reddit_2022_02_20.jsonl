The lower volume is not surprising due to seasonal trends (I think every single lender projected lower Q4 volume).\n\nBut the lower margins are interesting. This is probably due to increasing competition for less volume, combined with increasing wholesale market share (with lower margins).\n\n# Mortgage servicing rights (MSR)\n\n* Unpaid principal balance at the end of Q3: $521 billion.

They don\u2019t release their purchase numbers, but let\u2019s try to predict:\n\nUWMC estimates Rocket has 88% refi (source: UWMC November investor presentation available at [https://s26.q4cdn.com/976831745/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q3/UWM-Holdings-Corp-3Q21-Earnings-Presentation\\_Final.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/976831745/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/UWM-Holdings-Corp-3Q21-Earnings-Presentation_Final.pdf) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket had only 27% purchase in 2019, well before the huge refinance boom, as disclosed on their S1.\n\n [https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-delivers-record-volume-in-q3-but-execs-are-tight-lipped-on-purchase-v-refi/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-delivers-record-volume-in-q3-but-execs-are-tight-lipped-on-purchase-v-refi/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn their Q3 earnings release, Rocket proclaimed \u201cQ3 2021 represented Rocket Mortgage's strongest purchase closed loan volume in company history. Our purchase volume grew 70% over Q3 2020 levels.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal volume from Q3 2020 and Q3 2021 were nearly identical. Yet purchase volume increased 70%. \n\nTo give Rocket the benefit of the doubt, let\u2019s assume they had 12% purchase in Q3 2020, before the 70% growth they cite, and a full year before UWMC estimated Rocket with 12% purchase mix. \n\n* Q3 2020: 89B\n* 53.5B retail\n* 29.6B partner\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If 12%/88% ratio:**\n\n* 10.7B purchase in Q3 2020\n* Add 70% and you get 18.2B purchase in Q3 2021, now 21% purchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If 15%/85% ratio:**\n\n* 13.35B purchase in Q3 2020\n* Add 70% and you get 22.7B purchase for Q3 2021, now 26% purchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Another issue for rocket in Q1: Rate lock problems\n\nMortgage rates are rising exponentially. A rate lock in January may be significantly lower rate than the rate at origination a few weeks later. Longer times to close could have a big impact in Q1. It\u2019s likely we won\u2019t see any effects of this until Q1 earnings though. \n\n# Other data to support this\n\nloanDepot ($LDI) projected Q1 volume to drop by 8%-30%, and a huge drop in gain-on-sale margins:\n\n[https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc\\_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the publicly available mortgage data (h/t u/lymondfc).\n\n**VA data:** [https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender\\_Statistics.asp](https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender_Statistics.asp)   \n\nALL\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $103,822,920,824\n* 4th Qtr: $92,468,433,277 (10.9% decrease)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $7,319,511,113\n* 4th Qtr: $6,214,143,673 **(15.1% decrease)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FHA Data:** [https://www.hud.gov/program\\_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap) \n\nALL\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $85,650,768,830\n* 4th Qtr: $75,879,038,007 **(**12.9% decrease)\n\nRocket\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $6,479,459,993\n*  4th Qtr: $5,461,202,656 (**18.5% decrease)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolume down 15.1% and 18.5% in both data points. Let\u2019s take the average, down 16.8%.\n\nThat makes $72B volume, clearly missing guidance. \n\nYet **even if we assume high end of guidance, $80B Q4 volume, it's still a mess:**\n\n* 21% purchase: $16.8B\n* 79% refi: $63.2B\n\nUp to:\n\n* 25% purchase: $20B\n* 75% refi: $60B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne month ago, when rates were even lower, MBA estimated a 50% drop in refinance volume from a year ago. Surely it's higher than 50% now. Mortgage rates have risen dramatically since then.\n\nSources: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/mortgage-refinance-millions-of-borrowers-just-missed-their-chance-to-save-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/mortgage-refinance-millions-of-borrowers-just-missed-their-chance-to-save-.html) \n\n[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/di4t1gi881j81.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=7885082cd5d9a69beb8254881c604b2699085d4b\n\n# Putting it all together with only a 50% drop in refinance volume\n\n**Q1: $48-$50B total origination volume**\n\nThat\u2019s a 33%-38% drop from Q4 projected volume. \n\n**Q1 2022 volume likely will be Rocket\u2019s worst origination volume since they did $40.1B in Q3 2019, down over 50% from $103B in Q1 2021.**\n\nEven if they hit their high end of guidance for Q4.\n\nEVEN WITH VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES of refi volume drop. \n\nThis is lower than pre-pandemic levels:\n\nQ4 2019: $50.8B\n\nQ1 2020: $51.7B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMargins are dropping too.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n$RKT will miss earnings and issue horrible Q1 guidance due to plummeting refinance volumes.\n\nRocket will have a rough year.\n\n# Positions\n\n$RKT 50 9/16 12p", "id": "sx84h3", "created_utc": 1645382631.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|336|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q4zsek/uwmc_is_now_way_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx9car/uwmc_interesting_developments/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5a5f5/uwmc_ready_for_liftoff/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx9kgp/uwmc_ready_to_pop/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sx84h3/rocket_is_gonna_crash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obcr17/uwmc_is_waaaay_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0qk1s/uwmc_dropping_hints/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwdhqt/uwmc_dd_insider_purchase/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obe3bz/uwmc_is_waaaay_undervalued/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sx84h3)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sx84h3)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.313750684261322}, {"body": "I sold my entire rocket position a while back when I placed an offer on a house and the seller declined because the lender was rocket mortgage.", "score": 73, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46694162487983704}, {"body": "Long term bag hloder checking in.\n\nPain.
