The lower volume is not surprising due to seasonal trends (I think every single lender projected lower Q4 volume).\n\nBut the lower margins are interesting.

Yet purchase volume increased 70%. \n\nTo give Rocket the benefit of the doubt, let\u2019s assume they had 12% purchase in Q3 2020, before the 70% growth they cite, and a full year before UWMC estimated Rocket with 12% purchase mix. \n\n* Q3 2020: 89B\n* 53.5B retail\n* 29.6B partner\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If 12%/88% ratio:**\n\n* 10.7B purchase in Q3 2020\n* Add 70% and you get 18.2B purchase in Q3 2021, now 21% purchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If 15%/85% ratio:**\n\n* 13.35B purchase in Q3 2020\n* Add 70% and you get 22.7B purchase for Q3 2021, now 26% purchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Another issue for rocket in Q1: Rate lock problems\n\nMortgage rates are rising exponentially. A rate lock in January may be significantly lower rate than the rate at origination a few weeks later. Longer times to close could have a big impact in Q1. It\u2019s likely we won\u2019t see any effects of this until Q1 earnings though. \n\n# Other data to support this\n\nloanDepot ($LDI) projected Q1 volume to drop by 8%-30%, and a huge drop in gain-on-sale margins:\n\n[https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc\\_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the publicly available mortgage data (h/t u/lymondfc).\n\n**VA data:** [https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender\\_Statistics.asp](https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender_Statistics.asp)   \n\nALL\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $103,822,920,824\n* 4th Qtr: $92,468,433,277 (10.9% decrease)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $7,319,511,113\n* 4th Qtr: $6,214,143,673 **(15.1% decrease)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FHA Data:** [https://www.hud.gov/program\\_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap) \n\nALL\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $85,650,768,830\n* 4th Qtr: $75,879,038,007 **(**12.9% decrease)\n\nRocket\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $6,479,459,993\n*  4th Qtr: $5,461,202,656 (**18.5% decrease)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolume down 15.1% and 18.5% in both data points. Let\u2019s take the average, down 16.8%.\n\nThat makes $72B volume, clearly missing guidance. \n\nYet **even if we assume high end of guidance, $80B Q4 volume, it's still a mess:**\n\n* 21% purchase: $16.8B\n* 79% refi: $63.2B\n\nUp to:\n\n* 25% purchase: $20B\n* 75% refi: $60B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne month ago, when rates were even lower, MBA estimated a 50% drop in refinance volume from a year ago. Surely it's higher than 50% now. Mortgage rates have risen dramatically since then.\n\nSources: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/mortgage-refinance-millions-of-borrowers-just-missed-their-chance-to-save-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/mortgage-refinance-millions-of-borrowers-just-missed-their-chance-to-save-.html) \n\n[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/di4t1gi881j81.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=7885082cd5d9a69beb8254881c604b2699085d4b\n\n# Putting it all together with only a 50% drop in refinance volume\n\n**Q1: $48-$50B total origination volume**\n\nThat\u2019s a 33%-38% drop from Q4 projected volume. \n\n**Q1 2022 volume likely will be Rocket\u2019s worst origination volume since they did $40.1B in Q3 2019, down over 50% from $103B in Q1 2021.**\n\nEven if they hit their high end of guidance for Q4.\n\nEVEN WITH VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES of refi volume drop. \n\nThis is lower than pre-pandemic levels:\n\nQ4 2019: $50.8B\n\nQ1 2020: $51.7B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMargins are dropping too.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n$RKT will miss earnings and issue horrible Q1 guidance due to plummeting refinance volumes.\n\nRocket will have a rough year.\n\n# Positions\n\n$RKT 50 9/16 12p", "id": "sx84h3", "created_utc": 1645382631.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|336|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q4zsek/uwmc_is_now_way_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx9car/uwmc_interesting_developments/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5a5f5/uwmc_ready_for_liftoff/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx9kgp/uwmc_ready_to_pop/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sx84h3/rocket_is_gonna_crash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obcr17/uwmc_is_waaaay_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0qk1s/uwmc_dropping_hints/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwdhqt/uwmc_dd_insider_purchase/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obe3bz/uwmc_is_waaaay_undervalued/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sx84h3)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sx84h3)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.313750684261322}, {"body": "I sold my entire rocket position a while back when I placed an offer on a house and the seller declined because the lender was rocket mortgage.", "score": 73, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46694162487983704}, {"body": "Long term bag hloder checking in.\n\nPain.

{"title": "What's your YTD?", "selftext": "So we're going through a \"market correction\" right now. Most people lost money.  \n\nLooking at YTD since beginning of the year: Cathie's ARKK is down 33%, , TSLA 29%, big hitter Microsoft 14%, SPY 9%. My portfolio is down 5.4%. Majority is ETF, but with quite a bit of leverage/margin investment. \n\nIn a way, I feel lucky I got away better than others. I keep telling myself: Things will be better in the long run. I invest long term. I just have to hold. I only lose money when I close (plus margin cost). No rush.\n\n But the money lost still hurts. Not being careful enough makes me feel undisciplined. Opening up the app every day to see more red isn't fun anymore. Uncertainty about near term future persists. Explaining that I invest time in the stock market, but still lose thousands of dollars is not a happy place.\n\nHow is everybody else doing? What's your YTD? How do you deal emotionally with it?\n\nEdit summary: thanks for all the answers.\n I see about 3 times as many downs than ups, which is interesting. Up-people mentioned oil a lot. \n\nA lot of people commented that they are doing fine, since they started many years ago.

Zoetis bought abaxis which is interesting and another big player. Zoetis has some really interesting sales tactics to squire new business w good incentives to practice owners. Problem isn\u2019t lack of consumers ie pet owners it\u2019s lack of supply of the care providers and Barriers to entry into the space for new practice owners. \n\nFor example. There is currently a shortage of doctors in the vet industry. Due to rise in cost of vet school and poor income to debt ratio. This makes it harder for them to open their own practices. The mindset has shifted from being a practice owner to working for corporate entities.  . Mainly expansion is happening via corporate entities and private equity purchasing existing practices and expanding them to meet consumer demand. Why is this important \u2026\u2026 \n\nIdexx main revenue stream is via selling in-house lab equipment for clinics and hospitals. Unless there\u2019s is continued growth on the practice owner side i.e new practices opening I feel idexx\u2019s sales will slow. You will have places upgrading equipment over the next few years but I think they will slow as the contracts are typically for 5 years. Also, 1 analyzer can support a hospital of five - ten doctors. In years past those doctors may have opened 5 clinics and separately purchased 5 analyzers\u2026.. additionally their margins on ref lab are shit compared to sales of diagnostic equipment. \n\n\n \nIn summary my concerns for idexx \n1) less new opening practices compared to prior years past will lead to reduced sales of in house hospital diagnostic equipment the majority of revenue comes from equipment sales thus over long term slowed growth. \n4) increased competition due to Acquisitions and redirected business to feed their own associates entities. Ie vca and ANTECH. \n\nThus, although a healthy company which will remain profitable and I don\u2019t think they are going anywhere. I\u2019d expect them to have less growth over the next 10 years which will likely cause reduction in share price in the long term. I could be wrong but this is my take on it.

{"title": "Everyone cancel Netflix", "selftext": "Listen up retards. Now recently most of us have become aware that Netflix is hiking their rates again. Im sure there reasoning is so that they can bring more drool secretions to the masses. Perhaps inflation is even cutting into their production costs. Like the benevolent movie theater killers that they are they just was to provide more content for families across The world so we can all escape our miserable lives and spend as much time in front of the TV watching mind numbing content. I love eating tendies on the couch, pounding beer and watching Movies. Besides watching all of you degenerates lose small fortunes and posting your losses online\u2026zoning out on my couch is one of my favorite pastimes. Why? Cus im a lazy fat American. \n\nHowever. I dont want to pay 20 bucks a month to do it. So I propose this. There are a little over 11 million users on Wallstreet Regrets, even if half of you cancel your membership that will create a reasonable downside to this rate hike. Hell tell your friends and family too (ya know the ones who arent using your subscription to Netflix) and maybe we can put a real dent in their bottom line. In other words. Fuck your Netflix calls, cancel your subscription and buy puts.\n\n\nThis is my first shitpost. Not amazing i know im more of a meme guy myself. Have a great Saturday night.
