Problem is it will expire worthless way more than 50% of the time.  This is what's known as a bad exit strategy and the reason most people lose at it.\n\nThe other option is to let it expire ITM (or just execute it), and depending on how much money you have in your account and what broker you are with, they will execute the option for you and you'll get the stock at your strike price (which will be lower than the current price since the call was ITM).

Anytime you own a contract (buy to open), you decide the fates.. you can execute anytime you want (provided it's not a European style option), even if it's a terrible idea, and you can close it (sell it) anytime you want. The only problem with selling is there has to be a buyer that wants it. This can be another trader like me or you, or it can be a market maker (usually this is a person that just runs a algorithm, or a bot). MMs will only buy your call if they have a reason to. So there's no guarantee you'll ever be able to sell that call back. The other downside is that if you buy a call, you're usually gonna pay either the ask price, or at least close to it.. and when you sell, you'll only get the bid price, or close to it.  Sometimes this bid/ask gap can be wide on options that aren't trading a lot so you'll usually take a loss to the market makers if you are trying to scalp pennies on a trade like that.\n\nIn your example of a stock going from 100 to 50, you definitely wouldn't be able to sell that $1 contract back because there would be no one to buy it, unless you got really lucky and some guys cat jumped on his keyboard and hit the buy button for that particular option at the same time you tried to sell it.. and even then, market makers would probably snatch that up ahead of you.\n\nOh one other thing I forgot.. if you are on a broker like Robinhood that $1 call will only cost you $1. But if you're on Tastyworks or something, it can cost you up to 3 bucks to buy that (or more if it's OTC), and then more to sell.  So keep in mind your broker can have different fees for doing trades.  I have a couple different brokers including Robinhood and I've never seen this mythical \"bad fill\" thing that Robinhood supposedly has. I only trade low priced stocks on RH though so maybe it happens more with higher priced stocks.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "But IF they bought my shitty call for half the stock price, I\u2019d get $0.50 back? Am I understanding that right?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No, it doesn't go down at the same rate that the stock does. The reason is because the value of the option is based on the likelihood of the price of the stock meeting the strike price when it's OTM (when it's ITM, it has what's called intrinsic value and it can never be lower than that value, or it never should be). So for example, if a 110 call option (OTM and 1 week dte) is worth $.01 when the stock is at 100 dollars, that means almost no one thinks the price of the stock will be at or higher than 110 in a week.  If that stock now goes down to $90 the next day, people tend to think it will keep going in the same direction it was going, which is down. So now 110 is even less likely so people aren't willing to pay $.01 anymore, no one will even think about buying it at that point, and that's from only going down $10.\n\nA good example of how the price changes is to look at how the value of a call option changes when it's ATM (at the money).  I'll use a real world example that actually might be a good trade right now: TREX $100 call Feb 18 for 1.45-2.00.  It's only 16 DTE so I'd probably never do this, but this is just an example. That means if you got it at the midpoint, you'd spend around $175 for that call, and the price of the stock is $95.84 right now.  If it goes up to $100 tomorrow, that call would go up a lot in value because you can see the 95 is at 3.60-4.50 (which is about the difference between the current price and the call option), minus a little bit of time decay since it's would only be 15DTE then. So the option would now be worth about $410 just from the stock going up $5. And every dollar it goes up after that point will add 1$ to the value of the call (which would be $100 gain each time), so it goes up 1 for 1 after it hits the money.  This is why ITM and ATM calls are much better when it goes up.  They are higher risk too though, because they cost more, and whether it's worth that risk or not is very situational.\n\nI just want to reiterate that these plays are generally not good. You're basically gambling that a stock will go in a certain direction and at least a certain amount in a certain amount of time.. which is 3 things working against your bet.  If you can stick with $1 trades, you won't receive a lot of damage but you'll be tempted to go closer to ATM and further out because you'll say things like, \"oh man if I only bought 2 strikes up I would have made xx dollars\".. if you fall to those temptations, you'll start to lose a lot.

{"title": "AMD Yolo Update - <24 hrs after position was opened.", "selftext": "Hi everyone. Been several requests for an update to the call options. This will be the last update until I exit my position. To answer the question: It's up ~$240k usd since open & at the time of the screenshot (<24 hrs). I have no intention of selling today - I bought jan 2023 calls (leaps) because I believe that AMD is going to continue climbing. I will \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\udc50 this for a while.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFAQ: \n\nWhy only 240k? I thought calls meant \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. 100%+\n \n- These are leaps. They expire in a *LONG* time & I bought the day before ER, so the premiums were expensive. The gains are not near as large as shorter dated options. Leaps behave a bit differently than short term options. I personally treat these as the same thing as running ~4-6x leverage long on AMD - with the benefit that I cannot get liquidated if the price moves against me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIV crush?\n \n- Leaps are not as susceptible to IV crush as shorter dated options. This is partially because we will see 3 more ER's before these options expire, leading to very similar market conditions that we just experienced. IV will be high before all those ER's too. This lets me continue to hold them, without worrying too much about decay. I tentatively plan to exit before next ER, market conditions pending.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAre you selling today? Lock in gains?\n \n- No lol. I'm holding for at least 1-3 months. Let the winners ride. My thesis has not changed. I will post an update to WSB's when I exit, but none before then (for my AMD position). I suspect we will see AMD continue to climb, and I hold my targets of $140-160 within 3 months.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThesis?\n\n- It's really not that complicated. The company's still growing like crazy. I have been following AMD for some time, and based off rumors that I was reading into I suspected that they would crush ER again. They overdelivered. AMD's been in a non stop bull run for the last few years to match the company growth. Why would it stop here? It just dipped & (in my views) the market overreacted. It was the perfect opportunity for any bull to buy (Cramer was... RIGHT?!?). I view AMD like I view Tesla. Don't bet against Lisa. Don't bet against Elon. You won't win. I don't believe that $160 was the top, but rather a side effect of macro conditions (everything dumped) combined with people taking massive gains (it hit $160 fairly quickly). $100 was the bottom - it hit it *very* quickly and lots of paper hands got worried and sold. I don't believe the macro market will continue dipping (We have already bottomed for the next ~3 months) which gives me a few months of room to grow these leaps. I may reconsider when interest rates start going up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy leaps? Why not shares?\n\n- Leaps give me cheap access to leverage, which is what I am using them for with my AMD investment. If it hits ~$160 within the next quarter, shares would net me ~50% returns, whereas leaps will be ~300%+.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you think it's going to hit $160 within the next quarter, why not buy options with a closer expiry?\n\n- Leaps are a bit of a hedge. It's true that they don't gain value as quickly as shorter dated options. However - *IF I AM WRONG* and the share price plummets, I can keep holding. I am often wrong in the short term. I believe in my thesis, and that they will hit ATH's by EOY. My targets are sooner, but sometimes the markets disagree. Leaps let me have the option for either to occur. I am long term bullish on AMD, and would be okay if they dipped 5-10-20%. I'd just keep holding. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat do you do for work? How did you get this money?\n\n- I am a software engineer. However, the majority of my money has been made via my own high risk investing. My investment style is not suitable for most people. My primary investments are into leaps as I like the leverage they offer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext play?!\n\n- Nothing right now. I'm just going to sit on my current portfolio for a bit. Likely just wait for a good exit on AMD.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[EDIT]\n\nI closed the position: \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/snzefu/sold_amd_bought_intel_how_retarded_am_i/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPosition update: https://imgur.com/a/sU7LT06", "id": "sisjsp", "created_utc": 1643818526.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "I am following this mofo.

So volatility is massive on them (as would be expected). But if my underlying thesis is, eventually, correct, I win. And I get the massive upside of leverage.

I consider this when buying options. It's part of the reason I bought intel.

People OP sold those calls to are gambling not only on volatility staying high, but staying high bc the price moves in the right direction. \n\nYou're not just factoring change of the underlying share price, but *rate of change*. Think back to math and physics, velocity is the derivative of position over time. Hence why options are known as derivatives.\n\nIf Google price had slowly and steadily climbed to 3k over months or years, the rate of change would be low, and Implied Volatility and therefore options premiums would reflect that. \n\nBut Google hits 3k by jumping 10% in a single day? That means there's a higher likelihood of a further large move in either direction equally quickly.\n\nHow does one take advantage of this? Right now, both calls AND puts are expensive because of high IV triggered by the stock split news.. They are likely to drop in price soon due to volatility falling back down, since GOOG is typically not a volatile stock with massive daily swings, unlike say TSLA. \n\nSo, rather than buying options, I'd recommend *selling* options on GOOG today, with the expectation that the share price won't change too drastically after today, IV will drop, the options you sold would become cheaper and you can buy them back for less down the road. \n\nFor example, you could sell both a single call and a put for Google at $3000 expiring Feb 18, and get paid a total of ~$14.6k for both. If by Feb 18 GOOG s under 2850 or over 3150, you'll end up losing money.
