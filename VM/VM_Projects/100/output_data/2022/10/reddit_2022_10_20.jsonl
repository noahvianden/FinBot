In comparison, Tesla's market cap is about $690 billion. This means Tesla would have to grow roughly six times its current size to catch up.\n\n\"I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined,\" said Musk, according to a transcript of Tesla's earnings call on October 19. He acknowledged it'll be tough, but it can be achieved with \"a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.\"\n\nMusk made the ambitious statement on Wednesday after Tesla reported record revenues of $21.45 billion in the third quarter of 2022 \u2014 although it fell short of the $21.96 billion analysts were estimating, per IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also posted a profit of $3.29 billion in the quarter running from July to September \u2014 just under a record profit of $3.3 billion reported in the first quarter of this year.\n\nFull article: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-surpass-combined-apple-aramco-value-earnings-profits-2022-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-surpass-combined-apple-aramco-value-earnings-profits-2022-10)\n\nElon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) can exceed the combined value of Apple (AAPL) and Saudi Aramco, which currently with combined market cap of around $4.4 trillion. While TSLA's current market cap is about $690 billion.

The people shit talking the app haven't really provided any reasons besides anecdotal personal experiences that are very easily attributed to poor design or implementation.

Powerful, flexible, and effective, absolutely. It's a business tool to drive revenue, not a toy.\n\n > Have you tested competing products? \n\nYes. Specifically Connectwise, which is very weak compared to Salesforce. It simply doesn't offer the same level of granular reporting capabilities that Salesforce does, which can tell you what actions need to be taken by what team. We also utilize Hubspot, another tool being mentioned as a competitor to Salesforce in this thread which is kind of hilarious. Hubspot isn't even remotely comparable to Salesforce as a CRM. We use multiple sales engagement tools which for smaller organizations would suffice as a CRM but again, the level at which Salesforce can be customized and the granular reporting sets it apart from most CRMs. \n\n> Are there any you\u2019re aware of that are as good or better?\n\nAt the level my company is at, no. And we're still in the SMB category. Enterprise level organizations, definitely not. Small businesses can get away with smaller or simpler CRMs but once you reach a certain threshold you need a more robust system.\n\n\nEdit: In the ERP space each major provider generally has a module dedicated to CRM but, the ones I work with very rarely use that module. I work with **a lot** of enterprise organizations utilizing Oracle's various ERP applications and Salesforce is a very regular presence. I barely see any of Oracle's CRM modules being used.

And there'll probably be a bunch of cars in transit on 12/31, but that'll be mostly offset by all the cars that are getting delivered right now\n* There's a good chance that a lot of cars that were in transit were higher trim/profit models. Just because it would makes sense for Tesla to prioritize shipping more expensive models that can absorb the shipping price hit, and deliver more of the cheaper models locally\n* Zach made a great point at the beginning of the call, that even taking out credits, Fremont and Shanghai are at almost 30% gross margins. That's probably weighted towards Shanghai and is based on the margins of the cars they actually delivered\n* Austin and Berlin are going to be making way more cars this quarter, so their fixed cost absorption is going to be better and their gross margins will be up\n* Overall volumes are likely to be wayyy up, and Tesla has been doing an excellent job at keeping operating costs low, so operating margins should be up too\n\nLast quarter is what it looks like when you're positioning your company for huge growth. It seems like wall street would've preferred that Tesla sacrifice Q4 margins to make Q3 look marginally better? But Tesla is doing the right thing and keeping margins high and planning for the huge jump in deliveries that are happening right now. There's a lot of reasons to expect Q4 to exceed almost all analyst's predictions and investors are just ignoring it and selling at a huge discount. They're just fucking themselves because they can't look forward 3 months, not even a year or 5 years or any real investment horizon, they can't look forwards beyond a what happened a couple weeks ago.\n\nThe only real downside for this quarter is that the US tax credits go in to effect next year, so people might be delaying their purchase? But Tesla's backlog is so long that I suspect they'll be able to find lots of buyers who have been waiting 6+ months already and don't want to wait another 3-6 months. Also, even if Tesla does delay some deliveries from the end of December to the beginning of January in the US, that'll just be a huge advantage for their customers. I do expect to see them have a decent number of cars in transit at the end of the quarter, just not so many that it'll cause an operational problem of storing/delivering them all in January. But again, that'll be partly offset by all the deliveries of cars made in Q3, that are just happening now.\n\nBut then the credits will be in effect and Tesla is going to be printing money faster than they can count it. They're already an insane cash generating machine, when the tax credits hit their margins are going to go through the roof and the demand for any car they can make will be nuts.\n\nIt's like Tesla won the lottery, but they can't cash their ticket until January, and wall street is losing their shit because they want the money *now*.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "> It seems like wall street would've preferred that Tesla sacrifice Q4 margins to make Q3 look marginally better?\n\nAlmost correct.

{"title": "The Housing Market Will Crash in 37 Days", "selftext": "If you are one of the millions of people worried about housing prices, let me help you sleep at night: *you're wrong.* \n\nThis post title is easy to click on, everyone has 2008 burned into their brain, it is trendy to talk about how unaffordable real estate is. It gets discussed in the media, people make youtube videos about housing and regards write reddit posts - because it gets engagement/clicks/eyeballs.\n\nThat makes it potentially \"fake news.\" It doesn't need to be true to be discussed.\n\n# Here are some reasons why housing will maintain its uptrend for the next decade:\n\n**1) Mortgage Rates Will Fall Back Down**\n\n* The FED and easy money caused the last bull run after 2008. \n* The FED tightened in 2018 and the market crashed\n* The FED eased during covid, the market moved up \n* The FED tighten in 2022, the market crashed \n* When the FED is done, they will reverse, and they will send the markets back up. They will do this by cutting rates and encouraging people to buy assets \n* Don't fight the FED \n\n**2) Inventory Will Remain Depressed For Longer**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mlii4ou81v91.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=37a5fcea936873bf548d9c705432e98e63fc4d58\n\n* No one wants to produce new housing after 2008. \n* We have been under-building and not meeting demand for 10 years \n* People still having kids, people living longer, more houses are needed \n* Price is where supply and demand cross, there is undersupply \n\n**3) Potential Homebuyers Are Much Richer Post-Pandemic, Boomers Are Dying**\n\n* If you don't have more money now than you did pre-covid, you did something wrong \n* Boomers are the richest generation in history, and they are dying and giving their money to their children, who buy houses for their children to live in \n\n**4) Domestic And Foreign Institutional Demand Is Strong**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znzpicw991v91.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead76805183bb52e31edaa005c6d7276e2b16fb1\n\n**5) The Federal Reserve And Federal Government Are Pro-Homeownership**\n\n* Remember house Biden cancelled student loan debt, and how Pelosi ran the printer, or how Trump cut taxes? \n* The government is pro home ownership. \n* Don't fight the fed \n\n**6) Household Debt is Low, Income Is High**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ows36wd51v91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a653bbe3d6fa1b776cc01ccb6f313caad10f42d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0cmll2qf51v91.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=27b9682faa73c5d71effded41b8499bd5074b3a8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7) Houses Aren't Really That Expensive**\n\n* Relative to everything else, housing doesn't look that bad\n* People need housing (and food, and healthcare) - its not going to just \"crash\" because people don't want it any more \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yw32mz6k51v91.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=86ac29502721cf19db77b8922e0e80ed04fdfcd2\n\n* Is this trend line really that unreasonable?\n* Does it look like it is ready for a crash?  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xv5svqu041v91.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f3fbb08954588463b8202c2ce67e0c1b16b1214\n\n**8) Borrowers are Much Better** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6z1l62o51v91.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69befd98a267e9e2ab026c606d9eedc3e3fe630\n\n**10) Potential Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Hike/Transacting Real Estate is Expensive** \n\n* If tax rates are higher in the future, then people are going to hold their assets longer, and trade them less \n* Almost everything has come down in price over the past 20-30 years, but real estate agents/brokers still charge 6%\n* The title companies, lawyers, closing agents still charge the same. County filings still cost the same. It is expensive to transact\n\n**11) Higher Conforming Loan Limits Improve Affordability**\n\n* The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) increased the [conforming loan limit for 2022](https://www.financialsamurai.com/conforming-loan-limits/) by 18% to $647,200, up $98,950 from 2021\u2019s limit of $548,250.\n\n**12) Airbnb and Your \"Local Market\" is Meaningless** \n\n* There seem to be so many posts complaining about Airbnb prices, or that no one is getting/making bookings \n   * Airbnb has 7 million listings **in the world**, that represent the \"extra\" housing the market has, that private owners put up for rent. \n   * The average airbnb host makes 10k/yr \n   * \"Airbnb hosts\" are not a significant player in the housing market, they don't/won't effect the price of homes being sold\n   * yurts, igloos, cabins, shipping containers, tiny homes don't count as part of the \"housing market\" \n   * Before you start spouting off about your airbnb details, I am a superhost and have been doing it for 4 years so I have context to this argument \n* It makes no difference what is going on in \"your city\" where you RE prices falling, for something to \"crash\" it has to effect all asset holders. \n\n# Conclusions:\n\n* Supply and demand matter. Decreased supply is going to outweigh the effect of decreased demand. \n* The FED will pivot, the gov is pro home ownership. Don't fight the FED.\n* There is no massive \"debt bomb\" in housing, like there was in 08. No bomb, no \"crash\" \n* Your anecdote is not helpful in evaluating this topic. Neither is mine. Look at the aggregated math, forget your preconceptions \n\nDisagree?

Data is out of date, this is more up to date: https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/us-housing-starts-fall-september-building-permits-rise-2022-10-19/\n\n\nPoint 3: No data to back your claims.\n\nAn inflated personal balance sheet means nothing in the face of 40 year highs in inflation, and now in the face of increasing job losses. Personal savings are plummeting.\n\nBoomers are dying and passing money, sure. That wealth transfer is concentrated in a small percentage of the population. \n\nPoint 4: data is out of date. I\u2019m sure there was a spike in 2020, 2021, but in 2022 foreign demand has almost assuredly fallen off a cliff with the rising dollar being the driving force, followed by slowing demand.\n\nPoint 5: the last time the govt was explicitly \u201cpro-homeownership\u201d was Bush era. You can do your own research on the ensuing policy, Fannie/Freddie, etc, but this created the 2008 crisis. We wanted to stimulate coming out of 9/11, dot com, and we haven\u2019t stopped since. One bubble rolled into the next.\n\nIn short, govt being \u201cpro-homeownership\u201d has proven to be a net negative exogenous force.\n\nPoint 6: your data is out of date, cutoff at or near the peak of both of these metrics (2020/2021, printer still on).\n\nEquity is on the decline as home values drop. Mortgage debt is increasing as job losses mount.\n\nPoint 7: Data out of date. Housing has inflated further, continued to do so to this day on the rental front though home prices have fallen. Irrespective, a smaller % change on the average Americans largest expenditure (housing) doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a massive change as a % of total budget.\n\nFor example, eggs increasing 20% blows but going from $5 to $6\u2026 nobody really gives a fuck. Housing increasing 5%, from $2000/mo to $2100/month is a larger change in % of total income. People give a fuck.\n\nPoint 8: data is out of date. Ends at again another peak for this metric.

The 30-year\u00a0Treasury\u00a0rate rose to 4.213% Thursday, its highest since 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nFreddie Mac on Thursday said the 30-year mortgage rate was averaging 6.94% in its latest weekly survey, a 20-year high that has severely curtailed demand for new home loans.\n\nBut with\u00a0U.S.\u00a0inflation showing no signs of a clear pullback from a 40-year high, expectations have been running high for the Fed to increase its policy rate by another 75 basis points at its November meeting, and potentially by the same amount again in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nThe CME odds on Thursday favored a 4.75%-5% fed-funds rate to kick off February.\n\n\"There is a lag effect in mortgages,\" Whalen said, adding that even if central bankers decided to hit pause on additional rate increases after their December meeting, the 30-year mortgage rate still would \"easily touch 10% by February.\"\n\nWhalen, an investment banker, author and specialist focused on banking and mortgage finance, urged the\u00a0U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0in 2008 to move complex and opaque derivatives \"back into the daylight,\" after banks and investors saw hundreds of billions of dollars in losses tied to structured debt, including subprime mortgage exposure. He also provided testimony to\u00a0Congress\u00a0in 2009 about systemic risks of the banking industry.\n\nNow, Whalen sees another major shakeout coming in mortgage banking as profitability continues to get pinched (see chart) and the housing market sputters.\n\nImportantly, Whalen also sees potential for home prices to give back all of their pandemic gains if rates stay high for all of 2023.\n\nThat's a bigger call than estimates for a 10%-15% correction in home prices from prices that surged 45% nationally during the pandemic.\n\nBut Whalen pointed to speculative home flipping volumes that reached almost\u00a0$150 billion, or 10% of total home sales in 2022, and the cold blanket of double-digit mortgage rates as catalysts for a steeper home price retreat.\n\nEconomists at\u00a0Mizuho Securities\u00a0on Thursday pegged median home sales prices as down 2.5% from their peak, in a client note, and characterized the housing market as \"deteriorating,\" but mostly in line with expectations given the sharp jump in mortgage rates.\n\nMortgage loan rates can be traced directly to the mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, market, which are bonds that trade on\u00a0Wall Street, mostly with government backing, that finance the bulk of the near\u00a0$13 trillion\u00a0U.S.\u00a0mortgage debt market.\n\nWith the Fed's race to raise rates, it has jolted financial markets, sunk stocks and led to a stark decline in mortgage bond issuance this year, while also making it more expensive for corporations, municipalities and households to borrow as part of its inflation fight.\n\n\"It will take us months to get the bond market and lending market in sync so people can make money again,\" Whalen said.\n\nStocks closed lower for a second straight day on Thursday, leaving the S&P 500 index off 23% on the year at 3,665.78, and the 10-year\u00a0Treasury\u00a0rate at 4.225%, its highest since\u00a0June 2018.\n\n-Joy Wiltermuth\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 10-20-22 1753ET Copyright (c) 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm", "inflation", "dow"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Mortgage rates will fall down but it will take some time.
