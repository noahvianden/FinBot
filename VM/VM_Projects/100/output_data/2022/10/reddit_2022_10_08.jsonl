So it works in the opposite way if anything. Why? Well, at 130% debt-to-GDP were US treasury yields to hit 8% that would mean the US would be spending over 10% of GDP just on servicing their national debts. And that's just the interest payments on the national debt, private debt levels are something like x2 higher.\n\nBut what I'm describing here is basically the debt cliff - at some point it becomes infeasible to service debt and manage inflation. In such an event the best option becomes to inflate the debt away - at least in a country like the US where the debt is denominated in the national currency.\n\nMy guess is that in the US today 5-6% yields are probably the upper limit. Beyond this difficult trade-offs would need be made.\n\n\\> Idt any of the jobs data that is published is accurate at this point either too many people working two jobs and retirees picking up work as well\n\nIncreases in labour supply are deflationary so this would be deflationary if anything. I suspect a large part of the reason we're seeing wage inflation pressures is because a lot of boomers have quit their jobs over the last couple of years and labour participation rates are still below their pre-pandemic levels. However, I'd argue you can't have sustainable increases in labour demand without economic growth because companies can only hire more if they're making more, at least longer-term. What's probably happening is that there is a short-term supply / demand imbalance in labour given a lot of people have felt able to quit their jobs because of stimulus checks and savings during Covid. This isn't the kind of sustainable economic growth required for sustainable increases in labour demand. Over the next few months I can almost guarantee that people will be returning to the workforce as saving dwindle and companies will be cutting back on hiring as economic demand collapses.\n\n\\> On top of all this the fed basically saddled themselves with bags using QE, and at the last Fed meeting JPOW basically said they aren\u2019t doing QT.\n\nExcessive QE over the last couple of years is probably partly responsible for the current inflationary pressures, but that's over now. The question going forward is whether QT is feasible without breaking something. I'd argue there's a reason that every time they try to do QT they fail.\n\n\\> My thought is that they are trying to address inflation first without absolutely tanking the markets, but the reality is where we are right now Japan could sell of all their US treasuries and fuck the US economy\n\nYou mean you think they'll try to bring inflation down as much as possible short of systematically breaking something?\n\nJapan selling their treasuries to support their currency probably hurts Japan far more then the US. It would probably just raise yields in the US a little which wouldn't be a bad thing from the Feds perspective. It's not going to crash the dollar, and Japan can only do it for so long. Also, this would be terrible time to sell treasuries given how much they've fallen.\n\n\\> The only way I see a soft landing is the fed basically offsets their bags on every other currency out there by continuing to keep rates elevated, it\u2019s not solely addressing inflation.\n\nSorry, not sure I'm following you here.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation", "crash", "gdp"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4133191406726837}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3596440851688385}], "tickers": ["inflation"]}

This was further compounded by significant fiscal spending programs and shifts in employment that are causing productivity to fall (work from home is terrible for productivity). Then in a matter of 12 months much of that was whipsawed in the other direction as fiscal spending slows, interest rates rise, and food / energy inflation is rising significantly. Additionally demand was pushed forward while consumers are overcoming a spending hangover that has been subsidized significantly by governments. It is obvious that the E in the P/E ratio will fall for many firms going forward as purchasing falls and companies rationalize pricing to meet reduced demand and higher inventories. \n\nSo go ahead and cite your past experiences in a world that is different than those experiences. Go ahead and believe that Powell is going to do the same as Yellen and Bernanke. And go ahead and believe that peer research journals are the gold standard for investing approaches.\n\nHere are some recent things you can watch to see what is happening in the markets and how bad things are (it's not just FedEx and Nike folks).\n\nVideo on the state of the US car market.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1lpceQT4pWk\n\nA recent indicator review by Cathie Wood (the economic indicator section of her video).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8atBTSEdfF4\n\nWhile everyone thinks that Powell and the Fed are making a \"policy mistake,\" I disagree wildly. He needs to bring back sanity to the markets. And the only way to do that is to slap the global economy, reduce insane valuations, bring back reasonable interest rates, and get people working again (Not just goofing off in random Zoom meetings, but back to work together in on-sites and hungry to keep their jobs). So a decline in assets values is a feature; not a bug. And most people are reading the situation incorrectly when they think that Fed will \"pivot.\" They'll keep rates up as long as they can. And the longer they do, the more the tide will roll out. \n\nYou know the rest.

This is nothing like the 70s and though it has some similarity to the 20s, that was more like the real estate crash.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, we really dont know to what extent, tech has changed the fundamentals of the economy. For example, we know that we can do more with fewer people and that many jobs are just useless hamster wheels (for example, almost all finance jobs are useless). So at some point, many people will not need to work but we dont really know how far we have gone down that rabbit hole because we havent tested it in 14 years and a lot has changed.\n\nIm also wondering what impact the dual income is going to have. We are probably at record highs in terms of dual income households. Surely this will impact real estate and many other things.\n\nNow all that said, we can definitely assume that discretionary spending will drop. Thats sort of a given at this point. But will this really cause the markets to fall more? Come on man... we really dont know.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "First off, finance jobs are not useless. (I'm not going to debate this because I don't see the value to me and the relevance here.)\n\nSecond, the dual income household came into relevance in the 70s and was a partial driver of rising home prices in the US as women entered the workforce en masse. So I don't think it's really a big deal now; other than the fact that women are becoming more and more important as a share of household incomes as they are becoming relatively more educated than men. (And educational levels tend to mirror income. Generally.)\n\nTech and innovation (as Cathie would call it) have always impacted economies. Nothing special happened during the pandemic (i.e. - innovation during the last to years wasn't some sort of step change that will revolutionize productivity); and, if anything, the world saw productivity DECLINE. Read that again. Productivity is down. (Work from home isn't what people think it is. And it's not some wonderful innovation that  parabolically increases productivity for companies and industries.)\n\nIf you want to bottom line what happened over the last several years, it is very simple and comes down to this.\n\nGovernments increased both monetary and fiscal programs to stimulate the global economy to allow people to work less and produce less. This was compounded by global politics and reduced globalization / trade. It's that simple. (Now there are obviously other factors that are less savory and quite despicable that occurred to create inflation that central banks and the US government didn't do that significantly impacted this. But I'm not going into those because it will distract from the major points.)\n\nSo with increased fiscal spending (unemployment programs, PPP loans, EIDL, COVID sick policies, student loan deferrals, mortgage moratoriums, rental moratoriums, etc.) and monetary stimulus (zero / negative interest rates, lightened credit terms, etc.) you saw a significant increase in spending & speculation. Part of this was caused by the fiscal spending giving people money, some of it was caused by asset inflation (increasing the wealth effect), and some of it was caused by social media pushing people to speculate while everyone was stuck on their phones at home (globally).\n\nThere is a lot more that could be said here but the post is already too long already and there is more to come. But believe me when I say that as this rubber band that has been stretched so long (fiscal and monetary stimulus) is allowed to snap back, the impact is and will be powerful. \n\nYou can already see what is happening in the UK. (Which, yes, is partially attributable to Russia. But Russia is just a catalyst. Just like a spark is a catalyst to a fire in a barn full of old dry tinder that is about to catch fire.) But there is evidence of this snapback all over the place. Hiring freezes. Declining earnings and unexpected revisions (FedEx, AMD, a ton of other companies next quarter, etc.). Reductions in activities at the ports. Falling commodities prices (probably driven substantially by China). Higher inventories at retailers. And the list goes on.\n\nAs it relates to recessions, the job market is a lagging indicator. Companies start by cutting capital investment and cutting costs in other places (e.g. - office supplies, bonuses, random events, sales trips, etc.). But then they start to do hiring freezes and rescinding offers (sometimes this second thing happens before or during the first thing). And finally they start cutting hard; layoffs, reorganizations, etc. And if they can't figure how to survive with those things before you get to refinancings (which are harder to do in a rising rate environment). And if they cannot do that; bankruptcies and forced sales. So while the job market still seems hot to you, there is a lot going on behind the scenes and things are slowing down. The layoff wheels grind slowly; and even more so after this pandemic. And here's why.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic many companies decided to let workers go. (By the way, the rationale for the PPP loan program was to prevent this from happening by enticing employers to retain employees rather than let them go because governments understand that once a person is fired it's harder to get them hired back. - The idea was nice, but obviously flawed in execution and implementation.) \n\nAs those workers left, they were given unemployment that for many of them was more than they made working full time in their pre-pandemic jobs. (We are talking bartenders, waiters, cooks, cashiers, people delivering food, etc. Low wage jobs near minimum wage that could be overwhelmed by the sheer size of the unemployment checks they were collecting from the federal and state governments. On top of this independent contractors were allowed to collect this as well; which goes against the idea of unemployment insurance, but that's another issue. And probably the thing that is talked about least; it is obvious that some people who collected unemployment checks decided to go to work \"under the table\" so they could double dip. While still others decided to take advantage of the pandemic unemployment insurance to move into a new higher-paying career now that the standards were lowered to get into them and training was more available to them because they had free money from the government available to them to live and they didn't necessarily have to pay rent, their insurance, nor student loans. But those last couple aren't something I want to go into really. Because again, this is long already.)\n\nA short time after those workers were let go, the fiscal and monetary programs created demand for products and services that required those same people back. But now many of them didn't really need to work because of the fiscal and monetary support combined with the ability to not have to pay expenses they had before (e.g. - gas for commuting to work if they were remote, student loans, mortgage, rent, going to parties, going to the movies, going on trips, etc.) So now those people could take their savings or income and place them into things like \"investments;\" crypto, stonks, and Kobe Bryant rookie cards. As these things went up in value, those households could take on more debt or feel they could spend more. Here is a video below that you should watch to understand better; using one vertical as an example (which is just beginning to be understood by analysts).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1lpceQT4pWk", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": " \n\n\n PART II (Because the response was too long for Reddit)\n\nSo to bottom line it. People at the low end didn't really have to work. People closer to retirement decided that maybe it was time to retire. And people who could work remotely began to take advantage even more by taking on multiple jobs or just doing the bare minimum to get by to do work. Which reduces productivity and output. Driving up inflation (in addition to global supply chain shocks between countries and shutdowns to prevent the spread of a pandemic).\n\nNow as the economies around the world begin to open up, companies begin hiring even more again in anticipation of people going out and doing things again. Many of these companies are service companies. But guess what? The demand for workers is primarily on the low end of the job market because the higher paying jobs were more easily filled during the pandemic (because employers bent over backwards for those workers by allowing many to \"work\" remotely and hiring people with less experience into those roles). So while some companies were still hiring for high end (educated / technical) roles, they weren't going crazy with it. Primarily what they were doing was trying to find the best people they could at those levels; essentially poaching from other companies so they could increase their competitiveness. (But that began to slow significantly as the Fed began raising rates and Silicon Valley valuations tanked. Which meant layoffs and lower bonuses for tech talent who then applied to other companies for work; think Fortune 500 firms instead of hot tech names we all know.)\n\nSo with the high end of the market seeing layoffs and reductions, we now come to the low end. \n\nAnd here is the rub. While companies have been having a hard time finding people to work in these jobs, the numbers of job postings will decline as the recession progresses. They only need a certain number of people to do the job now; and will need even fewer as revenues decline. (You already see this with hiring at Amazon. They cut hiring ahead of the biggest seasonal hiring time for them. It'll eventually move to other retailers next year as things slow down and people are forced back to work because they have less savings. The main question here is boomers who retired \"early\" during the pandemic. Will they have enough to live on from their savings and investments? Or will they need to get a job to pay for some things? Especially health care and food.)\n\nAt some point companies will no longer need new employees, but will hire anyway. Why? Because those newer employees will work harder because they will want the job more. AND the company can hire those new workers at a lower title and lower hourly rate. Then at some point they can let their under performing (and higher paid) employees go as the new lower paid employees are doing just as much or more than their higher paid counterparts.\n\nAs a final point, some experts believe that companies are being slow to layoff and cut staff for fear of not being able to hire them back later. A kind of PTSD from trying to hire people during the pandemic and being understaffed significantly where employees would just ghost them or work less or they would have only three employees when they needed six. But the question is how long will this hangover last. Will companies finally get the courage to lay people off when they get 50 applications for every 1 cashier job again? Probably. When will that be? I don't know. Six months? One year? Two years? Perhaps. But I do know it will happen again. And so do the employers. And so does the Fed.\n\nI hope this helps explain more clearly some of the things going on. I understand how people would think me arrogant to say I see the writing on the wall and that I can predict the future. But I'm not really predicting anything. I'm just watching what is happening and adjusting to what I am seeing. Just like I did during the pandemic when I wrote DDs on Reddit for people about Funko and Herman Miller that turned out to be prescient and correct (based on data points I saw and an interpretation of what I was seeing). \n\nBest of luck and make sure to keep some cash on the sidelines.

I do disagree with some of your thoughts. \n\nFor instance, the dual income thing. I sense that this has climbed since the 70s but thats not all.. the level of income has probably substantially outgrown inflation for dual households specifically. The reason being, women arent just working low end jobs. Many are making more than their husbands. Practically all the dual income folks I know, even those who are uneducated, make north of $120k-$130k between them. That on the low end. The educated folks are making north of $600k dual income. And thats not all... many of them have no kids!\n\nWhat I was trying to illustrate here is how this will correlate with real estate. This is important because real estate is a major industry that trickles down to many parts of our economy, from finance to paper towels.\n\nThe point is that for an economy to really crash, you need real estate to falter. If real estate holds, then there is a good chance there wont be a major recession never mind a crash. The things that impact real estate the most is income and rent. Rent dictates whether or not RE is worth it. Income dictates whether or not you can hold it. In both cases, the indicators are that the RE will not sink. Rent is waaaay more expensive than holding the property you bought, even in the last 2 years and its just getting higher as people are priced out of the market. And income seems to be good enough to hold even if you lost your cozy job and had to turn to services. Heck the starting salary for a simple service job is like $40k now.\n\nSo what im trying to say is a major economic leg seems to be stable. There is no over speculation in real estate. What we have is inflation and inflation makes real estate and debt, more manageable, not less. This is why Trump did everything he could to keep rates low. He himself was drowning in debt. It was his way out. He could care less about the USA otherwise. If he were all cash, you could bet the house that he would have asked for rated to climb. But I digress.\n\nNext, tech. I think you are missing two key things. First of all solar energy. People are asleep at the wheel. Crunch some numbers into what solar is doing on a macro and micro scale. I wont dive deep into this because its mostly obvious so ill just summarize. I installed solar (SoCal) a few years ago. $12k for a 6kw system. I added an eV two years ago. Between grid and gas, im probably saving about $5k a year and im not even the most efficient household I know of (my car is actually a hybrid). My in laws run businesses. They are probably saving at least $10k a year in gas and utilities.\n\nNow think about that. Scale it and let it sink in. On a purely macro scale, this is energy we didnt have before. Its brand new energy. On a micro scale, its saving many people a lot of money. Where do you suppose it will go? This is more than what we got for unemployment and stimulus and it will never go away. In fact, the savings will increase over time. How many households have installed solar by now? How many have an eV? Are you really telling me that the tech is similar to past stuff? How? When was the last time we created new sources of energy at this pace? Industrial revolution? When was the last time it actually trickled down to common middle class people? The answer to that, is literally never. The closest comparison might be industrialization of farming.\n\nSo in other words, I think you are understating the effects of tech right now. We are literally in a reassurance and like all the others, people living it, dont seem to realize its happening but it is.\n\nOther tech, like work from home is also having a huge impact. You say productivity isnt up, but efficiency is waaaaaaaay up. Again think macro. People who work from home are saving between 1-2 hours their waking day. They are also saving money from commute. This is also taking them out of the commute entirely which is lowering commute times for all. This also makes infrastructure upkeep cheaper.\n\nSo during waking hours (assuming 8 hour sleep), you are literally saving between 6% and 12% of your waking time. This is huge given it happened almost over night. On top of that, you are saving an average of about $5-$10 per day on average in gas. There are apox 250 work days a year. Thats $1k a year in pocket money on top of 1-2 extra hours of free time. From infrastructure perspective, less cars means less traffic, less accidents, less slowdowns, less repairs. Etc. All in all, I would say we cut expenses by about $2k-$3k per work from home person per year in expenses (as a society on a macro level). Now do that math.\n\nAll these things matter. $5k-$10k from solar per year, $2k-$3k from work from home per year. Both increase with inflation. Both are likely permanent. This dwarfs the stimulus money you are worried about especially over time. And oh yea, automation. I cant speak for robotics in warehouses but I can speak about programming and how much easier it is today compared to 20 years ago. This is because we have so many more tools that automate much of what we did in the past. What would have taken me maybe a month or two in 2000 I can now accomplish in maybe a week if I stretch and take my time. And yet the industry is still so inefficient overall that I dont see this slowing down for a few more decades.\n\nSee what I mean? I think there is a lot more to consider.
