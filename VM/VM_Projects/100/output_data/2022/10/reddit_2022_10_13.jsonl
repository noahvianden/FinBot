Soaring prices have finally prompted the central bank to issue aggressive rate hikes and begin shrinking its balance sheet this year \u2013 but the rapid pace of tightening could easily send the economy into a recession, economists have warned.\n\n \"Powell is unbelievably late doing this. He sat still while the meme stock craze was going,\" Sternlicht said, adding that the belated reaction could kill off investors' gains across the entire market. \n\n \"There were really smart things that people did, and there were smart fish in the pond. And there were stupid things people did and they were idiot investments. \u2026 So you thought the healthy fish would survive and the sick fish would die. But the Fed is draining the entire pond, so everyone's going to die,\" he said.\u00a0 \n\n Sternlicht added that the Fed could be overtightening the economy by basing rate hikes on the Consumer Price Index, which remains well above the 2% inflation target. But that index lags behind the economy by around 18 months, experts have said, meaning the central bank could be basing its rate-hike decisions on outdated information \u2014 and it risks screeching the economy into a downturn.\n\nCurrently, the Fed expects to keep hiking until it hits a terminal rate of 4.6%. That's more than a full percentage point above the current fed funds rate, and it could mean the central bank is set to hammer the economy, costing \"millions\" of jobs around the world, he said.\n\n\"I just get so angry when people say the Fed needs credibility to fight inflation. Wait. You'll get what you want. You'll get this recession; it's definitely coming.\"\n\nBut despite anticipated market volatility, he noted long-term investment opportunities could be coming to the surface, as stocks will eventually be discounted and some will be poised to rebound.\u00a0\n\n\"I am personally looking for opportunities that I think represent incredibly compelling long-term investments, and I think you're beginning to see them,\" Sternlicht added.", "id": "y2xy26", "created_utc": 1665665477.0, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "I find this an interesting analogy as the Mississippi River is about dry in some places.

In the US for instance, Social Security COLA is linked to CPI, and since it is such a large, potentially insolvent, transfer payment, the government needs to keep CPI to a reasonable level. CPI will eventually feed core and producer inflation, which means that overtime we are likely to see those measures creep up for a time, even after CPI starts to decrease.\n\nWhat should probably concern you more is other measures the government utilizes to suppress inflation readings. Hedonic inflation adjustments are probably the most egregious, with product inflation being reduced by some officials opinion on how much extra value has been added to the product (think about a TV that increased by $400 but is hedonically adjusted to only a $380 increase because it is now 4k instead of 1080P). Substitution is another method used to reduce inflation (Steak increases by a significant amount, consumer will switch to another cheaper protein). OER and how the inflation basket is weighted all impact the readings and are designed to allow the government to slowly inflate away the debt, reduce the burden of transfer payments to the fiscal budget, while simultaneously maintaining the stability of the financial system and keeping the population politically complacent (at least on economic matters). \n\nThe problem is the system kind of depended on China producing goods below cost and dumping them on the global market while providing a never ending supply of low-wage labor to ensure the suppression of wages in the developed world. That is starting to break down and thus the Fed is struggling to keep inflation in check.
