At least they weren't significantly more overvalued in 2021 when compared to valuations in say 2016.\n\nWhat the market got \"wrong\" was inflation - and I put wrong in quotes because I'm not even sure to what extent that is true just yet.\n\nWhat is true is that near-term valuation are extremely dependant on treasury yields because the treasury market is how investors calculate the risk free return which all investment returns are benchmarked against. If you take the 10y yield in 2021 and apply that to today's earnings the S&P500 would probably be around $5,000.\n\nSo like I say, valuations just weren't that unreasonable in 2021 if you thought inflation expectations were correct. But the market got inflation wrong so the 1 - 2% yields the market priced in 2021 had to move up significantly and today they're closer to 4 - 5%. So I think what you're asking indirectly here is why the market got inflation wrong which I'm happy to go into if you like, but it's complicated.\n\nBut this doesn't really explain why some companies are down so much and I think in a lot of case this is more complicated to explain. This is because in addition to adjusting for rates a lot of the software sector has also been rerated, and in some cases its hard to explain why.\n\nFor stocks like PTON it's easier to understand though. They're an unprofitable company which had been fuelling their growth with debt and that debt is now much more expensive. At the same time their growth is slowing and their costs are far higher today because of all the expanding they did in 2021 which assumed their growth would continue. The growth slowdown and higher borrowing rates means their business model is now completely broken and a lot of hot pandemic-era companies fell into a similar trap (FSLY, COIN, HOOD, etc).\n\nBut there are other stocks which have been punished significantly which I don't understand as much. Stocks like CRM, TWLO and SHOP, for example. These aren't in debt and in the case of CRM and SHOP are cashflow positive so don't need debt either. I think the story here is more that the macro poses significant headwinds for growth and they have a history of share dilution which isn't what investors want to see right now. Additionally while I don't think their business models are broken, they are more questionable compared to your highly profitable big tech companies which again I think is fuelling doubt in such uncertain times.\n\nBut when you adjust for valuations for 2021 growth and inflation projection vs the growth and inflation projections today that explains 80% of the moves we're seeing imo.

Unless they had other reasons?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is just my opinion, no one knows for sure, but I think the fiscal stimulus was a wildcard that happened to be far more inflationary that anyone could have expected. But I don't think it was just the fiscal stimulus alone that alone did it, it was the stimulus combined with lockdowns which led to record saving rates and consumers paying down debts. And also that low interest rates allowed everyone with a mortgage to refi and lock in a historically low rate. This eventually led to a surge in demand and an extremely interest rate insensitive consumer.\n\nThere's two ways in which interest rates slow economic growth, the first being to make savings more attractive, and the second to make borrowing more expensive meaning more income goes towards paying down debt and debt is used less often to fund consumption. But when the consumer has no credit card debt, record high savings and the only debts consumers do have are mortgages fixed at record low rates you effectively fuel demand and destroy the primary method by which interest rates work to slow it.\n\nThis is why I put \"wrong\" in quotes because in some sense I'm not sure the market or the Fed actually got the neutral rate of interest wrong. I think that what we're seeing is a temporary (but fairly durable) boom in demand fuelled by excessive fiscal stimulus, low debt and high savings which means the Fed has no effect tools to fight the excess demand we've been seeing. We basically just have to let this run through the system then if our models on inflation are right, we should see it trend back down. I'd argue we're seeing this slowly happen now with savings coming down and credit card debt going back up, but it's just going to take time before consumers have to change spending habits.\n\nWhat I don't agree with are all weird theories we're seeing today trying to explain inflation via a lack of energy investment or deglobalisation trends because that doesn't explain why inflation spiked as dramatically as it or why interest rate hikes seem to be doing so little to combat it. It also goes against everything we previously believed about the neutral rate of interest being likely to trend lower in coming years with aging demographics, slower population growth and lower productive growth.\n\nIt would be silly to think inflation is just being caused by one thing though. There are clearly other factors at play here which aren't helping such as supply-chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine, but I don't think these sufficiently explain the spike we're seeing in demand.

For whatever reason we we're all so focused on \"money printer go, brrr\" that no one stopped to think about the unprecedented fiscal stimulus that was happening - maybe because we're so used to governments borrowing money and spending it in stupid ways anyway.\n\nI remember some heated debates on /r/investing back in 2021 where some of the more knowledgeable users who worked on Wall St were routinely \"debunking\" the runaway inflation theories circulating there, because again they were all coming at it from the central banking / QE angle while making factually incorrect claims about QE being equivalent to money printing.\n\nSo I don't know why the Fed or any of the \"experts\" didn't see it, but if I were to guess I think the lockdowns + fiscal stimulus were a kind of an unknown unknown that no one was really thinking about at the time.\n\nGiven what I've just argued though, I think the question to ask now is why is no one saying what I'm saying? At least I've not heard anyone in the Fed try to explain in any detail why they think they were wrong. They seem to be acting surprised and confused while making comments about how this might be similar to the 70s because that is the only perspective they have.\n\nBut if I'm right then the inflation we're seeing today is completely different from the 70s and we shouldn't be looking to historical parallels to explain / tackle it. It's quite possible we've now tightened way beyond neutral rate and the Fed is guiding the terminal rate far higher than it needs to be.

Re valuations now vs dotcom, I see SPACs, crypto, and WFH stocks like ZM as this bubble's version of crazy dotcom valuations. Remember where we were in 2001 with all this, and thankfully nearly all have been wiped out. NFLX is another example, but that one is re-inflating based on one quarter's guidance that could be completely wrong, tho at least it's a real business. \n\nWe're likely in Stage 6 of the business cycle, when stocks, bonds, and commodities drop in tandem. Similar to the dotcom burst, Stage 1 (recession), bond prices begin to rise (yields drop, flight to safety) while equities and commodities continue to sink. We're just not quite there yet, as even slightly lower yields (like on Fri) are being interpreted by markets only as a reason to buy stocks (lower discount rate applied to future CFs). At some point, when companies really begin to feel the heat and must bag employees (even if they are reluctant to do so given how difficult is has been to hire) this dynamic should change. Rates going down for the \"bad reasons\" is when stocks will drop hard, but stocks could be higher when this occurs so I'm not sure where SPX would end up. Given past bear markets that are accompanied by recessions and downward earnings revisions of 17-25% from here, the SPX could drop to well below 3000. \n\nStill too early to bet hard against the market, because these hype and technical bounces aren't over yet, not because I believe in seasonality/midterm elections normally being positive catalysts. There is nothing normal about 2022. Also, SPX likely bounces again at 3500 on technicals, so until we get through all of this I'm playing the Oct rally with play money via options, 40% of real money in 3/6 month TBills.
