But let's take a stab at it. From a purely technical point of view the 3100 range is possible. This is based on a measured move taken from the last swing high down to the previous support line and then projected downward. It's an old school Dow theory method that's surprisingly accurate. \n\n\nOn a valuation basis it's going to be all about earnings. Right now est. earnings for the S&P is $209.29 a share for the year. The current forward PE is 17.39. That would give the index a value of around 3640. (Which is higher than where it closed on Friday) This is assuming that earnings hold up to expectations and/or there's no more multiple compression.\n\n\nSome analysts are predicting earnings to come in around 10% under estimates. If that's the case then 3200/3300 is in the cards (if the PE remains constant) and that is more in line with the technical target of 3100. If earnings are off that much I would imagine that the PE would also come in and markets would fall closer to the 3100 target.\n\n\nLet's say earnings do hold up but guidance is weak. That scenario could drive more selling, which would further compress the PE. Unless investors start to believe that the multiple is now attractive (by some metrics it is) and earnings don't spook market participants, then the market could rally - or at least stabilize and base.\n\n\nIMO the current route is all about three things: 1) Inflation. 2) Dollar strength. 3) Rising rates. If you're familiar with inter-market analysis then you'll know that these issues are all interconnected. If one of these breaks down (bullish for stocks) then most likely all three are breaking to the downside - or, they just stop going up.\n\n\nIn any event, as a 25 year old you should be buying as much of the index as humanly possible right here right now. And just keep buying. 35 year old you will be incredibly better off for it.\n\n\nMarkets are unpredictable. We can only use past data points to project future results. There are only two guarantees 1) If you don't invest you're guaranteed to be poor. 2) If you do invest you're not guaranteed to be rich but you're guaranteed a chance.\n\n\nGood luck and just keep buying.", "score": 125, "replies": [{"body": "I like your comment so will nest here, adding one risk\n\nas a bear, there is a \"risk\" of things going up on unexpected news or good news.

OP - you are me circa 2005.  Thinking back it would have been really silly to start guessing which stocks are going to take off.  And if you are going to do that, I recommend ignoring the herd and starting with solid non-tech companies like PG or JNJ to get a feel for what it's like to hold stuff going up and down, and it most likely won't go down much, but if it does, then you at least get solid dividends.

Absolutely, however, the market could also reverse course and go to $4,500 with a 20 PLUS PE. (I'm not clairvoyant, never have been, so I have no clue). I just know that if the S&P 500 goes to ZERO then that means the likes of Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Visa, Exxon, Tesla, United Health, Procter and Gamble, etc....all go to zero. That means that money won't matter. Capitalism will be dead, gold will be worthless and we will literally be bartering for food. I just don't see this happening, therefore, the speculation of short term projections in the stock market make no sense to me so I just keep buying.\n\nHope this helps, as far as my approach to pricing on the S&P works, but I've been through the 2008 Financial Crisis where, literally, the system was on the brink of collapse and it survived that. If it could make it through that then, as long as the goal is to keep the capitalistic society we have in tact, the market will, over time, respond accordingly, in a positive manner.\n\nGood luck to all and feel free to message me with any further questions if you have any.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "> Could the market go to $2500 with a 10-12 PE on forward earnings?
