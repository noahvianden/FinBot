{"title": "Musk's entry into Twitter's \"first fire\": \"Bloodwashing\" management, freezing and checking all code", "selftext": "Twitter's \"Era of Musk\" is officially on!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk retweeted a picture showing Musk talking to employees in a coffee shop at Twitter headquarters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe media quoted people familiar with the matter as saying that Musk completed the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. After six months of public and legal wrangling, the world's richest man has officially \"joined\" the troubled social network as Twitter's CEO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd just yesterday, Musk changed his Twitter profile to \"Chief Twit\" and posted a video in which he wrote a pun, \"Enter Twitter HQ and let it sink in!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"First Fire\": Fire CEO, CFO, freeze and check all code\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThree fires have taken place for the new officer, and great changes have taken place within Twitter. The former CEO and CFO have resigned, and all codes have been frozen and checked...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs soon as Musk took office, he blew the management and fired several former Twitter executives. According to people familiar with the matter, CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and legal policy, trust and security head Vijaya Gadde were all fired. The company's general counsel, Sean Edgett, was also ousted. Executives were rushed out of the building, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCNBC's David Faber said former CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal have left Twitter's San Francisco headquarters and will not be returning to the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeparately, Twitter's engineers were no longer able to make changes to the code, and Tesla's engineers came in to check, people familiar with the matter said. People familiar with the matter said this was to ensure there would be no changes to the product until the deal closes. Twitter has implemented a similar freeze since April when the deal was first announced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMusk wants Twitter to be the most respected advertising platform\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding the previous rumors, Musk also clarified.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n75% layoffs? According to previous media reports, after acquiring Twitter, Musk plans to reduce Twitter's 7,500 employees to more than 2,000 in the next few months. After coming to the Twitter building on the 27th, Musk gave Twitter employees a reassurance, saying that he did not plan to lay off 75% of the staff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFreedom of speech, no consequences for what you say, cancel content moderation? Musk said Twitter clearly can't be a \"hell of indulgence,\" but Twitter should be more careful about deleting tweets or closing accounts. Musk has said that he wants to restore the account of former US President Trump.\n\nPotential conflict of interest in car advertising, with some advertisers even worried that he will remove the ad from the platform entirely? Musk stated:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen done well, advertising can please, entertain, and help you. It can show you a service, product or medical treatment that you may have never known about but that is useful to you. To do this, it's critical to show Twitter users ads that are as relevant to their needs as possible. Low-relevance ads are spam, but high-relevance ads are actually content!\n\nFundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world, one that makes your brand stronger and your business better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMusk also noted:\n\nHaving a common digital town is important to the future of civilization. That's why I bought Twitter.

{"title": "What the boomer idiot investors don't realize about METAverse", "selftext": "I see some real shit opinions all over Reddit on META, as this place has somehow become a cynical cesspool of anti-intellectual teenagers that think they know better. \n\nListen to me instead. An elder millennial that gets triggered by misinformation all day long and also thinks I know better. (sometimes it's even true) Also, may or may not be regarded. You tell me. \n\nHere's what I see:\n\n\\>\"it looks worse than roblox / vr chat\" \n\n\\>\"Facebook is dying\"\n\n\\>\"bring back myspace\"\n\nFirst of all, shut the fuck up. Just stop. Please. It hurts my head. If it was true, that would be fine. But like I said I my autism gets triggered by dumbness. \n\nWHY has Facebook/META thrown nearly 100 billion at this? (with a revenue of 27 billion per quarter, they have the money)\n\nFacebook is the ONLY multi-modal social media company in the USA. It has a marketplace, local community groups, videos (50% of all facebook traffic is watching videos) not to mention Insta, whatsapp. You can do almost anything on it. Run a business. Chat with your mom. See what your friends are doing. Rent a boat. Harass women with pics of your extremely small penis. Whatever you want! (don't do the last one bro. Just don't.)\n\nSo WHY? \n\nIt's a hardware platform, that you cannot access on a normal PC. Only on a META VR headset (potentially) \n\nYou think the graphics look bad? That's like blaming youtube for 480p video. Don't blame youtube. Blame the creator for having a shitty camera. Metaverse is the platform. Not the video. It's a new platform that has tools to do whatever you want. AR or VR both in one.\n\nNow just imagine this, if you can. Tell your wife to hop off her boyfriend's dick, pull both of them over, and try to imagine with me. \n\nYour favorite youtube/twitch livestreamer? Don't watch them anymore. VR with them. Walk in their room as they talk to you. Sit at their desk. You're not behind a screen anymore. You're in the room. Even a prerecorded youtube video can work this way. Or do it live.\n\nYou want to see that Ye redemption concert tour but the tickets are $5,000? Attend in VR. Walk around, live. The performer doesn't need a headset. Just you. Interact with other VR people at the concert (or not). See their facial expressions. Dance with them. Switch your headset over to AR, go to the fridge, get a drink, check your texts, reply to an email, and then head back into the concert. All using the headset. Buy merch at the shop, which has an AR eshop overlay. Easy. This can be done with 3d camera arrays. Even a basic iphone can LIDAR scan a bedroom in 5 minutes. Apple ahead of the game as always. A highly accurate (to the 1/16\" accuracy) venue model can be recreated in a single day using current technology, like the Leica BLK360 scanner. That's your metaverse. It's whatever you want. \n\nYou can't attend your best friends wedding? Attend in VR metaverse platform. The normal attendees will just see you on a screen (or not at all), they don't need headsets. But you can walk around, see the moment, while not being too invasive. To them, you're just on an ipad somewhere. Maybe there's a few 360 cameras around. Some LIDAR scanners to record the venue (or the venue provides this). You're not intrusive, but you can experience it. \n\nWant to buy a puppy on FB marketplace? See it in VR. Live. Confirm it's not a scam. Send the money through Facebook even, with buyer protection.\n\nOnlyfans - see your favorite porn model from every angle. Walk around. Jack off in the privacy of your home. Squirt some e-jizz all over his/her face. or not. I'm not the boss of you.\n\nThe possibilities here are endless. This hasn't even mentioned the work from home benefits yet. This is still 5-10 years down the road. But it is coming. Reality and the digital world WILL mix together more and more over time. Unless the apocalypse gets us first ofc. And META has a huge head start in technology hardware and software tools (not software environment))\n\nSo. That's why you're all dumb for comparing it to VR chat. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.\n\nI sold my calls yesterday, but I plan on going back in next week on Jan 100c contracts.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - fuck you learn to read bitch.", "id": "yfxijy", "created_utc": 1666983564.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|536|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yfxijy)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yfxijy)\n    \n>TL;DR: The Metaverse is a new platform with endless possibilities that has been thrown nearly 100 billion by Facebook.
