{"title": "Tomorrow you can go back in time.", "selftext": "Facebook stock $META will open up tomorrow at levels not seen since the beginning of 2016. If you buy, you will be paying the same price for Facebook as you would have back then. The difference? Back then the P/E ratio was around 80. Yes, 80. Now, paying the same price, you\u2019ll be buying in at a P/E ratio around 10. \n\nNo matter what you think of the Zuck, and his joke of a metaverse (Gavin Belson territory disaster), what you must consider is whether Facebook\u2019s business in 2022 is really that much worse than 2016. You may think this! That\u2019s okay. You\u2019d have some supporting evidence. \n\nBut in my view, on a pure cash flow and sum of the parts basis, Facebook is trading at an all time best valuation. A price to free cash ratio around 10 is a third of what it was in 2016. On the basis of its business today, Facebook is making 300% more gross profit than back then. \n\nYes, growth is slowing, and what we\u2019re seeing in these earnings is screeching brakes. If you think this is it for Facebook, that no growth is in its future, then maybe this valuation makes sense. \n\nBut for me, it\u2019s a chance to go back in time and increase my position as if I was back in 2016. Because I have a very hard time believing that this is where Facebook\u2019s story ends. Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus, all have room to grow and monetize. Who knows, maybe Zuck will realize the real money in the metaverse is putting 360 degree cameras on sports figures and allowing people to get a players-eye view during games; or creating virtual spaces for house of the dragon fans to become background extras while watching the latest episode; or anything other than a sad version of second life.

{"title": "Amazon sinks on weak fourth-quarter guidance", "selftext": "* Earnings: 28 cents per share\n* Revenue: $127.10 billion vs. $127.46 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates\n\nLike the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has had a rocky year so far as it confronts macroeconomic headwinds, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Those challenges have coincided with a slowdown in Amazon\u2019s core retail business, as consumers returned to shopping in stores.\n\nUnder CEO Andy Jassy, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in July 2021, Amazon has responded to rising expenses by aggressively cutting costs across numerous divisions in recent months. It shed warehouse space, halted some experimental projects, shuttered its telehealth service and froze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business.\n\nStill, analysts are expecting Amazon to report solid third-quarter results, thanks to easier comparisons with last year\u2019s numbers and a potential sales boost from its annual Prime Day discount event, which was held in July.\n\nRevenue growth is projected to come in at 15%, marking a return to double-digit expansion after three straight quarters of growth in the single digits.\n\nAnother bright spot could be Amazon\u2019s advertising unit, which has been more resilient compared to peers including Meta, Alphabet and Snap, whose ads businesses have gotten whacked due to the economic environment and Apple\u2019s iOS privacy changes last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Alphabet missed expectations for the third quarter, and YouTube\u2019s ad revenue declined for the first time since Google started breaking out results for the streaming video unit. Facebook parent Meta stumbled again on Wednesday, issuing disappointing earnings and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cBesides allocation to TikTok, budget shift to lower funnel activities is the consistent point of feedback in our conversations with marketers this quarter,\u201d said Rob Sanderson, a managing director at Loop Capital who recommends buying Amazon shares, in a recent note to clients. \u201cAmazon is the lowest on the funnel.\u201d\n\nWall Street will also be paying close attention to Amazon\u2019s fourth-quarter guidance. The forecast could signal how much demand Amazon expects to see during the holiday shopping period. Analysts are already girding for a lackluster season, with online sales expected to grow just 2.5%, according to Adobe.\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon hosted a 48-hour Prime Early Access Sale, which was the first time it has held two major discount events in the same year. The event jump-started the holiday shopping period early, and it could help juice Amazon\u2019s sales in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv are projecting fourth-quarter revenue of $155.15 billion.\n\nAnalysts have taken different approaches to their per-share earnings estimates because of Amazon\u2019s hefty investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian, which went public late last year. The plunge in Rivian\u2019s share price forced Amazon to take a combined $11.5 billion markdown in the first two quarters of 2022. However, Rivian shares rebounded a bit in the third quarter, climbing 28%, which could lead Amazon to mark up the investment.\n\nAmazon shares have slid 34% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index has dropped 20% over the same period.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/amazon-amzn-earnings-q3-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/amazon-amzn-earnings-q3-2022.html)", "id": "yf207r", "created_utc": 1666901445.0, "score": 151, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "Currently -19% in afterhours trading.

The Company posted a September quarter record revenue of $90.1 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.29, up 4 percent year over year. Annual revenue was $394.3 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and annual earnings per diluted share were $6.11, up 9 percent year over year.\n\n\u201cThis quarter\u2019s results reflect Apple\u2019s commitment to our customers, to the pursuit of innovation, and to leaving the world better than we found it,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO. \u201cAs we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, we are leading with our values in every action we take and every decision we make. We are deeply committed to protecting the environment, to securing user privacy, to strengthening accessibility, and to creating products and services that can unlock humanity\u2019s full creative potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur record September quarter results continue to demonstrate our ability to execute effectively in spite of a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop,\u201d said Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s CFO. \u201cWe continued to invest in our long-term growth plans, generated over $24 billion in operating cash flow, and returned over $29 billion to our shareholders during the quarter. The strength of our ecosystem, unmatched customer loyalty, and record sales spurred our active installed base of devices to a new all-time high. This quarter capped another record-breaking year for Apple (AAPL.NaE), with revenue growing over $28 billion and operating cash flow up $18 billion versus last year.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company\u2019s common stock.

{"title": "Elon Will Get Cancelled Soon", "selftext": "**Positives**: Let's keep it real, Elon deserves a lot of credit for all of his accomplishments, positivity brought into the world, a vision for a future and trying to turn humanity into a multi-planetary species. \n\n**Character**: With all that being said, he is kind of an annoying human. If he wasn't rich, wasn't good at engineering, wasn't changing the world, no one would like him personally. Mother of his children and x wife is all the character reference you need. \n\n**Interest Rates:** With the interest rate environment drastically different, and the TSLA bros starting to get underwater, his magic touch is wearing off. Just look at the TSLA chart YTD and try to feel positive about that. You can't. \n\n**Comps**: Kanye was the greatest rapper of all time. Trump was the greatest president of all time (not saying I agree, but some do). Elon is the greatest engineer of all time. No one really cares about their accomplishments if they don't comply with the social fabric of the new woke left America. It really doesn't matter about facts, only about feels. Not sure Elon gives people the good vibes he used to. Trump, Kanye, Elon are the three free speech musketeers - two out of these three are officially cancelled already. \n\n**Annoying**: Sink into twitter is a bitch move. It mocks the establishment, mocks the left. He threatens to fire 75% of the staff - even if they deserve it, this is a very \"non left\" thing to do. \n\n**Women**: He keeps impregnating women and then leaving them. Lefties don't like that. He impregnates his employees as well. I am sure there are some settlements out there he has made, or an abortion he paid for, just a matter of time until someone attacks him. \n\n**Anti-Vax Narative:** He is anti vax in some regard. He believes in science for sure, but isn't afraid to criticize WHO, Fauci, Biden, The Government, Big Pharma or other players on the left. \n\n**Capitalism is Bad Now:** He is anti worker, pro capitalist. Expects people to sleep in the factory, return to work, do his bidding or be unemployed. \n\n**Big Tech is Bad Now:** Both left and right hate \u201cbig tech\u201d - this is one of the only things that politicians agree on. Social media is bad, consumer privacy should be protected, tech companies shouldn't have more power than politicians. \n\n**Disrespects the Government:** He smokes weed on Joe Rohan with privileged defense contracts. This is just another disrespectful move to bite the hand that feeds him. He shits on Biden, Biden shits on him. Elon drops memes like he is 14 years old mocking the establishment, and he has a very large following - that makes him a target. \n\n**Indian Giver:** He demands the Gov pay for his starlink service for ukraine when the gov, nor ukraine, never asked him to save the day like that. You don't invite your friend to dinner, then complain and ask them to pay for it after the fact. Indian giving is a bitch move. \n\n**Conspiracy Theorist:** He promotes Russel Brands youtube channel. Sure MSM is total bullshit, but that doesn't make RB a source of truth. If you promote stuff like that, you are playing for the wrong team. The team that gets cancelled.  \n\n**\\[Redacted\\]:** His is king of \"that which can't be named here\" the bros are and their coins are not doing so hot right now. Powell actively wants them gone. The social media influencers who promoted these pump and dump coins are facing their time in court, Elon is the main dude pumping.\n\n**Not Green Enough:** The \"green\" left is starting to be alienated by Elon specifically. He is too rich, too successful, to capitalist. Lets not forget the cars themselves are not exactly \"green\" to produce and the whole idea of EVs being \"more green\" than ICE cars is a u argument that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. \n\n**Lack of Immunity:** He doesn't have \"founder control\" of TSLA. He actually can be removed, not saying he will or that he should, just stating it is possible. \n\n**False Promises:** He has a pending FSD lawsuit because - well, FSD is a complete lie. Its not even close and yet it is marketed AND SOLD as available. Many hundreds of thousands of people paid 10k for FSD, and it simply doesn't exist.  Where is the cyber truck? What is the deal with a robot 10 years behind Boston Dynamics and Honda? Bullet proof glass? Semi truck deliveries? Bigger than Apple and Aramco? \n\n**Free Speech:** The Twitter purchase removes the \"town square\" from the free speech arena. It is now private speech, controlled by one individual. It's also a huge distraction to his more meaningful missions at SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co etc - this alienates his investors and bankers across the \"real\" companies as he spends his time fixing the dumpster fires at a shit company.  \n\nI had another post on [TSLA as a stock losing its growth trajectory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and I recommended [everyone sell calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which everyone criticized but turned into gains for me. \n\nI have a Tesla, its a great car. I have starlink. I want people to go to Mars. Personally, I fully support Elon and couldn't care less what type of \"person\" he is - but that is not the climate we are in today. \n\nWhat do you guys think the chances are of Elon being socially \"cancelled\" - or there at least being an attempt - in the next 12 months? Is his popularity and influence fading along with his market cap? Can Elon be cancelled?", "id": "yf2hmj", "created_utc": 1666902610.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|19|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|397|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8e6uy/tsla_just_killed_the_rally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ebhy/tsla_just_ended_the_rally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y470da/spy_last_three_days_explained/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xn2wn6/how_to_win_the_week_of_926/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xrtkjs/the_bull_case_for_oil/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla_time_to_sell_calls/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yf2hmj)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yf2hmj)\n    \n>TL;DR: Can Elon be cancelled?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30129581689834595}, {"body": "Lmao bro this is WSB not politics", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "I was trying to not be political, but pretty sure I failed", "score": -22, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cTrump was the greatest president of all time\u201d lmao", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Lord.

Plugging in the numbers for the appropriate fields would resolve that in order to achieve a Month over Month reduction would mean that the individual month of actual price increase by percentage for an annual resolution of PCE at 4.1% would be 4.1/12, which is 0.3416\u2026% Monthly.\n\nNow simply put, this means that the rate of change needed to resolve an annualized rate more than halved in the last month of change, and means not that the last month saw that much more compared to the previous month, but the difference of the annualized value to this negative move.  It is a massive reduction in the rate of change, and means that if we see 2 more months of this kind of negative change, more than halving thrice in a row, then we would see an effective zero percent PCE projection based solely on a month over month rate.\n\nIt probably would have been easier to just explain that the rate is annualized, but now you have the math, the formula to run it yourself in the future, and the source for the data to learn more on the topic if you so desire.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you good sir for this very detailed info!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Happy to share!  :)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2710108458995819}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.009397467598319054}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43207278847694397}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3255385458469391}], "tickers": ["gdp", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21025536954402924}, {"body": "Huh, are we actually getting that soft landing?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Probably not.

As more dev friendly competitors plug the hole and people move because they can get better apps on newer systems. It won't be immediate, but I definitely see it happening. If it doesn't then a lot of companies go under water and that's the end of any meaningful app growth. Advertising is the life blood of most of the phone application market. Or the alternative way it can go is the growth in subscription services similar to Youtube Premium. If they can't make money on ads they have to get it from somewhere. And if companies fail to be profitable enough without them, people will have little alternatives but to use them. This is why this point isn't really a reality in my mind. There's no benefit to Google here... Why risk everything to kill your content creators? This is like if YouTube or Twitch stopped sharing ad revenue with content creators, their market dominate positions would be over within a year. And they certainly aren't just going to do this only for Meta because I see that breaking more than a few laws.\n\nAnother small point let's assume they do, do this. Why do you think they are investing in A.I? So they can literally target ads so they don't have to track users. A.I using machine learning models trained on their over a decade of user data, across the multiple demographics they have on their platforms. Could easily be built to easily target ads for users without the use for tracking them because it's able to predict what users are interested in. Or quickly adapt the ads they see in real time based on starting on a wider range of ads, and quickly narrowing it down to the ones that are most likely to have an impression. Which justifies their CapEx on this even more.\n\nI don't think this is as doom and gloom as that post implies. But people seem to want Meta to fail so they find reasons for it to do just that.

As the stock price drops without deterioration in fundamentals, risk drops and potential reward increases. I'd argue META isn't showing any real deterioration in fundamentals (with the expectation of Apple's privacy change) and this drop is largely sentiment driven.\n\nMy theory about META is that the growth investors sold it earlier this year on slower future growth assumptions and this attracted a wave of value investors. The only problem is that value investors tend to whine when a company isn't 100% focused on profitability and now META is disappointing these investors too with their continued commitment to the Metaverse.\n\nThere's really no identifiable investor base for META at this point. If you're looking for growth it's not that attractive anymore. And if you're looking for value you don't want to own a company that's pursuing growth over profitability. The investors who might like it are those that share Zuck's vision on the future of AR/VR and those are basically no existent.\n\nThe way I'd look at META is that while they're not likely to grow like they did in the past, this is still the second largest digital ads player in the world and a company with more reach than any other company to the global consumer. If their DAUs and MAUs were dropping then I'd understand why investors were fleeing, but the core business is still really strong. This valuation decline is not reflective of a comparable decline in the core business but instead entirely driven by the sentiment of investors.\n\nI think there is huge upside risk to anyone bearish on this stock right now. Perhaps as much as 100% upside over the next 6 months. What we're seeing with META today is very similar to the situation with NFLX earlier this year. Growth investors fled at signs of slowing growth and then value investors jumped in and started crying about how much they were spending on content and that they didn't to compromise their product by introducing ads. The only difference here is that NFLX caved to the value investors while META didn't.\n\nIf META simply said they're done with the metaverse (which I don't think they should do) and that they're going to be returning as much profits to shareholders as possible I can almost guarantee that the stock would rally 100%.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Nice prediction lol", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13282904028892517}], "tickers": ["meta", "aapl", "nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "META is the new Nokia.
