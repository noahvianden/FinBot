In the latest sign of trouble, After years of record capital spending, chipmakers are warning on a weekly basis that demand is sputtering. In the latest sign of trouble, Samsung Electronics Co. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported disappointing results within hours of each other that widely missed projections.\n\nSamsung -- the world\u2019s largest memory chipmaker -- reported a 32% dive in operating income, while PC-processor maker AMD said it will miss its earlier forecast by about $1 billion. Analysts\u2019 reactions ranged from \u201cbreathtaking\u201d to \u201cUff-da!\u201d\n\nThose numbers followed grim comments from memory makers Micron Technologies Inc. and Kioxia Holdings Corp., which are slashing spending and output in a bid to stabilize plummeting prices. AMD shares fell in premarket trading, along with chipmakers including Nvidia Corp. and Intel Corp. Chip gear suppliers such as ASML Holding NV and PC makers including Lenovo Group Ltd. also dropped. Japan\u2019s Disco Corp., whose equipment grinds, polishes and dices chips, lost the most in more than two years Friday.\n\nThis forum still loves tech stocks and resists any idea that we should be looking for ideas in other sectors.

I personally find MSFT disappointing when you go through the numbers and is overvalued by my estimates.\n\nI own both GOOGL and MSFT", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["googl", "msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Down short-term, definitely up long term.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06761537492275238}, {"body": "The stock market exists in a quantum superposition, fluctuating infinitely between positions of collapse and record gains. No one knows what will happen for sure. Even an educated guess is still a guess.\n\nWe can use some of the data available to us and our own experience to make what on paper is a smart move, only to have it blow up in our faces.\n\nMy only advice to you is to do these things:\n1. Don\u2019t invest money you can\u2019t be without.\n2. Educate yourself on stock terms and stock history.\n3. Distance your emotions from money. That\u2019s not to say don\u2019t have ethics. I won\u2019t directly invest in oil, meat, or dairy for example \u2014 even though there\u2019s a lot of money to be made in those industries. But don\u2019t think with your fears and don\u2019t mourn lost dollars.\n4. Decide what kind of investor you want to be. I am a bear. I make incremental, strategic investments. It\u2019s rare that I put most of my chips in one stock. I don\u2019t do options and try to avoid dark pool firms. I play it on the straight and narrow. I think about what\u2019s going to be taxed from my gains as much as the gains themselves. That works out for me. Over seven years, I\u2019ve grown a portfolio of 5k up to 250k, then used 150k on a down payment for a house 3 years ago. Used another 75k on other needed expenses (new car, house remodels, etc). The remaining 75k now swings in this wild market between 150-170k over the past 3 years. I mostly invest in tech and tech-related manufacturing. This is what works for me and I don\u2019t see myself changing my strategy any time soon.\n5. Learn from every mistake you make and, if you can, try to see the positive. Example: I lost about 15k to weed stocks as a bag holder. I sold two weeks ago and accepted the loss. Recently, Biden signaled steps toward legalizing weed. Weed stocks rallied just after I sold. They\u2019re still down like 70% overall but if I had held out just another two weeks, my loss would be ~10k not 15k. BUT since they are losses, I get a little tax break. Not much, but I count the blessings.\n6. Lastly, and most importantly, do not sacrifice your mental health for any of this. It\u2019s great to use your money to make more money but if it\u2019s too anxiety-inducing, don\u2019t \u201cmanually\u201d invest in the market. Instead, throw your money into an IRA or 401k or something more automatic.\n\nSide note: I was able to grow my portfolio so high mostly due to luck and understanding my personal finances to not spend money on extravagant things, mostly necessities. No lambo for me. But I actually got my 5k because I invested 1k in Netflix and Tesla when they are both at around $35. I think that was 9ish years ago? Well they blew up and split and I cashed out and made the mistake of incurring a lot of short term capital gains\u2026but I then sank that into Apple, Google, and Amazon and just let it sit for five years.

{"title": "Not Great, Not Terrible: Why I Valued Meta at $420 Billion", "selftext": "Here's where I pretend to do something useful in my life: [https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/not-great-not-terrible-why-i-valued](https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/not-great-not-terrible-why-i-valued)\n\n[META 0.14%\u2191](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/META) will have trouble returning to the high growth it enjoyed in the past, partly because of the economic slowdown but also because it has already settled-in its key market segments. While I envision a period of stagnating growth for the company, it is the profitability of the business that makes the investment attractive.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s future prospects, future profitability estimates, and the current price of risk, I estimated the intrinsic value of Facebook at $420b or $156 per share, with a 1-year price target at $171 per share, implying a 23% upside.\n\n[**Feel free to download and edit the whole model yourself.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[NYSE:META Estimated Intrinsic Value at $420 billion, 7th October 2022](https://preview.redd.it/6k7rj0w95ds91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=74771c99df0f83babbe08066ec4fd1c6a67992cc)\n\n## The Metaverse is Coming, Later\n\nMeta made a possibly rushed bet on the metaverse while getting slightly carried away in its peer campaign to offset public and regular attention from their business practices.\n\nStaking the company on a big promise such as the metaverse isn\u2019t a bad tactic to \u201cget it done\u201d, but it will likely require more time and effort than anyone has initially estimated. This strategy is in contrast to [GOOGL 0.19%\u2191](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL)\u2019s approach where they have a diverse product portfolio, but end up discontinuing projects as no key executive has the steel to stake their reputation on them.\n\n### Reinvesting Into the Business\n\nMeta estimated a CapEx spend of [around $32b](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Meta-06.30.2022-Exhibit-99.1-Final.pdf) in 2022, but seems to be quietly trimming spending on headcount and likely internally freezing projects. In the future, I expect Meta to lower the focus on the metaverse project, and move to improving key advertising features of its platform (\\*cough\\* that buggy mess), providing new content creation features, and incentives for people and professionals to create content.\n\n### More or Better Content\n\nAs a maturing tech business, I believe that the company will have to reinvest more into existing features to make them fun (not engaging), and profitable for people.\n\nRegarding content creation, I imagine the business will engage in something like the following projects:\n\n* Hybrid-AI programs - content created by [AI](https://beta.openai.com/), but enriched by a content creator.\n* AI program - short AI created content snips.\n* Engaging in contractor services - reinvesting in strategic content creation, such as high search volume content, content for groups and assistance, etc.\n\n## Valuation\n\nI expect a slowdown of revenue growth in the coming year with a growth of 2% in 2023 and 7% in the 4 years thereafter, with a decay function converging to the riskfree rate at year 10.\n\nAs a maturing company, I expect Meta to start slightly declining in profitability and allocating more resources to improving the quality of existing features, this may result in a future adjusted EBIT margin of 28% down from the adj. EBIT margin of 47.5% in the last 12 months. I adjust EBIT by capitalizing R&D, as this is a key investment for a tech company like Meta. The cost of capital used at the start of the valuation is 9.75%.\n\n[Finally, here is the resulting model for Meta:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660)\n\n[NASDAQ:META Future Valuation Estimates, 7th October 2022](https://preview.redd.it/81628jbf5ds91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=75af983a315f2e5b36c2e516c48e936f2d5f4be0)\n\nHere is the table if you want to dig into the details:\n\n[NASDAQ:META Valuation Table, 7th October 2022](https://preview.redd.it/i88xxjzh5ds91.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=1119f6a004da3815047985cd408a50297b4b489b)\n\nYou can use this general model to fine-tune your view of the company\u2019s future, as well as an explainer of why the market price has dropped for Facebook.\n\n### Risks\n\nMeta\u2019s key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. YouTube may become more engaging with its \u201cshorts\u201d feature, and the platform is set up to produce more costly content via its revenue sharing program with creators. This is opposed to Meta, which produces \u201ccheaper\u201d content that can only be monetized by advertisers and influencers, while people have little incentive to be creative on the platform. This may slowly shift the platform to a low-value content aggregator. *Think about it, which of your favorite figures are on Meta, and how many are there exclusively?*\n\nMeta\u2019s decision-making hierarchy seems to be structured top-down. While this allows for efficient execution of projects, the trade-off is that the administration is deaf to consumer feedback.\n\nThe metaverse project may be a large cash drain for investors, and nobody has the power to say \u201cno\u201d to the voting rights of the CEO. The best investors can do is leave - like Peter Theil, and that is a weak feedback mechanism which is starting to show its downside.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe market seems to be pricing the company at or even slightly below intrinsic value.\n\nMeta will have a rough period ahead, but can create additional value if it balances the business between focusing on internal quality and returning capital to investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtxo2nxk5ds91.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=f700abffa3dc5d8aa851c2672aafb9f8506c6a38\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**Drop a TICKER in the comments, and I'll send you a spreadsheet you can tinker with.**\n\nWithin the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660), there are a few things that can help you in your analysis:\n\n* Check out the competitor dashboard, that tells you where Meta ranks amongst key peers. You can also find your next research candidates there. I would move to [GOOGL 0.19%\u2191](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL) next, as a higher quality stock.\n* If you are thinking of Meta in terms of trading, try the market sentiment analysis. This can help you better assess the short-term market disposition towards the stock.\n* Intrinsic analysis isn\u2019t always the best option, so try comparing it with the multiple analysis in the sheet. Pay attention to the implied EV/Sales ratio, which is based on a regression model that tries to find out if the market is underpricing the stock.

Facebook's bread and butter does not have a HUGE overlap with LinkedIn. Two completely different platforms that cater to different segments.  \n\n\nI would wager that the biggest threats to Facebook are YouTube, TikTok, and Amazon.  \n\n\nParticularly Tiktok and Amazon.  \n\n\nFacebook has co-existed with YouTube advertising for a long time, but TikTok is projected to capture [$12 billion in advertising spend](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-23/tiktok-becomes-cash-machine-with-revenue-tripling-to-12-billion).  \n\n\nSimilarly, [Amazon has captured $32 billion in ad revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/amazon-has-a-31-billion-a-year-advertising-business.html).  \n\n\nThe reason for why I believe Amazon and Tiktok are greater threats to META is the following:  \n\n\nA very big part of the advertisers on META are e-commerce brands. The same audience that is attractive to e-commerce advertisers is the same audience that would be targeted by TikTok & Amazon.  \n\n\nFor example:  \n\n\nIf I am a service-focused local advertiser (home remodelers, junk yards, plumbers, etc...) - Google is going to be my bread and butter. Although I don't have any insight, having worked in digital advertising for a long time, I can tell you that what these local service businesses make on Google would be hard to beat elsewhere.  \n\n\nI don't imagine that Facebook has ever done well in this sector and never would have.  \n\n\nThe reason being that if a plumber targets you with an ad on Facebook but nothing in your house is broken, then you're simply not going to convert. On the other hand, if something in your house DOES break, your almost immediate reaction is to go to Google and look up a plumber. And that's where Google excels, and always has.  \n\n\nAnd what are the chances that an ad on Facebook reaches you the immediate second that something breaks? Or that you remember that a month ago you had seen an ad on Facebook for a plumbing service?  \n\n\nFacebook's bread and butter are consumer brands. And these same consumer brands are the ones who are most likely to go to TikTok to reach those audiences. Why is my guess for why YouTube is pushing Shorts, and META is pushing Reels.  \n\n\nThey don't want to lose that specific audience segment.  \n\n\nSimilarly, if Amazon can improve their advertising algorithms enough so that sellers on its platforms can see greater returns on investment, that proves a very strong challenge to Facebook who would see diminished advertising on its platform from Amazon sellers.  \n\n\nThe growth and effectiveness on YouTube, TikTok, and Amazon are then what I believe to be the biggest threats to META's ad revenue.  \n\n\nI agree that META should have long diversified more (Alphabet makes 80% of its revenue from online advertising vs. META's 99%) but that's a different topic.  \n\n\nThe reason why I believe people should focus more on META's future as a go-to platform for online advertising is because the online advertising market is expected to grow to $1 trillion dollars in size by 2027, compared to $500 billion (roughly) as it is today.  \n\n\nIf META can continue to capture at least 20% of the total market, that would put its revenue at around $200 billion in the next 5 years.  \n\n\nBut this would be imagining that the company does NOTHING but try to keep up which I don't think is true of the platform, overall. The META execs are not silly and I would imagine their revenue figures would exceed $200 billion before 2027, which would make it significantly more valuable than \\~ $150's per share.  \n\n\nForgive any misspellings, I rushed through this", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Man thanks for the productive comment, loved reading it.

The unemployment rate exaggerates the number of those employed who are a fraction of those who are not receiving unemployment benefits, many of whom have stopped looking for work or whose unemployment benefits have expired.  A low unemployment rate does not equate to a high employment rate.\n\nThe cause of the inflation is that too many trillions of dollars were lent out by the Fed to the erstwhile failing banks and brokerages in 2008 and 2020, to be lent to the erstwhile failing businesses and homeowners who had borrowed from the banks.  These lent out monies finally found their way to Main Street like a flood which if not forced back, will take away everything that sits on the shelves or showroom floors, and eventually warehouses and oil reserves too.  \n\nThe Fed has 2 ways to drain off the flood of fiat currency it created out of thin air - by selling the bonds it had purchased with the dollars it created (QT) and by raising the interest rate.  With inflation rate at 8.3%, the flood water is about 6 inches deep, but it is found everywhere, on every street.  Homes not built on elevated grounds are flooding in their living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and garages.  This excess water used to be collected by the swamps, lakes and rivers, behind dams, eg stocks, real estate and cryptocurrencies.  Now they are breaking, and when their investors begin selling at the same time, it is the equivalent of several dams breaking and dikes overflowing.  Add to this the loss of agricultural and industrial production, and the carnage of looting, war and epidemics, if the Fed does not do a \"Volcker\" ASAP what would ensue would be a global economic and political Super Katrina on steroids.  This is the real price of the 9 Trillion dollar free lunch showered on the economy by the Fed since 2008, equivalent to a 10% interest compounded annually for 25 years that must be paid back in full, principal plus interest.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Lololol the money found it's way to main street.
