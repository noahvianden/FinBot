{"title": "What are your stock picks when the market eventually turns around?", "selftext": "When the market turns around is anyone's guess. If I had to speculate I say we have a slight bounce in the coming weeks. I say this because it is common knowledge that October-January are the best months in the stock market if you look at history. Likewise, after the midterms in the second year of a president's term we tend to do well in the stock market. The reasoning behind this is because the stock market likes to have certainty on what policies will be approved or denied in the future. Will I be buying during this false bounce? Yes, I will be buying up a little into TQQQ to swing trade over the course of a few days here and there, selling once I make a 12% gain in under 4 days. \n\nNow for the meat and potatoes. What will you be buying up when the news eventually comes out that we are no longer having severe inflation problems? The perfect scenario would be Jerome Powell announces \"we are no longer going to remain hawkish, inflation is now under control ...\" and the rest will be history. Here is a breakdown of my portfolio picks when that day comes, which remember could be in a few months or in 2024, hell it could even be in 2026 for all I know. Right now my portfolio is about 95% cash. I will breakdown and explain each of these holdings: \n\n25% of portfolio will be in VOO - VOO is the lazy, set it and forget it ETF. It is not only great for long term growth, it also pays a nice dividend yield of 1.77%. \n\n20% of portfolio will be in SCHD - this is another good ETF that is good for growth and has an excellent 3.73%. \n\n10% of portfolio will be in GOOG - It's google, need I say more? \n\n10% of portfolio will be in TSLA - It's Tesla. They are the future. \n\n8% of portfolio will be in METV - This is a Metaverse ETF. \n\n8% of portfolio will be in SOFI - The future of banking. Millenials and Gen Z love this company. \n\n7% of portfolio will be in TQQQ at the start of the rally, and will be swung trade every few days to make a profit. \n\n2% of portfolio will be in CCL - I see Carnival Corporation doing well long term. In fact I almost want to buy and hold some after this recent sell off a few days ago. \n\n10% of portfolio will be in cash to do swing trading.", "id": "xt9irc", "created_utc": 1664667184.0, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "WTS- watts water.
