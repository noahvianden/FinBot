It is FCF negative and can only prop up their dividend via their deal with $BAM taking an ownership stake in their AZ fab complex.  From a business standpoint alone... this is an incredibly bad deal.  The only positive is that it prevents their cash balance from being completely drained and saved their dividend.  \n\nMeanwhile their two biggest opponents are AMD and TSMC.\n\nAMD even with their shitty quarter/guidance is FCF positive and earnings positive.  I don't think people appreciate that the complete destruction of the PC segment is at hand and yet AMD almost pulled more revenue this quarter than their entire 2020.  \n\nMeanwhile the data center is where AMD continues to steal marketshare for Intel and this is only going to accelerate over the next year as Sapphire Rapids was pushed back AGAIN to late next year.  This gives AMD a six month headstart for the most powerful and most efficient data center CPUs in a time where data center spend is holding up the chip sector.  \n\nNext their is TSMC.  TSMC is about to report (this Thursday) record revenue and earnings.  Their gross margins are higher than Intel's.  \n\nIn fact, this is important because every time I see an Intel thread I see one argument that Intel bulls make that is absolutely wrong - BUT THEY MAKE THEIR OWN CHIPS.\n\nNO THEY DO NOT.  Intel has no leading edge production capacity in high volume manufacturing.   Their most recent releases are all dependant on TSMC-fabbed dies (die is a piece of silicon).  It is why Intel's gross margins have been taking a shit all year long as they are now dependent on TSMC manufacturing and will be until 2025.\n\nIf you are a value investor looking at PE, both TSMC and QCOM are lower forward PE.  AMD is actively buying back stock.  \n\nIf you are a long term investor then take heart at this - long term I think Intel will fix their culture problems and return to their powerhouse status.  This won't even start until 2025 when their new fabs come online.

I shipped the phone and then a couple weeks later PayPal says it account was stolen and charge is being denied. They said I was having to pay back the money. I appealed and told them that\u2019s your problem, not mine.. you said address was verified and everything. Thank god I required a signature for the package to show I had actually sent something because I was able to use this as part of my appeal. It took over a month for them to finally accept my appeal. \n\nI move on, then 3-6 months later they hit me up again basically saying I was at fault but because I\u2019m a valued customer they\u2019re not going to take the money back, but don\u2019t let it happen again. \n\nDon\u2019t worry\u2026 can\u2019t happen again if I never use your shit service again.  \n\nPaypal is on a fast track to nowhere.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "That's some mafia shit.

The demand for oil is still increasing and there will be a decrease in supply of 4 to 6 million barrels a day in the next couple of months which will put massive upward pressure on oil prices.  \n\nUS and China are both releasing 1 million barrels per day from their SPR, that has to stop sooner or latter, November after the election for the US. When China stops the zero covid policy and shutting down their cities, that is an additional 1 to 2 million barrels per day of demand. This winter, Russian supply of oil drops by 1 to 2 million barrels per day because they can't produce oil in Siberia in the winter without western oilfield service companies that all pulled out of Russia.  \n\nSolar and wind energy are not capable of supplying the world with energy. They are a waste of time and a distraction. They don't produce enough energy to justify mining the minerals required to build them. It is a feel good story being sold to people that are paying zero attention to reality.  \n\nThe only answer that works long term is nuclear energy and in the short run it is oil, coal and nat gas. 18% of world energy is used as electricity and 82% is from direct combustion of hydrocarbons. Of the 18% of world energy that is used as electricity, the majority of the electricity is generated using hydrocarbons.
