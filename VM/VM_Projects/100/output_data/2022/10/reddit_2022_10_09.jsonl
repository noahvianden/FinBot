It is FCF negative and can only prop up their dividend via their deal with $BAM taking an ownership stake in their AZ fab complex.  From a business standpoint alone... this is an incredibly bad deal.  The only positive is that it prevents their cash balance from being completely drained and saved their dividend.  \n\nMeanwhile their two biggest opponents are AMD and TSMC.\n\nAMD even with their shitty quarter/guidance is FCF positive and earnings positive.  I don't think people appreciate that the complete destruction of the PC segment is at hand and yet AMD almost pulled more revenue this quarter than their entire 2020.  \n\nMeanwhile the data center is where AMD continues to steal marketshare for Intel and this is only going to accelerate over the next year as Sapphire Rapids was pushed back AGAIN to late next year.  This gives AMD a six month headstart for the most powerful and most efficient data center CPUs in a time where data center spend is holding up the chip sector.  \n\nNext their is TSMC.  TSMC is about to report (this Thursday) record revenue and earnings.  Their gross margins are higher than Intel's.  \n\nIn fact, this is important because every time I see an Intel thread I see one argument that Intel bulls make that is absolutely wrong - BUT THEY MAKE THEIR OWN CHIPS.\n\nNO THEY DO NOT.  Intel has no leading edge production capacity in high volume manufacturing.   Their most recent releases are all dependant on TSMC-fabbed dies (die is a piece of silicon).  It is why Intel's gross margins have been taking a shit all year long as they are now dependent on TSMC manufacturing and will be until 2025.\n\nIf you are a value investor looking at PE, both TSMC and QCOM are lower forward PE.  AMD is actively buying back stock.  \n\nIf you are a long term investor then take heart at this - long term I think Intel will fix their culture problems and return to their powerhouse status.  This won't even start until 2025 when their new fabs come online.
