{"title": "Duolingo stock analysis and valuation - A company that I love", "selftext": "This week's casual valuation is Duolingo, a company that's very close to my heart offering a great language learning experience that is universally available. I am a huge proponent of free knowledge and I try to contribute to that as much as I can. All of these posts that I share weekly are free (and will continue to be that way). I strongly believe knowledge should be easily accessible to everyone.\n\nThe post will be divided into a few segments:\n\n1. Understanding the business\n2. Understanding the historical financial performance\n3. Laying down some assumptions to value the company\n4. Valuing the company based on assumptions significantly different than mine\n\n**What is Duolingo?**\n\nIt's a technology company that wants to develop the best education in the world. At the moment, a more accurate description would be that it is a gamified language-learning platform offering over 40 different languages. What will come next, is to be seen. We could see mathematics, physics, and a lot more diversified content in the future.\n\nAs for the language-learning part, they are not alone in this field. There are plenty of ways to learn a new language, starting from YouTube, attending formal classes with tutors, to reading books and other similar apps. So, how is Duolingo different?\n\nIt's more personalized and provides a different and more fun user experience that guides the user through this journey. The user is not only engaged but also gets instant feedback. As a user, whether you've got it right or wrong, you are aware of it and can take action.\n\nAs a company, it has a significant amount of data that it can use to test and figure out what works and why. Similarly, the data can be used to understand what mistakes are most often made and help the users overcome these mistakes.\n\nSo, how does it make money? There are 4 different revenue sources:\n\n\\- Subscription (74%) - Those users that would like an ad-free experience can subscribe to their platform and get other features as well. This is by far their largest revenue source\n\n\\- Advertising (15%) - Users that cannot afford or aren't willing to pay for the content watch advertisements. They do not pay money, but they do pay with their time. Duolingo is monetizing these users as well which is great. Dropbox has a ton of free users as well, however, they don't earn anything from them as there are no ads. In addition, they need to pay for the storage, so the free users that Dropbox has, are destroying value over time.\n\n\\- DET (9%) - It stands for Duolingo English Tests - an English proficiency assessment and it is their fastest growing segment at this moment. This is being more and more accepted by universities, but also can be used as part of a resume/CV for those who would like to show their proficiency. In addition, it costs roughly 1/4 of what their competitors charge.\n\n\\- In-app purchases (2%) - related to additional features such as streak freeze/repairs, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn each of these segments, Duolingo has growth plans. In the end, it all comes down to:\n\n\\- Getting more users\n\n\\- Converting more users from free to paid\n\n\\- Increasing the lifetime value of the subscribers (by keeping them subscribed for a longer period of time)\n\n\\- Expand adoption of DET\n\n\\- Extend the platform beyond language learning\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical financial performance**\n\nSo, how well did they do until now?\n\nThe # of monthly active users grew from **27.3m** back in 2019 to **49.5m** as of June 30th, 2022.\n\nThe # of daily active users grew from **5.2m** to **13.2m** for the same period.\n\nThe # of paid users grew from **0.9m** to **3.3m**.\n\nTheir penetration rate (Paid users / monthly active users) increased from **3.3%** to **6.7%**!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis growth reflects in their financials, as the revenue grew from $71m in 2019 to $306m for the last twelve months (\"LTM\") ending June 30th, 2022. The LTM revenue is still roughly 10% of their market cap.\n\nTheir gross margin grew from 71% to 73% during this period, but isn't sufficient yet to cover all the other operating expenses:\n\n\\- Research & Development (was **45%** of revenue back in 2019 --> **40%** LTM)\n\n\\- Sales & Marketing (was **21%** of revenue back in 2019 --> **20%** LTM)\n\n\\- General & Administrative (was **23%** back in 2019 --> **37%** LTM)\n\nIt is clear that the company isn't profitable, but the general & administrative seems too high. That's mainly due to IPO-related expenses. It will decrease as % of revenue in the coming period.\n\nAs they are working on diversifying content away from languages, they are pouring a lot of money into R&D. All of the expenses are expected to decrease significantly over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The balance sheet**\n\nAs it is a technology company, there isn't really much on the balance sheet. Almost 85% of their entire balance sheet ($591m / $701m) represents the cash that they own.\n\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, there isn't much to discuss, except the unearned revenue of $128m. This represents the cash that Duolingo has received from users that have paid in advance for using the platform in the future. For example, if someone purchases an annual plan today, Duolingo will get the cash today, but the service will be provided over the next 12 months. Hence, the company does not recognize the revenue today, but over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Assumptions about the future & valuation**\n\nMy assumptions:\n\n**- Revenue growth** of 25% for the next 5 years, then declining to 10% by year 10 and then to 4% afterward (same as the risk-free rate).\n\n**- Operating margin** of -20% for the next year, improving to -5% in year 5 and ultimately to 25%.\n\n**- A discount rate of 12.92%** (WACC-based), decreasing to 11.31% over time (assuming the company becomes more mature and hence, less risky)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are two classes of share, each one with a different number of voting rights. Since this has an impact on the control of the company coming from owning these shares, I've applied a 15% discount for lack of control.\n\nBased on these assumptions, the fair value is $1,5b **($37.45/share)**\n\nThe current market cap is $3,1b ($78.31/share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, out of the $1,5b, only $72m is due to the present value of the cash flows in the next 10 years! The majority is based on the value that the company generates afterward as a stable, mature, profitable company with more users and diversified content.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 539% to $2b in 10 years and the operating margin will be 25%.\n\nI am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|350% ($1,4b)|$20.5|$26.0|$31.1|\n|539% ($2,0b)|$29.7|$37.5|$44.7|\n|650% ($2,3b)|$35.1|$44.1|$52.6|\n|1000% ($3,4b)|$51.9|$65.2|$77.0|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe table illustrates how much the company needs to grow and how high should the operating margin be so that it is fairly valued today.\n\nPersonally, I love everything about the company, except the price. It has a great mission, the management team is doing a good job, it is the best platform out there that I know of, and the users are engaged.\n\nI am definitely excited about its future and I would love to have it in my portfolio one day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts about Duolingo and its valuation?", "id": "y5hlal", "created_utc": 1665928944.0, "score": 228, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "Big upside.
