IMO there are completely legitamite reasons to be either bullish or bearish on my company's stock, but the majority of comments I've read from people about why they've chosen a certain stance make absolutely no sense. Like they make it clear they don't understand how the company makes money, who their customers are, what products they have & how important each one is to the company's bottom line... Every once in a while I see a comment from someone that actually does seem to know what they're talking about (both bear and bull theses) but honestly it's rare. I don't want to get too specific but I've seen tons of comments that to me basically make as much as sense as someone saying something like \"Google's search results have gotten worse lately so they're going under, Yahoo will probably just acquire them anyway.\"\n\nTo anyone else out there that browses this sub and sees their company pop up in discussion threads - do you generally agree or disagree with what people are saying about your company's stock?", "id": "xuuev8", "created_utc": 1664828703.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Nothing crushes your expectations of redditors abilities than when they start discussing something you have first hand experience in.", "score": 341, "replies": [{"body": "Not in this realm but absolutely, i have intimate knowledge of something and was getting crushed with downvotes because some idiot **sounded** like they knew what they're talking about.
