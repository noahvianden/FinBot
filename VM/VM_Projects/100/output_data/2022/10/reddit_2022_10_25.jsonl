{"title": "Strategist David Rosenberg skewers the Federal Reserve as he sees a 30% hit to home prices and the S&P 500 returning to an early 2020 low", "selftext": "The last time David Rosenberg shared his outlook for the U.S. stock market and the economy with MarketWatch, in late May, it was depressing enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cI feel like I am reliving the summer of 2008,\u201d Rosenberg wrote then. He speculated that the S&P 500 SPX, +1.19% \u2014 then trading above 3,900 points \u2014 would ultimately flirt with 3,300.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRosenberg is the widely followed president and chief economist and strategist of Toronto-based Rosenberg Research & Associates Inc. His sobering outlook last May echoed his thinking from March 2022, when he called the Federal Reserve\u2019s intention to hike U.S. interest rates \u201cnot a good idea\u201d and predicted that the inflation-fighting move would trigger a painful economic recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFive rate hikes later, with more expected, Rosenberg is even more pessimistic about the stock market and the economy in 2023 \u2014 and to say he\u2019s disappointed with the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell would put it mildly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s job is to take the punch bowl away as the party gets started, but this version of the Fed took the punch bowl away at 4 a.m.,\u201d Rosenberg said, \u201cwhen everybody was pissed drunk.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany market experts and economists are now coming to Rosenberg\u2019s side of the fence \u2014 criticizing the Fed for waiting too long to battle inflation and warning that the central bank now may be moving too fast and too far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut Rosenberg is leaning even further over the railing. Here\u2019s what he says investors, homeowners and workers can expect in the year ahead: The S&P 500 tumbles to as low as 2,700 (the lowest since April 2020), U.S. home prices decline by 30%, and the unemployment rate rises. The U.S. economy sinks into a recession, for which the Fed \u2014 especially Powell \u2014 would be largely to blame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cHe went from Bambi to Godzilla,\u201d Rosenberg says of Powell\u2019s radical and rapid transformation from inflation skeptic to inflation slayer. Adds Rosenberg: \u201cPowell was getting compared to \\[disgraced 1970s Fed Chair\\] Arthur Burns. Nobody in central banking wants to be compared to Arthur Burns. This is the reality.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReality admittedly isn\u2019t something the financial markets have had much of a grip on in the past several years, with essentially free money and a hands-off Fed fueling a go-go investing climate. \u201cNow that movie is running in reverse,\u201d Rosenberg says, and the reality here is that the next scenes will be tough ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut since markets are cyclical, the Fed\u2019s flushing inflation and dumping the punch bowl should lead to a new bull market for stocks, bonds and other risk assets, Rosenberg says. He sees this fresh start beginning in 2024, so don\u2019t despair \u2014 that\u2019s less than 15 months away.\n\nIn this mid-October interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Rosenberg discussed the challenging conditions investors face now and offered his top ideas for their money over the next 12 months \u2014 including Treasury bonds, stock sectors that can profit from longer-term business trends and technology themes, and good old-fashioned cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarketWatch: You\u2019ve been skeptical of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate hikes since they began last March. But it seems that your skepticism has morphed into a kind of disbelief. What is the Fed doing now that is so unprecedented?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRosenberg: The Fed is ignoring market signals and chasing lagging indicators like the year-over-year in the CPI and the unemployment rate. I\u2019ve never seen the Fed at any point before this version totally dismiss what\u2019s happening on the supply side of the economy and totally ignore what\u2019s happening from market signals. I\u2019ve never seen the Fed tighten this aggressively into a raging bull market for the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.18%. I\u2019ve never seen the Fed tighten this aggressively into a major decline, not just in the stock market but in the most economically sensitive stocks. I\u2019ve never seen the Fed tighten this aggressively into an inverted yield curve or into a bear market in commodities.", "id": "yct40k", "created_utc": 1666663532.0, "score": 214, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "Everyone that knows anything knows two things:\n\n1.

{"title": "Apple tightens its rules on crypto and NFTs. Any trading service of NFTs must use Apple\u2019s in-app payment mechanism where Apple gets 30% cut", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/apple-tightens-its-rules-on-crypto-and-nfts-in-its-app-store.html\n\nApple clarified its rules on cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) laying out what apps are allowed to do with these technologies. On crypto exchanges, Apple said in updated App Store rules on Monday, that apps may facilitate \u201ctransactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange.\u201d But the app can only be offered in countries or regions where it has licensing and permission to operate a crypto exchange. \u201cApps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality,\u201d such as cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency wallets. Apple has clarified the rules on NFTs, which can be a digital representation of a real-life asset such as artwork and are usually purchased using cryptocurrency. The guidelines say apps may use in-app purchases to sell NFTs and sell services related to them, such as minting, listing, and the transferring of these tokens. Apps can also allow users to browse NFT collections owned by others so long as the apps do \u201cnot include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\u201d\n\nAll of this means that any sort of trading service for NFTs must use Apple\u2019s in-app payment mechanism. Apple takes an up to 30% cut of in-app payments. While this does not ban NFTs in any way, it does put a major restriction on the kind of services that can be offered involving NFTs, given the 30% slice Apple takes. Apple\u2019s 30% cut has long been criticized by app makers who accuse the technology giant of running a monopoly over in-app purchases. Apple argues that control over the App Store allows it to ensure the security of apps and payments. It has also said that the App Store has birthed a successful app ecosystem allowing developers to make money.", "id": "yd4rdd", "created_utc": 1666704267.0, "score": 290, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m looking for serious clarification on this.
