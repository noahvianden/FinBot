I invested in a small company with a great product and huge plans, but scaling up production is difficult and when it didn't work out, the stock dropped 90%. Likewise, there are plenty of companies (*cough* GM *cough*) that are talking about their plans everyday, but not executing whatsoever and going bankrupt as a result. So the lesson here is that, unless a company has an amazing track record of executing on plans, look at what they're doing, not what they say they will do.\n* Unlike what people say around here, diversifying by owning more stocks is not safer.

The policy was originally slated to go into effect on November 3.\n\nBut the updated policy created a firestorm on social media over the weekend, with several former PayPal employees weighing in and criticizing the policy, including PayPal co-founder Elon Musk.\n\nFormer president of PayPal David Marcus tweeted, \"It's hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to. But Paypal's new AUP goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with. Insanity.\"\n\nPayPal immediately rolled back its policy update to exclude the new misinformation policy. The company told media outlets: \"PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and the language was never intended to be inserted into our policy.\" The payments platform said the policy update \"went out in error that included incorrect information.\"\n\nSource: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/paypal-stock-price-blowback-misinformation-policy-2500-fine-error-musk-2022-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/paypal-stock-price-blowback-misinformation-policy-2500-fine-error-musk-2022-10)", "id": "y0gz4n", "created_utc": 1665414111.0, "score": 1313, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 348, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|42|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|43|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=y0gz4n)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=y0gz4n)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Whoops, sorry guys.
