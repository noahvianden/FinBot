These new factories as Elon puts it are money furnaces, yet they\u2019re already making cars profitably. Compare this to Nevada or even Shanghai and you can see tesla is learning fast. So when they do build another factory and ramp the 30k model, it will most likely be profitable rather fast.

They have been filing on average only about 300 applications a year, while others such as Ford, GM and Honda for instance file over 10-20 times as many applications (these are worldwide numbers, not just US).  \n\nA large patent portfolio is as much a defense as it is an offensive strategy.  Most companies just cross-license with each other and call it a day, but that's because they each have a sizable patent war chest.  Tesla isn't building this war chest, so either they'll end up paying some hefty licensing fees or risk being sued and having an injunction placed on one or more of their vehicles (this prevents that vehicle from being sold in that jurisdiction).  \n\nNow keep in mind a judge can grant an injunction while the infringement case is pending.  So just the threat of this can be used to essentially extort very nice licensing fees.  This type of tactic usually isn't used when both sides have similar patent war chest, as the other side will just counter sue, because it's highly likely that both sides are infringing on each other, and they just end up shaking hands and doing a cross-licensing deal.\n\nHowever Tesla can't enact such a strategy because it doesn't have an equal amount of patents to bring to the table to force a deal.  This makes them very vulnerable to infringement suits from all the other major auto and battery manufacturers.  Once other manufacturers have EV cars on the market it becomes a lot more lucrative to shut down Tesla this way.  \n\nThe risk of this happening is definitely not priced in.  The chance that other auto/battery manufacturers end up suing Tesla or forcing them into costly patent licenses is pretty high.

{"title": "Alphabet is not immune to the same fate as Meta.", "selftext": "Jeff Bezos once said \u201cTreat Google like a mountain. You can climb the mountain, but you can\u2019t move it.\u201d \n\nHe said this because of how powerful Google\u2019s moat was against its search engine competitors like Bing. His approach to Google\u2019s moat still holds true for the next 20+ years against other search engines. However indirectly the moat can be threatened without a competeting search engine because of a growing ad space industry. \n\nAllow me to illustrate how Meta got to where it is, and why it can parallel with Alphabet. \n\nMeta has competed against so many social media sites like Tumblr, Vine and today against Tiktok which arguably is the most threatening competitor today. It\u2019s managed to remain to the top social media company in the world with 3 billion users worldwide. It\u2019s likely to keep the number 1 position, yet suffer the biggest financial drawdown it\u2019s ever seen. \n\nRecently Meta has been threatened by the Apple iOS changes for user privacy, government regulation, and post 2021 the slowing demand for ad service. Probably the largest threat against Meta is itself for the pivot towards the Metaverse which is not clear if it can one done successfully. This all cultimated because its ad service business model is threatened by too many factors. \n\nIn comparison Alphabet has 4 billion users world wide for all its offered services. It\u2019s faces similar challenges to Meta for except the threat of Apple or itself. Despite this, Alphabet investors should consider that the fate of Meta is not immune for Alphabet and in the coming decades. Just like how Apple trounced 10 billion off of Meta\u2019s balance sheet, what if the government did the same in a larger scale for the US v. Google antitrust case. If Alphabet cannot win this case it sets a large precedent against the company and its industry handicapping its potential growth with tighter regulation.\n\nThat\u2019s not even the worst of it! We are in a new era of advertising where every company wants to expand into ad service. Walmart and Apple recently have expanded their ad services. With more companies being added on to this list like Amazon, and Tiktok. I am aware that Tiktok or Walmart is not directly a competitor to Alphabet but in reality it\u2019s becoming a threatening competitor as time will show. More companies can steal this market share with their services that retain user attention span and offer more efficient ad space. The Industry of ad service is stagnating revenue growth because its too competitive and it's affecting Meta equally as is Alphabet despite macroeconomic conditions. \n\nIt might be worth asking why would a company choose to advertise on Youtube or Google search if they know they can get more sales centralizing their advertisements on websites that have higher success for product sales. This could be for many reasons like they know their target audience is more reachable on XYZ website or app than a google search. Perhaps people are more likely to have an adblocker activated on a Youtube video over a top search result on a e-commerce website. \n\nIn the end Alphabet will likely be fine in the coming years. But do not think Google and Youtube is not too big to stagnate in this increasing competitive environment where everyone wants to become an ad service company. If it\u2019s threatening enough, you will see Alphabet pivot just like Meta did to keep it\u2019s company growing. This might mean sacrificing free cash flow.\n\nOver 80% of Google\u2019s revenue came from advertising where as Meta had over 90% revenue from advertising. Alphabet could be the next to pivot with its centralized advertising business model.\n\nEdit: People are not reading my post right. Im not saying Google will be extinct or obselete because some other tech will surpass it. What im saying is that Alphabet in the forseeable future might pivot like Meta did because its legacy apps were not sufficient in providing long term revenue growth. Google and Youtube could face this in its growing competitive market for ad space. Will Google die? No. Can it stagnate and grow less, yes.
