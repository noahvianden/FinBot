These new factories as Elon puts it are money furnaces, yet they\u2019re already making cars profitably. Compare this to Nevada or even Shanghai and you can see tesla is learning fast. So when they do build another factory and ramp the 30k model, it will most likely be profitable rather fast.

They have been filing on average only about 300 applications a year, while others such as Ford, GM and Honda for instance file over 10-20 times as many applications (these are worldwide numbers, not just US).  \n\nA large patent portfolio is as much a defense as it is an offensive strategy.  Most companies just cross-license with each other and call it a day, but that's because they each have a sizable patent war chest.  Tesla isn't building this war chest, so either they'll end up paying some hefty licensing fees or risk being sued and having an injunction placed on one or more of their vehicles (this prevents that vehicle from being sold in that jurisdiction).  \n\nNow keep in mind a judge can grant an injunction while the infringement case is pending.  So just the threat of this can be used to essentially extort very nice licensing fees.  This type of tactic usually isn't used when both sides have similar patent war chest, as the other side will just counter sue, because it's highly likely that both sides are infringing on each other, and they just end up shaking hands and doing a cross-licensing deal.\n\nHowever Tesla can't enact such a strategy because it doesn't have an equal amount of patents to bring to the table to force a deal.  This makes them very vulnerable to infringement suits from all the other major auto and battery manufacturers.  Once other manufacturers have EV cars on the market it becomes a lot more lucrative to shut down Tesla this way.  \n\nThe risk of this happening is definitely not priced in.  The chance that other auto/battery manufacturers end up suing Tesla or forcing them into costly patent licenses is pretty high.
