{"title": "Semiconductor route wipes out $240 Billion from chipmakers - TSMC drops 8.3% and Samsung and Tokyo Electron also declined.", "selftext": "Asia\u2019s top chip stocks tumbled Tuesday, ensnared in an escalating US-China tech race that has erased more than $240 billion from the sector\u2019s global market value.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker, plunged a record 8.3% while Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. also declined.  The selloff spread to the foreign-exchange market as investors tallied up the damage from the sweeping curbs the US is imposing on companies that conduct technology business with China.\n\nThe Biden administration measures erect barriers of entry to China\u2019s market by limiting the ability of US firms to sell equipment and tech to their Chinese counterparts. There are concerns that the restrictions could spread if Washington widens the initiative to include other countries, while questions also remain over the scope and final impact of the moves.\n\nThe US announced the export curbs Friday, and there have been suggestions that similar actions may be deployed in other countries to ensure international cooperation. The announcement spurred a two-day rout of over 9% in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index that saw it close Monday at its lowest level since November 2020. Markets in Korea, Japan and Taiwan were shut that day for holidays. \n\nThe US measures include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company. Washington also added more Chinese firms to a list of companies that it regards as \u201cunverified,\u201d which means US suppliers will face new hurdles in selling technologies to those entities.\u00a0\n\n \u201cIt is difficult to call a bottom on the performance of the chip sector,\u201d said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. \u201cThe big story is that the West is becoming profoundly more concerned about security around any form of technology. We see no reason to re-enter the sector for the moment despite the profound poor performance.\u201d\u00a0\n\nUS chip stocks were on track to decline for a third day, with Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. all down more than 1% before the bell. Chip-tool maker ASML Holding NV traded down 2.3% in Amsterdam, bringing three-day losses to more than 11%. \n\nFull Article:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/chip-stocks-fall-across-asia-as-japan-korea-return-from-holiday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/chip-stocks-fall-across-asia-as-japan-korea-return-from-holiday?srnd=premium-asia)\n\n***Buying opportunity or too early?

Mobileye does not contribute much in terms of earnings, but if they manage to sell it for 30bn that's 1/3 of their market cap, i.e. $8 per share of instant value whilst maintaining earnings.

{"title": "Intel Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs in Face of PC Slowdown", "selftext": "Intel Corp. is planning a major reduction in headcount, likely numbering in the thousands, to cut costs and cope with a sputtering personal-computer market, according to people with knowledge of the situation. \n\nThe layoffs will be announced as early as this month, with the company planning to make the move around the same time as its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 27, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The chipmaker had 113,700 employees as of July.\n\nSome divisions, including Intel\u2019s sales and marketing group, could see cuts affecting about 20% of staff, according to the people familiar with the situation.\n\nIntel is facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors, its main business, and has struggled to win back market share lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In July, the company warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than it previously expected. Analysts are predicting a third-quarter revenue drop of nearly 20%. And Intel\u2019s once-enviable margins have shriveled: They\u2019re about 15 percentage points narrower than historical numbers of around 60%. \n\nDuring its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes in its business to improve profits. \u201cWe are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022 and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time. \n\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs.\n\nIntel\u2019s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total. The company has made smaller cuts since then and shuttered several divisions, including its cellular modem and drone units. Like many companies in the technology industry, Intel also froze hiring earlier this year, when market conditions soured and fears of a recession grew.\n\nGelsinger took the helm at Intel last year and has been working to restore the company\u2019s reputation as a Silicon Valley legend. But even before the PC slump, it was an uphill fight. Intel lost its long-held technological edge, and its own executives acknowledge that the company\u2019s culture of innovation withered in recent years.\n\nNow a broader slump is adding to those challenges. Intel\u2019s PC, data center and artificial intelligence groups are contending with a tech spending slowdown, weighing on revenue and profit.\n\nPC sales tumbled 15% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc, and Lenovo Group Ltd., which use Intel\u2019s processors in their laptops and desktop PCs, all suffered steep declines.\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly awkward moment for Intel to be making cutbacks. The company lobbied heavily for a $52 billion chip-stimulus bill this year, vowing to expand its manufacturing in the US. Gelsinger is planning a building boom that includes bringing the world\u2019s biggest chipmaking hub to Ohio. \n\nAt the same time, the company is under intense pressure from investors to shore up its profits. The company\u2019s shares have fallen more than 50% in 2022, with a 20% plunge occurring in the last month alone.\n\nUS tensions with China also have clouded the chip industry\u2019s future. The Biden administration announced new export curbs on Friday, restricting what US technologies companies can sell to the Asian nation.\n\nDavid Zinsner, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, said after the company\u2019s latest quarterly report that \u201cthere are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar.\u201d The chipmaker expected to see restructuring charges in the third quarter, he said, signaling that cuts were looming.\n\nSome chipmakers, including Nvidia Corp. and Micron Technology Inc., have said they\u2019re steering clear of layoffs for now. But other tech companies, such as Oracle Corp. and Arm Ltd., have already been cutting jobs.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/intel-is-planning-thousands-of-job-cuts-in-face-of-pc-slowdown#:~:text=Intel%20Corp.%20is%20planning%20a,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20situation", "id": "y1mjl7", "created_utc": 1665527599.0, "score": 483, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "So what I thought would be a temporary bagholding turned out to be permanent", "score": 310, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 68, "replies": [{"body": "Hyper threading for twice as many loses!", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "F12?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07718314230442047}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05850546434521675}, {"body": "Have you tried clearing the cache?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12579800188541412}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10751452296972275}, {"body": "I mean, if you look at it this way....

Ended the day holding SPY 362c and GME 24.5c that I bought cheap at the bounce off 24. Up 80% on those. Hoping for a morning bounce tomorrow to unload all my calls then all in on spy puts for cpi. Traded my ass off today. +168% on my account in a single day trading with 25% of my capital. Best day of trading ive ever had. Jesus fuck I love volatility. Godspeed brother.
