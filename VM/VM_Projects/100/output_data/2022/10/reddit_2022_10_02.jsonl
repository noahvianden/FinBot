Although social media like facebook , myspace, orkut etc were around but they weren't used the way they are now.\n\nLet me go back to the dot com bubble, i had just joined a mid-sized tech company as an intern in 1999, it was annoying to be around any of the older colleagues at the time because all they spoke was about some xyz company that just got listed and how their stock was oversubscribed !  By mid-99 people had started talking about insane tech valuations, and how 20 somethings were raking in millions while running their companies out of their 1 bedroom apartments in San Francisco etc , its just that internet was so new that many people did not understand anything about these new-age tech companies or how to put a value on them. Anything with a html site ending with .com was being marketed as a \"tech\" company that demanded multi-million dollar valuation. The market as i remember had started to correct much before Mar 2000, its just that by Mar 2000 we saw Cisco, IBM, Microsoft etc begin to go down.  Layoffs in tech began in a big way from early 2000 and things did not improve until end of 2003. It spread to other sectors mostly because of a nasty election followed by huge corporate fraud cases and ofcourse 9/11 and war on terror. As someone in tech, i always thought the 2000-2003 downturn in tech was more brutal than the one between 2008-2011. It also did not help that it was during this time that tech and non-tech companies first began outsourcing tech jobs offshore.\n\nIn 2007 no one except home buyers noticed the bubble conditions . Everyone thought things were great until the infamous Citibank Q3 call in 2007. Yet there was no panic, companies were still hiring, recession or bubble talk wasn't even part of the normal vocabulary unlike today.  I remember by March of 2008 things were starting to get noticeably worse. So many around me in my office and my circle of friends were getting laid off and were finding it hard to find jobs ( i would eventually get laid off in 2011).  Still there was no talk of bubble or recession, but sometime late that summer the media started screaming about \"banking crisis\", and then Lehmann Brothers happened and then the news about Wachovia, Merill Lynch, AIG etc. Citibank, which not so long ago was one of the biggest companies in the world by market share was reduced to $1/share. It quickly spread to every sector except healthcare. By October it felt as if the whole world was about to collapse. I will never forget the line outside a local Barnes and Noble bookstore in my neighborhood with middle aged men and women dressed in their Sunday best waiting to apply for salesperson jobs that had opened up ! So many folks in their 40s and 50s were working in sandwich and coffee shops that otherwise was manned by 20 somethings. It wasn't until late 2011 that things started improving. I firmly believe the feds should have stopped QE and begun increasing interest rates meaningfully from late 2013, unfortunately they did not take the foot off the gas until 2018 leading to another asset bubble we face today.\n\nAlthough for me 1999-2000 or 2008-09 feels like just yesterday, things were a lot different then.  Social media and outrage factories like facebook/twitter gives us space to explore all possibilities, and maybe that's we hear about bubbles, recession, crash etc so frequently now than we did back then.

I'm sure you know more than most that materials have skyrocketed the last couple of years which makes houses more expensive to build. Interest rates are rising, which means monthly payments will increase on the same overall loan value, that reduces the number of people who can afford that home. Banks have also started being more picky with their mortgages, even withdrawing some types of mortgages, again that brings less demand, and no one wants to build a new home and not be able to sell it\n\nLarge/custom houses are a different thing i think, there are still lots of people who have lots of money. If they have lots of money it's easier for them to borrow more, and they are probably less concerned about a recession and will be spending until the last moment. That doesn't mean they will be unscathed by a recession, they just aren't as worried about it. Yet.\n\nI'll be honest, I was actually expecting interest rates to start increasing  Dec 21/Jan 22 and faster than they have been.
