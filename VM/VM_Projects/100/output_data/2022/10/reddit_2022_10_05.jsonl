{"title": "Trading SPY Next 9 Days", "selftext": "**What We Know:**\n\n1. Jobs report Tuesday was bad: short term bullish, long term bearish \n2. UK almost shit the bed, but didn't: short term bullish, long term bearish \n3. Credit Suisse almost imploded, but didn't: short term bullish, long term bearish \n4. Fed called \"emergency meeting\" that wasn't really an emergency: no real signal \n5. People think the Fed meeting, and CS, and UK, and Jobs might make the fed pivot: short term bullish, long term who knows \n6. 10yr and 2yr rates have come down from their recent peaks: bullish \n7. OPEC+ is reducing production: bearish \n8. Volume has been very low: bearish, as the move higher has no conviction \n\n**What is Coming:**\n\n1. A more important jobs report Friday. If its bad (less than expected), it is bullish because it implies Fed will be closer to pivoting \n2. CPI October 13th: If its good (less than expected), it is bullish because it implies Fed will be closer to pivoting \n3. Potentially a lot of geopolitical and financial issues - or not\n\n**Context:** \n\n1. Powell/Fed just recently gave a dot plot that clearly shows no pivot is coming this year. To remain credible, they need to deliver on their word \n2. If we rally too much, and rates come down too much, then financial conditions are loosening. Fed seems very committed to be restrictive, which means more tightening. A rally will be met by a tighter fed, killing the rally. If you want the fed to stop, there needs to be capitulation and pain. \n\nThe last time we had a \"inflation has peaked, the fed won't be so hawkish\" rally it lasted 7 days and moved 5%, on 30m in volume \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjtzyb8kaxr91.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbf91ebbc298217aa0f70768b67eacc424922a7\n\nAs of last night, the current rally has moved 6% in \\~4 (trading) days on 16.5m in volume. We have given almost 2% of that back already this AM. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfghdecpaxr91.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=e30005800c99417f0d271d1961a9a0ddeeaf7da0\n\nNotice the RSI has bounced and is almost at the top of the range already.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cave paintings](https://preview.redd.it/seyyiov5bxr91.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=902ce0ed297f86524c3ec2856478d8d6fa3974e2)\n\n**Where do we go from here?**\n\n* We broke 375 to the upside, which was a recently contested price point (pink line)\n* The next meaningful area up is 380 (orange line) \n* If we fall back below 375, like this AM, we probably retest the lows and go lower. Unless:\n   * If we get a bad (which means good) jobs report on Friday, we at least go to 380 \n   * If we get a good (meaning less than expected) CPI on October 13, we go to 390+\n\n**Powell / The Fed Controls This Market**\n\nJust keep in mind, Powell keeps saying the same thing: we need meaningful evidence that inflation is coming down. We are going to stick with it. There will be pain etc. The point is, the Fed already told us what the plan is for the rest of this year, and we don't hear from them *until November.* The plan is in place, no reason to assume it will change. \n\n**Will the Rally Continue?**\n\nFor the rally to continue we need very strong, and repeated evidence that inflation is coming down, we need for Credit Suisse and UK to not blow up, we need Russia to not use Nukes, we need oil to not get too high, we need no other problems from the rest of the world, and we need the cash on the sidelines to keep investing thinking that the bottom is in. The hopium must sustain us until the Fed speaks again, and THEN the fed needs to say something dovish. \n\n**Will the Rally Fail?**\n\nTo go down, we *anything* to spook the market. Any better than expected, the economy is still hot report will confirm this is a bear market rally and send us back to at least the lows to be tested again. \n\n**The Way I Will Be Trading it Is:**\n\n* Sell the -380/+390 call spreads, end of October expiration. Add to this position each time the market makes the very unnatural looking sustained moves higher. As VIX contracts, these sold calls really won't loose much even if we move higher. If VIX is coming down, sold calls don't hurt as much. \n* If the Jobs report is really bad, we are going higher. Buy back the 380s, and leave the 390s until the CPI report October 13th. \n* On October 13th, if CPI report is hot again, sell the 380 calls again. Use the cash received from the 380s to buy 355 puts expiring end of October (same exp date). VIX will have collapsed to 25-27 so the puts will be relatively \"cheap\" \n   * As VIX expands, and we move lower, the puts are going to print and your sold call spreads are going to print. \n   * As we approach the lows, sell the 345 puts, completing a debit spread if you think we are going lower. Sell the 365 puts creating a credit spread if you think we are going higher. (I will write another post at this time)\n* On October 13th, if CPI report is below expectations, it will be very bullish. Sell a -380/+370 put spread and keep your 390 calls. Hold for a few days...  (I will write another post at this time)\n\nThis bounce was expected, and I got it right last time: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xn2wn6/how\\_to\\_win\\_the\\_week\\_of\\_926/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xn2wn6/how_to_win_the_week_of_926/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "id": "xwd4zs", "created_utc": 1664982521.0, "score": 135, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|107|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xrtkjs/the_bull_case_for_oil/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla_time_to_sell_calls/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xwd4zs)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xwd4zs)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25273630023002625}, {"body": "So funny to think that a bad job report is actually bullish as this implies an earlier pivot.

As long as both strikes stay OTM this is a positive number and you will get paid as time passes.   \nVega: this is IV which is what you are asking about and concerned with.

You are going to make 5x on delta what you might lose in vega going against you.   \n\n\nTLDR: you are directionally bearish, so you want SPY to continue to fall. Yes, VIX going up hurts you a little, but not too much. If SPY goes down a lot, and vix goes up a lot, then just sell some far OTM put spreads to match and you will get paid on both sides.
