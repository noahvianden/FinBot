This isn't some 2020 meme stock, but a serious player in the ecommerce space. If you shop online with any frequency you're almost certainly using SHOP storefronts all the time.\n\nSHOP is building a platform around ecommerce in the same way a company like CRM built a platform around customer relation software. I'm not saying they're definitely going to scale like CRM, but this is a company which is being used by 20% of ecommerce sites already and is constantly adding new customers and new products to upsell those existing customers. If they continue to take market share while continuing to expand into areas like payments and fulfilment the potential here is huge. As in bigger than AMZN's ecommerce division with far better margins. Unlike a lot of innovative tech companies, this is one of the few that I think could achieve mega-cap status and be one of the big winners this decade.\n\nAnd before anyone says it, no, PE is not a good metric to value on the company on currently.\n\nSo I'd say SHOP, but honestly it depends on what you're looking for.\n\nWhile I think SHOP offers the best risk/reward at this point in time, PYPL is probably the safest near-term. I think long-term their business model is questionable given that the payment space is moving quickly and they don't have the kind of moat they used to, in fact PYPL is actually one of the companies SHOP could disrupt by integrating their own payment service into their ecommerce platform. I think PYPL is a company quite likely to go nowhere over the next decade while upside is limited given the scale. I don't think it's a bad investment though, I just think the base case is that it will market-perform.\n\nUPST is... interesting... I've done a lot of research on this one because I really like the team. The company is run by some very smart people who bring a innovative mindset to an industry with relatively little innovation. I'm fairly bullish on the company long-term and think it's probably undervalued here. But the issues here are major. Firstly they're now putting a significant number of loans on their balance sheet which they originally said they wouldn't do. But these aren't just any old loans, these are loans which they've originated based on their unproven lending models which dramatically increases the risk. And if that wasn't bad enough, they also seem to be explicitly targeting those with lower credit scores and who would be typically be refused loans by traditional lenders. So given the recession risk, I think this is just a really bad environment to own a company like UPST, regardless of valuation or potential. Until recession risk can be taken off the table I struggle to see the stock appreciating much and will struggle to ever achieve prior highs given the increased risks of its business model today. I also think that UPST claiming they were only holding loans on their balance sheet to test their models was basically securities fraud. They were obviously lying to investors and while I understand these kinds of pivots are both common and necessary in innovative startups, when you're a public company you simply can't mislead investors about the nature of your business in this way. So right now, I'm staying away. While I think they have a lot of potential and they have a very smart team behind them I don't currently have enough trust be an investor in them. But I do think they have by far the most near-term potential.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "crm", "pypl", "recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "None of them", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "FR all in my to hard basket", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15109705924987793}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.186150461435318}, {"body": "SHOP.

That's not to say they won't perform worse in say recession, but they shouldn't ever perform worse than the banks current models. \n\nThe reasons why I'm still sitting on the sidelines however is for a couple of reasons. High interest environment reduces overall borrowing, which has been a large part of their strong revenue growth and profitability in the past. Banks may also cut back spending and put off investing in new software to help their core business. So I don't see them doing amazing in the next year, but once the bear cycle ends I see them doing quite well. Especially if they can get the kind of partnerships they need to really take off. \n\nAt the moment they've been mostly demonstrating the tech by doing the lending themselves, packaging it and selling the loans off.

Going to smaller and smaller devices can improve yields because a given product can be fit in a smaller area, meaning you can fit more successful products between the random defects that develop. There is no real technical impossibility of any of the high end manufacturers making 3nm chips. EUV isn't even a strict requirement, though the yields without it would be atrocious. I'm pretty sure IBM announced that they had made a 3 nm pitch die back in like 2016. The trick is getting the yields high enough to economically begin manufacturing at scale. So, rest assured, TSMC, Samsung, and Intel have all made 3 nm chips. TSMC and Samsung being Asian fabs do have a lower threshold to meet of yields to achieve profitability.

Sometimes, they have to move for some amount of time, sometimes they can do things remotely depending on the fraction of time which is being used to support that effort in different company. However, the seamless front on engineering is by design but the logistics behind it are a bit complicated. Since, Tesla is a public company, a lot of things that SpX takes are paid for by SpX using a PO system. All of this is actually publicly documented because Tesla is public.\n\nHowever, since both companies use the same(literally exactly the same in-house developed procurement system, called WARP drive(because of course!!)) systems, it\u2019s all filling out a form and getting approved by managers.\n\nAnother layer of complication is that SpX stuff is ITAR controlled whereas Tesla hires foreign nationals with visas so we have to make sure compliance is maintained throughout the duration of the project.\n\nAn example would be that - pretty much all of early power electronics for Starship came from Tesla. There are still components of Tesla power electronics that are part of Starship Avionics. One more example would be that, a lot of SpX Li ion cell testing is supported by Tesla. From SpX side, we have provided Tesla with some niche expertise in leak testing for their 4680 cell development.\n\nPersonally, I lead an Org in SpX and have worked at Tesla in the past, so I know all the nuances but at an engineer level, things are smooth.

But that's not what matters to me.\n\nWhat matters is ***for that business segment***, who are the competitors are how are we doing against them?\n\nIt's the same way we wouldn't compare [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) shopping to Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop. They're all tech giants and all online software sellers, but that's about the extent of the overlap. They aren't competing products.\n\nIf AWS was some moonshot with negligible revenue, that's one thing. Well maybe it fails, but it's not bringing in any real money so it's a line item on R&D. But it isn't. AWS is a massive source of revenue for Amazon, not to mention it runs all the underlying platforms (Prime, Video, the shopping website, etc). It's *roughly 18% of revenue*.\n\nWalmart, Home Depot, Chewy, and a host of others are chipping away at Amazon's shopping dominance. Another host is chipping away at it's cloud dominance.\n\nThat means about 60% of Amazon's revenue is under *direct, sustained margin pressure.*\n\nAMZN is a company the market currently thinks is worth a trillion dollars, and the price to whatever (earnings/cash flow) reads as if this is some high growth venture that's going to put forward a 30+ CAGR for the next decade or two. That's outside the realm of reason.\n\nSomeone might make the argument \"Well they're expending absurd amounts in CapEx and they can stop anytime, which will add enormously to the bottom line.\" This is a bunk argument.\n\nAll the physical infrastructure (warehouses, trucks, sorting machinery, robots, data centers, etc.) is tangible and depreciates. Maintaining these things costs money.\n\nCode likewise costs money to maintain and update. Not always as much, but it's not free.\n\nSo you've got a business where a minimum of 2/3's the revenue is under heavy competitive pressure - which means even more CapEx to keep running as fast as the competition. A very significant pile of debt. Regular share dilution. A trillion dollar price tag. A \"high growth\" company - in name only, at this point. Amazon has never paid a dividend.\n\nAll of this priced at roughly ***100 times earnings***.\n\nA few years ago Amazon was going to compete against everyone and own everything.

{"title": "JPMorgan Chase wants to disrupt the rent check and money order with its payments platform for landlords and tenants", "selftext": "JPMorgan Chase is betting that landlords and tenants are finally ready to ditch paper checks and embrace digital payments. The bank is piloting a platform it created for property owners and managers that automates the invoicing and receipt of online rent payments, according to Sam Yen, chief innovation officer of JPMorgan\u2019s commercial banking division. While digital payments have steadily taken over more of the world\u2019s transactions, boosted in recent years by the pandemic, there is one corner of commerce where paper still reigns supreme: the monthly rent check. That\u2019s because the market is highly fragmented, with most of the country\u2019s 12 million property owners running smaller portfolios of fewer than 100 units.\n\nAs a result, about 78% are still paid using old-school checks and money orders, according to JPMorgan. More than 100 million Americans pay a combined $500 billion annually in rent, the bank said. \u201cThe vast majority of rent payments are still done through checks,\u201d Yen said in a recent interview. \u201cIf you talk to residents to this day, they often say \u2018The only reason I have a checkbook still is to pay my rent.\u2019 So there are lots of opportunities to provide efficiencies there.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan has spent the past few years working on the software, called Story, which is meant to ultimately become an all-in-one property management solution. Besides having to manually collect paper checks and depositing them, landlords typically lean on decades-old software including Microsoft\u2019s Excel and Intuit \u2019s QuickBooks to run their businesses, said Yen. Newer options more tailored to the real estate industry have appeared in recent years with names like Buildium and TurboTenant. None are dominant yet, according to the executive. Story will \u201cgive [property owners and managers] much more visibility across their entire portfolio to see exactly what\u2019s been paid and what hasn\u2019t been paid,\u201d Yen said.\n\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/jpmorgan-chase-unveils-payments-platform-for-landlords-and-tenants.html", "id": "yibm7r", "created_utc": 1667221612.0, "score": 821, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 262, "comments": [{"body": "There are literally a million of these services already lol.
