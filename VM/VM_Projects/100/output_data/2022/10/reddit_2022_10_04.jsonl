This is maybe possible while pulling into a parking space with plenty of preceding data. Coming out is another story. From monocular cameras, this entirely relies on parallax and reading points of contrast in imagery to infer depth. When you get into your car in a parking lot, what is there for the neural nets to see? You're immobile and a number of your cameras will be staring at walls and car doors which will likely appear as simple blocks of colour to a camera.
