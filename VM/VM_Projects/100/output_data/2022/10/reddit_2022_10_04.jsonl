This is maybe possible while pulling into a parking space with plenty of preceding data. Coming out is another story. From monocular cameras, this entirely relies on parallax and reading points of contrast in imagery to infer depth. When you get into your car in a parking lot, what is there for the neural nets to see? You're immobile and a number of your cameras will be staring at walls and car doors which will likely appear as simple blocks of colour to a camera. There is zero chance you can pull a depth measurement from a static image of a brick wall point-blank. You can argue maybe this information will be saved from when you pulled in, but that doesn't account for when the environment changes around you: different cars, different lighting from the time of day, etc. To an image tracker, this may as well be an entirely different scene. This all becomes 100x harder for a computer to do when pulling images in the dark.\n\n\nParking assist showing precise distances to nearby objects will be going and never coming back without USS.
