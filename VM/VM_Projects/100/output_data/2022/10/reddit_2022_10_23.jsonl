{"title": "Apple Earnings (AAPL): A Sensible Discussion", "selftext": "Sup Ladies and Gentleman, and all you other degenerates.  I would like to discuss the event that is this Thursday: Apple Earnings.  I know nothing about the company products really which is why I've tagged it a discussion.  I am not some neckbeard fanboy who has such a poor understanding of technology, he has to get a baby proofed computer with an outrageous monitor stand,  nor am I a yuppie wanna-be artist with my head stuck up my ass sitting at a coffee shop waiting for someone to compliment the apple logo on my devices and clothes.  Personally, I am bearish.  Personally, I am an idiot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\nI'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:\n\n1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.\n2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**\n3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble.\n4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone.\n5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.\n6. American population is cutting back on expenses, and apple products are so overpriced for what they do.\n7. (Hoping to add more as good points come in)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[See Biggest Square](https://preview.redd.it/5y2tsbc7mlv91.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=503fc2604fa460ae6af4d47b04f88ee261dd24c9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. Apple Still Hasn't Fallen Off the Tree\n\nOn my 1Y chart on Robinhood it says:\n\n* Apple down 1.41%\n* Microsoft down 21.94%\n* SPY down 17.13%\n* Amazon down 29.93%\n* Google down 27.26%\n* Snapchat down 86.93%\n* Bitcoyne down 67.9%\n* Silver down 21.16%\n* My portfolio down 69.69%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is some historical reference going all the way back pre-covid:\n\n|Announcement Date|Fiscal Quarter End|Estimated EPS|Actual EPS|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|10/27/2022||$1.25|$????|\n|2022-07-28|2022-06-30|$1.14|$1.20|\n|2022-04-28|2022-03-31|$1.43|$1.52|\n|2022-01-27|2021-12-31|$1.89|$2.10|\n|2021-10-28|2021-09-30|$1.24|$1.24|\n|2021-07-27|2021-06-30|$1.00|$1.30|\n|2021-04-28|2021-03-31|$1.00|$1.40|\n|2021-01-27|2020-12-31|$1.41|$1.68|\n|2020-10-29|2020-09-30|$0.69|$0.73|\n|2020-07-30|2020-06-30|$0.51|$0.65|\n|2020-04-30|2020-03-31|$0.52|$0.64|\n\nYou see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.  It's been years, and the effects are being felt still.  Which brings me to my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. Chips\n\nNot sure what computers have to do with potatoes, but we are dealing with a bag of Lays right now.  You know how you buy a bag in line at the store, and then you open it and there is like 6 chips and air?  We are in a chip shortage and it is affecting everything.  I'll leave most of this discussion to the comments because the severity of what is going on needs to be mulled over. I can't help but think this is catastrophic.  Someone correct me. Please.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThe remainder of my points are basically general recession points and Apple really isn't in a great place for a downturn. They sell unaffordable shiny and chrome items as a forefront of technological advancement, and people chase that clout with a fervor of excitement and pay a premium for it.  Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.  Similar to NVidias video cards when mining with GPU's was made obsolete.

Haha!\n\nWe spent 4 days in airports or airplanes because we couldn\u2019t even get out of the airport. Police were blocking the entrance and you needed an actual flight ticket to get in. We were flying standby the whole time, and what we did was buy flights well in advance because they were cheaper, and then go to the ticketing booth in the airport and ask them to transfer those to current flights, and that was waaay cheaper than buying the flights on the day, because it was looking like $8,000 for the two of us. Instead it ended up costing us $525 total.\n\nWe were the last two people to board on the very last flight out of this tiny town before they shut down the airport indefinitely, otherwise we were looking at either Airbnb in a tiny little suite with only 30 minutes of outdoor exposure every second day (prison like lockdowns), or spend $500 each to take a van taxi 24 hours overland to Buenos Aires. Argentina is a huge country and that\u2019s a long drive.\n\nCamping out in the airport we had built a little fort out of luggage carts and our backpacks. We took out every layer of clothing we could to soften the ground, and my gf flies with a travel pillow, so we took turns using it. Looking up at the bright airport lights, you just kinda wished you could fucking turn them off for an hour. But they were always on. Food was very scarce and low grade, and kind of unreasonably priced for what you got. \n\nThen when we got to Cancun, walking through the absolutely packed, chaotic airport, there was a guy, leaning against the post, head in his hands, sunburnt to hell, and he just looked really rough, and at that point it finally hit me, this intense feeling of despair. Imagine being stuck in Cancun and they run out of clean drinking water? Panic kind of set in. We were supposed to stay in Cancun overnight to take care of some logistics, but decided to bounce as soon as possible. Luckily, every time we transferred our flight tickets, all the staff was super helpful, friendly, and didn\u2019t charge us. \n\nSo we got out of the airport and went straight to the grocery store to get something other than packaged food like potato chips, and we walked right past a van taxi, one of the guys got out of the van right as we walked by and literally coughed all over us. Smdh.\n\nWhen we got back to the airport I was starting to get agitated because people don\u2019t typically give you much space there, especially if you\u2019re a gringo, and perceivably worth a couple bucks more than the locals would pay, so they get on you. But the airport lounge helped us chill a bit. \n\nOverall it just felt like running a gauntlet. But when we got to Miami, everyone was way too lax there, and lots of the staff members were all joking around, by doing things like spray disinfectant all over themselves as if they were having a shower. One of the border patrol agents just had a helpless approach to things, like he knew what was happening everywhere, but just thought, what could he even do? He still has to go to work and deal with 1000\u2019s of international travellers.\n\nIt was only when we got to LA where things got a lot more serious about wearing masks, filling out forms, etc.\n\nFinally after flying to Seattle, and then Vancouver BC, getting home and laying on my bed, I noticed I had a strong fever again. I guess all the stress and dealing with so many nasty people, like people that pick their nose in public and touching everything, I think my immune system needed to kick back into high gear.\n\nNice thing was that my daughter bought us some groceries for when we returned home, so we were able to isolate fairly easily.\n\nHope that wasn\u2019t too boring to read, but if you were there, it would feel really messed up. There was a genuine feeling of despair everywhere you went. Lots of shops were all closed. People were scared, etc. Overall 1/10. Do not recommend.
