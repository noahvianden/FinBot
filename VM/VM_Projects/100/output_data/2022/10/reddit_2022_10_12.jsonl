Not sure if you are aware of the $9 trillion the FED put on their balance sheet or the other 4 trillion the US gov spent.

I didn\u2019t know QAnon ran this deep. The USD is stronger then ever. It\u2019s what is causing a currency crisis across the globe. I mean unless by devalue mean it has gained value against the yuan, the gbp, the yen, the rupee, the euro etc etc etc.\n\nNow I don\u2019t disagree that the usd has its hand in this global inflation and the petro dollar doesn\u2019t help especially when the usd is gaining strength against a basket of currencies. Further exacerbating the problem is the rush for dollars and us securities as collateral for what was previously considered stable hedges such as gilts. If ur a pensioner in the uk do u hold gbp which could possibly lose another 10% of value against the usd or dollars and or us treasuries after you sell assets to meet your margin requirements (margin is probably not the proper term but it meats the intent)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So i think your issue is you don't have an understanding of macro economics and you don't understand the full picture of what is going on. \n\nI know you think inflation is high gas prices and expensive mortgage rates and groceries costing 20% more at the check out line. Inflation is the increase in those prices **(and this is the important part)** due to the decline in value of your money. Your personal dollar is worth less today by 8.5% as compared to last year and that is why things are more expensive. Under \"normal\" circumstances, your dollar devalues by 2% every year. Ergo, prices go up by the same \"weighted average\" per year. You personal money loses value because your government increases the supply of money every year. Greater supply means less demand. Less demand means the value goes down and you need more of it to buy the same thing from a year ago. This is what price increases are in an inflationary environment. Bottle necks and wars are not inflation. They are adding to the raising costs of goods due to inflation. \n\nThe inflation you are seeing in the US is a direct result of the devaluing of the USD. **If you can understand this point we can continue.** The USD has been devalued the most it has been in 2022 more so than any other year in history. Since 2020, the US has printed 13 trillion dollars. More USD than ever existed in history. The result of this printing was the devaluing of the USD and 8.5% inflation in prices (weighted average) you see today. The US increased their supply of money. **more supply = less demand**. The US printed more money than anyone else. The US apart from some specific euro countries (with absolutely crushing energy prices) and turkey has the highest inflation. higher than canada, higher than south america and switzerland. Higher than NZ and Australia. The US printed a shit ton of money. So your currency is devalued a shit ton. Whatever you think about inflation is likely not entirely accurate. It doesn't go further than this. The definition of inflation (forget what they talk about on tv) is this: **a general increase in prices due to a fall in the purchasing value of money.** The USD just lost a ton of purchasing power (value) in 2022. Get it? It is literally what inflation is. It is literally what we are all talking about. The USD just got decimated in terms of monetary value. \n\nIf you're still with me. The strength of the USD is at a high right now as compared to other currencies. This is true. We know this to be temporary though. Every two months the FOMC has been raising interest rates on the USD. **It's only raising the rate to borrow USD on US dollars.** Meaning CAD and the EURO as example are not raising rates as much nor as fast. **The effect of the raising of the interest rates on USD has not been felt yet around the world but it's coming and coming fast.** Janet Yellen just said that she is alarmed by the lack of treasury notes being sold. yeah, no shit. Why would anyone want a USD. It just got devalued due to excessive printing but you're also making it expensive with your rate hikes. **Who wants to pay more for less value?** What this means is the globe (countries) is no longer buying USD as an investment and many of them are no longer buying them for future remittances. Do you get this? There is so much USD floating around right now, it's perceived to be worth less. Now, the USD is the reserve currency so it has a special status. We need it to pay for oil and debt across the world. But JPow is making it way more expensive to buy a dollar these days...right? he's raising the interest on the borrowing of those dollars every month. **What this is doing is costing other countries tons of money to transact in USD and it is causing a huge shock due to the speed.** Remember that most countries don't just invent (print) money out of thin air when needed. It means that the USD is both over abundant AND super expensive at the same time. It means that the most basic economic rules of supply and demand are out of whack at the moment. This needs to be corrected or the entire globe can fall into a deep deep economic crisis. So, how does it get corrected? Well, there is only so much debt and pain another country can take. Countries service their debt by buying US treasury notes (among other things). Given that new treasury notes are so expensive they cannot be used, countries will have no choice but to dip into their reserves to service their debt in USD. This will flood the market with even MORE USD and as we know, **more supply means even less demand**. As countries are currently NOT buying USD and have all the reason in the world to continue to stop buying USD, the price of the dollar will be devalued even further. **The demand goes down, so does the price.** \n\nThis is not theory. This is not my opinion. This is how it works. It's happening as we speak and will continue to happen. One thing is for sure, in a fiat system of dollars, there is no mechanism to restrict the effects of supply and demand. \n\nI tried my best to give you a grade 9 economics lesson in a reddit comment. hope it helps. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The currency issue is this. Other countries are dealing with pretty bad situations with relation to their economies and their debt. The US has not started in earnest to deal with its problems at this point.

And right now I think it's absolutely reasonable to be checking our assumptions about \"stocks go up\" and maybe start lowering our price targets a bit.  Does that mean it's a bad time to buy?  Not necessarily, personally I think there's some good deals right now.\n\nBut I don't think there's some magic formula that says greedy is always a bad time to buy and fearful is always a good time.  It's not written into the fabric of the universe.  People get greedy for a reason.  They get fearful for a reason.

Just because it went well for him doesn't mean it's going to go well for us, this is a new century with new challenges.\n\nThe hard part about all this is that you have to form your own conclusions.

They have been consistently wishy washy, so any casting of strength is hard to discern. Frankly they have lost credibility, so you cannot blame people for questioning the Fed. I would be cautious of those constantly harping about \"JPow said this and he is going to inflict pain, blah, blah, blah\". So far the actions have been luke warm in comparison to the inflation landscape that has developed over the last two years. \n\nI think there is a real apprehension at the Fed to drive rates to the point where they spur deflation, especially if this is still predominantly a supply side issue. This is a risk adverse bunch, keep that in mind when determining what risks the Fed is likely weighing by their actions.\n\nMy take is that they hope to modify behavior through warnings before they start aggressively moving. I think they likely fail and will eventually have to start with real hikes.
