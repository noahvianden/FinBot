Normally that could get you into trouble if you end up writing strikes below your cost basis, but if your split-adjusted cost basis from 5 years ago is like $5/share, that won't be a problem for a while. What is your split-adjusted cost basis?\n\nHere's the problem. Say you buy shares for $100/share and start writing .3 delta calls as the share price drops to $60. As you write calls below the $100 strike (because that's where .3 delta is), you run the risk of having your shares assigned at a loss. Say .3 delta is $75. If the price rises back to $80, you could get assigned a $75/share, which is $25/share below your cost basis. It is unlikely that you will have accumulated enough credit from CCs to compensate for that large loss.\n\nCan you roll yourself out of this problem by rolling up and out? Maybe. The larger the loss, the less likely you will be able to roll your way out, even if you are willing to have ridiculously long holding times, like a call that expires in 2 years. Even then you might not be able to roll all the way above your cost basis, if the decline is large enough, so after 2 years you could be right back in the same problem you started with.\n\nOn the bright side, TSLA is highly liquid with a lot of volatility, so the option chains are unusually large (distance from lowest strike to highest strike in the chain is several hundred dollars). This means its more likely you can roll yourself out of this problem for a while.

Now I've heard different things from different sources so I would appreciate it if someone cleared it up for me, is this a relatively safe way to trade or not? The reason I'm asking is because I've seen a side or reddit say it's not risky if you do your due diligence and manage your risk accordingly,  the opposing side says its extremely risky and the worst thing you can do. Now I am confused because I would like someone to tell me the truth, the YouTuber who's video I was watching stated she deals with those trades because she manages her risk and Essentially you can only lose what you originally invested. I'd like to know if that is accurate or not, if it's worth doing these type of trades or not, as well as some explanations.  I also understand that most options are rarely exercised but I would like to know on the off chance it is, am I screwed given the fact that I don't have those shares or the capital?

There is something missing in my understanding of how real world options trading works, so I thought better to ask here:\n\nI don't understand why do the Greeks or the Option value matter so much, once you have bought a position?\n\nIn textbooks, Option trading is explained this way: let a trader buy a Call Position on stock ABC at Strike $105, expiring whenever (the contract of buying 100 shares of ABC at $105). The current price of underlying stock ABC is $100. Now say, at some point the underlying reaches $110. Whether American-style or European-style, let's just say the trader either exercises the option, or it expires with underlying at $110.\n\nSo, the textbooks would say, the profit made is: $(110-105) x 100 = $500.\n\nLet the Option itself be valued at $10, so the *net* profit is $500 - $10 = $490.\n\nIn any of that, I don't see where the need for knowing the Greeks and how the Option value of $10 decays, matters? Option trading is presented as trading the underlying stock with leverage. Why do I have to worry about how the value of the derivative changes, when I already bought it? My only concern is where the underlying ends up. But the books just dive right into discussing all the Greeks and how they are impacted by variables like time to expiration, volatility, Moneyness of the option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I just want to know what I am missing here? Do we actually buy a Call/Put option and then *sell* it later, to close the position? (same when selling Options, but I don't intend to get in that side of trading).

In reality, most options positions that are ever opened are never exercised.

There are two related components:\n\n* The market's estimate of the value of the contract at time T0 is realized at later time T1 within an acceptable range.\n\n* The market's estimate of volatility of the underlying at time T0 is realized at later time T1 within an acceptable range.\n\nIf the market overestimates volatility at T0, you could end up overpaying for volatility that is never realized at T1. Likewise, if the market underestimates volatility at T0, you could end up underpaying (and thus getting a killer deal) for volatility that is realized at T1.\n\nAnd then the connection between price and volatility is that a certain amount of volatility is required to hit a range of prices. If your target price on the underlying is +20%, but the volatility only realizes a +/-10% range, you're never going to hit that price range target.\n\n> Short option positions are a whole another matter that seems more dangerous for me, right now. \n\nOnly because you are early in your learning.

You must have misunderstood. At expiration, a call or put that is ITM is worth the exact same gain/loss as the net gain/loss of round-tripping (buying and selling, or shorting and covering) the shares at their respective prices.\n\nIn your earlier example, you said the call cost $10. Did you mean $10 as in $0.10 as the quoted price, or did you mean $10 as the quoted price? Because remember that the quoted price of a call or put is *per share*, and since standard contracts deliver 100 shares, that means the full price of the contract is x 100.\n\nSo if you meant the per-share price of the call was $10.00, the gain/loss from your example is actually (110 - 105 - 10) x 100 = -500, a loss.\n\nSo obviously the holder of such a call would not exercise, since they would lose money if they did so. If you make the expiration price be 120 instead of 110, then it's a more clear example of how the ITM parity value as a gain is equal to the exercise value as a gain. Again assuming $10.00 per-share price to buy to open the call.\n\nExercise: Pay (105 + 10) x 100, receive 100 shares worth 120, sell shares for 120. Net net: (120 - 115) x 100 = gain $500.\n\nSell call: Pay 10 x 100 for the call. When the underlying is 120, the call will be worth *at least* 15, so sell to close at 15.
