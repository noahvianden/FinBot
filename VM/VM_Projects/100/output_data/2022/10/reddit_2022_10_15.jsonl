{"title": "Cathie Wood's Main ETF Closes at Five-Year Low in 78% Drop From Record", "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood\u2019s flagship fund on Friday closed at its lowest level in five years, after suffering a 78% plunge from last year\u2019s highs.\n\nThe ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) dropped 5.7%, finishing the day at $33.99 per share. The fund fell roughly 9.4% over the five-day stretch, its fifth straight weekly decline. \n\n\u201cNothing has changed in the larger macro backdrop -- a strong dollar is pressuring risk assets, inflation keeps surprising on the upside, rates are sticky and the Fed has to keep tightening,\u201d said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas Securities. \u201cAll of that is a bad combo for high-growth stocks.\u201d\n\nThe year hasn\u2019t been kind to the $6.7 billion ETF, as top holdings like Tesla Inc. and Zoom Video Communications Inc. were pummeled. Growth-oriented assets, like tech stocks or retail-trading favorite Tesla, have tanked as the Federal Reserve raises rates to knock down scorching levels of inflation. \n\nWood took the central bank to task this week for its aggressive tightening campaign, penning an open letter to officials to express concern that they could be making a policy error. \n\nSpeaking at a conference on Tuesday, Wood said the current risk-off environment means investors are looking for safety in passive benchmark-tracking products and failing to recognize that her fund\u2019s investments are positioned for the long haul. Wood and her firm have often said they are focused on at least a five-year investment horizon.\n\nWood\u2019s other funds have also been battered this year, with most dropping 40% or more. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) dropped 5.1% on Friday and closed at a record low. \n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-main-etf-closes-at-five-year-low-in-78-drop-from-record-1.1832745", "id": "y4c7sv", "created_utc": 1665800914.0, "score": 1110, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 299, "comments": [{"body": "Anyone else remember when ARKK was being compared to BRK-B \u2026.", "score": 302, "replies": [{"body": "I do!

Typically they will go up or go down somewhat together, and one might grow more than the others a little, but you won't fundamentally see one do a 20x in 5 years while the others do a 2x. So if you invested 25% in each, very likely you will start at 25% and end at 25% and participate in the gains of each company the full extent (because you're really diversifying for the sake of diversification/risk mitigation rather than because you expect one of these companies to really make you more money than the other).\n\nNow with innovation, let's say you have an EV car company, an internet company, a genomics company, and an AI company. Let's say the first 2 companies will 20x, 1 company will 2x, and 1 company will do nothing. The expected value of holding the exact same number of shares in each for 10 years will be 10.25x.\n\nWhat if the EV car company grew 5x in the first year? Well, now you have to sell off some of it before it hits 20x. You then redistribute the money to the other 3. So when this happens, the one stock that was actually going to represent the vast majority of your profits ends up being cut by more than half in just the first year. So if you had 25 shares of each company all starting at 100 dollars, a 5x in the first year that you end up redistributing ends up with you having 10 shares instead of 25 of your main winner. \n\nSo instead of making 50K with the EV car company, you're capped at 27.5K - how much the other stocks end up losing or gaining with the redistributed money.\n\nSo it can get fairly complicated to showcase in detail, but innovation operates under the premise that a company will basically 5x to 50x in 10 years and some will fail/underperform. So if you have a hit rate of 25% (which is amazing), that stock will go from 25% of your portfolio to 99% while it's waiting for the other stocks to catch up. Which means you have to sell down your winners to fund the losers even if have no incentive to sell down the winner if you think it can do a 20x and another 20x from there, for example.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "First of all, thanks for such a detailed breakdown on this. You really encapsulated that concept and showed how much more of a crapshoot innovation companies can be. Which in a weird way makes me want to buy more haha!\n\nSecondly, are there any sectors of innovation you'd recommend I do research on to potential invest? The semiconductor industry (namely AMD and NVDA plus SMH for a hedge) is very interesting to me right now", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well, there's innovation, and then there's \"innovation\".\n\nI typically only care about disruptive innovation. Apple with the iPhone took over the phone market and then took the majority of the industry's profits long term even after losing market share, same thing with Amazon, and the same thing is happening with Tesla. When incumbents become complacent and a newcomer comes in with an extremely good product and quickly innovates in typically a capital intensive industry with high barriers to entry where simultaneously incumbents are too scared to throw away their existing products and R&D, they are the sole winners where everyone else in the same industry fights for scraps. These are the types of companies that do a 20x or 50x. Netflix almost did the same thing, but content is not the same thing as a product, so it wasn't able to get a lead with its product but rather only the business model (which was copied and was out competed by the incumbents many years later). So Netflix is a failed disruptor in that it succeeded in changing the industry but did not take the profits.\n\nAMD and NVDA are innovative for mature companies, but are not necessarily disruptive in the same way. Nvidia is currently more of a rent seeker exercising monopoly power, and it's debatable how much innovation it is capable of that it is able to capture the value of. So for example, if NVDA makes all of its money selling chips for self driving in the future (let's ignore Tesla for a moment), it will make profits from the chips, but it won't necessarily make the actual money from the value of robotaxis. While it can overcharge to an extent, if it goes too far, there is incentive for others to forgo Nvidia, limiting its profits.\n\nI divested from NVDA a little while ago for this very reason. Don't think it's a bad company by any means, but it's more of a company that will likely 2x to 5x by 2030 than one that will 20x. Disruption is very difficult to research, and it doesn't really happen by sector in the same way. AI training seems to happen with or without Nvidia's software, so while the hardware is great and NVIDIA does a lot of great AI, it's debatable how much it can actually charge other companies for when much of the value comes from the other companies.\n\nSemiconductors performance is much more affected by geopolitics and governments than anything else at this point. You have to really ask yourself if these companies are innovating more than like a Heinz? Or if they are innovating relative to each other. If Intel comes out with a GPU, does that hurt NVDA? If Apple makes its own chip, does it hurt NVDA and AMD?
