A put is the opposite. In reality, a call option gives you the right to purchase 100 shares per each contract at the strike price if you hit above it. So if Netflix goes up to $300, op has the option to buy 100 shares at his strike price of $270 before it expires on 10/21. So you would automatically make $3,000 per each contract owned in this hypothetical scenario. What most people here do is disregard exercising the contract option to obtain shares at a lower price and take advantage of the volatility that stocks like Netflix experience during earnings. If op had a call on Netflix for say $250 expiring 10/21 and the stock maintains $270 before expiration, he would get $100 for each $1 the stock price increased and, since op had 6 contracts on Netflix he would automatically get $600 for each $1 over $250 and would stand to earn at least $12,000 if the stock stays above $270 in this scenario.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Under the call what do the number of buys/sell mean?
