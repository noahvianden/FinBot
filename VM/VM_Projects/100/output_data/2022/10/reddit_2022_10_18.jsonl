So if Netflix goes up to $300, op has the option to buy 100 shares at his strike price of $270 before it expires on 10/21. So you would automatically make $3,000 per each contract owned in this hypothetical scenario. What most people here do is disregard exercising the contract option to obtain shares at a lower price and take advantage of the volatility that stocks like Netflix experience during earnings. If op had a call on Netflix for say $250 expiring 10/21 and the stock maintains $270 before expiration, he would get $100 for each $1 the stock price increased and, since op had 6 contracts on Netflix he would automatically get $600 for each $1 over $250 and would stand to earn at least $12,000 if the stock stays above $270 in this scenario.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Under the call what do the number of buys/sell mean?

More advanced people made logins and such (like myself). Most obviously didnt bother until myspace and geocities.

I think this recession has really shown some cracks in META's foundation.  While Zuck is trying hard for a pivot, that pivot is years away - look at current metaverse numbers actual numbers are not meeting predicted numbers.  That journey will be extremely expensive, and I am not sure it will catch on so that is a huge gamble.  I think while their user base is huge, I think their numbers of active users  has slowed. I joined the platform less than 2 years from releasing to the public, so I am a very long time users.  I have noticed that my news feed is showing less and less activity of my friends... when I check their profile, they haven't posted in a while... so I have taken the time to call a few of them and I get \"yeah, kind of over the BS of FB.\" so with all the political crap, the censorship crap - a large slice of their users are over it.  So they are using FB to post memories or photos they want to keep... but the interaction is slowing.  They also have missed a generation, my daughter is 22, and has never had a FB account - her statement is \"FB is for Boomers\"... Next to last, by now they should be paying dividends and AMZN is my only non-paying dividend stock I own. Finally, I don't like that the board is there for fluff, they have no power, Zuck can't be fired or even told what to do, and that is a bad thing nearing the end of a long run and this company has had a long long run.\n\nAMZN was a simple growth buy for me a while back, and my first non paying dividend stock since the dot com timeframe... I bought 200 at 116.97 right after their split.  The reason for my buy:  If they offered a tiered levels based on customer loyalty like Dillards use to offer a black card membership to anyone spending $5000 in their department stores in a year, my wife would surpass the highest levels - get the point?  Second, I  have been both a consumer of their AWS platforms through one of my companies, and another company I owned as a vendor on AMZN, so I have been what I would call a super user of AMZN.  While I think Azure will be the long term winner, AMZN will be sitting in 2nd for a long time.  There platform is very solid, but lacks the Office 365 and Dynamics that solidifies MSFT as the ultimate corporate cloud provider. While I wasn't a Bezos fanboy, I admit they have had and do have decent leadership.  The iRobot purchase makes perfect sense for their vision of being a major player in smart homes.  I also, however, see very strong headwinds from the Fed possibly wanting to split them up.  Although I think these headwinds could be bad for the stock initially,  the long term on that is tremendous if they are split or not...  I know, some just went huh?  So, think back to the big break ups, the winner of the split up wasn't Joe Consumer, it was Victor Stockholders... people made serious money long term when the government forced the break up.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ask your 22 yo if she has an IG account.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Actually she doesn't... \nshe at one time had snap - not sure if she still does or not.  \nShe also at one time had Pinterest for posting up her paintings... \n \nI just helped her build her LinkedIn account and showed her the complete ins and outs. \n\nShe also has a made up user account to watch tiktok.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4501649737358093}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11103316396474838}], "tickers": ["meta", "recession", "msft", "amzn", "ups"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "META has a lot more upside IMO", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["meta"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Lol\u2026 one company is growing revenue like crazy, one is plummeting like crazy. \n\nIf you need help with this decision, stop investing and just bury your cash.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Meta's revenue is down 14% from 2 quarters ago.
