{"title": "Peloton to Cut 500 More Jobs in Last Bid for Turnaround", "selftext": "Honestly, WSJ really missed the headline for this article - Their Subtitle should have been the actual title...\n\n# Peloton's  Chief Executive Barry McCarthy says company has six months to prove it can survive on its own\n\n Peloton Interactive Inc. [PTON -4.18%\u25bc](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PTON?mod=chiclets) said it plans to cut about 500 jobs, roughly 12% of its remaining workforce, in the company\u2019s fourth round of layoffs this year as the connected fitness-equipment maker tries to reverse mounting losses.\n\nChief Executive Barry McCarthy, who took over in February, said he is giving the unprofitable company about another six months to significantly turn itself around and, if that fails, Peloton likely isn\u2019t viable as a stand-alone company.\u00a0\n\nThe job reductions, announced to staff on Thursday, will leave Peloton with roughly 3,800 employees globally, less than half the number of people the company employed at its peak last year. It also has eliminated about 600 more jobs since June than previously disclosed through retail store closings, attrition and other moves, Peloton said.\n\nMr. McCarthy said that the latest cuts mark Peloton\u2019s final significant move to reduce its operating footprint and that executives would now focus on increasing revenue. He said the cuts are companywide but would be heaviest in its marketing operation, which he said is too big for a company of Peloton\u2019s size.\n\n\u201cThere comes a point in time when we\u2019ve either been successful or we have not,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in an interview.\n\n* \u201cIf we don\u2019t grow,\u201d he said, before pausing. \u201cWe need to grow to get the business to a sustainable level.\u201d\n\n The company has reported six straight quarterly losses, culminating in a $1.2 billion loss in the most recent quarter. Demand for Peloton\u2019s bikes and treadmills has plunged and the number of people who subscribe to its fitness classes has stagnated as Americans return to pre-Covid routines and, more recently, confront decades-high inflation.\n\nMr. McCarthy said he sees evidence that Peloton can succeed.\u00a0\n\nHe said the company has drastically reduced the amount of cash it is burning through by cutting jobs, outsourcing all manufacturing and reducing costly unsold inventory, and isn\u2019t at risk of running low on funds. Peloton went through more than $1.7 billion in cash in the past three quarters combined, ending June with $1.25 billion in cash reserves and a $500 million credit line.\n\nThe new management team is clicking, according to Mr. McCarthy, who said he believes Peloton\u2019s near-term growth targets remain achievable.\u00a0\n\nEmployers\u2019 total job openings declined 10% in August and layoffs rose, providing the latest signs that the labor market, while still strong, is cooling. More companies, from Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. to Snap Inc. and Stanley Black & Decker Inc., are cutting jobs, while others including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google have said they would freeze or pull back on hiring.\n\nPeloton employed about 3,700 people near the start of the pandemic, and grew to more than 8,600 in 2021 as the company scrambled to meet explosive demand, adding employees internally while acquiring equipment manufacturing operations in a bid to quickly expand capacity.\n\nPeloton in February said it would cut 2,800 jobs and replace co-founder John Foley as CEO with Mr. McCarthy, who previously was finance chief at Spotify Technology SA and Netflix Inc. In July, Peloton said it would cut about 500 Taiwan-based manufacturing jobs. A month later, it announced plans to cut 530 employees from its North American delivery workforce and 250 customer-service positions in North America.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know many of you will feel angry, frustrated, and emotionally drained by today\u2019s news, but please know this is a necessary step if we are going to save Peloton, and we are,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in an internal memo to employees provided by the company.\u00a0\n\nSeparately, Peloton is exploring a sale of its Precor commercial fitness-equipment unit less than two years after acquiring the business, according to people familiar with the matter.\u00a0\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-to-cut-another-500-jobs-in-last-bid-for-turnaround-11665011471?st=76mfmpbr32v2wqn&reflink=desktopwebshare\\_permalink](https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-to-cut-another-500-jobs-in-last-bid-for-turnaround-11665011471?st=76mfmpbr32v2wqn&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)", "id": "xx4c8b", "created_utc": 1665060225.0, "score": 1025, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 298, "comments": [{"body": "How does Peloton have over 5000 employees?!", "score": 495, "replies": [{"body": "All these fake \"tech\" companies had shit tons of workers doing likely nothing all week.

You think gas prices are too high\n2. If oil companies drilled more gas prices will go down\n3. Evidence - Pioneer said they could be drilling more but chose not too!\n4.

Drilling more on land that already has permits won't fix anything. Getting non-permitted land producing will. \n\nThis shows that even if Pioneer could 100% tap instantly all their reserves they'd barely move the needle (and would have no oil to drill at all after that).

This isn\u2019t a scenario where one asset class (RE) got out of whack and markets dipped 48% while a few Wall Street firms folded and people realized packaging trash with A paper was a bad idea.

Not anymore boys. I\u2019m seeing demand softness across sectors. This reduced demand is resulting in price reduction (see lumber and steel). Seems good right? Wrong. Companies loaded up on expensive inventory because daddy told them to be worried about the supply chain. So now they are relieving inventory and taking huge GAAP losses. In short I\u2019m seeing companies losing revenue and gross margin across the board. \n\nBut wait\u2026.there\u2019s more! Interest rates are up. Now people are realizing that I in EBITDA that everyone adds back to cash flow is a cash expense that\u2019s actually paid. Weird right? Oh and Google the word inflation. Every working in America is leaving the grocery store and gas station like they just got kicked in the nuts. So what do they do?? They ask their employer for more money.

As an economy we\u2019ll be fine, but we are going to see record bankruptcy filings next year (my hunch).
