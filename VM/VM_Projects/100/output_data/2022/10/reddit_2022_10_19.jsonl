So first of all, the new Quest Pro is a VR/AR headset, so when you have it on you are not really \"Stuck in VR\" to you, you see the world around you, but with giant monitors and virtual people you work with.

Specifically, look at Las Vegas.  It was a prime example of the flaw in your assertion that housing would be cheap if only the pesky government would get out of the way.\n\nIn the early 2000s Las Vegas was one of the fastest growing cities.  Builders couldn't build houses fast enough.  Eventually the builders built so many houses that they had built more than there was demand.  Builders didn't keep building houses no one would buy, as this tied up their capital and labor on projects they wouldn't be able to quickly turn around.  Building basically stopped once the demand threshold was crossed.  Housing prices came down for a while to liquidate the excess inventory.  Many of the vacant properties were bought up as Air BnBs and other investment properties.\n\nThis same cycle has happened time and time again all over the world.  A few more examples you could check out if you're feeling up for a research project.  Phoenix, Arizona.  Austin, Texas.  \n\nI'm not saying better zoning and planning wouldn't help with high housing prices.  I'm saying the interests of those with the means to produce more housing won't keep building houses past a certain point, because it isn't as profitable for them.\n\nThere is also a realistic limit to how many houses can be built.  This is simple math to be used as an example, not real world numbers.  Say you have 100 home builders in a city, who can build 1000 homes in a year.  There are 1200 people who need homes.  An REIT comes along and buys up all the existing home inventory at an inflated price.  Now you have 200 people who want homes and can't find them because the builders can only build a limited number of homes in a given period of time.  The 200 people who need a place to live now have no choice but to rent from the REIT, at an inflated market value.  Had the REIT not purchased the existing home inventory, there would have been plenty of homes for everyone to purchase with the existing homes and new construction.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03287432715296745}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03235889971256256}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03235889971256256}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.005585090257227421}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.005585090257227421}, {"body": "But you seem to be advocating a system where we build way more houses than we actually need to shelter people.

He even released Tesla patents for fair use for anyone. He is a dick of a person, but he has vision and drive that other company CEO's lack. VW's ex-CEO Herbert Diess was inspired by Tesla's success, and made big moves to transition VW to electric. He was ousted by the VW board, because their old business model was threatened. Ford's Jim Farley is also doing good things, but at a much slower rate than Tesla.  \nYou should note a couple of things: Tesla does not advertise. Ford and GM each spends $3 billion per year on advertising. That is money that goes to media such as newspapers, magazines and websites. So mainstream media (such as The Washington Post article you quoted) is inherently threatened by a car company such as Tesla that spends $0 with them. There is a very strong incentive for these media companies to spout negative news about Tesla. Have you heard about Tesla's that catch fire? Of course you have. They are big news. There have been a few dozen Tesla car fires, and recently almost none that do not involve crashes. Do you also hear about the 500 ICE car fires PER DAY in the US alone? Of course you don't. its not in the interest of media companies to tell you that.  \n\n\nScrutinise everything you read about Tesla in the mainstream mead with a critical eye.  \n\n\nFossil fuels are big business. The world's largest company is Saudi Aramco. If you drive a fossil fuel car, you have paid money to the Saudi Princes who own that company. Also Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, Shell and the Koch brothers. These companies' income is threatened by electric cars in a huge way. There is a lot of nonsense spouted in the media against not just Tesla, but electric cars in general.

Note that my original premise was that while Elon's promises are often delayed far beyond the original timeline, they ARE eventually delivered.\n\nLets look at the claims of \"missed promises\" in your article:\n\nThe $35000 Tesla was available in February 2019. That model was discontinued in November 2020, for a longer range model. Inflation can also account for price increases from promise to delivery time. Even you article acknowledges that.\n\nFull Self Driving - yes, its taking much longer than initially promised. FSD beta is getting very good in some locations now, to a point that was unimaginable 10 or even 5 years ago. But agreed, its not ready for general release yet. Have you got a reference for your claim that \"His own engineers have begged him to stop promising FSD and he refuses.\"? I have not heard this.\n\nThe first electric semi is being delivered December 1. Delayed, but not vapourware.\n\nThe Thailand cave submarine option was requested by the Thai government as a backup to the main plan. Plan A worked, so the sub was never required. Not a broken promise. The subsequent twitter was between Musk and one of the divers was obscene on both sides, but especially Musk's.\n\nRobotaxis are a consequence of FSD. Once FSD becomes safer than human drivers, Robotaxis will become a thing. Yes, delayed.\n\nCybertruck did not deliver in 2019. But is now in tooling mode at the Nevada factory and will be delivered first half 2023. Delayed, not a broken promise.\n\nAs a medical doctor, I found Musk's tweets on COVID19 to be disgraceful. He should not comment on issues he is not an  expert in.\n\nThe Humanoid Robot has been shown as a prototype now, contrary to The Washington Post article. Whether or not it becomes useful in 2023 remains to be seen. Not a broken promise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso note that The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, a competitor with Musk in the aerospace business.

That was a $35,000 car. I get that inflation has gone up but no other car manufacturers have had to raise prices by 25%. And yes, they improved it. Most car manufacturers improve their car every year and still don't raise the price significantly. The fact is it was an unreasonable goal he could not deliver on in the long term. Either that or once he realized that he couldn't make the goal he decided to raise the price far higher than his increased cost. And before you say something about how EV cost went up more, no other EV or hybrid went up by 25%.\n\nThe Truck being rolled out in December probably will because no company is dumbest enough to wait until a month before to admit they won't make it. The others, who knows. We will have to wait and see but arbitrary promises and release dates prove nothing.\n\nAs for my claim of his engineering team saying they can't do: I read that a few years back and can no longer fight it. Who knows why that is. Could be it was a suspect article or he invoked an NDA. Either way I have to resend that.\n\nThe cave incident went far different than you remember. He *asked*no one reached out to him. He inserted himself in the situation and they said \"sure, se if you can make it work.\" It never would have thought. It might work amazing in other caves but the divers repeatedly told him they can barely fit people through some parts so a big metal canister won't fit. After he kept trying the lead diver got shity with Musk. Tbf that seemed uncalled for, while Musk wasn't helping he also wasn't hurting.\n\nThe robot could shuffle and wave. Tbh I don't know why he is going into a field he will never catch up on. It will go just like the boring company.\n\nHe is mad his feelings were hurt so he is shutting  down starling in Ukraine. \n\nHe killed a monkey testing Nuerolink even though he was told that he was not cleared to test in monkeys yet.

I am a doctor. Just yesterday I was involved with a patient that had a deep brain stimulator (DBS) for Parkinson's disease. I am absolutely sure that many animals died in the development of that technology.

They have also been pumping money into the 4680 cells which are not yet scaled. $250 million in currency depreciation took a toll on their profits as well.\n3. Regulatory credits revenue has declined because there are fewer vehicle sales in the market. The negative for Tesla is it's unlikely they will ever see the $600 million amount they saw in Q1 but regulatory credits are such a small part and won't play a role in the future.

Taking a 30, 50 or even 100 year timeframe would be a lot fairer, translating into 9.6%, 10.3% and 10.3% respectively.

Compound that over 30 years and you're talking a 66x compared to a 17x.
