So first of all, the new Quest Pro is a VR/AR headset, so when you have it on you are not really \"Stuck in VR\" to you, you see the world around you, but with giant monitors and virtual people you work with.

Specifically, look at Las Vegas.  It was a prime example of the flaw in your assertion that housing would be cheap if only the pesky government would get out of the way.\n\nIn the early 2000s Las Vegas was one of the fastest growing cities.  Builders couldn't build houses fast enough.  Eventually the builders built so many houses that they had built more than there was demand.  Builders didn't keep building houses no one would buy, as this tied up their capital and labor on projects they wouldn't be able to quickly turn around.  Building basically stopped once the demand threshold was crossed.  Housing prices came down for a while to liquidate the excess inventory.  Many of the vacant properties were bought up as Air BnBs and other investment properties.\n\nThis same cycle has happened time and time again all over the world.  A few more examples you could check out if you're feeling up for a research project.  Phoenix, Arizona.  Austin, Texas.  \n\nI'm not saying better zoning and planning wouldn't help with high housing prices.  I'm saying the interests of those with the means to produce more housing won't keep building houses past a certain point, because it isn't as profitable for them.\n\nThere is also a realistic limit to how many houses can be built.  This is simple math to be used as an example, not real world numbers.  Say you have 100 home builders in a city, who can build 1000 homes in a year.  There are 1200 people who need homes.  An REIT comes along and buys up all the existing home inventory at an inflated price.  Now you have 200 people who want homes and can't find them because the builders can only build a limited number of homes in a given period of time.  The 200 people who need a place to live now have no choice but to rent from the REIT, at an inflated market value.  Had the REIT not purchased the existing home inventory, there would have been plenty of homes for everyone to purchase with the existing homes and new construction.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03287432715296745}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03235889971256256}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03235889971256256}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.005585090257227421}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.005585090257227421}, {"body": "But you seem to be advocating a system where we build way more houses than we actually need to shelter people.
