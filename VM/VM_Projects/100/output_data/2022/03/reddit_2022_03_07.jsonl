You waste money trading wide bid/ask spreads.\n\nIVW has just about the worst liquidity I've seen. If the bid/ask is wider than 10% of the bid at the ATM strike, think twice about using that chain. The April ATM strike's bid/ask is almost 50% of the bid. My advice, stay far, far away from that chain.\n\nHere's why. Within the bid/ask are price points that buyers will buy at and sellers will sell at. It's the \"real\" price they want to trade at, if you will. For example, for a buyer, they may want to buy for $1.00 but will settle for $1.10. Nobody knows what those \"real\" price targets are, but you can assume they are within the bid/ask spread.\n\nThis means that the narrower the bid/ask, the more likely you are going to trade at a \"real\" price, rather than an inflated/discounted one. For example, if the bid/ask is $1.00/$1.01, there's no room to overpay/undersell. You'll hit the real price every time just by using the bid or the ask. But if the bid/ask spread is $1.00/$2.00, there is all sorts of room in that spread to overpay/undersell. Like say a buyer is willing to buy your call at $1.40, but you offer $1.30 and they fist-pump for the money you allowed them to keep.\n\n**Wide spreads mean a higher chance you will overpay/undersell**.\n\nSo instead of worrying whether or not your order will \"execute\", you should worry more about how much you might be missing the real price if it does execute. Trust me, if you undersell your call, it will be instantly filled.. You can always instantly fill an order if you offer extra money to sellers or cut a huge discount for your buyers.

Your line of thinking is how so many companies developed inflated valuations. Thinking that big revenues will easily lead to profitability (actual positive earnings and profit). Revenue is great and all but what investors care more about is how much profit they're making/going to make. You need revenue to eventually turn a profit, but EPS is not only dependent on revenue. PTON and FB are great examples for different reasons. For PTON they have good revenue and seemed to have a decent customer base but they hemorrhage money in order to generate that revenue. If they could somehow consolidate and turn a profit with their current user base then they'd probably increase in valuation a ton. However, their future growth in terms of gaining more customers is definitely slowing down yet they aren't that much closer to turning a profit. FB is a massive cash cow and revenue generator but because they're investing more money into their own company going forward to pursue metaverse things their EPS will be lower despite an enormous revenue stream. FB will continue to have huge revenues and if they stopped pursuing metaverse then their EPS would go back to an absurd level but they're banking on metaverse being their next big thing.

Decreasing profits with higher inflation and rate hikes will make those small profits look even worse. If you're not generating profit at least equal to inflation then your company is worth less than they were the month before or the year before (whatever inflation metric you're choosing mom or yoy/). Profits and the potential for future profits are a better indicator to battle against inflation than revenue.

But again, revenue doesn't mean as much as EPS and better yet, future EPS. There was a huge valuation spike because they could keep growing their revenue AND profits if WFH continued due to covid. As soon as the main driver of their business model subsided (covid restrictions) then their revenue and profit stream potential also got cut, and therefore their valuation got cut. Add onto that their limited moat due to other well-known companies like MSFT and GOOG now having competing platforms and that potential future profit gets chopped again. They might have a bright future but when people already contract with MSFT for Outlook and office and they get MSFT's version for free then there's little motivation to pay for ZM.
