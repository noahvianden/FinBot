Yes higher than desired concentration in single stock but still overall portfolio is diversified with ETFs, MFs and oh, did I mention healthy % allocated to few d*egen strategy* as well (r/HFEA and versions of it, Crypto etc). My cost basis is around $150 so definitely don't want to get called away given tax implications. But comfortable with 0.1 - 0.3 delta and it appears 30-45 DTE seems preferred duration although I have to read up more on few great suggestions on weeklies, 0.35 delta. Last year, I used to follow the .1 delta 30 DTE strategy but with the up only market conditions it didn\u2019t work out well where after several 'roll up and out', was staring at $70K current value hit on the upside gains. However this year I switched to more active management with 0.3 delta, 2-3 months out for healthy premium, sell on big green days, buy back at 20% profit and wait to sell more until next big green candle. I pretty much recovered all my 'losses' from last year and now back in black in this strategy which I track very closely in a spreadsheet. This active management this year has been super profitable but of course the IV has been super high with Powell/Putin contributing to good bit of vol. So I still see my approach thus far and luck as function of current market conditions and not tenable. Hence reaching out to experts here on what CC strategy with such sizable locked shares (hodl for long term) folks have employed with lessons learnt / pro-tips / 'rolling playbook' etc.\n\n**Update**: THANK YOU ALL for so many pro-tips and certainly lots of experienced hands here. Over past 15+ months, I have gone through multiple scenarios and always struggled on the optimal 'roll decisions' during expiration time.

The trick is that you want to sell only 33% of the contracts available to you at first, so if you have 1900 shares, sell and roll only 6. This should get you around $1080 per week. When you roll, you will attempt to keep at the 0.35 delta range, if you were itm and you can't do it without coming out of pocket, then increase the number of contracts until you are flat....but if you can roll for credit, reduce until you are back to 33% of available. If you are reaching maximum contracts, attempt to skip a week or up to 4 weeks as far up as you can with as little amount of contracts as you can so that nothing comes out of pocket.\n\n    If the stock has an ex-div date the next day, always make sure you are at least $1.20 otm by half an hour before market closes (the higher the better, your choice)...if not, roll to the following week early as described above for rolling procedures\n\n    If you set a price alert at your strike price, you can roll early up and out for credit usually without having to increase contract size....keep ahead of the game as much as possible. If you roll early, try to go as far up as you can, you shouldn't worry about the credits, this is a corrective action as you gained value on the stock rising.\n\n    If you previously rolled early and stock falls, you can attempt to move the contracts closer in time and down to burn it quicker (try not to go past 0.35 delta). If it's a previously early roll, it is 7DTE, AND you have 33% contract size, you can roll it down to the 0.35 delta to collect any lost premium to adjustments.\n\nThe money you collect on premium can be used to:\n\n    Buy more shares directly to increase your portfolio\n\n    Buy \"forwards\" as I have described many times in these forums (it is a calendar spread to load value and protect against runs). If you build up enough of these, then you could effectively just roll these instead and leave stock completely alone.\n\n    Keep it to the side to help pay to move any positions out instead of increasing contract sizes, giving you more of a \"buffer\" (if you buy shares as #1 suggests, you can actually sell them back to do the same effect, so combining this with #1)\n\n    Build up enough cash to purchase a 600+DTE Put contract to protect the portfolio, it will cost quite a bit upfront, but at 365 DTE, you roll it to another 600+DTE for a minimal carry price. Should be about 4k to set up, but then it's only 1k per year after that per contract.\n\n    Take your wife or husband out for a nice meal.\n\nIf you didn't care about losing the shares, I would say go with 100% 0.35 delta rolls buying forwards with the premium until you are at double rolling....then reduce the longs with premiums until they're loaded up with high value (0.80+ delta), collapse them at the end of the year and let the whole thing cool off for 31 days to clear any wash sales, maybe buy some Christmas presents, start up again middle of January.

For example, with MSFT, if I were able to sell 6 of the 4apr305C for 0.90 each, that's $540. If instead I sold 7 of those and purchased 1 of the 22apr305C, I would be able to get $70, but I get an extra contract roll for 3 rolls. The idea is less to do with the money and more to do with protecting, if the stock were to climb above 305 and you can't roll \"up and out\" for enough credit, you can sell the long position completely for the profit to help pay for the others. If you were to do all 19 contracts, you could do 20 and have a forward out to October for credit....if you did this every week for 19 weeks (depending if stock moved), you would end up with 19 contract rolls in excess (allowing you to scale back your short position if you wanted)\n\n    I priced at 0.45 delta (atm skewed with msft), since your cost basis is 150, you don't actually have to protect that much if you don't want to, but the carry cost (yearly maintenance) will be minimal difference down to about 0.25 delta, so unless you want to specifically save on the setup fee, might as well stick with atm.\n\n    As above states, if you were to go all-in with forwards, you can pretty much double up your position by week 19, possibly sooner (since more rolls means more money faster and since you don't want to go past November, it'll be more like 9 or 10 weeks). Then you'll have 38 rolls making about $3800 per week until October/November.

{"title": "Interest rates, inflation, and where that leaves Gold and the markets.", "selftext": "**If you are skimming, read the bold.**\n\nWith interest rates finally being raised on Wednesday, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to in 2022 as well as the following decade. The FED has announced a 0.25% rate hike with what sounds like a target of 7 this year, leaving the target range somewhere between 1.75%-2.00%. What does this mean? It means money is becoming more expensive to borrow. This results in a tightening of the money supply in both the market and the economy. Borrowed money is permanently returned and removed from the system. To put it simply, imagine your credit card interest rate rising from 10% to 20%: you are not only less inclined to spend, but also pressured to pay off any outstanding debt ASAP. Hence the fear of money(outstanding debt) flowing out of markets and back to the lenders.\n\nExactly how much is 1.75%, and is it going to be enough to bring down inflation? Well, the inflation rate came in at a reported 7.9% last month. Most of us already know this number is detached from reality, the inflation calculation has been altered over the years to favor government irresponsibility. Using inflation calculations from 1980, the inflation rate would be at 16%. This sounds more reasonable and in line with the price increases we all have experienced.\n\nSource: [http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate\\_data/inflation-charts](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6buhfirsmo81.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6d35faf42483685ab1147a1ce8283b157e7e33\n\nBelow is a chart of interest rates (orange) vs inflation (blue). Every time inflation gets out of control, rates are hiked in order to tame it. Back in the 1970\u2019s, with inflation at around 12%, we needed hikes of 13% to bring it under control. Using the FEDs silly terms, that is 1300 BPS. Again in the 1970\u2019s we saw near 15% inflation and 19% rates (1900 BPS) needed to bring it down. Nearly every year that inflation skyrockets, interest rates need to match or exceed in order to bring it under control. However, there is one difference between now and pre 2008, quantitative easing (aka uncontrolled money printing). When so much of our economy is reliant on printed money (debt), reeling the line back in is an impossible feat without a total collapse.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osa7xnzssmo81.jpg?width=2050&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82fa3e37f2943e44c843c5f3349ed461612ae7bc\n\nOne look at 2018 and you begin to see the problem with rising interest rates in a debt dependent economy. **Back in 2015, the FED decided to start raising interest rates to maintain a 2% inflation target for the coming years. This caused a massive strain on markets, resulting in both the NASDAQ and S&P500 dropping \\~18% in 2018. After seeing this, the FED promptly reversed the decision.**\n\nThe stock market and most assets are completely built upon and reliant on debt. **Quantitative easing has turned our economy into a ponzi scheme with ever ballooning prices. Cutting access to that debt through interest rate hikes begins a cascading effect of \u201cmargin calls\u201d. As one person goes to settle their debt, the outflow of money puts pressure on everyone else to repay their outstanding debt.** One of the largest contributing factors to the 1929 market crash was Margin debt. Margin isn\u2019t the problem, uncontrolled debt is.\n\nThis is why your schizophrenic, QAnon supporting uncle has been screaming that the global economy is about to crash every year for the past decade. This is at the core of gay bear ideaology. So why hasn\u2019t it happened? And will it happen?\n\nThe entire goal of the FED is self preservation, they will do whatever they need to do to keep the economy from exploding. In what scenario will a bank or the FED EVER tell you they don\u2019t have something under control? Doing so would cause panic, bank runs, and your uncle\u2019s wet dream coming true. **The FED will find any reason to keep printing. If 2018 is any indicator, a reversal on rate hikes is inevitable.**\n\nNow moving on to how the recent interest hikes affect gold. **If you don\u2019t know by now, gold is an unproductive asset. It doesn\u2019t produce anything, it doesn\u2019t grow, and it certainly doesn\u2019t offer dividends. Opportunity cost is the price you pay for holding a stable asset while everything else around you is ballooning higher.** **Why hold gold, when you can gain 2% a year from bonds or 8% average from stocks? That premise is all based on the FED taming inflation, resulting in your 2% and 8% gains outpacing inflation.**\n\n**As commodity & energy prices rise, so do the input costs of your favorite tech companies. Everything from running servers, to buying equipment, to maintenance all have energy or commodity costs associated with them**.\n\nNow combine this with consumer spending. **When the average consumer\u2019s bills go up, their consumer good spending plummets.** Let\u2019s take a look at what happens to Jane\u2019s $2500 paycheck as rent, gas prices, and food soars. Jane used to pay $1000 for rent, $400 for food, and $200 in gas/utilities. This left her with about $900 to spend on consumer goods produced by your favorite companies in the stock market. Now that her rent is $1300, food $600, and $300 in utilities, her spending allowance is a third of what it was at $300. Even advertisement centered businesses like facebook/google see profit losses as less buying results in less marketing by companies. **Nearly every company is dependent on the average consumer\u2019s spending in one way or another.**\n\nOk we get it there\u2019s going to be lower profit margins for stocks, but where does this leave gold? Fundamentally, higher interest rates should mean that it\u2019s more beneficial to secure your money in bonds; but what happens when the real rates (meaning the interest rates adjusted for inflation) are negative? If inflation is rising faster than interest rates, bond buyers are bleeding money.\n\nAs many of us know, the market looks ahead 6 months+ attempting to price in any future events. It\u2019s why the stock market was falling before rates were actually hiked, and why so many people complain about the stock market soaring on expected bad news (it was priced in). **Anticipation of bad news suppresses prices. That pressure is lifted when the expected news actually occurs. This is only true for expected events as unexpected events cannot be priced in.**\n\nGold prices are no different. **Back between 2011 and 2015, gold prices drilled to local lows in anticipation of interest rate hikes.** **No one wanted to hold gold knowing that in a few years the FED would raise interest rates**, their money would be better off in bonds or elsewhere if that happened. This was the market pricing in rate hikes in the price of gold. **The exact month that the FED hiked rates marked the bottom in gold. The following 4 years saw one of the largest bull runs in gold even with interest rates rising.** The price was so suppressed in anticipation of FED responsibility that it ballooned higher when rates slowly increased. Once the FED reversed, and COVID forced interest rates to 0, gold went parabolic all the way to $2000/oz in August 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yoy0hdbusmo81.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c32c1010dad500e326612fd9a0e949c4d8340c5d\n\n**So here we are again with an 18 month consolidation in gold prices as the market waited in anticipation of rate hikes and FED responsibility. During some of the highest inflation we have seen in US history, gold went from over $2000 in summer of 2020, to reaching $1700 lows near the end of 2021.**\n\nHow is this supposed inflation hedge losing value in the 18 months after COVID. Even after massive money printing, record inflation, wars, and every other event that should be sending gold higher?\n\nIt all comes down to the market pricing in interest rates and responsibility from the FED, which effectively suppresses the price. The market expected FED \u201cresponsibility\u201d, but it\u2019s time to face the music and Powell ain\u2019t dancing. **Now that rate hikes are actually happening, the pressure on gold prices is being lifted.** There is a decade-long bull run in commodities coming and gold is not going to be the only player. Uranium, silver, and gold will be the trade of the decade.\n\n**TLDR: Input costs for stocks rising, consumer spending cut due to inflation bills. Anticipation of rate hikes has suppressed gold prices, actual rate hike always mark the bottom in gold prices historically speaking (buy the rumor, sell the news). Debt dependent economy cannot sustain rate hikes, the fed reversed in rate hikes 2018 after stocks crashed and will do it again.**\n\n**Please at least read the bold in the post.**\n\n**Positions:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tts09p00tmo81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f5f6c839ddb474eded2f5e5e05a234e3516d629\n\n50% of my account is in $AG first majestic shares (a junior miner with one of, if not the highest leverage to gold & silver).

It was a moment that began in May 2018 when the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018, effectively clearing the way for legalized sports gambling.\n\nLegal sports betting is currently allowed in\u00a030 states and Washington, D.C., and [the Washington Post reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/01/14/legal-sports-betting-states-2022/) that number will only increase. Some states have restrictions on the type of betting, with Oregon banning betting on college sports, and states such as Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia restricting betting to in-state college teams.\n\nWhile some critics [have raised concerns](https://www.vox.com/recode/22947732/phones-sports-betting-gambling-apple-google-march-madness) that legalized betting could enable people with gambling addictions to lose a life-ruining amount of money, many states have the viewpoint that people will place bets no matter what, so they may as well get some taxable revenue out of it.

Coupon-clipping types are playing them against each other to make risk-free bets.\n\nDave is a 34-year-old high school guidance counselor from Buffalo, but his true calling is hunting deals. He and his wife started out as extreme couponers, buying up massive supplies of shampoo and paper towels for a fraction of their usual cost. From there they moved on to credit card sign-up bonuses and, between the two of them, opened more than 100 accounts. In July the couple paid for their six-week, 13-country honeymoon almost entirely with points and miles. But Dave had never considered applying his deal-hunting skills to gambling until he attended a talk at ZorkFest, a conference in Las Vegas that promises to help patrons wring every last dollar out of corporate promotional offers. There, a presenter explained how people in Colorado had used a system called matched betting to make tens of thousands of dollars harvesting intro bonuses and free bets from online sportsbooks.\n\nIt was simple, the man said. Use a promo offer to bet on one team to win a game, and then hedge the bet by wagering a mathematically precise amount of cash on the other team. This system, he claimed, could guarantee a predictable, risk-free profit, no matter which team won. And you could keep at it for as long as sportsbooks continued to offer more giveaways.\n\nDave was intrigued, but he had no legal outlet for sports gambling once he flew home from Nevada, so he put the idea out of his mind. \u201cBut fast-forward to January,\u201d he says, when the state of New York legalized online sports betting, \u201cand I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh shoot, what was that guy talking about in Vegas?\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\nAt that point Dave, who asked that I use only his first name to conceal his identity from sportsbooks, had made just a single sports bet in his life. While enjoying a comped drink in a New Orleans casino (another miles-covered trip), he\u2019d wagered $100 on a multi-leg parlay that required Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen to surpass an improbable number of benchmarks, including one for passing yardage. As Dave remembers it, Allen came up 10 yards short. \u201cI was 0 for 1 in my sports betting career,\u201d he says. But he also noticed that every time he used the internet, he was barraged with ads for promotional offers: a $3,000 deposit match and $300 site credit from Caesars, a $1,000 risk-free bet from FanDuel, and a $5,000 risk-free bet from DraftKings, along with a series of smaller deals.\n\n\u201cSo I started asking around,\u201d Dave recalls, \u201cnetworking with people that I\u2019ve met over the years that are really into this hobby of maximizing the return on their spending.\u201d One of them pointed him to the r/sportsbook forum on Reddit and, specifically, a post from \u201cthis really mysterious, shadowy figure named DarkHorse.\u201d\n\nDarkHorseOdds, to use his full handle, seemed to have anticipated all of Dave\u2019s questions in a multipage explainer headed \u201cNew Yorkers: How to make $7K guaranteed from these sign-up offers.\u201d He wrote, \u201cDepending on how the bets play out, you\u2019ll need anywhere from $9,250-$15,750 to do this. The size of the winnings scale with the size of the bets. If you don\u2019t have that much to commit, you just won\u2019t make as much.\u201d And $7,000 in winnings was merely the start, he added, because sportsbooks would continue to send new offers even after you played through the initial deals.\n\nThe post amounted to a more technical version of the strategy Dave had heard about in Vegas. DarkHorseOdds offered users a four-phase, nine-step plan for exactly how to play the different companies\u2019 sign-up deals against each other, beginning with BetRivers and DraftKings. \u201c1. On BR: Activate the $250 bonus. This might take 48 hours to appear after your deposit. 2. On DK: Place the $5 to win $200 in Free Bets. Do NOT opt into the $5,000 Risk Free Bet on DK yet.\u201d And so on.\n\nR/sportsbook has only 279,000 members (or \u201cdegens,\u201d as the forum\u2019s \u201cAbout Community\u201d tab calls them), compared with the 11.8 million users on its more famous cousin r/wallstreetbets, but it features a similar aspirational ethos. Although many posts are sports bar arguments about which team is the surest bet that day, there\u2019s also a constant background chatter about how best to cash in on the billions of dollars bookmakers have spent over the past few years to attract new customers. Below DarkHorseOdds\u2019 post, someone using the screen name GirderErection asked, \u201cSerious questions. Should I take out a personal loan and pay the bank back next week?\u201d Another user, squaredeel, replied, \u201cHave you considered refinancing your home? Rates at 3% right now, free money imo.\u201d\n\nAt first, Dave had trouble following DarkHorseOdds\u2019 explanations. \u201cIt was like a foreign language to me, all the odds and the nomenclature,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I read it, and I read it again, and I read it like another dozen times.\u201d Eventually he was persuaded enough to open accounts at all four mobile sportsbooks then operating in New York. Over a three-day weekend he made a series of bets that escalated in size, culminating in a wager north of $11,000 with Caesars on the National Hockey League\u2019s Dallas Stars to defeat the Montreal Canadiens, hedged with a $5,000 \u201crisk-free bet\u201d from DraftKings on Montreal.\n\nDave was guaranteed to win a little more than $3,000, no matter the final score. Even so, he says, betting a quarter of his annual salary on a hockey game was terrifying. \u201cIt felt like a rocket ship, like the fire was burning as I\u2019m going back and forth between the two different screens,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then, when I finally clicked bet on both and it went through, it was like the rocket ship went off.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuman error is really the biggest risk. The math is sound. Two plus two equals four every time\u201d", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "none of this has provided any proof that making a BET isnt gambling, the original point. \n\nJesus man, you still cant come up with verifiable proof of that\n\nits a bet, thats gambling. youre literally wrong sorry", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You're really dense.\n\nOr a convincing troll.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "youre arguing definitions bruh", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, what's the definition of matched betting?

{"title": "Blackrock Crisis Part 4", "selftext": "Is BLK still going to 0?\n\n**TLDR:** Yes.\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7qm7s/blackrock_crisis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t82pod/blackrock_crisis_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tbwd2h/blackrock_crisis_part_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nOh Blackrock, you big beautiful fucked bastard, I am so excited to buy up all your shit with the money I make on you on the way down. \n\n**Quick summary of 1-3:** \n\nBlackrock is a equity holding giant, the vast majority of their revenue comes from that little MER section at the bottom of the ETF description that you idiots never read. They hold 40% of their crappy overvalued holdings internationally and a boat load of that is worthless Chinese equities and properties. Blackrock owns the world and the world is overvalued. How is China looking since my last post? Not so good huh? A bit of a relief rally during last week's quad witch party was nice for some BABA holding degens, but lets be clear... China is fucked. Since my last post we have seen new lockdowns and a 2008 style sell off as a result. Granted it was gobbled up when the CCP announced they were going full JPOW but we'll see how that goes.  \n\nAll in all Blackrock has been bleeding out for months and as you can see in part 2 I circled this week as a nice little buying opportunity for you guys. I sold some of my April puts around $680, and just went all the way back in gorilla style today for May dated OTM puts. \n\nThis week we're talking about **BONDS:**\n\nThe bond market is rattled at the fed for raising rates too slowly. Last time we talked about how the mortgage rate was moving independently from the real rates, time to look at those pesky yields. Blackrock like another asset manager works with leverage, therefore they have to paying off debt on the majority of their holdings. As yields increase the payments to service that debt increases and with the majority of its revenue coming from that tasty MER or a percentage of their investment holdings their ability to service that debt is dropping and will drop much further as equities and assets continue to correct. Take a look at what the 10 yr is up to recently:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6ckgqnp2so81.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=369fcd2bd283766ca0e29fc7a88e7c8e374895c0\n\nGood luck paying off that debt during the upcoming recession. Oh and if oil ripping up 50% wasn't a good enough recession indicator how about **the yield curve**. If you've never heard of anything before you won't know that yields are supposed to go up the longer the maturation period. i.e. 1<2<5<10<20<30 At the time of writing this Bond yields are:\n\n2yr: 2.107%\n\n5yr: 2.312%\n\n10yr: 2.299%\n\n20yr: 2.647\n\n30yr: 2.523\n\nSo far the 5 and the 10 are inverted as well as the 20 and the 30. The classic ones to watch though are the **2 and the 10**, so lets check those out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn4gzjb73so81.png?width=1843&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a81d8b375f6d04389e0de148a2c383a9156c875\n\nOof... Give it a week or two and we'll see the inversion.\n\nLast little chart to take a peak at even for dummy bulls who think we're back on easy mode. Here is **BLK and SPY from 2018.** You can see even though spy had a bit of a rally before the bid dump at the end of the year, BLK was pretty much a steady blead all year. \n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekq10k5n3so81.png?width=1850&format=png&auto=webp&s=1237e8a02206c2cb103685b9f7b3da9553b9f948\n\n**TLDR:** Buckle up. we're dumping.\n\n**Positions:** INB4 yeah last week was ass, but sold the last of my other positions in my gambling portfolio and dumped them in to buy the put dip.\n\nBLK Apr 14 22 630P\n\nBLK May 20 22 650P", "id": "tjig56", "created_utc": 1647887246.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4374|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tbwd2h/blackrock_crisis_part_3/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7qm7s/blackrock_crisis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t82pod/blackrock_crisis_part_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tjig56/blackrock_crisis_part_4/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mp6wu9/leveraged_index_etfs_as_longterm_holds/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tjig56)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tjig56)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5049811601638794}, {"body": "It\u2019s simple, if OP can\u2019t spell **bleed** I\u2019m in", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "Underrated.", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17905345559120178}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.015016861259937286}, {"body": "Blackrock owns everything, ur astronomically retarded if u think it's going to 0", "score": 294, "replies": [{"body": "Owning everything and having liabilities against those assets is no assurance of solvency in the long run.

{"title": "South Park Investment Theory (deeper dive)", "selftext": "Ten months ago, u/robertisaak proposed, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naehn4/south_park_investment_theory/) on wsb, using a portfolio derived from South Park episodes. He promised to return with a graph but never did. I took it upon myself to continue his research. \n\nWhile the show definitely had its tenbaggers, I assumed that the good calls on Build A Bear Workshop, Tesla ($TSLA), Apple ($AAPL), Sony ($SONY), Amazon ($AMZN) were just lucky, and, all-in-all, the performance should be roughly on par with an index (let's say S&P500, as it uses the same acronym). \n\nI did however decide to look deeper into it, and to my surprise, a very simple South Park Index^[1] drastically outperforms S&P.\n\nThis is how they actually compare:  [2009-2022 graph \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80](https://i.imgur.com/VhUObvd.jpg). \n\nA different comparison showing how good our South Park predictions are is the following: consider you buy a stock mentioned in an episode during that day and keep it for a month, respectively a year - how does the performance compare to buying $SPY on that day? Average returns:\n\n* **1 month hold**: South Park Stock: 5.93% \ud83d\ude80 vs S&P 0.93%\n* **1 year hold**: South Park Stock: 35.42% \ud83d\ude80 vs S&P 11.86%\n\nWhile past performance doesn't guarantee future performance and this approach has some small biases^[2], the numbers make it quite clear that South Park has been a really good stock selector. But why is that? You could argue that the publicity that it brought helped, but it's definitely too small of an impact for the large-cap stocks (i.e. AAPL, AMZN). Most likely it's just the fact that the episodes tend to focus on things disrupting & impacting our society, those things that change the way we do things ($TSLA, $AAPL, $TWTR), those we love ($SONY) and those we hate ($AMZN). Buying such companies at an early time is a good way to make a strong return (especially in a long Bull Market).\n\nSo, should you buy the next stock mentioned? Maybe, probably. \n!!This is not financial advice!!\n \n\n[1] The index is an **equal-weighted** combo of all stocks mentioned in episodes in the previous 18 months, and they are \n\n[2] Mainly survivor bias\n\nMore detailed info on data preparation, biases, portfolio construction & rebalancing in my yt on this: https://youtu.be/8CRYaVEQD-4\n\n\n**Later Edit:** By popular demand, here's how the same index construction (except this time position is set the next trading day, as Simpsons airs on Sundays) would perform for **The Simpsons** [2009-2022 Graph](https://i.imgur.com/dTb05BF.jpg).

I can't find a video of the direct quote but [here](https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Timmy_2000/Script) if you search for \"stocks\" one of the doctors notes that Ritalin stocks are up \"ten points\" and that \"That's easily another twenty grand apiece!\".

I'm convinced its a reason why we still have Randy owning and operating a pot farm; they want to eventually make a real life marijuana business, but they just need it to be decriminalized before they can do it.
