You need to account for more than just the price movement. Options are super hard to trade and make consistent profits. \n\nNo joke, it's much easier to do what everyone suggests and move on to simple DCA into SPY.\n\n================\n\nBut if you still really want to go down that route, here are a few of my recommendations:\n\n1) Use a tiny size of your account for Options No more than 5 to 10% for beginners total.\n\n2) Until you are very comfortable and have been consistently not losing money, stick to spreads to reduce costs/losses to time decay.\n\n3) Do not get greedy, take profits up 40, Hell even 20% in some cases. When in doubt, close it out. Especially if you can walk away green.\n\n4) Position size. Remember that 5 to 10 percent? Divide that up by another 5 to 10. Until you are really comfortable and making consistsnt profits, Stick to 1 to 2 option plays per week max.\n\n5) Before you open a position, consider the market conditions. Is it super volatile with uncertainty? Is it super stable? How fair of a price are you paying for an option play?\n\nConsider selling Options during high IV.\nConsider buying when low IV.\n\nSince it's hard to get Options price fairly, spreads can again, help mitigate this.\n\n6) Have an exit plan, whether in losses or gains. Ask yourself why you are playing this and if you actually have a goof enough reason to enter. Afterwards pretend it's a million dollar position. Would it still be acceptable? If yes, Consider going ahead.\n\n7) Above all protect your precious capital and take breaks when things haven't been working for a bit.\n\n8) In the end, don't forget to breath, it's just money after all, not your health, or your life.\n\n9) Make sure to not skip the exit plan and understand what the risks are for holding till expiration.\n\n10) If all else fails, consider taking an option trade a day on a PLAY money account. Keep in mind that the options prices that fill, will likely not ever be as lucrative in the real world. However, this does not invalidate the experience that one gains here.\n\n11) Bonus, Don't be afraid to admit you are wrong or know much less than you think. The quicker one sets their ego aside, the less likely they are to hurt their exchange account over silly moves that \"literally can't go tits up.\" Never stop reading/watching helpful videos and practicing your trade. After all, it's a skill that needs a lifetime to master. This space is ultra competitve, it takes a very long time to build an account and only one potential bad play to blow it all up.\n\n\nI'm glad thar OP posted this.

I tend to use a 0.15 delta or less for the puts I sell, which often correlates to a 5%-10% or so discount from the current stock price.   \n\nExample SPY is at 448 right now as I write this.  A 7% discount (approx 0.12 delta) would be a strike of 420.  Looking out two weeks to Apr 8 you would receive approx $177.   \n\nNow **$177** ***premium*** **/ $42,000** ***money held as collateral for assignment*** **= 0.41%**  Repeat it every **two weeks** and you get:  **0.41% x 26** ***trades*** **= 10.6%** for the year.\n\nIf you get assigned you simply sell the call for whatever amount you like above the strike you were assigned on.   I usually aim for about a 3% capital profit.  So in the above example if I got assigned at 420 I would start out selling a call for around 435 and adjust each time downward or upward depending on if I really wanted to dump the shares quickly or not.  \n\nNow the question for you is to determine what underlying stock best fits your portfolio to allow you to execute this type of a strategy in a consistent, patient, disciplined manner.
