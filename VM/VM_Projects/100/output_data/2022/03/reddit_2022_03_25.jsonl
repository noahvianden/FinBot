We just said\u2026 Elon has dogey and \nBam, everyone bought dogecoin. Facebook had tons of banks, big companies  , advance coders and backers \nAnd nope.  No way anyone will give any info to Facebook or trust Facebook in any way or form.\n\nSo the writing is on the wall IMO,\nFacebook will eventually go out along w boomers and Instagram will soon loose to tiktok.\nInstagram has also become this toxic Narcisistic platform and kids are not adopting it. \nFacebook is the platform that does better with ads.

{"title": "Amazon vs. Tesla - what are your thoughts?", "selftext": "Over the past 5 quarters, Amazon\u2019s operating income has been getting decimated by inflation. The share price has been range bound for the past two years. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income has exploded. They\u2019ve been range bound while their PE has compressed from over 1000 down to 180. In other words, through their impeccable execution, they\u2019ve delivered unbelievable margins while continuing to scale. Amazon and Tesla are two companies that have been range bound for roughly the same duration. That sometimes means they\u2019re about to make a swing in either direction. I\u2019d put a spread trade on the two (Tesla up and amazon down) for the following reason: Tesla\u2019s operating income has exploded sequentially for the past 5 quarters while amazons has done the exact opposite. I also think amazon is going to take a -$9 eps hit in Q1 driven by rivian and continued operating expense inflation. In Q1 \u201821 amazon hit $16 eps. This is a negative differential of -$25 eps out of the total $67 eps they made in all of 2021. And that's after only one quarter! That means their PE ratio is set to sky rocket with limited upside growth on top line revenue. Tesla on the other hand is just starting this journey. They built the infrastructure during a period pre-inflation and are flooded with cash. In an inflationary environment, you want/need improving margins.

The cells themselves are cheap and the assembly process to put them into a pack is cheap and easy because they're larger cells. Cheap all-around. They think a battery pack is just an EV gas tank and therefore they massively under-estimate the technological challenge ahead of them. They've made their choice and are starting to built their own gigafactories that will *scale up* this massive mistake in huge numbers with the sunken cost fallacy sinking its teeth in exponentially deeper over time.\n\nRIVN will have its own challenges like any startup. They won't be perfect. But they will suddenly get massive support as it becomes more obvious just how bad and inept the old giants are at EVs right at a time when demand for brand new ICEs will start to crash. Americans love their trucks and many of them depend on them. But a lot of ranchers are doing just fine with their 10-20yo diesel dualies. A lot of them can wait to buy new if they think an EV alternative will be coming in the next 5-10 years. Despite the coal-rolling stereotypes these people can balance a checkbook and are tech-savvy. Farm country was an early adopter of smartphones and most tractors and combines are tech powerhouses.
