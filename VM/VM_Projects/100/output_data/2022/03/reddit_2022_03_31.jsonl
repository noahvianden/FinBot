This pushes up interest rates on mortgages.

Think California and New York. \n\nThese are high value real estate areas. So, people use the cash from selling a home in Californian to pay cash for a lower priced home in Arizona. It's really not new. It occurs to secure the purchase the home in their new state of residence. In fact, I've read articles where a builder voided a contract to sell to an all cash buyer for an extra $100,000. Cash buyers often outbid buyers needing a mortgage. \n\nThe other aspect is ibuyers - Zillow and others buying properties with hedge fund money. How can you compete? In a rising market, you make money especially with low interest rates. \n\nLast point, mortgage rates are not high at 4 to 5%. In 1981, mortgage rates averaged 16.63%. That's Freddie Mac data. Run an amortization using the median home price for 2021 of $346,000 with 20% down. \n\nOh hell, you won't do that. So, here are the numbers for a 30 year mortgage at 3.5, 5.5 7.5 & 16.5%. Mortgage amount of $276,800. Payments are respectively $1,243, $1,572, $1,935 & $3,834. Higher interest rates make a big, big difference. Couple that with unemployment at some point and a recession.

You don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming or when it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s irrelevant to the current conversation unless you can state with uncertainty that we are in a recession and job losses are coming. \n\nCurrent market shows available job openings at all time highs.

In order to pay taxes at the 70% rate a married couple filing jointing had to have an income $215,000. Per capita income was around $10,000 or $20,000 for a couple. \n\nI never mentioned housing inventory. But, the exodus of sellers is real and has an impact on home prices in other states. \n\nAccording the NBER, the US is in the longest period of expansion on record.

We have barely seen the fed increase rates beyond 5% for much of the last 30 years. \n\nIf you are arguing a recession will soon hit. Well maybe. Who knows.
