{"title": "Money printer stopping, political chaos, inflation, interest rates increasing, entering \ud83d\udc3b market territory. How is everyone feeling right now?", "selftext": "As the title suggests, how is everyone feeling right now? Like truly, how is everyone feeling during these times because as much as we want to try to add humor to our mega capital losses through memes and trying to brush it off, I know some of you are still looking in the mirror asking how could you lose all that money you worked soo hard for. Money you probably needed or money your family could use. Maybe it was tuition money or money for a rainy day. Regardless, losing is part of trading but it sure beats you down and makes you lose confidence in ever trading again. It may even traumatize you enough to the point you may never trade the same way and that\u2019s okay. \n\nI personally have been there when i first started investing solo, no advisors and strictly going with my gut picks on individual stocks instead of just investing more into my 401k or into ETFs to reduce risk and take tax advantage. What happened literally a few days after i poured a bunch of money into the market  on my individual picks i researched a ton on? The pandemic hit LOL, how lucky right? Never seen 50% of my investment disappear like that before with no idea what to do because I was a novice of trading solo. I had shares and looking back I could\u2019ve averaged down and kept holding. Instead i sold at 50% loss and I tried soo hard to get my losses back. I shorted the market and invested in gold stocks and luckily for me it panned out after months of grinding. But had i even done nothing and held my shares i would not only have made my money back but some of these at ath were at 10x+. Not saying i would\u2019ve diamond held for that long but my point is this:\n\nIdentify what you did wrong and mitigate it from ever happening again. If you trust your stock picks just hold and keep avg down on any big drops. Have stop losses and try to learn through paper trading or through tiny investments first before going ballz deep. When you win keep in mind someone else is losing so take your wins and temporarily celebrate but be grateful you were on the winning side and thank the players for their sacrifice. Many people lose a ton of money and never trade again. My advice is to never give up if you truly enjoy the process because i obsessed over trading everyday. I am no pro, but I learned a ton through losing and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t give up because I love trading, i love researching, i love business, and I love these communities where we can share each other\u2019s stories and help one another win and beat the big man. \n\nHats off to all you apes \ud83e\udd8d who keep on grinding everyday and keep learning and invest in yourself to get better at your craft because practice and experience does make the difference. I am not a millionaire nor am I telling you to do anything, but my passion is telling stories and experiences that can help others going through similar situations and letting them know it will be Okay. \n\nI believe in you my fellow apes \ud83e\udd8d and keep on keeping on!\n\nEDIT: The market is down 20% so that is considered \ud83d\udc3b territory. Do we have more room down? Who knows. I am hedging my bets with some puts/shorts but not much invested. My post wasn\u2019t to tell everyone the world is ending and to buy puts, but to let everyone who feels discouraged to not give up and keep grinding because you will recover. Just learn from your mistakes.

Rinse, repeat. \n\nSame thing with financial sectors, airlines, utilities, weed stocks. You can see it today. Airlines sold off like a motherfucker on oil news.

I have some long dated calls to reduce volatility swings but what else is there?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think EVs and ENPH are people buying with the idea that they will have big profits in the future. But the future isn't now. \n\nIt happened a lot during the COVID crash. People buying heavy on airlines, cruise lines, green energy etc. in anticipation of demand and profits. But they weren't prepared to wait. And those stocks went insane because of people having free money.\n\nWhen I look at ENPH's chart, it really looks like an artificial fad rally t the moment based on instituons knowing that people will think \"Oil is so high. EV and GREEN is the future!\" and buy them.\n\nI'm anticipating a dump of all those. Any chart that's 1 month or more seems to affirm that. Institutions will cycle back in when they're done shaking out the easy money.\n\nEVs are absolutely the future. But car sales were off the charts 2020-2021. People only buy one car (maybe two) every few years. Consumer discretionary is tanking, commodities to manufacture them are pricey..\n\nSo I'm waiting for a good long entry on all of them once the current hype calms down. If one EV or green company posts shit projections for 2022 that'll be all it will take. \n\nLike you, I have commodities and enegy stocks - but I've been swing trading. Taking profits when they pump. Grabbing small amounts when they dump. \n\nI have been doing the same with metals (PPTL PALL SLV GLD GDX) and fertilizer/Agriculture (MOS SMG DBA GRWG VFF) They all still have room to climb but might see a pullback first.\n\nMilitary stocks are worth a thought LMT GD BA, KTOS, MAXR. Current war has caused people to invest more in military (though I still need to research who supplies Europe with their gear).\n\nI'm holding TLT. Based on: \n\nBonds are ignored as an asset class. That will likely change pretty quickly when the market tanks. People completely misunderstand how yields work, thinking they will rise. They'll drop first. Because of that miscalculation, bonds are really undervalued. Better yet, they are incredibly heavily shorted. \n\nThey won't shine for a while yet. But they will have their day. I've got a small long position and some waaaay far out ITM calls.\n\nADM KO DLTR MKC MCD are also worth a look (along with COST but that's not really well priced). Consumer staples and discount goods are king in a recession. \n\nI have a mix of the top holdings of XLF (why pay the fee when you can buy banks yourself easily). FCFS UPST (that's been fun to swing trade).  Lending seems like a distant idea but it's coming soon enough. Banks do well with higher interest rates. And they're priced lower now because of Russia.\n\nCXW is also a sad but smart stock choice, IMO. A lot of unrest is coming.\n\nThen there are the chip stocks that will have their comeback in a long time to consider. I'm taking very small positions on the best of those when they drop.\n\nGood health sector stocks seem smart. Same thing with cybersecurity (CIBR PANW - though they just had a short term pump) as well as robotics and weed along with MNMD (which will need some years to pay off, probably). Big data is also a good choice, IMO. \n\nI'm also looking beyond our borders now. \n\nThe U.S. trade deficit is at all time highs. The dollar is on a rip. I'm looking at countries that are doing better than us in a lot of ways.\n\nRecently, a lot of money hit the U.S. equity market based on its stability. I think theyre rethinking that now. That money is going to go elsewhere for the next while. Some of mine will too.\n\nI'm still researching the best foreign markets to look at while holding FRDM until I get more specific ideas. EEM looks near bottom too.\n\nEWW is a thought. Based on:\n\nBig imports to the U.S. (who is close so that will mitigate transportation costs soaring). They didn't go insane with financial assistance during the pandemic too. Debt to GDP is half America's.\n\nAgriculture economy (50% of land area is agricultural) which will fare well with the insane food shortages and prices. \n\n2019 saw 23.46% of their energy produced from green sources so the oil mess won't hit them as hard. \n\nThe EWW chart looks a lot more gentle than QQQ SPY. 6 month chart all the way to 5yrs. shows solid support $43-$45. 2yr. shows solid support around current levels.\n\nAnd they are about the last country on earth who will get involved in the geopolitical mess (though domestic politics can be an obvious concern).\n \nOther options are MELI, ILF, EWZ, EIDO, EPI, EWY, VNM.\n\nI can't vouch for those yet. I don't have enough research done.\n\nI would be all over Chinese stocks. They aren't about to start shit with the U.S. and are playing the middle when it comes to Russia. China is out for China. The best strategy is not to ruffle any feathers and trade with everyone. They are the U.S.'s biggest trading partner. Plus they just lowered interest rates.\n\nThe only problem is their economy getting wrecked over their real estate mess.
