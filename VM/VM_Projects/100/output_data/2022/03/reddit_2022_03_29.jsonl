Google's third-party reseller attach rate goal is around 90%, whereas AWS is around 25%.\n\nBelieve it or not, I think that that structure - heavily relying on third party resellers - is what's causing the lag in the ceiling for them on Cloud, too.  The reseller ecosystem started in the MS-Office to Google Apps days, margins are thin on licensing so integrators had to spend time + resources chasing SOWs for things like migrations, etc., to make up the difference.\n\nNow, as Google has pivoted more heavily towards Cloud + trying to make that inroad, there's a bit of an educational challenge where there's a dearth of knowledgeable talent that can deploy, manage + service G Suite, but not so much GCP.  It's going to take them a bit longer to gain market share, but ***market share is the goal***. \n\nMeanwhile - AWS had the earliest lead-in time (having no other core products to focus on), the best 'early story' (\"It's what [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) runs on\"), and the most aggressive tactics (don't involve partners, grab every workload you can)\n\nMS also had / has the strategic advantage of just so -- much -- legacy.  I'd wager that products across GCP rival that of MS or AWS lb:lb, but that's a far cry away from changing hearts and minds of the old MS stalwarts.\n\nTL;DR - Google has a lot of headroom for years of growth, and is positioned well with their focus on the partner ecosystem that, while proving a bottleneck in the short term, will likely end up being an accelerator in the long term.

I'm baffled how people still continue to buy Tesla, my brother, my friends, etc, people who just started investing in 2020. They see Tesla go from $800- $900 and think \"wow, I could've made so much it went up $100!\" Meanwhile, I'm making even more from other stocks based on % ROI, this shows you how dumb retail is. I have a lot of friends who buy Tesla and think a $50 gain is good from their initial amount invested, rather than actually considering the %...\n\nI personally think Tesla as a stock is a beast, but the company doesn't reflect the stocks price or the company's future prospects. So while I am an early investor, I admittedly take profit and invest in NIO, BYDD, Honda, AMBL, Uxin, mining companies, etc. The reason is because these companies either provide more stability, diversification, exposure, etc. I've considered heavily reinvesting in UBER and maybe even DiDi because I do think data collecting is important and could be sold, but UBER does not at these prices, DiDi perhaps. I think you're all clowns for buying Tesla and the risk versus reward is just not worth it. There is so much downside with Tesla as a stock, but the company will continue to do well. My average is low so even if it were to come down, I would still be green and not care.\n\n**THOUGHTS ON OTHER EV**\n\nI don't particularly care for a lot of charging stocks, and I think most American companies tend to be overvalued. Rivian and Lucid are terrible excuses for stock and ride the American hype train circle jerk. This means that despite these companies having questionable performances, lack of actual credibility to justify the stock price, and lack future prospects, people want an American EV they can go to, I get it. But that doesn't mean I would invest in these companies, especially at their evaluation based on those things I consider along with the market being the primary U.S., which isn't all that great and being niche.\n\n**Chinese EV**\n\nI'm a China BULL, I don't believe the FUD.  Common arguments are:\n\n1. Chinese stocks get delisted. It will never happen unless the world were to end. Wall Street wouldn't allow it and definitely have control over the SEC, we already saw how corrupt Wall Street is and how little they care about morals or ethics just in 2020/2021 alone. Too many people would lobby for Chinese stocks. But not only this, if it were to happen because the U.S. is so reliant on China, the U.S. would crumble. But here's the thing, China owns the means of production, is a creditor nation, has its own network of providers of goods, is owning the resources, owns real goods, has a government and stronger control over its people, along with stronger unity. This means that China can always navigate through obstacles and complete a task as a country, substantially better than the U.S., which is divided and is on a path towards much slower growth. The U.S. cannot be stressed tested as much as China can, which is why the delisting would never happen. The U.S. cannot afford to create any social disorder because the country socially, economically, politically, geopolitically, just isn't as strong as it once was. Americans do need a reality check.\n2. China is focusing on selling EVs primarily in Asia and Europe. I don't even care if Chinese companies come to the U.S. and neither should you. The only reason I would want NIO or BYDD to come to America is for brand recognition and the forcing of more intertwining of supply chains, goods, and services. But besides that, the U.S. is not a favorable market for EVs compared to China and Europe. If the U.S. did not have control over the largest stock exchanges, no one would care if EVs were sold in America or not. If China or Europe held the largest stock exchanges, no one would care what the SEC or perception of American retail investors think along with any other voice, which makes sense. \n\ntldr; if all Chinese stocks get delisted, the U.S. will suffer more and have much more to lose. The U.S. cannot afford to delist Chinese stocks. I also know the U.S. is the king of the deficit is on the decline, loves to use its status as the reserved currency, loves to take advantage of the world's financial regulator, the bigger picture is, the U.S. has been losing leverage over the global financial system. So these problems and FUD with China become less probable each day that passes. A big problem is that U.S. politicians, retail investors in America or who own U.S. stocks, U.S. economy, all rely heavily on U.S. stocks performing well, so there will always be unfair rhetoric in favor of U.S. stocks, this is despite U.S. being over valued with less future prospects.\n\nIf China and the U.S. were viewed as companies. The U.S. is an old dinosaur company that pays dividends but has no future prospects, has bad management, the employees want to quit and constantly fight, its management from the top to bottom is corrupt.\n\nChina is a strict company with many future prospects, starting to realize its profitability, re-invests its income, has great management (idc what you think, it's different but this is just a company view), employees despite having a lower standard of living that's rising to have much more social unity and hope along with social order and better social constructs.\n\nCharlie Munger acknowledges these things and doesn't really care about your virtue signaling morals and ethics.\n\n**NIO, BYDD, Xpeng**\n\n**Chinese EVs have substantially more value than U.S. EVs and offer better ROI % and better future prospects.**\n\nAnother problem with EVs:\n\nIt costs $7,000-$14,000 to replace a Tesla battery, not even to upgrade it. Due to more money flowing into R&D towards battery tech, the batteries are rapidly improving. So when we shift from Lithium-Ion to Solid-State or partial, this raises the standard substantially for EVs from the top to bottom. So early adopters of EVs that have terrible range are stuck with their junk EV with low range, this is despite the shell of the vehicle being firm, the battery sucks and it would cost half or so for a newer EV with a better battery and similar shell. This will lead to a few things once we start raising the standard in EV batteries in leaps such as lack of vehicle retention value/ resale value being hit, more waste due to people opting in to dispose of their EV for a new one (which is against sustainability and net-zero carbon emissions), and lack of vehicle relevancy. These problems won't be realized until a couple of years though. This is why China is standardizing battery swaps because they recognize these problems.\n\n**Robo Taxi:**\n\nSo there will be a point when a lot of EVs meet a point where not only Tesla will have robo-taxi. Companies such as NIO, mobileye, google, Baidu, and more will have Robo-taxi capabilities. The problem is, even if robo-taxi were to become normalized, Tesla would not have a monopoly over it. In fact, I would argue NIO has set up the infrastructure to accommodate robo taxi. This is due to battery swap stations being placed strategically all along with China, this could also be replicated in Europe/Norway, and even the U.S. \n\n**Battery Swap Stations:**\n\nWhile battery swap stations and battery swap station infrastructure is a nice convenience for fast charging, it's not the true value. The true value is the infrastructure and technology. This is because when EVs become fully autonomous along with robo-taxi fleets become more prominent. Battery Swap Stations will one day be able to swap the battery out, vehicle maintenance, vehicle inspection, vehicle cleaning, etc. All which is necessary for robo-taxi and EVs working 24/7 without the need for any worker. \n\nTesla cannot do this because it takes over one thousand steps to grab a Tesla charging cable, plug it in, and there are too many variables such as theft, vandalism, and it's just not cost-efficient. But battery swap stations are affordable and this is why NIO wins robo-taxi, customer satisfaction, the approach towards net-zero carbon emissions, vehicle retention, vehicle sustainability, etc. China has even less red tape which allows for these types of technologies to advance much faster.\n\n**I don't care about virtue signaling or your false sense of morals and stuff that you probably don't even live up to, you're not altruistic. IMO, most people are greedy and just want to make money, I don't care personally, and I am here to make money. NIO is a better bet along with Chinese EVs, the FUD is fake and has no real sound validity behind it. The U.S. keeps losing its leverage which is why nothing will ever happen.

The purchase price is at a 15% discount of the lowest price in the offering period (6 months).
