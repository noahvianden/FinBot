Google's third-party reseller attach rate goal is around 90%, whereas AWS is around 25%.\n\nBelieve it or not, I think that that structure - heavily relying on third party resellers - is what's causing the lag in the ceiling for them on Cloud, too.  The reseller ecosystem started in the MS-Office to Google Apps days, margins are thin on licensing so integrators had to spend time + resources chasing SOWs for things like migrations, etc., to make up the difference.\n\nNow, as Google has pivoted more heavily towards Cloud + trying to make that inroad, there's a bit of an educational challenge where there's a dearth of knowledgeable talent that can deploy, manage + service G Suite, but not so much GCP.  It's going to take them a bit longer to gain market share, but ***market share is the goal***. \n\nMeanwhile - AWS had the earliest lead-in time (having no other core products to focus on), the best 'early story' (\"It's what [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) runs on\"), and the most aggressive tactics (don't involve partners, grab every workload you can)\n\nMS also had / has the strategic advantage of just so -- much -- legacy.  I'd wager that products across GCP rival that of MS or AWS lb:lb, but that's a far cry away from changing hearts and minds of the old MS stalwarts.\n\nTL;DR - Google has a lot of headroom for years of growth, and is positioned well with their focus on the partner ecosystem that, while proving a bottleneck in the short term, will likely end up being an accelerator in the long term.
