The reading was up from 5.5% in January, and above economists' expectations of 6%.\n\n\"Inflation rose steeply in February as prices increased for a wide range of goods and services, for products as diverse as food to toys and games,\" Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said.\n\nThe jump in inflation adds to the chances that the Bank of England will hike interest rates again at its next meeting on May 5. It has already raised them for [three meetings in a row](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/bank-of-england-interest-rates-uk-economy-inflation-ukraine-conflict-2022-3?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets), taking the main rate from a record low of 0.1% to 0.75%.\n\nLondon's [FTSE 100](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/ftse_100?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) stock index was up 0.52% after the figures were released. The [pound](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/gbp-usd?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) was down 0.23% to $1.323.\n\nThe figures make tough reading for Britons, who are now seeing prices rise faster than wages and face a steep rise in living costs in the spring.\n\nEnergy bills are set to soar in April after wholesale prices skyrocketed and the government lifted a price cap. Prices at the fuel pump have also risen sharply, and the Ukraine conflict risks sending energy prices even higher.\n\nThe government is also increasing taxes in April, as it worries about the state of the public finances following a surge in spending during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThere is little sign that the cost-of-living crisis will abate any time soon. The Bank of England expects inflation to soar above 8%, and even suggested it could hit double digits if global energy prices continue to rise.\n\nUK Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil measures to ease some of the burden on households when he delivers a spring economic statement later Wednesday. However, he has argued in favor of tax rises in the face of opposition from within his own party.\n\nMartin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said he expects inflation to rise significantly over the coming months.\n\n\"The impact of rising global goods prices continued to feed through,\" he said. \"What happens further out will be heavily influenced by the geopolitical situation and its impact on commodity prices.\"\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expects the Bank of England to be cautious about how far it raises interest rates.\n\n\"With the economic recovery likely to slow sharply as households feel the pinch, and domestically-generated inflation still relatively subdued, we expect the Committee to pause raising Bank Rate, once it has increased it to 1% in May,\" he said.\n\n\"Further rate hikes would increase the risk of a [recession](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-recession?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) and the chances that CPI inflation ultimately would significantly undershoot the 2% target in the medium term.\"", "id": "tkr47l", "created_utc": 1648032322.0, "score": 1330, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They are holding their market share almost as tight as your wife holds your boyfriends schlong.\n* Now that they\u2019re controlling the sales of thousands of middle aged women who sell macaroni-necklaces, they can take as much of a cut as they want. (This in itself is borderline a violation of the anti-competition laws that Biden is actively fighting for)\n* They have done a pro move, they\u2019ve increased their revenue. But the cost of that majestically autistic move worthy of the front page of a Guiness-world-record book is that their sellers are now planning a strike.\n* Not only are they planning a strike/boycott, they have already started creating their own websites, bringing market shares away from NaziEtsy.\n\n*as much of a cut as they want\u2026 how bad can it be?*\n\n**Really fucking bad.**\n\nIt turns out these top-shelf retards have increased the amount they tax their sellers by **30%**  compared to what they charged a few months ago.\n\n**This brings the fees to 6,5% of the displayed price. The seller then has to pay for shipping and packaging too.**\n\n**And TAXES. Don\u2019t forget that the IRS will fuck  you, your wife and her boyfriend if you don\u2019t pay taxes on those sweet NaziEtsy tendies gained from selling macaroni necklaces.**\n\n**This has pushed the sellers over the limit.**\n\nTheir sellers were already complaining about the massive fees that Etsy taxed before, but now these middle aged women will have to double up their production to be on the same level as the children in China that made the device you\u2019re reading this post on.\n\nNow, let\u2019s use whatever brain cells you retards have acquired since your professional investment journey started back when you got cockblocked by Vlad And RobbingDaHood.\n\nIf your entire business model is connecting buyers to middle aged women and take a cut on their sales, how retarded do you have to be to royally piss these middle aged women off? Answer: top tier retardation is required.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Etsy have done. They have pissed of so many middle aged women, Karens and your wife\u2019s aunt that their own sellers are planning a **MASSIVE STRIKE**\n\n[**READ THIS, this post has over 20k upvotes in less than 24hours and the PETITION has over 5000 Signatures**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/tk0z3v/will_you_help_us_expose_them_details_in_comment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nThese sellers have formed an alliance of terrifying PISSED middle aged women to go on Strike and Boycott Etsy.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2026 Etsy\u2019s own product is leaving them.\n\nSpeaking of leaving, I have spoken to some of these sellers because I actually do some research between retarded YOLO\u2019s\n\nThey are a group of sellers, they are reaching out to A LOT of media and news outlets all over the world.

While it's being touted as a 30% increase in order to sound more dramatic, it's actually a pretty small increase of 1.5%\n\n\\- Amazon charges anywhere from 8% to 45% depending on the category you're selling in. eBay is around 12% for most categories and even has banded fees based on final sale value (i.e. they take more money the higher the price you sell the item for). By comparison even at 6.5% Etsy fees are super cheap.\n\n\\- If you're selling on Etsy and your profit margin is drastically effected by a 1.5% inrease in seller fees, then you should reevaluate your business - your profit magin is FAR too low. I run a business that turns over $300k and if I lost 1.5% of that during the year I wouldn't even notice it. I increase my prices every year anyway, to cope with the ever-increasing cost of doing business.\n\n\\- A small, vocal portion of the community don't reperesent the entire community. I can't see any evidence of a mass revolt against Etsy. Someone started a petition and it's only got like 5,000 signees (Etsy has 3.14 MILLION active sellers). People will bitch and moan for a bit and then raise their prices slightly to compensate for the fee increase. Inflation is basically causing this across the board anyway so customers will adapt like they do for everything else.\n\n\\- A reddit post with 22k upvotes means nothing. It's not in the Etsy sellers subreddit, and probably 90% of the people who upvoted it aren't even Etsy sellers, they will just upvote whatever they agree with based on the subreddit it's posted in. It was posted in r/LateStateCapitalism \\- you could go on there and post anything that vaguley resembled anti-extreme capitalism and people would upvote it.\n\n\\- Etsy's last fee increase was in 2018. Honestly suprising they haven't raised them in the last 4+ years, especially during the pandemic when their web traffic, sales and users greatly increased.\n\n\\- Etsy's CFO has stated that much of this additional revenue will be re-invested into the company, to improve and expand marketing, customer support and product development. Doesn't sound like a capitalistic money grab.\n\n\\- Etsy will generate more revenue, and more profit becuase of this fee increase, as well as a increased userbase if they do put the increased fee revenue back into the company for marketing etc. I fail to see how this is a problem for shareholders.", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Kinda' sounds like OP is a middle aged Karen that was selling cheap shit on Etsy and was burned by their stock going down.", "score": 27, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37727031111717224}, {"body": "Thanks this is what my gut kinda thought about OPs post but now I don't have to think about it", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.025794336572289467}, {"body": "This is the post op should have made", "score": 18, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.00427806843072176}, {"body": "They bought depop and no millenial is buying new clothes in their right mind.

ALL OF THEM have their own sites and shops now, doing their marketing on socials and looking for sales this way. We're talking about Etsy shops with thousands of sales each.\n\nYes, Etsy has millions of shops but nobody will show you how many of them are pushing dropshipping or cheap crap. The whole idea of Etsy and what this brand has been built on, was handmade. Unique, laborious stuff you could buy only there, as opposed to Amazon or AliExpress.\n\nFast forward to 2022, now we have loads of potential clients asking \"How can I find actual HANDMADE there?\", \"Where is Etsy, why is this all dropshipping?\" On Etsy-themed subreddits, for example. We have aggregators for things that are actually handmade. We have lots of solid craftspeople leaving Etsy as it has lost its appeal. I've read today that people are just clinging to the idea of a company that no longer exists and it strikes me as accurate.\n\nI don't know if they will pivot or what they will do but if nothing changes, clients will one day wake up and see yet another Amazonoid and that will be it. They were coming there to find an alternative to mass-production. It's a very specific group of people, akin to folks that went berserk when last year's Cricut bulshit has materialised.\n\nAnd when it comes to Etsy vs. inflation... One would think that if your fee is x% and the cost of labour, materials, shipping and whatnot goes up steadily, sellers will keep raising their prices (otherwise they'll starve and/or go bankrupt) and your money will go up as well in the process. Etsy's fee is inflation-proof by design. It's not greed-proof though.\n\nAlso, people are not raising their prices by 36% after this change in fees. Their goods have to be 36% more expensive in comparison with their own prices in 2018.\n\nAnother thing is that this fee is not the only fee Etsy charges but other people have explained this already.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Your graph extends out into 2026, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if trump dies before 2026.

Again, in your own words, this is a bubble. Getting in on shares and cashing out later for a 10% gain might be a sensible play. But you should stay the *fuck* away from the options chain. Look at the implied vol. 110%+. Absolutely insane premiums.

Mere rumors can wipe your position out, especially if you\u2019re on the options chain.

I think we can both agree the cancel mob is ruthless, right? Any corp who advertises where qanon is vocal risks bad press.
