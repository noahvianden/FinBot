{"title": "Why were investors so excited about Ebay & Paypal, a 25 year old company ?", "selftext": "Please help me to what do I not understand?\n\nI've been using Ebay for 24 years now.  Amazon and Etsy grew for the last 10 years.  Last 5 years, FB Marketplace had to eat into the action, also.  I believe Alibaba also become more popular for certain goods.   Also, many boutique sites for certain products like Swappa.   Partly, what allowed this other growth was Ebay was never branded as cool.  Ebay had a marketing problem right from 1998, which was perception of only weird or used goods.\n\nI still use Ebay, but less than in the past.  Is Ebay growing much anymore?  For 16 years, from 2004 to 2020, Ebay price was almost flat.  $25 to $30 in 16 years.  \n\nI never used Paypal outside of Ebay.    I've been using Paypal for 20 years.  Is not Paypal is basically Ebay payments, and EBay is old school.  When Ebay spun it back off in 2015.  who was excited about this old technology?  Paypal is now almost 25 years old.  Venmo has grown for p2p payments, but is an unprofitable arm of Paypal.   Is the growth of Venno the entire bull case for Paypal?\n\nBoth seem a mature company with saturated markets.   Should Ebay and Paypal trade at growth PE?  Or like a utility or bank?   Yet, Paypal was a 10-bagger going from $30 to $300, and now back to $100.  \n\nIs Ebay & Paypal still growing?  What is the growth case?  What was the bull case for Paypal since 2015?", "id": "t80xv1", "created_utc": 1646580129.0, "score": 132, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "For me, I stopped selling things on Ebay because of the high fees and taxes (use FB marketplace instead).

Opening more pipes doesn't change that because oil production itself is down.\n\nTHAT is what's putting pressure on oil futures markets, not cost issues so much. While oil producers are facing some inflationary cost concerns, the cost of a barrel of oil is on the future's market BEFORE the cost to get to the refinery is taken into account.\n\nOnce it gets to the refinery, then next place the gas goes is it gets sold on the global market.\n\nWhat determines prices in a seller's market is demand and willingness to pay, flexed by supply.\n\nKeystone XL won't impact supply. That supply is on the market, it's just taking trains/trucks/boats to get to refineries. The product of that is ALSO sold on similar futures markets.\n\nIn other words, all energy suppliers to consumers are paying higher prices. The existence of demand eliminates the downward pressure on prices that you need to have that pressure for competition. Basically, because all energy supplier outlets are feeding high demand against relatively low supply, they don't have a need to compete for customers on price... and they're not getting the price savings to justify gas stations lowering prices in local competition as a result because they're all buying from the same in-demand commodity pool.\n\nSo where it matters, they have no advantage from lowering prices.\n\nIt's pretty simple to understand. If I am going to 100% buy from you, and I offer you $115 for a barrel of oil that you have, and it only cost you $105 to acquire it, are you going to say \"No, it's OK, keep your $10...\" even though I'm willing to pay it?\n\nOf course not. Why would energy companies agree to lower prices when there's no volume movement gain? They wouldn't, and that's how prices go up in a seller's market.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for writing this", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate you listening. :)", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.355251669883728}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03057228773832321}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6143357157707214}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6030383706092834}, {"body": "There it is, the dumbest thing I'll read on Reddit all week.
