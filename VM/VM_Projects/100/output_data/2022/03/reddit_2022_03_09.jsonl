This prompted the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to both open investigations into the matter.  \n>  \n>Insider trading is the buying and selling of stocks with confidential or non-public information, usually with the intention to make as much money as possible.

Dead cat bounce?\nI get that almost everyone is feeling their tanks yesterday and the demand today is probably much lower than it was before but could it be that Saudis are also lowering the price to exit the market maybe? \nSorry for the low effort post but I am trying to make sense of everything\n\nEdit: Okey, tomorrow before the market opens we will have the CPI report. Because my knowledge is very limited and I know that there are other supply issues that need to be taken into account (plus many other inflation catalysts such as money supply)  I will just focus on the crude oil prices compared to the increasing CPI. \nIn January the price of oil increased by 15% and we had ATH CPI of 7,5%. In February, oil prices were not surging as much as before and only increased by 6% till the 24th (start of war) after that, the price jumped by 13%, closing a 19.5% increase in just February. \nBecause the crude oil price was rising a lot slower in February you think we should be safe from high CPI reports, however, we mustn't forget that the peak of covid-19 was on the 14th of January and many businesses suffered big losses in that period. I remember that UBER and LYfT employees were complaining a lot back in January that they can't find any customers. Meaning people were not spending money in restaurants but rather buying groceries (writing this I see that could raise the CPI lol) at home.... \nSo basically now I don t know anymore if tomorrow is going to be 7,8% CPI increase like Bloomberg said or less and we ll see a green day hahaha\n\nEdit: ok, food and beverage is just 1 of the 8 things used CPI. Everything else was down due to covid in January and we still had 7.5%. Now I am not afraid I bought gold.

United Arab Emirates said it will call on its fellow OPEC+ members to boost oil output faster. Iraqi Oil Minister Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael meanwhile said at an oil conference in Houston that OPEC+ will aim to make the market balanced. Meanwhile, Zelenskiy reiterated to Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper it was ready to make compromises to end the war. \n\n\u201cThe oil market will remain persistently volatile and crude prices will remain supported until a major de-escalation in the war in Ukraine occurs,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nThe U.S. and U.K. decided Tuesday to halt Russian oil imports after Shell Plc and BP Plc said they are stopping new purchases, but other European nations have been reluctant to commit to similar action. The International Energy Agency said a recently announced stockpile release will amount to almost 63 million barrels of crude and products, but it has done little to cool prices.\n\nAgainst the market\u2019s fast-moving backdrop, OPEC+ is sitting on the sidelines sticking to its 400,000 barrel-a-day production increase. Russia is one of the key leaders of the cartel, along with Saudi Arabia and a major producer of crude and petroleum products such as diesel. \n\nRussia is a major supplier of refined products to Europe and the threat of fuel supplies drying up in the region has sent diesel markets into a frenzy. U.S. distillates inventories fell to the lowest level since November 2014, dropping 5.23 million barrels, according to government data.\n\nOil imports from Russia made up about 3% of all the crude shipments that arrived in the U.S. last year. When other petroleum products are included, such as unfinished fuel oil, Russia accounted for about 8% of oil imports. A planned House vote on the legislation to ban imports was delayed, even as Biden moved ahead with executive action amid growing political pressure to do so.\n\n \u201cThe market is awaiting the domino effect of mainland Europe announcing a ban, however, with oil majors announcing that they won\u2019t touch Russian oil, there is already a de-facto ban,\u201dsaid Keshav Lohiya, founder of consultant Oilytics.\n\nShell and BP said they won\u2019t make any new purchases of Russian oil and gas, but they can\u2019t immediately disentangle themselves from the country in part due to long-term contracts. It\u2019s a dramatic U-turn for Shell, which faced heavy criticism for its purchase of Russian crude last week, and could have a huge impact on the region\u2019s oil refining.", "id": "tafdmf", "created_utc": 1646853805.0, "score": 413, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tafdmf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tafdmf)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13199783861637115}, {"body": "i took profits on monday after reading about Carl Icahn selling $OXY.\n\nBuffet bought $OXY that day.\n\none of these old bastards is going senile.", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "I bought OXY too.

That on top of climate/energy transition narrative, there has been severe under investment in developing new sources. Companies are focused in reducing debt and capital discipline, even as exploration and development costs are only going higher year by year, because everyone thought and still some extent thinks \"oil is dead.\" Almost all the growth in production last year was due to drilled but uncompleted wells, that were drilled but shut off or never started pumping because then price of oil was too low. They are bringing those wells online faster than they are drilling new wells. It also means each new well is less and less productive because they start with the best ones first. There is no growth in sources outside of US shale and even in the US it is only in the Permian Basin, the other major areas Eagle Ford and Bakken are declining. With supply chain and labor issues hitting oil industry as well, there just isn't the capacity or incentive to rapidly increase production. It is going to take massive amounts of capital just to keep production flat for the next few years - capital that will be extremely limited because of \"ESG.\" And yet because almost all growth in demand comes from developing countries, where the demand is extremely inelastic, high prices are not going to check demand for most of the world.
