He declared the war and direct conflict with the US will justify his paranoia. Elected officials making sanctions are far superior to private corporations calling the shots.

Speculation of a half-percentage point hike has waned in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Fed is expected to continue to raise rates throughout the year. Powell said he wanted to proceed \u201ccarefully,\u201d which is likely a signal of further quarter-point moves. But the Fed chairman said larger rate hikes were on the table if inflation doesn\u2019t subside.\n\n\u201cTo the extent inflation comes in higher or is more persistently high\u2026then we would be prepared to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings,\u201d Powell said. The central bank\u2019s policy rate has been stuck near zero since the coronavirus pandemic struck in early 2022 to help the economy weather the storm.\n\nWith inflation surging, the central banks wants \u2014 as the first order of business \u2014 to get rates closer to \u201cneutral\u201d or around a 2.5% rate, in orderly and regular steps. Powell\u2019s comments Wednesday show the Fed doesn\u2019t want to surprise the market with its policy moves.\n\nPowell told the committee the Fed will have to be \u201cnimble\u201d in its execution of monetary policy. The Ukraine war was a big reason to move carefully, he said. The Fed has a second tool to cool the economy \u2014 shrinking the size of its almost $9 trillion balance sheet. Powell said he expects the Fed to \u201cmake progress on agreeing on a plan to shrink the balance sheet\u201d and the question of when to implement it \u201cis not answered yet.\u201d\n\nThe Fed wants to shrink its balance sheet \u201cin a predictable manner\u201d primarily letting maturing securities run off of its portfolio, rather than outright sales, he said.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/powell-signals-fed-will-raise-interest-rates-at-march-meeting-11646227825?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/powell-signals-fed-will-raise-interest-rates-at-march-meeting-11646227825?mod=home-page)", "id": "t56bte", "created_utc": 1646244773.0, "score": 545, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "feds wont do anything meaningful about inflation until they have to", "score": 209, "replies": [{"body": "Just the talk of raising rates has moved treasuries up and valuations have already dropped a good deal.
