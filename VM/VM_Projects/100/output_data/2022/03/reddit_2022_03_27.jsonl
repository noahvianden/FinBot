Missed a decent amount of gains on stocks like Costco, CF, NTR and oil stocks listening to the \u201covervalued\u201d crowd\u2026 \n\n Not financial advice but Tesla out of all my growth stocks has been holding up fantastically well (bought in february)", "id": "tp8p0f", "created_utc": 1648341662.0, "score": 123, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "What's the point of spending on advertising when they can't even keep up with demand", "score": 252, "replies": [{"body": "Not only that but all of the haters paid talk show hosts across the country to talk shit about them for years.  100% free advertising.", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "Perhaps, but it also had a serious negative effect. The amount of people that truly believe any or all of the following points is staggering:\n\n* EVs have a serious risk of catching fire when compared to ICE.\n* EVs take hundreds of thousands of miles to be CO2 negative when compared to ICE.\n* EV batteries cannot be fully recycled.\n* FSD increases risk of accidents.\n* Tesla's build quality is worse than other automakers' EVs (this is a tricky one, because it used to be true and for the Fremont Model 3 still is true when compared to legacy ICE cars, but legacy EVs have the same issue and Fremont Model Y and MIC models are already better than legacy ICE)\n* Musk pumped BTC and Doge for his personal profit\n* Musk pays almost no taxes.\n\nNow obviously all of these points are verifiably false, but I honestly could keep going for a while. All of these legacy media talking points have definitely negatively affected Tesla's demand. It just hasn't affected their sales yet because the demand is still (much) higher than their supply, but at some point in the future it will have a negative impact.

Tesla's research as published in their 2020 Impact Report has proved to be quite accurate, and it states that a grid charged Model 3 for personal use emits about 185 grams of CO2 per mile driven over a typical lifetime (150.000 miles), compares to 440 for an average mid-size premium ICE vehicle, and includes CO2 emissions from the manufacturing phase.\n\nThat would put the average breakeven point between EV and ICE vehicles at 42% of the lifetime, or 63.000 miles.\n\nNow an important factor this doesn't even take into account yet, is how most Tesla owners either charge at Superchargers or at home using solar and/or green energy providers. On top of that, EVs and specifically Teslas have a much longer lifetime than ICE vehicles because of the lower wear and tear. There are already [reports of people driving 250,000 miles without even replacing the brake pads](https://www.torquenews.com/13417/tesla-owner-reports-their-model-s-did-250000-miles-one-set-brake-pads), and the batteries should last between 500,000 and 1,000,000 miles.\n\nJust solar charging your Tesla reduces the average CO2 emission per mile driven down to below 100 grams. Extending the estimated lifetime to just 200,000 miles, which I think is still very conservative, brings it down to around 75 grams.\n\nAt that point, your breakeven point is only about 25,000 miles.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

Now, add 1k for options like bedliner and some other stuff, I forget what, and you're at $42,699. Sales tax would be $2,650, brings it to $45,349.  Less $7,500 for the tax credit puts it at $37,849 including destination charge.\n\n\nHmmm... you conveniently omitted the most important part of my comment, pointing out that when the Pro's eventually come out, the $7,500 rebate will be long gone.  You're still at $45,349.

I currently have two cars without any of those things and I am just fine.

Also BLK is going to 0.\n\nHere is S&P 500 doing a pretty nice head and shoulders pattern. There's a sort of secondary channel that's pretty apparent and helps predict the angle of the next/ declining channel if you believe in fortune telling and whatever.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asp5b2mj1up81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b616173520fbfc93b087737e58c8c0cddf23a2c4\n\nHere is BLK doing a *italics* version of the same pattern. Maybe it got pulled towards the full moon when Venus was in retrograde or something. Since all the dates for the other points match up I pulled the price on Apr 14 and May 20. Looks like my $630 Apr 14 puts might sneak in under the wire. I'm hoping for an earlier bounce off the neck line to unload them incase witching sticks don't actually work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fctlgcdu1up81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1de4426fae75174c3c67d61b8519b78b30cbc24\n\nWe talked about bonds last time so here's what the bond market has been up to for the last 40 years. Looks like the 10 year bond yield likes to stay in its nice channel and just test the top right before recessions. For some reason probably related to some kind of space warlock it seams to always top out on the bottom formed off the recession that happened about 20 years before each time. There are three exceptions to that rule though,1987 and 1994 and 2022 which all pop out above the line early to test the roof. I wonder if bad shit happened in 1987 and 1994? Lets check the tarot cards. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddi3x47m2up81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=23d718c44d23998d1b5f00f961b24b6d02e89ec4\n\n10yr yield in blue, S&P500 in purple for 1987. Damn Daniel, that doesn't look too good. On black Monday the Dow dropped 22% and the entire world's equities were obliterated. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtvar2mr3up81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=98a75d5b9ce5c334b0d74c19932a591474772bf8\n\nHere's 1994. Something called the 1994 bond market crash. Apparently the FED acknowledged inflation was creeping up, raised rates a quarter point and promised more hikes throughout the year, then the bond market dumped the world over (not kidding incase you were also 2 and don't know this either.) The S&P500 dropped from it's high of around $480 (Also not kidding) about 10% but recovered by the start of 1995 and began a rally that ripped like 300% by 2000. So maybe bulls are going to win this round after all, but keep in mind between 1990 and 1994 the S&P500 rallied from only about 290 to 480 or about 69% where as between 2018 and 2022 the S&P500 has rallied from holy shit... 69% from 2900 to 4800 (still not making this up). Okay so there are some similarities... Shit are my puts fucked? I need a s\u00e9ance stat! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6lr00734up81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=46c49840da54c23ca6d79b5aca4e8edf25f1137d\n\nSome idiot bull told me that the bull thesis is that MMs are fucking with Powell. They are dumping bonds, pouring cash into stocks and jacking yields up so that he has to restart QE to get them back down. I agree with this statement 100% and it seams like that's probably what is for sure happening, but back to tea leaves and lets see if we can salvage this shit before I lose the last 2 people who might be still reading. Here is what we're looking at right now. We jumped back over the 2008 bottom to retest the top of the 10yr yield channel about 6 years earlier then expected (2000-1994=6... fuck). Assuming fairy's are real and yields need to drop to make sure Peter Pan never grows up and becomes Robin Williams, JPOW won't flinch, the dollar and bonds will rally and we will get our tasty black Monday scenario which based on the head and shoulders on the crystal ball that we saw Spy is expecting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3ew9g4z4up81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1c33d8f52922254e2885bdac66722b1790f7f47\n\nLast thing, lets see what some BLK equivalent looked like in 1994 to see if there's any more hope for my ever increasingly OTM puts. Here's Ber Sterns dumping from $12 a share to $7.50\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ozkhdh8xeup81.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=c304a846b540f00db1997f9581df59597c8acb8f\n\nI'm back baby! You thought I was going to give up there for a second didn't you. Ber Sterns bled like a pig all fucking year even though the S&P500 stayed comparatively flat and this is for the **best case scenario** buckle the fuck up if we get a black Monday or anything in between.

It builds discipline, sure, but it doesn't factor in the fact that typically you earn significantly more around 30 than around 18\n\nMy total savings up to 24 was around $5k which I considered a huge pile of money compared to my peers / not living in the usa, that would be ~$12k if adjusted for purchase power parity / . I started work very early (19) and made shit (as most young people) but still saved here and there - mostly in cash accounts, some in stocks but I didn't know what I'm doing so most of this did not make anything.\n\nThen I moved, started making serious buck at ~25 and up to 33 I racked up somewhere around $250k - but out of this $160k is _earned_ money I actually contributed to the market only $80k is capital gains. And of these $160k vast majority of money I saved was in last 3 years - my savings (surplus of earnings vs spendings) looked something like that: 19 to 25: $5k, then double this with $5k saved @ age of 25, then 8k@26, 10k@27, 12k@28, 20k@29, 30k@30, 30k@31, 40k@32. See how this adds up and skews to the right? /yes I actually have spreadsheet to track my annual earnings and savings :D that's what helps me see a big picture now /\n\nLong story short - if I started investing at 30 not at 24 I would probably have \"only\" $120k savings ($90k earned, $30k in capital gains) vs $250k I actually have when starting at 24 ($160k earned, $90k in capital gains). So it sounds like a huge loss right? 50% less savings... Not really. I can now save $40k a year I will recoup these \"lost\" $120k in 3 years and that's assuming that savings stop growing (unlikely at 5-10% inflation worldwide).
