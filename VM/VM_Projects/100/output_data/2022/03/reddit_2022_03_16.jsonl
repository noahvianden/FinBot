{"title": "JPow might still shock with a 0.5 hike", "selftext": "First off I'm just as retarded as any of you and my macro takes are especially bad. That said, I might have a thought no one has considered.\n\nChina's Winnie the Pooh asked the Fed not to raise interest rates two months ago:\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/xi-jinping-warns-fed-against-hiking-interest-rates-11642502735\n\nThat's because he started on a path to consolidate power in Beijing, but ran into an unexpected problem. Earlier than expected tightening by the Fed while China is already cracking down would challenge Yuan parity. This was already happening in 2019 when the Fed was raising rates:\nhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/yuan-falling-china-currency-manipulator-struggling-secretly-858981\n\nPlus given that the new league of self sabotaging nations (Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, etc) is trying to challenge dollar hegemony, I wonder if JPow shocks us tomorrow to (among other priorities) challenge Yuan parity. \n\nIt is unlikely, but if by chance they assess that such a shock will increase domestic labor force participation (which lowers inflation), they have another reason (dollar hegemony) to do it. In fact, the Fed has repeatedly shocked markets since November to improve labor force participation. Here's my take on that and a pretty graph to show that it is working: \nhttps://twitter.com/moazzam0_reddit/status/1491974994313859089?t=_U5Px6yKJKL21o0aIE3UlQ&s=19\n\nWould they risk recession? No, I think supply driven inflation and bottlenecks are so sudden and drastic that they're limiting growth. That's why I think we have stagflation. So if the Fed sees labor force participation as their solution to this supply side inflation, it makes sense to shock markets some more. Plus they get the bonus of making Winnie the Pooh tear up.\n\nNo I'm not holding puts.", "id": "tf6wv6", "created_utc": 1647397115.0, "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|100|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|740|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7xled/virus_had_mutated_30_times_weeks_ago_some_strains/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwmr2l/40_upside_on_bhc/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyg174/brrr_pump_is_temporary/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmixmn/synthesis_on_gme/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu5g54/the_profit_says_brk_will_beat_spy_again_cheap/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pw4798/why_brkbs_intrinsic_value_is_over_42069_per_share/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pw8q5u/brkbs_intrinsic_value_is_over_42069_per_share_i/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8jjvh/gme_autistic_epiphany/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tf6wv6)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tf6wv6)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.189717635512352}, {"body": "Haha.

Hemp oil can at least in older cars be used as a direct replacement for diesel. Especially in milder climates. Bioethanol is in all gasoline and the amount of it could be increased to a level that there is almost no CO2 released anymore. These plans were halted because people didn't adopt Bioethanol fuels because Oil companies used propaganda to make people afraid of using them because of claims that they would harm their cars. This was wrong and yet another of their typical games.\n\nThere sure will be a need for more processing plants as the amount of produces hemp increases to the size I expect it to but that isn't an issue. It is a known technology that we have been using for decades. There are already companies that are specialized in these kinds of plants.\n\nAs you can see in this presentation by the University of Kentucky hemp is the spuirior energy crop:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdyl7u\\_qwTw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdyl7u_qwTw)\n\nAlso, it has been shown to yield about 10x the price of other crops like wheat. The good thing with hemp is that it does not compete with foodstuffs. Hemp seed protein is the best plant protein. It is the closest to animal protein and does actually taste nice(for me at least)\n\nSo actually replacing farm crops with it will yield more foodstuffs.\n\n\" Also, where were the oil/gas infrastructure when the automobile (horseless carriage) first hit the trials (there were not even good roads)\" \n\nThe issue during that time was that the processing of hemp was difficult and required a lot of manual labor. Pumping oil out of the ground was a lot easier. We now have the technologies to do the processing. Actually, the event of these technologies was one of the reasons for hemp to be outlawed. You can read about the history of why there is so little hemp grown nowhere:\n\nhttps://www.soulask.com/the-hemp-conspiracy-the-real-reason-why-hemp-is-illegal/\n\nSpoiler alert it was some capitalist asshole(actually the guy that citizen Kane is based on) that saw his business in danger and used his connection to the government to make it illegal.\n\nThe claim that hemp oil is actually CO2 negative is based around that you can actually use hemp wood to make \"real\" wood:\n\n[https://hempwood.com/](https://hempwood.com/)\n\nThanks to hemp's superior growth you get about 4-8 times as much wood out of a hemp farm as you would with a conventional wood(tree) production. Hemp wood also is far superior in its quality. It is far more resilient and can be shaped in any standard or none standard form.\n\nWe could thereby replace conventional wood farms now and increase their efficacy. This would mean a possible 4-8x of carbon sequestering compared to planting trees. Hemp wood can be used as a building material. Hemp housing is mold resistant, automatically regulates humidity, and is heat insulated. Removing the need for additional heating which currently uses about a third of all energy.\n\n\"Where is the infrastructure to deliver any bio fuel in the scale as needed?\"\n\nAll the infrastructure we are currently using for fossil fuels and other plant oils. Hemp oil is not toxic and could be transported with existing pipelines and trucks.\n\n\"Using Hemp would magically make all these pieces fall in place in less than a year?\"\n\nIt is not magic. It is replacing one crop with a different one. Of cause there are challenges but the solutions for these challenges already exist and only need to be implemented. Trying to do it in one year will of cause be quite the struggle but who said we need to.\n\nGermany is already in the process of doing this. Hemp production has more than doubled each year for many years now and we should all be quite familiar with exponential functions by now...\n\nHemp also can be grown in any climate because it is a native weed around the globe. It was just removed from wild grows because of it illegal status. It needs little to no additional water and can be grown even in desert areas.\n\nIn my opinion  the green belt movmnent is flawed: [http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/](http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/)\n\nThey should much rather plant hemp as it grows quicker and far more resilient to drought and pests(resistant. You need no pesticides)\n\nThere is a lot more but this is already getting quite long and I am unsure if there is even a point to this.

At least here in Germany, you will get sued for tax evasion if you drive using plant oils. People used to buy flax oil at the supermarket and put it in their cars because it was cheaper than diesel. They put a stop to that by adding taxes on it.\n\nAlso right now the market for edible oils made from hemp isn't saturated. At the moment you can sell 1l of hemp oil for around 20\u20ac. This price will come down over time as production increases and people expect lower prices. At some point, the price of oil will drop to a point where people will start to use it to drive their cars. The hemp insulation and building material are just new and people are skeptical of using them. Because of missing training. Also, hemp is flame retardent but not enough to fulfill current regulations here in Germany. This whole segment of the market is just starting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to sum up why are we not using it:\n\n\\-We are but we are at the very beginning.

{"title": "Fed raises interest rates for first time in 3 years to fight inflation, forecasts six more hikes in 2022", "selftext": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/03/16/interest-rates-increase-fed/7052888001/\n\nThe COVID-19-induced era of rock-bottom interest rates is over \u2014 just as the U.S. finally seems to be turning the corner on the pandemic.\n\nYet while falling COVID cases and solid consumer demand are helping clear the way for higher rates, the Federal Reserve is taking aim at the pandemic\u2019s stubborn economic legacy: soaring inflation.\n\nMoving to curtail a historic surge in consumer prices, the Fed raised its key short-term interest rate Wednesday \u2013 by a quarter-percentage point -- for the first time in more than three years and forecast six more hikes this year. That\u2019s up from the three total quarter-point increases Fed officials predicted in December and more than the six moves many top economists predicted this week. The Fed forecast another four hikes in 2023.\n\nThe central bank also sharply boosted its inflation forecast, largely as a result of Russia's attack on Ukraine, while lowering its estimate of economic growth, highlighting the quandary the Fed faces as it tries to tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\n\n\u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,\u201d the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting. \u201cThe implications for the US economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.\u201d\n\nSaving money or creating problems?: My car requires premium gas. Can I switch to regular gas to save on high gas prices?\n\nGas theft: Rising gas prices present 'new crime of opportunity' for thieves nationwide\n\nWhat do Fed rate hikes mean?\nTraditionally, the Fed increases rates to curb borrowing, temper an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth. Now, it potentially faces a worst-of-all-worlds scenario of spiraling inflation and slowing growth.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hike bumps up the federal funds rate \u2013 which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans \u2013 from near zero to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. It\u2019s expected to ripple through the economy, pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages, among other loans. But Americans, especially seniors, should start to get some relief from puny rates for savings accounts and CDs.\n\nIn its statement, the central bank added that it anticipates \"ongoing increases...will be appropriate.\"\n\nAlthough Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress last month that he supported a quarter-point increase at the March meeting, economists have debated how aggressive the Fed will be in the months ahead amid a worrisome economic backdrop.\n\nIs the Fed raising rates further in 2022 and beyond?\nThe Fed now expects its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% by year-end and 2.8% by the end of 2023, higher than many top economists projected. \n\nSince fall, Fed policymakers have been gearing up to combat a bout of inflation that has steadily hit new 40-year highs, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 7.9% annually in February.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month compounded the problem by further juicing fast-rising gasoline and food prices \u2013 Russia is among the world\u2019s top oil producers -- and worsening global supply-chain bottlenecks. The average price of regular gasoline hit $4.32 a gallon Tuesday, up from $3.50 just a month ago, according to AAA.\n\nWorker shortages spawned by the pandemic are also stoking inflation by forcing employers to bid up wages to attract a smaller pool of job candidates. That, in turn, is prompting companies to raise prices to maintain profit margins.\n\nYet the leap in prices is also dampening consumer spending, and the Ukraine war is battering the stock market and global growth \u2013 all of which is set to slow the U.S. economy.\n\nPowell told lawmakers the Fed could consider raising rates by half a point at future meetings. But Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle says officials are unlikely to seriously weigh such a move \u201cuntil downside risks to the global economy from the war diminish.\u201d\n\nHow is the current U.S. economy?\nThe Fed on Wednesday said it expects the U.S. economy to grow 2.8% in 2022, down from its December estimate of 4%., according to officials\u2019 median projections. That\u2019s still sturdy growth by historical standards but analysts worry an intensifying war and sharp rate increases could slow the economy further or even nudge it into recession.\n\nThe Fed estimates its preferred annual inflation measure (which is different than the CPI) will end the year at 4.3% before easing to 2.7% in 2023, up from its prior forecasts of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. It predicts a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.1% at year-end and 2.7% at the close of 2023, up from prior estimates of 2.7% and 2.3%.\n\nWhat is inflation rate for 2022?\nInflation is expected to moderate this year as the pandemic eases and more truck drivers, along with factory, warehouse and port employees, return to work, helping alleviate the supply troubles. But the increase in the consumer price index is now expected to peak in late spring at 8.7%, higher than previously believed and it will take longer for inflation to subside, predicts economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.\n\nAnd with the economy still growing solidly, Bostjancic reckons the Fed will err on the side of aggressively fighting inflation rather than worrying its actions may cause a downturn.\n\nIn an opinion piece in Tuesday\u2019s Washington Post, Larry Summers, Treasury secretary under President Obama, said the Fed took inflation too lightly over the past year and \u201cwill have to head in a dramatically different direction\u201d to \u201cavoid stagflation (high inflation and stalled growth) and the associated loss of public confidence in our country now.\u201d\n\nOther Fed moves\nThe Fed on Wednesday also said it it will begin reducing its trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities \"at a coming meeting\" after launching the purchases at the start of the pandemic to lower long-term rates. The purchases ballooned the Fed's balance sheet to about $8.8 trillion.\n\n Rather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature. The shrinking balance sheet will also nudge mortgage and other long-term rates higher.\n\nWednesday\u2019s moves mark a reversal for a central bank that had been focused on helping the nation heal from the recession and 22 million job losses caused by the pandemic. In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis upended the economy, the Fed slashed its benchmark rate to near zero and launched the bond buying.\n\nAs recently as early November, Powell said officials believed the inflation surge was transitory and would ease as both the supply snags and pent-up consumer demand from a reopening economy pulled back.\n\nHe said the Fed would be patient and hold off on raising rates so the economy could reach full employment \u2013 an environment in which virtually anyone who wants a job has one.\n\nBut by late November, Powell acknowledged the supply problems and inflation would linger longer than expected. The U.S. is still 2.1 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level and the share of people over 16 working or looking for jobs is at 62.3%, below the 63.4% pre-crisis mark. But many Americans retired early during the pandemic and most are not expected to return, and Powell has said he believes the economy is at full employment.", "id": "tfocsi", "created_utc": 1647454399.0, "score": 364, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tfocsi)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tfocsi)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09238647669553757}, {"body": "Recession or stagflation?", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Powell: both.", "score": 55, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19730520248413086}, {"body": "recessfellatio", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1252756118774414}, {"body": "in my idiotic opinion treasury yields could be slowly inverting in the coming months in which case probably a recession in 1-2 year.\n\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Great, people can actually afford housing and food again.

Market likes that. \n\nBiden/Putin: Neither country participated in the war crimes court. In general it\u2019s more a sign of cluelessness than anything. \n\nPutin probably isn\u2019t unstable. The longer this drags on the more he can nationalize after getting western money to leave on its own. He\u2019ll just buy from the numerous countries who haven\u2019t banned him and launder money through China. He knows the Western politicians need their cheap labor to maintain lifestyles. Gotta pump out those iPhones. \n\nJust thoughts. I don\u2019t think the old schoolers who knew a closed off Soviet state are too surprised by Putin being a nationalist and not a globalist. He\u2019s been saying so for a decade but it\u2019s not covered in the Western press, and he backed it with significant action that got serious around 2014. We\u2019re just asleep at the switch as usual, insofar as to have a published, consistent, foreign policy. We never do have one. \n\nBut we are damn good at not keeping promises to folks and the world knows it and remembers.

All he really needs is a quagmire in Ukraine to blame it all on in internal propaganda and nobody\u2019s going to speak freely about it. They\u2019re all relearning the old ways where you say nothing political and your don\u2019t get visited in the middle of the night. \n\nIn general, our market doesn\u2019t care much other than seeing who\u2019ll be paying our \u201cdefense\u201d companies for high tech weapons. Germany says they want the F-35 but they and Poland now both have a massive refugee problem on their hands that won\u2019t be cheap to deal with.
