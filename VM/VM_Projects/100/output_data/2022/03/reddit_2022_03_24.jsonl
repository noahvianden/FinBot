On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.\n\nA lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher. Inflation appears to be more persistant than originally thought. And the FED will likely need to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated.\n\nGiven economic conditions have deteriorated since, what's the reasoning for AAPL to be trading near ATHs again? Have the fundamentals of the business improved so much that it offsets the heightened economic risks?

You're the first to ever claim that Apple is one bad quarter from having to worry about bankruptcy. If I were you, I'd be buying puts. You'd be rich. No one in the industry is even worried about Apple being bankrupt. What info do you have?\n\n1. Their financial statements do show that. Marketable securities. They have nearly $60 billion in unrestricted cash if they needed access to it but they don't. Another $120+ billion in long-term securities that again, they have no reason to sell. Why do you focus solely on their liabilities and not their account receivables, then, of which other companies owe them nearly $30 billion? Same concept here.\n2. \"Only made $34 billion.\" 2020, their net income for Q1 was $29 billion. 2019, it was $22 billion. \"Only $34 billion\"? They just recorded their most profitable year of $95 billion in net income last year. Previous high was $60 billion. $275 billion in revenue for year 2020. $365 billion in revenue for year 2021. This is a company that continues to grow.\n3. Maybe you want to look at why Apple's debt is high. Hint: It's a strategy. They leveraged low interest rates much like U.S. bonds to finance their business. Because these rates are so low, they earn more $ off their marketable securities than the rate of the interest on their debt. Also, their money is mostly overseas so they avoid paying U.S. corporate taxes by doing this. It's artificially high because Apple was able to get basically low-interest $ to use. They have nearly $70 billion in debt that is costing them less than what inflation is charging. Imagine a scenario where you can either use $100 of your own money and earn 5% of interest on it or you can borrow $100 and only pay 2%. You pocket the 3% difference. Why wouldn't you? Apple uses this debt to finance their R&D, structure buyback on their shares, and pay dividends to investors. Again, when used correctly, debt is actually a GOOD thing.\n4. Companies already repair iPhones all the time whether it is small businesses or some established iPhone resellers online. That isn't news. I had my iPhone repaired five years ago with generic parts. You're making seem it seem as if this is new and will be a huge issue for Apple in the grand scheme of things. Very few individuals are going to repair their own iPhones.\n5. You keep ignoring the services side of business that will eventually be Apple's most profitable segment. $68 billion in revenue with margins reaching 70% last year. By 2025, it is expected to be Apple's most profitable segment and reach $150 billion in revenue. Apple is diversifying away from their iPhone hardware and are making significant R&D improvements to wearables and AR technology.\n\nBtw, if Apple was worried about their short-term debt, they would decrease or eliminate their dividends. They have been increasing it yearly. They spent $86 billion to repurchase shares last year and paid out $15 billion on dividends in that same period. Since 2012, Apple has spent nearly $500 billion buying back shares. Does this seem like a company that is worried about liquidity? Your concerns are not valid.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1. I said they have 148 billion in current assets this has all of those number you are talking about so I am not ignoring them. They are called current assets because they can be converted to cash within a year. That's why you can't use the non-current assets for current liabilities which are at all-time highs. Non-current assets are too illiquid to use within a year. So assuming they maintain income levels, they are left with less than 10 billion in the tank.\n2. Oh congrats, their physical inventory increased in value last year due to inflation. So did every other companies' physical inventories last year. And wow, no change to any other segments just iPhones which match the same pattern as every previous year. So Q2-4 inventory will be much lower. Even now I can see the price of the iPhone increased from 2019 to now. \n3. I agree debt can be good in high inflation environments, but this debt will not be refinanced which is what they have been doing for years and why financing operations has only increased from $18 billion 5 years ago to $96 billion last year. The past 4 years have all been about $90 billion. They refinanced this year too but only $28  billion. So we confirm these payments will only increase as they refinance if they refinance. They may make money off marketable assets but they only have $26 billion to access this year. This is why they'd restructure if needed. They'll have it in the future but not this year. \n4. Apple has been against these shops for years. They do everything they can to make it hard to impossible for them to repair iPhones. From proprietary adhesives to software only they have. This will change when they are made to share information with the shops.\n5. Services may be growing but it's not their most profitable segment, iPhones are, and by a long shot. Maybe they can pivot into just services, but I highly doubt it alone will generate more revenue than all segments combined currently make while iPhone regresses.\n\nBecause dividends keep investors in the boat when the water is rocking it. Every company increases dividends to entice investors to stay during times of turbulence. Hint: JB Hunt increased dividend 33% but cut forecasts and bonuses for the company this year. Banks increased dividends heading into 2008 crisis. Oil companies increased dividends while the price of oil per barrel decreased (exception is the events in recent weeks). Maybe they sell authorized shares to come up with cash but all of this still means the stock is overvalued and due for disruption.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1.

They locked in their interest. It's not adjusted. Net income was $95 billion last year. They spent near $90 billion on that on buying back shares. If they don't buy back any shares, they would have $90 billion extra in cash. Cash sitting idle does nothing for them so they opted to increase dividends and buybacks to create shareholders value. What are you specifically claiming here? That Apple doesn't have the cashflow to pay off their liabilities? \n4. Such a small part of their business it's not even worth mentioning. The underlying point is people wanted the right to fix it on their own. Not a huge issue monetarily.\n5. By profitable, I meant for every $ in sales, 70% of that is profit. This is why services has quickly become Apple's new golden egg. It's easier to piggyback off their services than to depend on new hardware sales.\n\nYou don't make sense. You're claiming Apple is having liquidity issues but no company having liquidity issues increases their dividends. If their liquidity was becoming an issue, they would decrease or eliminate dividends, grow their cash stack even more, and problem solved. The fact they are distributing cash to their shareholders means they aren't worried about their liabilities impacting their business in a tangible way. You also ignore that Apple spent nearly $90 billion last year buying back outstanding shares. Why? If they have short-term liability issues, why buy back shares? They spent $500 billion the past decade buying back shares. Again, $500 BILLION. If they wanted and truly had liquidity issues, buying back shares is the worst thing they could do as their liquidity issues would hurt the operations of the company and devalue the shares they just bought.\n\nStop. Your analysis is way off here. There's a reason why short interest on Apple shares are the lowest it has ever been. No one is betting on it being bankrupt let alone, crashing in prices. None of what you're saying is valid.

{"title": "Article: \u201cThese 3 Charts Strongly Suggest the U.S. Stock Market Has an Invisible Hand Propping It Up\u201d By Pam Martens, March 23, 2022", "selftext": "[**Link to Article**](https://archive.today/qfEff)\n\n# ============\n\n# \u201cThese 3 Charts Strongly Suggest the U.S. Stock Market Has an Invisible Hand Propping It Up\u201d By Pam Martens: March 23, 2022\n\nAs someone who has watched trading screens for the past 36 years, it\u2019s pretty easy to spot a fake market. As the charts below indicate, there is an invisible hand (or hands) pushing this stock market up when it should be plunging. The likely suspects are U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s Plunge Protection Team, known as [the Exchange Stabilization Fund](https://archive.ph/9NWoh); foreign central banks that are aligned with the U.S. position on Ukraine and want to help stabilize financial markets in the West; hedge funds and [Wall Street\u2019s Dark Pools](https://archive.ph/f2Pin) owned by megabanks that are net long the market; or a combination of all of the above.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, the stock market is not responding in a normal fashion to soaring inflation, a hawkish Fed, spiking interest rates, and military aggression by an out-of-control dictator with 6,000 nuclear warheads.\n\nConsider the chart below: since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has skyrocketed by 20 percent, currently reaching 2.38 percent. That was a correct and normal reaction since inflation is already soaring in the U.S. and the military aggression is going to disrupt oil and gas supplies from Russia via sanctions, thus likely pushing commodity prices even higher. In a normally functioning stock market, an increase in yield of that magnitude on the 10-year Treasury note would have caused the stock market to plunge. Instead, per the chart below, the S&P 500 stock index has actually risen 5 percent since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n[Yield on 10-Year U.S. Treasury vs S&P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://preview.redd.it/xbv9tduqzdp81.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=068c0bb077701262987ff0b646cd0e5200a7b98b)\n\nThe stock market\u2019s bizarre behavior is further evidenced by the chart below. It shows how the S&P 500 stock index has performed in relation to the S&P GSCI commodity index since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Notice particularly how the dramatic spike in commodity prices between February 24 and March 8 was not met with a dramatic plunge in stock prices during that same period. It should have been. Then there is the equally important fact of a big yawn from the stock market as a nuclear power invades a sovereign nation of 44 million people, bombs its cities and towns to rubble, and persists in making threats against the U.S. and allies that are supporting Ukraine. Commodity Prices vs S&P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine\n\n[Commodity Prices vs S&P 500 Since Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://preview.redd.it/hwmsc28vzdp81.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=da96f6ed1248fbe6e58f21e6881ce80955b0fb68)\n\nAnd, finally, there is the disparate reaction of the stock market versus the correct share price reaction of the global banks that will be impacted by the Russian invasion. The chart below shows the radically different response from the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500 index, versus global banks since February 1, 2022. We selected the date of February 1 because that was the point at which Russia had amassed 100,000 troops near Ukraine\u2019s borders, backed up with tanks and artillery. The global banks shown on the chart below are those with significant exposure to Russia. The worst performing of these, Austria\u2019s Raiffeisenbank, has lost 50 percent of its value while the S&P 500 is down less than one percent from February 1 as of yesterday\u2019s market close.\n\nThe stock market is supposed to be an efficient pricing mechanism. When it stops efficiently pricing risk, it loses the public\u2019s confidence. Those invisible hands should think long and hard about that reality.\n\n[S&P 500 Stock Index vs Global Banks Since February 1, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/ahi2uacxzdp81.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=914900ba2c9e720507be381c1ccc020df6fb59c2)", "id": "tlxrkw", "created_utc": 1648096570.0, "score": 242, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|180|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tlxrkw)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tlxrkw)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21397148072719574}, {"body": "Calls it is.", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "I don\u2019t get the inflation argument.
