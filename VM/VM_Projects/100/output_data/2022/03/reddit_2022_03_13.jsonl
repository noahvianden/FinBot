{"title": "I've essentially been a perma-bull, but this current market has me very nervous", "selftext": "Over the past decade, I've always been of the mindset that any pullback in the market would be temporary and in hindsight would be merely seen as excellent opportunities to buy the dip. For the most part that has worked out great.  Unfortunately this current market feels different.  \n\nNothing earthshattering here, but these are the issues that really worry me:\n\n1. **Inflation / supply chain issues / Oil.** I was of the mindset that as covid restrictions were eased, supply chain issues would ease as well and the world economy would be unharnessed and supply chain issues would resolve.  Unfortunately that has not happened.  Particularly with oil, which is so interconnected across many industries.  There aren't any convincing signs that tell me inflation and supply issues will subside any time soon.  I would personally love to see the whitehouse incentivize american oil producers to ramp up oil production.  It's almost a patriotic duty.  We're sitting on massive amounts of oil, but american oil producers will not produce any more oil to help bring in more supply. Unfortunately I do not see any relief in sight on any of these issues.\n2. **War in Ukraine.** At first I though the market tanking toward the beginning of the Ukraine invasion was an excellent buying opportunity, as the sanctions on Russia don't seem like they'll have a noticeable impact on most company's earnings (bought a bunch of GOOG and MSFT).  Unfortunately the constant fear of world war 3 is going to put a ceiling on this market.  Russia thought they'd just blow through Ukraine and call it good, but the Ukrainian heroics have forced Russia to shift to the long game.  This war could drag out for months if not years, especially since even if Russia eventually takes over the whole country, I imagine there will be constant insurgency and continued fighting.  Don't see an end to this any time in the near future.\n3. **Fed rate hikes.** With inflation running wild and showing no signs of alleviating, the Fed has no choice but to continue to hike rates to try to get things under control.  While I'm seeing many people who are much smarter than me saying stagflation is not a legitimate risk for the country at this time, rate hikes certainly won't help with any growth.  \n\nNot only do we currently have these major issues, but I don't see how any of them could be resolved in the near future.  I'm keeping my weekly dollar cost averaging going in my Vanguard account (I will never stop this), but I'm not planning on buying any individual stocks for the time being.  I'm more pessimistic than I've been for a long time.\n\nThoughts? Am I way off on anything / everything? I don't claim to be the knower of all things, so I'd love to hear other perspectives\n\nEdit: For clarity, I'm not selling anything. I've got gotten too pessimistic to buy this dip. If it drops another 10% or so I'll reconsider again. Also, I won't just build up a big cash reserve that will waste away with inflation. I'm planning on putting my flow of excess cash in my Nexo account where I get 8% interest for holding stablecoin.", "id": "tcwe9u", "created_utc": 1647136538.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "This is why dca into index funds is the best.

{"title": "With the likelihood of a recession increasing everyday due to oil and gas prices staying elevated. What is everyone buying puts on?", "selftext": "In case in one has been living underneath a rock, the Russia situation has added more stress to the supply chain problem we\u2019ve been experiencing, specifically to oil and gas and other commodities. \n\nNot every recession is triggered by oil and gas price increase of 50%. But every increase of oil and gas price of 50% has triggered a recession. There\u2019s a common saying, \u201cthe best way to fight high oil and gas prices is high oil and gas prices\u201d. What this means is that the price of oil and gas will get so high to the point that demand destruction will occur and businesses will no longer be able to turn a profit and have to resort to closing their operations and start laying off employees. When employees are laid off, people will start spend less money. When people spend less money, more business will have to close their operations and lay off more employees. And the cycle continues. Eventually, this will result in a recession, and as a result, oil and gas prices will come back down to earth.\n\nSo if history repeats itself, we\u2019ll be entering a recession if oil and gas prices stay this high. What is everyone buying puts on? \n\nHere are some stocks that I\u2019m looking into buying puts on:\n\n1. Expedia (expe). Stock is near all time highs. Ain\u2019t no one traveling with oil and gas prices being so high, which directly impacts the prices of tickets.\n\n2. Seaworld (seas). Stock is near all time highs. Ain\u2019t no one going to seaworld to see dolphins flip in water when they can\u2019t even afford to drive to commute to work\n\n3. Wayfair (W) ain\u2019t no one paying for new furniture at home, when they already bought everything they needed from Covid. \n\n4. Etsy (Etsy). Ain\u2019t no one got money to pay for expensive homemade goods during a recession. They be buying at dollar stores\n\nThis is all I have now.

But the largest part of that was people bought houses way over their means. Or took new money loans on their existing houses that were way beyond their means. The banks knew they wouldn't be able to pay, but they didn't care because they sell the loans on the secondary market. \n\n2008 was also about rates. The fed starting increasing rates in 2005 and kept going until they realized they were causing a problem in 2007 and started reversing course. People with flat incomes who could afford large mortgages in the low interest rate environment. But when rates went up, they soon found themselves underwater when values decreased and eventually defaulted. \n\nWhat happens when rates rise? The economy slows a bit each time. The housing market slows. This is why they adjust many times over a long period vs one large adjustment, one time. What happens when the fed starts QT? Loan standards tighten and lenders increase rates a bit more because it's not as easy to sell the loan on the secondary market and they'll have to keep it on their books. If they're going to do that, it's at a higher rate or they'd rather not grant it at all. \n\n>A house with large loan is an excellent inflation hedge\n\nI have no idea what you're trying to say here.

{"title": "$SST - The Incarnation of Market Maker's Fear UPDATE", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI thought I'd provide an update on System1 (SST) from [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tag6am/sst_the_incarnation_of_a_market_makers_fear/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). First and foremost, this **play is still well and alive**. The numbers have only improved, all signs are pointing towards MMs/short sellers frantically trying to suppress the price prior to the S-1 going effective, which as it **currently stands**, will be the **week of March 31st at the latest**. A lot of enthusiasm exists for this play on twitter and many people more 'fluent in finance' than myself and with access to better resources have been providing a lot of useful information for this play which I will include.\n\nBased upon the feedback from my last post, I will leave out the 'Ape fanfic' as the majority of negative comments were due to this and I disenfranchised a lot of people off the get go. I will treat this more scientific with emphasis on highlighting the 'need to know' details, without droning on too much. If this post gets a **TON** of traction, I may do another attempt at an ape version.\n\nI hate writing DDs in general but I feel like this play warrants the huge amount of time and effort I have already spent because **(1)** it has the potential to generate **life changing gains** for anyone owning stock/calls and **(2)** retail buyers can be the **final** catalyst to this play going parabolic, **I.E.** ***YOU!***\n\n# System1 Crash Course\n\n>**TLDR**\n\n* **Micro-float of 703K shares**\n* **SI of 1.37M** **shares, average CTB between 44%-115%**\n* **ITM OI March and April claims 450% of Float**\n* **April OI steadily increasing - indicating MMs expect S-1 to not be effective prior to March OPEX**\n* **IRNT gamma squeeze lasted until OPEX**\n* **ESSC died Tuesday of of OPEX**\n* **VWAP Clause isn't a threat until S-1 Effective, so play is a go past March 18th (assuming no filing)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Float Size**\n\n* SST is a high-redemption deSPAC with a 98.5% redemption rate. SST is a  System1 combines best-in-class technology & data science to operate its advanced Responsive Acquisition Marketing Platform (RAMP). TREB was the name of the SPAC prior to the change in ticker to SST\n* Low-float due to the high redemption rate, the CURRENT float stands at \\~703k shares.\n* Many have asked about what I mean by \"redemption rates\" and how its even possible to have a float so small. The total number of shares (insider owned, institution owned, public float, owned by company) stands at 100M. When a SPAC's sponsors approve a business combination, they can choose to convert their ownership of the SPAC directly to SST or sell their stake back (Redeem) to the SPAC. [Good source for deSPAC process](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2021/6/published-articles/redemption-rights-bij-spacs).\n* The redeemed shares for SST **CANNOT** be sold until the business combination (BC) goes into effect. This happens after the S-1 is filed and becomes effective. **No S-1 has been filed**, on System1's website, they posted a [draft S-1](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001805833/e73525a3-b2f2-4846-84bf-5ab8654fe05c.pdf).\n* Many investors including myself have emailed IR asking on the status of the real S-1 filing. They (CFO himself) replied with:  \"*No issues.* ***We need to have an effective S1 on file for you to exercise your warrants on a cash basis*** *through DTC. We are working diligently to do that, but have not provided guidance publicly.*\u00a0 ***We have to file a 10K and audited financials for S1 and Protected by 3/31***\\*, *which are all pre-requisites for an effective S-1 if that's helpful*\". As of 3/13/2022, **System1 has not filed a 10-K OR the audited financials for \"Protected\".** now \"Just Develop It\", a subsidiary company owned by System1.\n* Further, according to [Repos39's twitter](https://twitter.com/Repos_39/status/1502846206434717697?s=20&t=xJvFj5XEQg1LHCTVmKmsWg), SST switched auditors recently and progress on the audit for Protected may be lagging behind and the S-1 filing could require an amendment (S-1/A)  prior to becoming effective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Short Data**\n\n* As of February 28, SST has a short interest of **1.37 million shares** [per fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/sst). With a float of 703k shares that puts the short interest at 194% of the free float.\n* Below is a graphic of the FTDs up until Feb 28th. Clearly showing rampant naked shorting, suggesting complete desperation by shorts to keep themselves from being margin called. On March 15 (Tuesday) new data for FTDs will be released by the SEC and I'm sure will have even more extreme FTDS as the stock continues to climb consistently.\n\n[SST FTDs, Will Update on 3/15](https://preview.redd.it/t4hjy9d7d7n81.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7291adb1cc26f2351e31e6fa45acd8629f14441)\n\n* FINRA short ratios for SST remain in the 50% of total volume ratio range, crossing into the mid 60% a few times last week.\n* Cost to borrow is also through the roof at **42%** per fintel and others stating **rates as high as 115%** according to FINRA.\n* There is a continued high churn rate of borrowing and returning with **1.89 days to cover.**\n* Shorting likely began at or shortly after $TREB sponsors approved the business combination and ticker change to $SST, meaning anyone started a short position on January 20th, means they will hit a their -100% on their margin maintenance fee at the $18-$20 range. When this happens, any institution or fund at -100% minimum maintenance margin receive a  **margin call.**\n* The moment a hedge fund or institution with a significant short position gets a **margin call,** it forces them to cover their short position immediately, leading to a massive demand for stock. This further leads to other institutions short on the stock receiving a margin due to the massive increase in stock price caused by earlier margin calls.\n* **Remember that last point.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Options Data**\n\n* Current OI of all call options ITM ($15c and below) in both April and March strikes is at **450% of the float.** This level of delta hedging is absurd and option volume/OI has been reflective that MMs are exercising these calls at very high rates. These majority of these options are primarily used by market makers to acquire shares without causing the stock's price to increase in the exchange.\n* Since my last post, OI on the ITM April strikes have DRAMATICALLY increased. This indicates that **Market Makers likely anticipate SST S-1 to** **not be filed before the March 18th OPEX.**\n* Market makers stand to lose a LOT of money when demand for a stock greatly exceeds supply. without going into too much detail, this is why Robinhood shut down buying of GME and AMC.\n* **IRNT gamma squeeze lasted until OPEX**, ESSC runup occured up until Tuesday of OPEX week.\n* Gamma squeeze is still a total possibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Other Info**\n\n* In my last post I highlighted the VWAP clause coming into effect on March 18th as a potential play killer. However, the **VWAP clause is only viable if the S-1 is effective.**\n* I have only increased my position in SST since my last post. I own March Calls but I plan on rolling into April Calls after doing more research this weekend.\n* I haven't been deterred whatsoever by negative feedback for this play. It is inherently a high risk play with **unbelievable upside**\n* Stocks like ESSC may be similar to SST, but its not a fair comparison. Primarily, no retail buyers without amnesia have forgotten the two giga dumps after non-stop pumping by countless redditors and fintwit.\n* I will keep updating this post, but I wanted to get this info out ASAP for anyone who hasn't heard of it.\n* Do your own DD!

My take is the company is completely under the radar. They have done 0 marketing on System1 the brand. The market was EXTREMELY anti-spac from when they announced the merger in June to the launch in January. I don't think anyone bought in when it was trebia. Want proof? Look at the chart of TREB between the announcement and the merger. There was literally 0 price movement. Only waved between 9.90 and $10 the ENTIRE TIME. Supposedly there were two big whales who bought in but redeemed their shares. Probably because of the anti spac sentiment. They may have guessed it would tank and they could pick up more shares at the lower price point. \nAdditionally, if you look at the cap table you will see management controls an extremely high percentage of the shares. We are talking 85%+ if you include Cannae leadership. So there were very few shares ever offered to the public for purchase. \nBlend is a savant and his CFO is very sharp.
