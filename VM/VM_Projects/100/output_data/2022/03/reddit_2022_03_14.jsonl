{"title": "In-depth Analysis: Putin Vs Elon Single Combat", "selftext": "Putin: \nAge: 69\nHeight 5 feet 7 inches \nWeight: 157 pounds\nReach: 2 feet 7 inches\n\nFighting Styles: \n   Putin\u2019s primary style is Judo. He originally obtained his black belt at 15, but this has since been revoked. \n\nSupplementary: \n   Putin is also said to practice Sambo and Kyokushin. \n\nWeapons training: \n    Putin has extensive training with various fire arms as documented with his hunting background. \n    Poison debufs have long been Putin\u2019s primary damage source for single targets, but it is unclear if Putin has the charisma stat needed to convince Elon to drink/Eat which may limit its impact.\n     Putin has a well documented Chemical, nuclear, and ballistic missiles supply, but the size of the arena may limit there effectiveness. \n   Additionally we can assume he has explosive experience and a potential for a hidden shoe blade(Source Deadliest Warrior: Spetsnaz vs Green Beret S1E2) thanks to his time with the KGB/FSB.\n\nAssumed: \n\n   Due to Putin\u2019s history KGB experience it can be assumed that he has experience with some Greco-Roman wrestling techniques to the extent they are used in Systema. ARB techniques can also be assumed due to Putin FSB involvement.\n\nTheoretical: \n\n   Animal Magnetism. Putin has on numerous occasions showed a bizarre ability to control animals with his mind. Feats include calming and hugging a polar bear and earning the respect of militant pigeons(claimed to be a hoax by many). \n   While it is not certain that Putin can use this power at will or if he will have access to Polar bears at the fight location, it should not be overlooked.\n\n\nElon: \nHeight:  6 feet, -2 Inches *see edit*\nWeight(Assumed): 180.7 pounds\nWing Span: 2\u201911 inches\n\nFighting Styles\nAllegad: Musk has stated that he has trained in Kyokushin , Karate, Taekwondo, Judo, and BJJ since an early age. I have not been able to confirm this.\n\nWeapons training: We have definitive evidence that he not only owns at least one \u201cflamethrower\u201d and has some experience using it.\n\nAssumed: \n   Autistic Strength: Musk has stated several times that he has Autism and confirmed with his actions. It can be assumed he posses some level of Autistic Strength.\n\nWeeb Techniques: \n   While I can not definitively say that Elon has access to techniques from his love of Anime, it should also be a factor. Additionally it can be assumed he has some mastery of the blade, but it is unclear if this only applies to the katana.\n\nTech: \n  There is a very real possibility Elon would utilize Tesla\u2019s Autonomous vehicles as \u201ccavalry\u2019s\u201d to and/or flame based IED\u2019s. Historically both methods have been proven effective to incapacitate or kill with, but it is unclear if targeting only applies to passengers and innocent 3rd party motorists. SpaceX rockets and Satellites are a theoretical factor that could also become a factor.\n\nLocation: \n\n Russia: \n   If the bout were to take place in Russia Putin would gain a significant boost due to potential for status effects (poison), cold resistance, and ally assist(Snipers, FIS, and Friendly Law Enforcement).\n    We can also assume Putin will gain a slight buff due to the \u201cDefending the Motherland\u201d buff applied to all Russia Citizens when a foreign force invades. \n\n International Waters: \n   Both Elon and Putin\u2019s yachts show experience on the ocean and could provide naval support. Putin has more experience on the water and time at sea due to his well documented yacht escapades. While Elon does have some sailing experience, it is not as lengthy as Putin\u2019s. Additionally we can assume that Russia\u2019s naval fleets would likely be deployed. \n\nUkraine: \n   Elon and Putin would both gain massive ally buffs without a definitive \nadvantage to either side.\n   Putin would likely experience the Away from Motherland Debuff. This is assumed due to the historical precedent shown in Ukraine, Afghanistan, etc. of Russians willpower, fortitude, and strength debuffs when Russia invaded as seen in Afghastan, Ukraine, etc.\n\nTerms of Engagement:\n\n   It is unclear if the bout will be to death, incapacitation, or yielding. If the match is to the death Putin has a clear psychological advantage. \n   It is unclear if weapons will be allowed and to what extent. We can assume both fighters will play dirty and have various undisclosed gadgets. \n\nTLDR/Conclusion: \n\n Both Papa Musk and Vladdy Daddy have distinct advantages in various categories. A clear favorite cannot be chosen until terms of engagement are ratified.\n\nA CEO challenging the most powerful dictator on the planet to single combat is a clear signal of strength to investors. Bullish on Tesla. Bearish on the Rubble.\n\nResearch Methods: Vyvanse 70mg\n\nEdits: \n\nThank you to thekittynati for pointing out that Putin\u2019s funny number age will likely affect the public perception and could be a bullish signal for the rubble.\n\nDue to several Elon Musk height experts concerns I have revised 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet, -2 inches. I believe this is a fair compromise since the best proof I have been able to find are photos with Joe Rogan who is approximately 4 feet 11 inches.", "id": "te2zwf", "created_utc": 1647279284.0, "score": 2586, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 259, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|28|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=te2zwf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=te2zwf)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "For those asking for less complex analysis here is my [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfhlt/a_brief_explanation_of_options_for_stoolies/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) guide for new WSB members", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0896996483206749}, {"body": "Epic post, thanks for the much needed laugh.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16536739468574524}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11469797044992447}, {"body": "Age 69.
