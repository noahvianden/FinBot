{"title": "Amazon closes $6.5 billion deal to acquire MGM", "selftext": "Amazon.com Inc. has closed on its $6.5 billion acquisition of the MGM movie and television studio, the company said Thursday.\n\nThe move comes after Amazon certified to the Federal Trade Commission that it had provided all the information requested by antitrust investigators reviewing the deal. That step put the deal on a regulatory clock with the agency that has now expired, leaving the company free to move forward, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nAmazon provided the FTC with more than three million documents over the past eight months as part of the review process, the person familiar with the matter said.\n\nEven though the deadline has expired, the commission would still have the ability to challenge the acquisition later, if a majority on the FTC votes to do so. The five-member commission is currently split 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans, with one vacancy. A President Biden nominee for the open seat remains pending in the Senate. An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-closes-6-5-billion-deal-to-acquire-mgm-11647527256?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-closes-6-5-billion-deal-to-acquire-mgm-11647527256?mod=mw_latestnews)", "id": "tgcbkt", "created_utc": 1647529618.0, "score": 333, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Hopefully it will add new content to prime video", "score": 128, "replies": [{"body": "They need to for sure", "score": 38, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23569323122501373}, {"body": "All the bond movies hopefully", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Stargate", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This is the ONLY new show i want", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I dunno if I want Amazon's vision for Stargate.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not sure either but i do want to decide for myself after watching it.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0892435684800148}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2572040259838104}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23587051033973694}, {"body": "I miss those movies so bad", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3703112304210663}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29640066623687744}, {"body": "Reacher was great imo.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "What made it great was that it didn't get bogged down by 'critics/oscar stuff'.\n\nJust a fun, beat-'em-up revenge journey.

For the most part, driving is actually a *simplified* task in that realm. Most automakers (including Tesla!) don't even model the pathing in three dimensions, but rather two dimensions, and the overall *goal* is as simple as applying [A\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to some user-provided input (a destination). The outputs are simple \u2014 acceleration and steering only, on an inherently stable agent \u2014\u00a0no balancing required, no shifting centre of gravity. The inputs are mostly predictable and clear. Nearly all responses to external stimuli involve modulating your acceleration or yielding to other agents. Things like road signs are mostly from a [defined, standardized](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/services/publications/fhwaop02084/index.htm) set.\n\nThe bot is much more (several orders of magnitude) complicated, even at its simplest.

It only gets worse from there.\n\nYou mention object recognition, and I want to point out object recognition is easy, and basically solved at this point.

How do I operate the power switch?\n* How do I know *when it's powered on*?\n* How do I avoid vacuuming up loose items (screws, papers, etc.) which may be important, and may have fallen off a shelf?\n* If I'm sweeping, how I pick up dust I've sweeped? Is there a dust pan? What do I do with it? What if the dust pan is missing?\n* Where do I find an appropriate rubbish bin, and how do I know it's important to avoid spilling dust on the way there?

Hell, if you want to be impressed, Waymo is at the point of building photorealistic scenes *entirely in neural networks* ([Block-NeRF](https://waymo.com/research/block-nerf/)) and even *that* doesn't mean much in isolation. It's the *semantics* of how you interact with a scene that is the major challenge, and one that is unsolvable by a simulator itself, alone, in a general manner.\n\nThis statement:\n\n>Once that's done, do the same thing for Starbucks baristas, cashiers, baggers at grocery stores, shelve stockers, you name it.\n\n...to put it delicately, is just a *gobsmacking* understatement of a sentence rolled up into a neat little package. Neural networks and deep learning simply *do not work that way*. They *cannot learn* a task as abstracted as *being a drop-in barista* simply by watching and learning, they need to be specifically trained (ie, adversarially) on *each specific minute sub-task* (ie, picking up a cup) of *each discipline*.\n\nEach one of these subtasks is monumentally complicated, even at its simplest. Articulated joints mean shifting centres of gravity. Tasks and targets exist in three dimensions, and multiple orientations. Goals are dynamic, and sometimes ambiguous or nuanced. Objects presented for manipulation are not guaranteed to be from a finite, defined set, and have a non-finite number of possible interactions.\n\nIn contrast, as I mentioned in another comment, the subtasks involved in basic driving are absolutely minute \u2014\u00a0it is actually an immensely *simplified task.* Pathing happens in two dimensions, and the overall goal is just shortest-path navigation of a map to some user-provided input (a destination). The outputs are simple \u2014 acceleration and steering only, on an inherently stable vehicle \u2014 no balancing required, no shifting centre of gravity. Nearly all responses to external stimuli involve modulating your acceleration or yielding to other agents. Things like road signs are mostly from a defined, standardized set.\n\nYou're getting the idea that we can simulate other things just because we can simulate driving, but all of other things are *genuine orders of magnitude* more complex.\n\nIn your previous thread, you'll see u/misteratoz, u/Kalsin8, and u/Kirk57 echo all the things I've just mentioned, and they're all *completely bang-on.*", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Driving might be simple in terms of the degrees of freedom that the car has (acceleration and left and right turning) but it is insanely complex in terms of the scenarios it can run into. Hundreds of miles can be covered in a day with different weather, biomes, and all the craziness of the real world. I completely disagree with you that it's simple.\n\nThe whole point of machine learning is that you don't need to program any of the complexities that you're taking about. You just need an accurate physics engine and cad models, the ability to compute fast enough to iterate on a reasonable time frame, set some parameters (don't spill the coffee, don't run into shit and give the customer their order) and then you run that scenario a few million times.

It's *explicitly* an examination of what you'd need to get, say, a simple L4 system going, as compared to the most simple, useful, generalized task-performing bipedal robot you could think of.\n\nI'm not going to repeat what I've already said regarding that, and I would encourage you to understand my argument and be receptive to it, not just argue past it as you're doing now.\n\nThe way you're talking about machine learning is conceptually a fundamental misunderstanding of what it is and how it works. The phrases \"give the customer their order\" and \"don't spill the coffee\" and are landmines involving thousands of individual, complex interactions, *each* as complex as the ***basic*** self-driving task.\n\nPhysics engines have nothing to do with it.
