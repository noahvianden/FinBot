It posted revenue of $54 million, well below investors' expectations of $60 million.\n\nAs of Thursday's market close, Rivian's share price had dropped about 77% and lost $124.5 billion in market capitalization since hitting its peak after going public in November.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Amy Caren Daniel and Matthew Lewis)\n\n[Source](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/news/basicNewsStory.jhtml?symbols=RIVN&storyid=202203101651RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_KCN2L72KI-OUSBS_1&provider=RTRSNEWS&product=COMBINED&sb=1)", "id": "tbb6rk", "created_utc": 1646952339.0, "score": 177, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "Amazon's Q1 earnings aren't going to look so rosy with rivian taking a steaming dump this year so far", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "My conspiracy theory is that this is exactly why Amazon announced the stock split and buy back after more than 20 years of explicitly staying they would not split.\n\nTheir CFO saw the forecasted numbers from his team, slammed the alarm bell and told the board that they needed to pump the price up before the rivian impact hit. \n\nI'm being half glib, but as a person working in Corp finance this isnt a large exaggeration of what happens behind board/exco meetings.", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Smoke and mirrors...

Yes, Ford has a lot of legacy *baggage*. They have a hugely monumental task of ramping up their EV production fast enough to displace ICE sales in the hopes that demand for ICEs doesn't decline faster than they can keep up with.\n\nEven catching up to Tesla's 1M EVs per year isn't going to be good enough. They need to hit that 4M/year EVs produced ASAP. No law of economics says that the downward trend in ICE demand will be slow, gentle and easy for Ford and an equal-opposite mirror to EV ramp up. Those two things operate at very different time scales. They can hope for a slow decline in ICE demand but need to plan for a dramatic and fast collapse or just not bother trying.\n\nAnd what kind of tech do they plan to use to get there? LG pouch cells. The same pouch cells in the [Bolt](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a38252667/battery-experts-explain-chevy-bolt-fires/), [Pacifica PHEV](https://insideevs.com/news/567150/chrysler-pacifica-phev-recall/) and [Mach-E GT](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/mustang-mach-e-gt-vs-tesla-model-y-performance-power-problem.html). The same pouch cells notorious for overheating, swelling and bursting into flame. They have a brilliant plan to cram a shitload of those into an F-150 frame and have people tow heavy loads with that. Heavy loads. With crappy pouch cells known for thermal runaway issues. Probably good for popping popcorn over.\n\nRivian's got its own challenges like any other startup but their tech lead and experience are huge. They're up there with Tesla and Lucid with over a decade of experience and know-how. It's no mistake that these three companies have the longest-range EVs on the market and they're all using cylindrical cells. The only exception are base-model, non-performance Tesla Ys and 3s that use CATL prismatic cells. But if you want high-performance or high-load batteries it's becoming obvious that you need cylindrical.\n\nRivian will struggle but get a big boost when Ford, GM and Stellantis EV pickups are either bursting into flames or stranded on the side of the road at the start of a mountain pass.

{"title": "Rivian, failed price hikes, only 1000 vehicles sold, French bonds and Ford's soon to happen dumping, This could mean blood in the water.", "selftext": "So posting this because last time I made a DD on a earnings call it went quite well for me, consider this a good luck charm (especially if you roast me in the comments).\n\nBut Rivian's earnings this time around seem to be expecting a better cash burn rate than this time 3 months ago. HOW? They're still building their factory and I assume paying employees more due to COLAs in addition to increased component costs. \n\nI noticed today that they're selling a billion dollars in USD bonds in France with an expiration of 2025.  This just adds liability onto the bonfire that is the company. Alexa ranks show their traffic TANKING. All their metrics are all down. I expect this to mean it's a brand currently in decline short term. Meaning it's not growing, but adding more debt to the pile of a currently shrinking business.\n\nThe failed price hikes are an example of desperate moves to try to make some profit off the cars, which failed and led to backlash. This means that if they aren't making money off the trucks for the pre-orders, then they're losing money on each truck they sell, meaning cash burn would be worse as of now. Not to mention the planned rollout of charging stations and the cancelled pre-orders on their end (see rivian sub-reddit). This means that unfortunately for the Rivian hopefuls, at least right now, they're most likely trying to decrease units built, not increase them. Meaning a bad guidance.\n\nFord is a major shareholder and is expected to dump once the lockup is over. If that's the case and the eventuality of Rivian's stock price is down, then it only makes sense to dilute the stock like crazy now and get the cash before Ford can. I saw a post the other day saying Ford might dump and then buy the ashes of the company for pennies on the dollar. With the decline of lincoln being more for rich boomers/Gen-x'ers, millennials want an offering to their tastes which is what (I assume) a Rivian division of ford would bring. The only way to survive is to make sure they can't do this, so RJ's gotta crash it first.\n\nRivian puts 0DTE, let's do this. (I got in before IV jacked it up sorry everyone). Also, everyone knows what a tesla is, whose parents know what a Rivian is?
