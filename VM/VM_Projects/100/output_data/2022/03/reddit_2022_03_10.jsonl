It posted revenue of $54 million, well below investors' expectations of $60 million.\n\nAs of Thursday's market close, Rivian's share price had dropped about 77% and lost $124.5 billion in market capitalization since hitting its peak after going public in November.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Amy Caren Daniel and Matthew Lewis)\n\n[Source](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/news/basicNewsStory.jhtml?symbols=RIVN&storyid=202203101651RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_KCN2L72KI-OUSBS_1&provider=RTRSNEWS&product=COMBINED&sb=1)", "id": "tbb6rk", "created_utc": 1646952339.0, "score": 177, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "Amazon's Q1 earnings aren't going to look so rosy with rivian taking a steaming dump this year so far", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "My conspiracy theory is that this is exactly why Amazon announced the stock split and buy back after more than 20 years of explicitly staying they would not split.\n\nTheir CFO saw the forecasted numbers from his team, slammed the alarm bell and told the board that they needed to pump the price up before the rivian impact hit. \n\nI'm being half glib, but as a person working in Corp finance this isnt a large exaggeration of what happens behind board/exco meetings.", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Smoke and mirrors...

Yes, Ford has a lot of legacy *baggage*. They have a hugely monumental task of ramping up their EV production fast enough to displace ICE sales in the hopes that demand for ICEs doesn't decline faster than they can keep up with.\n\nEven catching up to Tesla's 1M EVs per year isn't going to be good enough. They need to hit that 4M/year EVs produced ASAP. No law of economics says that the downward trend in ICE demand will be slow, gentle and easy for Ford and an equal-opposite mirror to EV ramp up. Those two things operate at very different time scales. They can hope for a slow decline in ICE demand but need to plan for a dramatic and fast collapse or just not bother trying.\n\nAnd what kind of tech do they plan to use to get there? LG pouch cells. The same pouch cells in the [Bolt](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a38252667/battery-experts-explain-chevy-bolt-fires/), [Pacifica PHEV](https://insideevs.com/news/567150/chrysler-pacifica-phev-recall/) and [Mach-E GT](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/mustang-mach-e-gt-vs-tesla-model-y-performance-power-problem.html).

Heavy loads. With crappy pouch cells known for thermal runaway issues. Probably good for popping popcorn over.\n\nRivian's got its own challenges like any other startup but their tech lead and experience are huge. They're up there with Tesla and Lucid with over a decade of experience and know-how. It's no mistake that these three companies have the longest-range EVs on the market and they're all using cylindrical cells. The only exception are base-model, non-performance Tesla Ys and 3s that use CATL prismatic cells. But if you want high-performance or high-load batteries it's becoming obvious that you need cylindrical.\n\nRivian will struggle but get a big boost when Ford, GM and Stellantis EV pickups are either bursting into flames or stranded on the side of the road at the start of a mountain pass.

{"title": "Rivian, failed price hikes, only 1000 vehicles sold, French bonds and Ford's soon to happen dumping, This could mean blood in the water.", "selftext": "So posting this because last time I made a DD on a earnings call it went quite well for me, consider this a good luck charm (especially if you roast me in the comments).\n\nBut Rivian's earnings this time around seem to be expecting a better cash burn rate than this time 3 months ago. HOW? They're still building their factory and I assume paying employees more due to COLAs in addition to increased component costs. \n\nI noticed today that they're selling a billion dollars in USD bonds in France with an expiration of 2025.  This just adds liability onto the bonfire that is the company. Alexa ranks show their traffic TANKING. All their metrics are all down. I expect this to mean it's a brand currently in decline short term. Meaning it's not growing, but adding more debt to the pile of a currently shrinking business.\n\nThe failed price hikes are an example of desperate moves to try to make some profit off the cars, which failed and led to backlash. This means that if they aren't making money off the trucks for the pre-orders, then they're losing money on each truck they sell, meaning cash burn would be worse as of now. Not to mention the planned rollout of charging stations and the cancelled pre-orders on their end (see rivian sub-reddit). This means that unfortunately for the Rivian hopefuls, at least right now, they're most likely trying to decrease units built, not increase them. Meaning a bad guidance.\n\nFord is a major shareholder and is expected to dump once the lockup is over. If that's the case and the eventuality of Rivian's stock price is down, then it only makes sense to dilute the stock like crazy now and get the cash before Ford can. I saw a post the other day saying Ford might dump and then buy the ashes of the company for pennies on the dollar. With the decline of lincoln being more for rich boomers/Gen-x'ers, millennials want an offering to their tastes which is what (I assume) a Rivian division of ford would bring. The only way to survive is to make sure they can't do this, so RJ's gotta crash it first.\n\nRivian puts 0DTE, let's do this. (I got in before IV jacked it up sorry everyone). Also, everyone knows what a tesla is, whose parents know what a Rivian is?

Our troops or bases in Afghanistan are gone and could not be leveraged for any operations. Our trustworthiness with our allies had been decimated, after both the Afghanistan withdrawal and our complete abandonment of the Kurds in Syria. \n\nBut it's important to note that most of this was done or caused by the previous administration. Trump deliberately fucked our Kurdish allies and abandoned them. Trump also signed a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban which Biden had to comply with. Obviously Biden could have renegged on the deal, but that would have been an even worse shit show because the entire Afghan endeavor was a quagmire and everyone knew it. \n\nSo yes, Putin definitely saw the USA position as weak.

The current administration royally fucked up Putin's plans, publicized Putin's plans, rallied support, re-armed the Ukranians... yeah...

I give Biden a bit of a pass (perhaps undeservedly) because the timeline was basically just a month after he got into office... seriously, one month. But it was still his job to recognize that the timeline was set and to prioritize finding a way to get out of there, but again, it's my opinion that the super tight timeframe between swearing in to office and our withdraw date from afghanistan basically made this mission impossible for him. I personally might even believe that this was an intentional trap set by Trump to hamstring Biden in the first month of his Presidency, but I can understand if you might disagree with that. \n\nAs for Ukraine, I believe Putin was always going to invade. I can't blame the previous administration that the invasion occurred because I do not believe it's Trump's fault. Honestly, the US and NATO should have had a much stronger reaction when Putin took Crimea. \n\nBut what I \\*can\\* say is that I believe Putin would have preferred Trump to be President during the withdraw, and that Putin would have preferred the US to already be out of NATO (if possible, not a requirement but a nice-to-have for sure). I think we all know Trump loves Putin. He sent him fan mail before becoming President. He sees him as strong, he sees he has full control over the country... Trump wanted that for himself... always has. It's been a long time since I read up on the topic, but I recall when the Kurdish backstab was occurring, I remember thinking and reading that this helped Putin tremendously (but I don't remember the context of it to be honest). \n\nI genuinely believe Trump would have let Ukraine just be rolled over and pretended he didn't know until after it happened. Whether I'm right or not is irrelevant, it's a personal belief. I think Germany kinda wanted to do that too. When Trump first got the Republican nomination in 2016 at the Republican National Convention, one of the first orders of business he had AT the convention was to ensure the Republican party platform did NOT offer lethal aid to Ukraine. You can see that here:  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html)\n\nSo basically, I think the Trump administration made very clear from day 1 that they had no strategic interest in Ukraine at all, that we shouldn't offer Ukraine aid or defensive weapons, and (by implication only) that we should not respond or assist Ukraine if Russia does attempt to invade Ukraine. Even when Trump was required to give the aid to Ukraine by law, Trump delayed, did not release the aid, and then eventually asked for \"a favor\", which I'm sure you and i have different opinions on and I'd rather not get into right now but, I think the combination of these things shows that Trump had no interest in putting anything (effort, money, etc) into Ukraine, and was more concerned with what he could get out of them. \n\nIs Trump at fault for the invasion? No. I think it was always going to happen. Did Trump strengthen Putin's hand in some way or weaken Ukraine to make the invasion easier? Not really, but he definitely tried to not give the weapons when he was required to give the weapons, but in the end, he still gave the weapons so he didn't really have any effect here. But would Putin have preferred Trump be in office when he did invade? Yes, I believe he would have. And I believe the invasion would have been swift and successful if Trump were President. \n\nWould that have been better for the US? Would that avoid WW3? Well, I don't know the answer here. I suspect it wouldn't avoid WW3. I suspect that when someone like Putin has an easy success (like crimea) they begin planning the next one. Eventually Putin would have pushed up against NATO. If we were no longer in NATO, would Putin feel emboldened enough to take Lithuania, Estonia, Moldova, etc? Would Putin try to rebuild the entire Soviet Bloc? Your guess is as good as mine. \n\nWould it be better for the US to let Europe fight Russia alone and the USA comes in at the end and mops up resistance like after WW2, which led to decades of prosperity for us as Europe was a burned out husk? I mean, maybe, but that's not exactly avoiding WW3... that's just trying to stay out of it until we can mop up what's left. \n\nAnyway, I think you should really consider whether Biden has ACTUALLY been weak in this situation or not. I know it's fun to cheer for our team, but every now and then it's good to sit back, revisit all the information, and really consider whether Biden did a bad job here. He basically had three choices: 1) ignore it and let it happen,  2) step in as world police and fight russia directly, or 3) do anything he could to expose the plans, ruin the plans, build consensus, get NATO to back Ukraine with super-lethal weapons, etc. I believe Biden did a pretty good job. Will it avoid WW3? No idea... but I think it will, because Russia's military has been shown to be a huge paper tiger. \n\nI think you should definitely take a step back and think about what a weak President does in this situation.

{"title": "RIVN is dead in the water and their trucks won't even float.", "selftext": "Okay, so here's the deal. Rivian has absolutely nothing going for it. It can't break into the market for consumers because its target market doesn't know trucks at all, and the market it could feasibly advertise to has brand loyalty and doesn't want electric trucks because the smell of gas is too good. It also has an extremely ambitious plan for charging stations across the US which isn't going to happen under their name because they're hemhorraging money like a hemophiliac with a cut artery.\n\nHell even look at their preorders and manufacturing. Making 1000 cars in 3 months and having 71,000 preordered? On top of having 100,000 trucks slated for amazon? It's going to take two years to make even a tenth of those because of material costs, manufacturing, shipping, and servicing. By that point they're going to be losing money by manufacturing previous models when everyone is buying their Ford and Chevy pickups that run on Uranium or corn oil or some shit that has more power than their already underwhelming pickup specs. That's long term, but it's going to reflect in their earnings tomorrow because holy shit the company has no guidance on what they want to do.\n\n\"But wait, Amazon owns 20% of the company, they wouldn't let it go under!\"\n\nJoke's on you they absolutely would. The services they've started up and failed is getting longer each year. Even the whole foods acquisition is losing them money each year and thy can't expand on it or any of their other side services. Each time they do, the service [lasts 1-2 years max and then is completely removed, whether it's a subscription service or product.](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-products-services-failed-discontinued-2019-3#amazon-webpay-22)\n\n\"The company can remain solvent while they get more manufacturing capacities though!\"\n\nThey have billions in debt and their upcoming factory is going to cost them billions more. Now they want [a battery recycling plant that's going to cost them $5bil](https://www.ajc.com/news/rivian-confirms-ev-factory-thousands-of-jobs-coming-to-georgia/CUH7ZNS5URGODNQG7CEUU2FCVY/) and employ 7,500 people at competitive wages starting in 2024 when they hope to start manufacturing and becoming profitable. Building costs alone are going to eat them alive before it's even making trucks that aren't profitable because they're going to need to manufacture 171,000 vehicles at the promised price which will be a loss.\n\nTheir last quarter posted horrible losses, increased overhead costs, and only boasted further lofty expansion ideals that will again, increase their costs and not generate profit to match. This quarter is going to eat them alive and their methods of generating revenue are going to continue to fail until they start focusing on generating actual income instead of trying to promise the moon.\n\nHere's my positions because I can't buy any more until I make bank from this. https://www.imgur.com/a/lUHPvfX\n\nThis is not financial advice, and I actually have no idea if their trucks float or not. I just know electricity and water don't mix well.\n\nEdit: DJ just sent out a news story saying that earnings don't matter and that the only part that will matter is the manufacturing capacity. Investors are expecting only 40,000 cars by the end of the year, just over half of the preorders if no one cancels. Prices are only going up on raw materials and manufacturing too, so the longer it takes for them to get made the lower they net per vehicle and can't manufacture ones at the new price until previour orders are filled. That's not even including the Amazon contract of 100,000 freight vans. They're expecting an 18% move up or down according to Barrons.com. They're going to lose a shit ton of money on the cars that already got sent out because of the insane costs to everything and they still haven't cauterized that figurative hemhorraging femoral money artery. This stock is going to the GROUND.\n\n2nd edit: these numbers are good for Rivian's forward growth, right? https://imgur.com/a/j511eJE\n\n3rd edit: get fucked Rivian, only 9,000 more R1T preorders since last quarter, $4.6 net operating loss for 2021, losing money for each car produced, tripled amount of R&D spending, and now expected to produce a whopping 25,000 cars in 2022 compared to the 40,000 estimate. Can't even fill all preorders now for 2.5 years at this rate, and by that point the technology will be outdated. My puts are gonna be spicy tenders tomorrow, people!\n\nFriday edit: What kind of autism does actual wall street have? A price sitting at close to open currently for a company that had only 1% of its revenue compared to its losses and it has a $100 price target to put it at a market cap of nearly $120bil? The company is going to lose all credit, collateral, and any liquidity in 2-3 years and if inflation halves to what it currently is and supply lines get fixed they STILL lose money on every single vehicle.
