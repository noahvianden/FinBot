{"title": "Goldman cuts U.S. GDP forecast as it says recession odds are as high as 35%", "selftext": "The U.S. stock market put in a resilient performance on Thursday, given the data showing inflation surging to a new 40-year high even before the impact of the recent sanctions on Russia, what appeared to be a pretty dismal result from the Russian-Ukrainian meeting of foreign ministers in Turkey, and a surprisingly hawkish decision by the European Central Bank.\n\nBesides the humanitarian catastrophe, sky-high commodities prices have been the result so far of what has been a two-week invasion. Economists at Goldman Sachs have now cut their forecast for growth for the world\u2019s largest economy in 2022 to 1.75%, from 2% previously and the consensus of 2.75%.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward call. \u201cCombining our commodity strategists\u2019 forecasts with estimates of pass-through to consumer prices, we estimate that rising gas and food prices will create an effective 0.7 percent point drag on real disposable personal income in 2022 with larger drags for lower-income households whose spending is typically more sensitive to fluctuations in income,\u201d said the note written by Joseph Briggs. \u201cAlthough households will likely partially offset this income drag by reducing savings, this hit to income should weigh on spending in 2022.\u201d\n\nBesides commodity prices, the Goldman team also noted that consumer sentiment tends to be affected by geopolitical crises, and already gauges from Morning Consult and Ipsos have dropped. The downgrade to Europe\u2019s growth prospects will hit U.S. exports, and a tightening of financial conditions will also weigh on U.S. growth.\n\nThe Goldman team said, if anything, they may be too positive on the outlook for the U.S. economy. \u201cEven after these downgrades, we still see risks around our growth forecast as skewed to the downside, particularly if sanctions escalate or if oil prices rise even further, for example, to the $175/barrel price target our commodity strategists see as possible if supply losses reach four million barrels a day. Additionally, we have not assumed any growth hit due to metal shortages since\u2014aside from palladium\u2014only a small share of U.S. commodity demand is met by Russian exports,\u201d said Briggs.\n\nRecession risks, they said, are mounting. While they expect further service-sector reopening and spending from excess savings to keep the U.S. economy growing, they said the chances of a recession next year are between 20% and 35%, or roughly as implied by the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-cuts-u-s-gdp-forecast-to-a-full-point-below-consensus-as-it-says-recession-odds-are-as-high-as-35-11646999690?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/goldman-cuts-u-s-gdp-forecast-to-a-full-point-below-consensus-as-it-says-recession-odds-are-as-high-as-35-11646999690?mod=home-page)", "id": "tbtzs1", "created_utc": 1647016452.0, "score": 939, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "Had the Fed pulled back accommodation a bit earlier in better times, there would be some room to ease policy when the economy is facing slowing growth. \n\nThey helped save the economy at the outset of Covid, but they didn't \"take profits\"--and now we're here.

Since then the stock has jumped quickly to the $3.20 range. $CLOV showed its power last June when its launched it way up to a high of $28. With the company on path to 3+ Billion in revenue this year it is way under valued. The Clover Assistant Ai software saving money and lives is what separates it apart from the competition. This should be valued as a tech company which would put the stock somewhere between $15 to $30 based on this years earnings. It is also a prime candidate for a short squeeze which could lead to a much higher price than predicted. The short data does not reflect all the naked shorts and synthetic shares trading hands on dark pools. A very similar setup to $GME before it squeezed itself all thw way to $500 range in a matter of weeks.

{"title": "Senate sends massive $1.5 trillion spending bill to Biden's desk", "selftext": " The U.S. [Senate](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate)  passed a $1.5 trillion, 2,741-page omnibus spending bill on Thursday  evening that will fund the federal government through Sept. 30 and send  $13.6 billion in aid to [Ukraine](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine).\u00a0\n\nThe bill passed 68-31 and now goes to President Biden's desk.\u00a0\n\nNearly $14 billion in U.S. aid will go to Ukraine and [European](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe) allies in the fight against [Russia](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia), including funds to provide humanitarian aid to the millions of Ukrainians who have fled, as well as funds for weapons.\n\nUkrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy) appealed to lawmakers in a Zoom call on Saturday for more help in his country's fight against Russia.\u00a0\n\nThe $1.5 trillion spending bill includes a 6.7% bump in domestic  programs to $730 billion and a 5.6% increase in defense spending to $782  billion.\u00a0\n\n\"The bipartisan product contains major wins for our  national defense, for our friends in Ukraine, for the conscience rights  of the American people, and for many other key priorities, and it keeps  new left-wing poison pills out,\" U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch  McConnell, Ky., said ahead of the vote.\u00a0\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also praised the bill as bipartisan.\u00a0\n\n\"When  we're unable to find common ground, Democrats will hold firm in defense  of our values and be willing to work alone, if needed. But this week,  bipartisanship has propelled us over the finish line,\" Schumer said on  the Senate floor Thursday evening.\u00a0\n\nPresident Biden had originally  proposed a 16% increase in domestic spending and just 2% for defense  last spring, but that became unrealistic due to the Democrats' slim  majority and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0\n\nMissing from the bill is $15.6 billion to combat the COVID-19  pandemic. House Democrats refused to accept Republican demands that new  funding is paid for with cuts in previously passed pandemic aid.\u00a0\n\n\"We\u2019ve  got a war going on in Ukraine,\" Pelosi told reporters Wednesday when  explaining the compromise. \"We have important work that we\u2019re doing  here.\"\n\nHouse Democrats plan to hold a vote next week on the $15.6 billion in COVID-19 funds.\u00a0\n\nCongress was facing a deadline of Friday at midnight to pass the bill or a government shutdown would ensue.\u00a0\n\n[Source](https://www.foxnews.com/us/senate-sends-massive-1-5-trillion-spending-bill-to-bidens-desk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all the talk about inflation and interest rates hikes next week.
