{"title": "Booked my Train Ticket on the Tilray Express just yesterday", "selftext": "Good morning fellow gorillas. It's been 14 straight months that I have been watching $TLRY get it's ass pounded. I was here for weed gang 1.0 last March and have seen the price slowly dwindle from $22.00 all the way down to $4.88. Over the past 4 months I've been slowly buying shares and had $7000 total in shares as of last Thursday. Woke up yesterday to shares being up 30% and figured it was going to be another streak of news bumping the price up for a day or two and then coming back down like it has every other day for the last 14 months, so I sold all my shares to buy back in on the price drop. It wasn't until about 1:00 pm that I realized congress is voting on federal legalization of marijuana again. With the house voting next week, I realized I made a mistake in selling. Bought back in at about 3:00 pm and bought another $2000 in shares. I'm sitting at $10,802.70 right now with markets closed.\n\nNow I know what you guys might be thinking, \"What is this guy, fucking retarded?\" and yes, you would be right. But allow me and my 70 points of IQ to explain why the next few weeks are going to be wild. Ballotpedia shows the makeup of congress before and after the 2020 election. Check the subheading \"Partisan Balance\" \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqauma457qp81.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=304f08de52caedd4b0afcf775906fc3231491b8f\n\nLast time this was voted on, the house was a clean sweep with 228 for and 164 against. Then stalled in the senate. This time around there is still a blue majority in the house. If that passes, it's smooth sailing until it reaches the senate again. This time around were looking at 48/50 blue/red in the senate vs the 45/53 the last time this happened. Not only that, but it's been over a year since then I'm betting that time will slowly turn government heads in favor of recreational marijuana. This would open many doors for companies that are waiting on this lottery ticket and I'm betting that the growth of these companies and the hype around cannabis stocks is going to take this sky high.\n\nGlad there aren't many eyes on this at the moment with all the GME hype. I've been trying to save up to go back to graduate school, so if this fails at least I know I was too stupid to go back to college anyways. If this shit goes tits up, I'll make sure my friends have my login info so they can post my obituary to WSB when I invest in $ROPE.\n\nWeed gang 2.0 is on the horizon and I've booked my ticket on the Tilray train. Diamond hands to the moon baby. I'll keep you updated on my positions throughout the week. What do you guys think about all of this?\n\nMy positions yesterday morning vs today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6i6gdyc7qp81.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=8aeecb3821a9ee7dc500284c6da7de6623e68374\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzd240pd7qp81.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=f499b23356a50b0c97dea8141fea5575bbcaa85f", "id": "too1mp", "created_utc": 1648299734.0, "score": 286, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=too1mp)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=too1mp)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24604320526123047}, {"body": "I've held APHA since 2016.

I was just thinking: how is this possible, how could there be a 9% bull run on basically no good news.  Then, the thought finally came to my mind, every market crash has been different.  So many people like to relate market crashes to events that have happened in the past like 1930, 2001, 2008, except they are all different.  I still believe that there is a market crash but now my view has changed: this market crash will be like nothing we have ever seen before, I am not implying this will catastrophic collapse of the financial system, just saying that there will be movements we have not seen before and things that historically do not make sense (like what happened last week).   \n\nInteresting enough: low volume bull runs have signaled an end to a bear market and the start of a longer term bull market.  This will not be the case for 2022.  There is one main reason why I believe this market crash will be different than anything before.\n\n**Retail investors**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Daily volume has increased dramatically in the last year](https://preview.redd.it/vl0ku8bn2rp81.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=482c86d17fb7ac66ed95011504cc163a33e8a419)\n\n[Many more retail investors have started actively trading](https://preview.redd.it/9jl7hlut3rp81.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cdb3b305e623fa5c8b855dc750605baf2cd8fd2)\n\n[Retail investors have caused increased volume in option contracts](https://preview.redd.it/tgy8amui3rp81.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3135894ec464320f78f58f023187f3c8229b940)\n\n[The top 100 stocks with the most option volume have outperformed major indices](https://preview.redd.it/tjko61nw3rp81.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=8445e402b82de7f76c35e036e99d6f6b994957e6)\n\n[The volume on stocks these stocks is mostly hedging...](https://preview.redd.it/juqcqch64rp81.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=8954c5ba6d08ce89e5c97739386c3e88a8015f1a)\n\nOne last thing, just all this above.  Retail investors have access to more information and tools than ever before.  In 1930 retail investors read the stock tables in newspapers they had no complex analysis... that's why one spooky front page title made people panic sell.  Today is much different, I just found this in depth research paper written by a multi-billion dollar bank from just a youtube video.\n\nBecause of the increase in call volume on these large cap stocks, market makers are forced to buy up more shares as a hedge if the options expire in the money.  This has caused a once in a lifetime bull market.  And now, since there is many more retail traders actively trading stocks and options this is why I believe this market crash will be different than anything before.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/k5fz2mzufrp81.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=33991c9953d966e3c9e71e37c7ce72222373bfad)\n\nImportant zones to watch\n\n\\~453 major resistance area\n\n\\~432 major support area\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe RSI is currently at 99 on the daily chart, this is a very bearish indicator showing that the buying pressure is gone now. %K could cross %D in the beginning of next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x9kp0momtrp81.png?width=1494&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d952c9228a3d529efb3d1b0bebe2457b0cbc293)\n\nWhile it might not seem obvious at first, to me there is a clear cycle here. During this bear market there will be a smaller cycles.  Cycles of high volatility with a big swing in the market, followed by a consolidation phase with lower volatility before the next swing.  Ignore the market open on the day that Russia invaded Ukraine that is an outlier in this since it is a very rare occurrence.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[US Bond Yield Curve](https://preview.redd.it/g50kn46iwrp81.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6586f655a13515d7408faf30c20d60285e672c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Historical 10Year - 2Year US Bond Chart Compared to SPX](https://preview.redd.it/h4e3970vxrp81.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=34385d6583de6ab9171a765333adc8bc8397779b)\n\n**Predictions**\n\nEven after the rally last week, I still think that there is an overall downtrend.  I seriously believe that there will be cycles also because many new retail investors, the movements in the market will be extrapolated. \n\nWhen the 10 year minus the 2 year bond yield approaches 0% or has even inverted this has previously indicated a recession.  Bonds will always be a major indicator in the markets.\n\nFrom my technical analysis and research I can conclude that we are entering another consolidation period with a down trend.  The situation in Ukraine will not be getting any better and there are no major events happening next week that will shake the markets.  The next few weeks will not be a crazy panic like early January, just a slow sell off.\n\nFor my positions I will be looking for an entry on UVXY and ITM Put contracts for a quick day trade, I do not know if I will hold anything over the next weekend, haven't made that decision yet.  \n\n\\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMonday\ud83d\udc3bTuesday\ud83d\udc02Wednesday\ud83d\udc3bThursday\ud83d\udc3bFriday \ud83d\udc02, Support\\~432, 10Y-2Y bonds signaling a market crash!\n\n**I will respond to every comment!**", "id": "tp494n", "created_utc": 1648329132.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|22|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|564|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skwpds/spy_current_week_analysis_next_week_predictions/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sqwd9c/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_214/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t23ypl/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_228/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcoh2o/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_314/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t7jifc/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_37/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tp494n/spy_predictions_for_the_week_of_328/) \n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tp494n)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tp494n)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36340564489364624}, {"body": "5 day forecast, that's a new one", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Not new.
