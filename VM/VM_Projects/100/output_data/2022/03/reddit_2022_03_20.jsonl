Nasdaq, Russell, Dow Jones and S&P500, all rallied to more than 3% before FOMC. Surely you weren't worried, because I clearly mentioned all of this in my last post, that after March 16 we would get our exit liq rally. The real reason being trillions of dollars of hedged puts getting closed. Add triple witching closes on top of that.\n\n( Sell the rumor. Buy the news )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Everything is just fine.](https://preview.redd.it/hr6mq30j9io81.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=841553062af124407e12d1ffa46932fcbae70014)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarch 16 Meeting. (Summary)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe had a few hiccups when we saw the GDP no in the range b/w 2-3 and the FED funds rate for 2022 to 1.9. What that meant was 0.25X7 = 1.75% hike in 2022 + room for a 50 basis pt hike.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Economic Projections](https://preview.redd.it/bhrdieul9io81.png?width=1325&format=png&auto=webp&s=05f0593dff37bb786582c46d6ee2a4294457ab46)\n\nI have to say I was shocked, but then my boi J. Powell came in to the rescue. He was just not having it to see his and other senators portfolios go into red. Why would he ? They all bought calls for Q2 / Q3  2022. He was pretty adamant that the FED was in control of inflation. That guy talked me down like low GDP, no isn't that big of a deal considering we were coming out of a pandemic. He also assured me that balance sheet run-off was no such a big deal. What's getting a few trillions out of 28T of balance sheet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DOT plots](https://preview.redd.it/yz8pq06nujo81.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=235bdfc96c2ccf63528868482eadfbe21da98961)\n\nI have to say it, guys. Powell has switched from \"Inflation is Transitory\" to \"Our Economy is very strong with tight labor market\".\n\nNote : Guys don't forget Bullard and Waller are down for 50bps and Balance sheet runoff. Lets see next week with other speakers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FED voters](https://preview.redd.it/wj1tmyv3tjo81.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&s=60a3e2823357314414122583ca5e590b0af673c0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAftermath of two camps\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Camp A vs Camp B](https://preview.redd.it/kmq8hd2gsjo81.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a351864de2f54537f423a87f3710152dcbcb1659)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have now got ourselves into two situations :\n\nCamp A) Either Powell has done things right by raising 0.25bps and he is not gonna rug pull us and be transparent about everything, so guys \n\n\" You can buy this dip \"\n\nCamp B) Powell cannot bring this situation under control and then he will one day at one such meeting come out by surprising me (most probably September 2022) and sending my portfolio into recession territory that inflation can only be tamed by Paul Volckering us. So guys, you can chill out and spend time with friends and family. And later in Q4 you see signs of rug pulling, you can \n\n\" Short the market in Q4\" and then buy at -50%+ from ATH.\n\nOr\n\n\"You can buy this dip, sell before september, short the market , and invest profits in -50% from ATH\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo choose the camp you guys want. But i am not joining any such teams. Rather, i am looking at things from diff perspective ( i.e. THE BOND MARKET)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5 - 10 curves have been inverted. Q4 crisis ?](https://preview.redd.it/nc3vr5pwujo81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec7722287848818eb2ae7a23ef9ddc516276173)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n       What if J Powell made a policy error and we shouldn't have increased rates.\n    \n    Yes guys, you heard it first here. What if he made such error or he could just be bluffing about going on with an additional 6 rate hikes. Idk about you guys, but i am not feeling too optimistic about more than 4 rate hikes. The Curve is suggesting there is no room for another hike. Do it and you get an inverted curve (10 -2 yield curve) with banks giving chill statements like nothing happens when a curve inverts. \n    \n    Also long term bond will sell off and since we are in +ve correlation with curve flateening even before mid cycle of rate hike then it means stock markets will drop with each rate hike increase. Add housing and mortage crisis on top of that. \n    \n    \n    \n    J Powell wasn't too concerned about this in his FOMC remarks. But I am coz Powell lied to me about inflation, but curve hasn't till now. It could have been if Russian money was controlling it. But then we can also assume that the whole stock market is being manipulated.\n    \n    So it all depends on the data that will be coming out this year. Or powell could inject QE+ after 4 rate hike and once again skip recession by kicking the can down the road if inflation comes down by september.\n    \n\nSo now that I have established my camp, and where I stand on this.  In no way means it means i am right 100%. It just means I have to sit tight and assess this situation by May 2022. My assumptions could be wrong and hence i will then have to switch to camp A or B. And i will take camp B all day coz i have been supporting it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat they know, that we dont know\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Risks 2022](https://preview.redd.it/nvm912otrjo81.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c778181975c1d890f13369ed577b20b0f7a93f39)\n\nSo campers of the B ( which most of my readers will be coz, i told you to ride exit liq or not and come back in q4 )  i am giving you a HW like any other senior manager of a hedge fund pass-on to their juniors.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut i am not that kind of guy. In fact, in the next post ( 2-3 weeks ) we shall have a great discussion where you throw punches at me, and I will land some right back at you. So come prepared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are a few points you need to research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Is Russia going for a capture fest in Europe after Ukraine?\n\n2) China abandoning Dollar system with Arab, Pak, India, Russia. Basically division of the world into Asia and EU + USA\n\n3) China invades Taiwan and the battle for Sillicon chips. ( The next war would be fought with chips, not carriers )\n\n4) Sovereign debt crisis. Debt/ GDP ( Start with Greece and then study current Russia and then USA bonds ) \n\n5) Financial Crisis. Find out which bank in Europe/USA is getting into default. ( Study Credit Suisse )\n\n6) Gold Vs Equity ( My calculation says near dotcom )\n\n7) Recession , Forgotten Depression, The Greater Depression.\n\n8) Study investing in China and Hong Kong stock markets. \n\n9) Agricultural and Water Investing. \n\n10) Covid new variant\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome other points you could cover were reported by Bloomberg. Its like ecom syallabus for yr 2022.\n\n[Bloomberg 2022 Risks](https://twitter.com/KshitizBisht/status/1477968438777683969?s=20&t=3rTvclwnUnEr-8D7T7ZpBQ)\n\nAnd these are the risks for next week\n\n[Next week after march FOMC week risks](https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1505293879041572865?s=20&t=3rTvclwnUnEr-8D7T7ZpBQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you guys for taking your time and reading this.

One day we woke up and the Uhaul was in the driveway and it appears some flippers bought the place. \n\nI have no idea where they went or what happened to them. That sort of thing accelerates in this market, the question is, how fast. \n\nAt Halloween they were out front on our dirt road handing out candy to kids on our local hayride for the neighborhood (it\u2019s way too far between houses to walk it) and she was excited she had started a home based beauty business.\n\nI just wondered in my head how many customers for expensive nails and hair it was going to take to pay back whatever she paid to the beauty school, but I smiled and held my tongue. She was happy and had hope and probably didn\u2019t have a written business plan. \n\nIt appears it didn\u2019t work out for them. But they\u2019re still somewhere, buying groceries and necessities and probably renting or staying with family. Very hard to say. \n\nI kinda hope they sold and weren\u2019t foreclosed on and got to pocket some equity even on a trashed place. Now we watch the guys in work trucks show up every weekend and beat on this house. Here\u2019s hoping they can get it sold before the market cools and they\u2019re upside down. \n\nWe saw stuff like this happening en masse in 08. We aren\u2019t there yet. We could get there though. All depends on how well this slow roll into higher interest goes. \n\nThe announcement that the credit agencies are dumping medical debt from scores says something. They want to keep handing out scores to banks that allow banks to lend\u2026 and landlords to rent\u2026 and insurers to insure\u2026 awful bad if that\u2019s the lever they\u2019re pulling to keep their credit scores relevant. Otherwise, nobody will pay them for their magic credit score number game.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2887341380119324}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5554017424583435}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5347057580947876}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47160789370536804}, {"body": "I cant read can you draw this for me", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What draw?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3692176640033722}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06745344400405884}, {"body": "The wait OP types \"coz\" bothers me so much.
