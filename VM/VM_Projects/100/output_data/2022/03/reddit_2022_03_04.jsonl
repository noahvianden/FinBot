But doing so in the wake of Russia\u2019s widely condemned invasion of Ukraine brings unique risks. World leaders are seeking to punish [some Russian companies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/R83LEHDWLU70) and cut the country off from the global financial system, and any firm perceived as working against those interests faces potential reputational damage, market watchers say.  \n>  \n>\u201cThe whole point of the sanctions is to make them and their instruments untouchable,\u201d said Athanassios Diplas, a veteran derivatives trader who was at Goldman Sachs during the 1998 Russian financial crisis. \u201cI have no issues looking at arbitrage opportunities in distressed situations, like back in 1998. But this is different.\u201d  \n>  \n>**To be sure, the sanctions on Russia haven\u2019t outright banned trading in the assets.**  \n>  \n>Goldman Sachs is primarily asking for corporate debt from the likes of [Evraz Plc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EVR:LN), Gazprom PJSC and [Russian Railways](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/RZHD:RU) that matures within the next two years, and has made bids for Russian sovereign notes, the people said.  \n>  \n>**The purchases by banks underscore a facet of Wall Street\u2019s longstanding culture: Trading desks are geared toward finding undervalued or mispriced assets, and their activities don\u2019t necessarily reflect the broader view of their firm toward an asset class or nation.**  \n>  \n>Representatives for Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment.  \n>  \n>Russian corporate bonds denominated in foreign currencies have plunged to deeply distressed levels in recent days. The debt may soon [be removed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-01/jpmorgan-reviewing-what-part-russian-debt-will-have-in-indexes) from major benchmarks, and concern is mounting that companies could miss principal payments.  \n>  \n>JPMorgan was telling clients that it traded about $200 million of Russian and Ukrainian corporate debt Thursday, including from clients seeking to exit positions.  \n>  \n>Still, some banks and fund managers are erring toward caution, either reining in or abstaining from such transactions amid the rapidly evolving situation, people familiar with the matter said.  \n>  \n>At one major U.S. hedge fund, a decision was made to avoid Russian bonds entirely for now. The specter of holding debt that could become untradeable in another round of sanctions is too risky, and the war is just a week in. At another, the decision was made to look only at corporate bonds that aren\u2019t majority owned by the Russian government.  \n>  \n>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a bit of revulsion -- more and more institutions are steering clear of Russia due to reputational risks and pure difficulties in clearing and executing trades,\u201d said Sally Greig, a money manager at Baillie Gifford in Edinburgh. \u201cYou have to tear up the distressed playbook. This is not the usual distressed situation. This is a very difficult time.\u201d  \n>  \n>*CDS Play*  \n>  \n>Goldman Sachs is also trading credit-default swaps on names including Evraz and Gazprom, according to the people with knowledge of the situation.\u00a0  \n>  \n>[Read more: Russia sanctions put $41 billion of default insurance at risk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/russia-sanctions-put-41-billion-of-default-insurance-at-risk)  \n>  \n>The market for Russian default protection has faced growing scrutiny this week as traders try to understand if the contracts insuring $41 billion of sovereign debt could be rendered worthless by sanctions, or could be triggered in the event of a technical default.\u00a0  \n>  \n>CDS tied to Russian government debt this week signaled a 65% chance of default within five years and 40% within one year, according to ICE Data Services.  \n>  \n>Late Thursday Russia [was downgraded](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-03/russia-cut-again-by-s-p-as-sanctions-and-controls-ramp-up) to CCC- by S&P Global Ratings, three levels above default, citing sanctions that have dramatically reduced available foreign-exchange reserves and are likely to restricted the ability of bondholders to receive interest and principal payments.\n\nBy [Laura Benitez](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATbVNWPJ0k4/laura-benitez), [Sridhar Natarajan](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AQsv6zME0W4/sridhar-natarajan), and [Katia Porzecanski](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AQlzPWIh6gY/katia-porzecanski)  with assistance by Katherine Doherty, Claire Boston, Eliza Ronalds-Hannon, Rachel Butt, and Erin Hudson.\n\n[ ](https://www.bloomberg.com/tips/)", "id": "t6f6lt", "created_utc": 1646385842.0, "score": 1157, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 275, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|318|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvk0tv/wkhs_has_a_secondary_offering_shelved_with_an/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t6f6lt)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t6f6lt)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2874971926212311}, {"body": "Maybe it was GS and JPM traders lecturing us the past few days to not buy Russian assets.
