Nixon hammered his Fed chair to provide cheap money to keep growth high at all costs even if it resulted in some inflation so long as it didn't result in recession. As we all know now  it resulted in both.  With the fed not raising rates while all of the other factors were being added to the mix, the real interest rates were going steeply negative  ultimately requiring the shock to the system that were the 20% interest rates needed to bring inflation back in check and restore the environment to one suitable for stock asset investing.  \n\nHaving said all that, the current situation seems a bit different in that the glut of recent spending seemingly resulted in staving off of the negative effects of the pandemic with respect to overall economic growth.  This appears to be a positive for the market.  \n\nWith regards to the inflation side of things, if the Fed is able to raise rates unimpeded by political actors like the influence Nixon exerted, then it should result in a less catastrophic unwinding of the cheap money policies of the last decade or so.  Even though some of the causes of inflation appear to be transitory like the supply chain issues and increased government spending, the right approach should still be to allow the fed rate to rise to keep the real interest rates from an accelerating negative trajectory. \n\nIf this happens, I would expect the stock market to do a soft landing and not a catastrophic crash.  But there is no certainty in predicting how our political elites will act and if we see signs that the fed is being held back and not taking decisive action then I would say watch out below.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "By a soft landing, does that mean they will let the market slowly decline 70% over a few years?

Imo, if there is unexpected inflation, then these two assets should do well. Unexpected inflation is the difference between real inflation and the forecasted inflation. So if interest rate policies don\u2019t perform as expected and supply chain inflation factors don\u2019t come down, then these two assets should do well. \n\nIn terms of the stock markets, inflation will likely impact start ups, and non profit generating companies more than others. If you\u2019re going stock market route, go with companies that are cash flowing and have the ability to push costs down to consumers or down the supply chain. Sadly this only perpetuates inflation. \n\nBitcoin and other coins don\u2019t have enough (actually no data) data to support that they will be a good hedge against high inflation as we are experiencing now. I don\u2019t really follow this much, but from what I\u2019ve read, they often follow high risk assets, so similar to how tech and start ups trend. Again, there isn\u2019t enough data to support how this asset performs in high inflation periods, so it could very well do the opposite and perform well. If you want to speculate on this allocate accordingly - maybe a 1-5% allocation at most. \n\nCurrencies - just as much of a speculation as Bitcoin. Here you\u2019re essentially betting on certain countries experiencing significantly less inflation than US (if you\u2019re in the US). Considering USD is still the world\u2019s reserve currency, most currencies will trend with USD and most monetary policies also follow US. China\u2019s yuan is seen to be appreciating, but I doubt you\u2019ll make more money speculating on currencies than the other assets above.\n\nAs a last resort, if you don\u2019t know - diversified ETFs and just DCA and hold. Diversified can be viewed from many ways, but it\u2019s safer than putting all your eggs in 1-5 baskets which could go very wrong. \n\nInterested in what others think though.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!

I have a couple of degrees in science from one of our top universities and I consider myself pretty lucky and pretty happy.  I have a good job, zero debt and I notice the price increases because I, like you, have to shop for groceries and other needs.  Like you probably are, I'm also worried about housing prices.\n\nI would argue that the cause of these price increases, both in wage, in shelter and at the grocery store can be narrowed down to one fact.  Growth is decreasing while supply of non-productive money is increasing.  That money needs to go somewhere or it depreciates in value.  It goes wherever it thinks it can make a gain.   \n\nInterest rates are very low in both Canada and the US.  The real yield on a long bond purchase is negative.  Meaning if you invest in bonds, you will have less purchasing power at the end of the term than at the beginning.  What once was a viable long-term investment is no longer the case. \n\nSo where is that money to go?  Wherever it can make a profit.  In Canada, we have a bulletproof (almost bulletproof) housing market.  Our CMBSs have been very safe investments historically (until very recently).  Our government insures these assets and makes sure home buyers are qualified.  It's one of the safest investments you can make.  The excess money flows there.  \n\nInternational money flows there also.  You can't blame overseas investors.  That's where you would put your money too.  Canada is pretty safe and pretty awesome.  Now look what's happening overseas.  The money is going \\*poof\\*.  The assets backing our mortgage-backed securities are losing value.

{"title": "SPY and TSLA Callapalooza", "selftext": "\nSup freaks. Its me again, the only guy left on this piece of shit forum that still posts some trades BEFORE it\u2019s too late to get in on them.\n\nThis one is easy as fuck. Buy some SPY calls. Attached are my positions. All 2069 of them. Thats right I\u2019ve got 2000 SPY calls and 69 TSLA calls (that I purchased this week).\nHere\u2019s why you should follow me.\n\n1. The rate hike is in. Its a beautiful quarter point raise, Jpow hinted that the rest will be quarter points as well and the market loves it.\n\n2. Ukraine conflict has been fully priced in. Putin\u2019s midlife crisis has hopefully come to a head and the sanctions being imposed have definitely shook him and his boys up. Its also made China realize the cost of doing war in a fully globalized economy. Barring any major escalations from Putin, the market will continue its uptrend.\n\n3. The global economy is sizzling hot. Metrics from almost every sector are putting up great numbers, unemployment is at all time lows, we are seeing the final exit from the covid economy. The last lagging effect is supply chain issues. Which brings us nicely to my next point.\n\n4. Inflation is actually transitory and not as bad as the numbers suggest. Most of the inflation we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t because of all the money we printed. Its because of heavy demand coupled with supply side hiccups and hangovers from covid. Its known as cost push inflation. So all the urchins out there trying to peddle some crap about hyperinflation and weimar republic are just abusing your pea brain for clicks. However inflation will most likely remain high for some time while the fed reigns it in. So if inflation persists but the economy is hot\u2026. What should you do with your money?\n\n5. Buy the dip ******. Stop trying to be fancy with grandma\u2019s death money or your shitty kid\u2019s community college fund. I don\u2019t know where you retards are getting some of these awful plays that I see in the loss porn. Maybe TikTok? Treat yourself to some tasty SPY calls, or if you\u2019re feeling frisky, TSLA calls. Everything is pricey right now due to all the volatility, but calls are cheap relatively and in my opinion dirt cheap if you believe that the market is moving up hard. Pretty much everything is going to rip and soon. I\u2019m already up roughly 200k on my positions but they\u2019ve got plenty or room to run. This week was most likely the bottom and beginning of the rip, but you haven\u2019t missed out.\n\nMy final speculation is that not only are we going to see green, but the market will retrace back up to our previous ATHs scarily fast. \n\nTL;DR\nMonday was the bottom, buy the dip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[positions](https://i.imgur.com/mpQcgoe_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)", "id": "ti7acr", "created_utc": 1647730935.0, "score": 99, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|15|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|26|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ti7acr/spy_and_tsla_callapalooza/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ti74az/spy_and_tsla_callapalooza/) \n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ti7acr)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ti7acr)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24323226511478424}, {"body": "Forget spy and tsla they're already up, get into AMD $120 weeklies all in", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "This is where I'm thinking of heading", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1928086131811142}, {"body": "Based on...?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I actually think he\u2019s got more than us", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20245720446109772}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14116384088993073}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06659100204706192}], "tickers": ["amd", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "EPS hasn\u2019t been revised for a single company that have completely shut down all operations in Russia.
