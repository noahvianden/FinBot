Personally I think that averaging down on a spec stock, micro cap, with no revenue yet is the dumbest thing that you can do. In my opinion averaging down on a spec pre revenue stock is SUPER RETARDATION on steroids.\n\nYes I know that the spec stock you are invested in is super special and will be the next Amazon and may even develop warp drive.

He and Boris Johnson are probably the loudest protagonists for escalation vs Russia. A couple of days ago Biden literally called for regime change to remove Putin's government and had to reel that back to calm down allies who were upset at what they called \"escalation\". Biden has also aggressively pursued Trump's trade war vs China, which is most of the reason behind the semiconductor shortage that contributes the \"scarcity\" inflation factor of our overall inflationary crisis. The splitting of semiconductor supply chains is 100% a deglobalization priority. Biden's fully on board with all of that. \n\n> What would your solution be regarding Ukraine? It seems like the only other options(outside sanctions) are to send troops or let them take over Ukraine. \n\nI don't really care about Ukraine. I was all for supporting Ukraine against Russia in 2014-2016. However, it eventually came out how corrupt, brutal and dysfunctional their \"democracy\" also was. Ukraine is one of the top corrupt countries in the world, along with Belarus and Russia, so much so that it can (could have been) called a kleptocracy in its own right. Before he turned on the heroism after the invasion, Zelensky's approval rating was down in the 20's over some offshore accounts/embezzling scandal. Ukraine is also maybe one of the only openly white supremacist, highly racist countries in the world. Stories of the racism -- violent racism toward Africans, Arabs, South Asians & Far East Asians -- vs foreign people trapped in Ukraine were covered due to appearing on social media for a while but have since disappeared. The country even has a right wing white supremacist militia as part of its armed forces.\n\nI don't care about Ukraine, not enough to want blue collar families to suffer hunger here in America. The country is in the situation it's in partly because of the endemic corruption and brutality of its people at every level of its culture, not just government. The only thing that makes their situation any different than Libya's or Syria's or Myanmar's is the pictures of fleeing people who look like they could be sitting in a diner in Ohio. It's because they're white and look like us, and we have different standards for how badly white people are allowed to be treated in the world (standards that we don't apply to countries of people of color). I feel less obligation to help Ukraine than I feel for just about any other country or resource in crisis in the world right now, that we could be mobilizing to save. I don't know why I'm supposed to care so much about this white country's crisis that millions of people of color in oil-importing developing countries have to starve and suffer. We're giving assurances of supplies of gas and resources to Europe, but how about India, Africa and SE Asia? \n\nIt's a white people's crusade and only white countries are in the little club of those we will help shelter from the economic impact of our sanctions.\n\nI don't have a solution to Ukraine because (1) they are not an ally, (2) they can't ally with anyone because they lack an effective and functional (i.e. not corrupt/racist/kleptocratic) government that would enable them to join the EU or NATO, (3) in 2021 they instigated and trolled Russia to antagonize Putin and invite an invasion for whatever reasons they might have had for doing that. Their situation is their doing and I don't feel responsible for solving their problems, much less as a taxpayer paying for anything but humanitarian aid for the country. I feel less responsible for Ukraine's problems than I feel responsible for Afghanistan's problems, for example. I don't have any sense of ownership of a responsibility to solve their problems, just because they're a white country and that somehow makes their dysfunctional issues top world sovereign rights priorities. \n\n> Do you consider limiting climate change justification enough for increased EV funding and limiting of local oil and gas production? \n\nEV's don't help climate change that much. You do know why coal is doing great, right? It's one of the fuels used to generate power for electric grids. Somehow, \"EV\" became synonymous with \"low carbon\" for this generation, which is firstly incorrect and secondly an appeal to jingoistic symbols in place of a coherent energy plan. Increasing EV production comes with increasing oil, gas and coal use because that's how most electric power is generated to power electric grids, and oil is where most plastics, resins and other chemicals for advanced materials like composites come from. There is literally nothing about EV production and use that can be exclusively and uniquely equated with reduced carbon footprint or lower hydrocarbon usage. There are dozens of other things that would have to change for EV usage to be associated with lower carbon footprint, and those things can/should change with or without EVs. The whole EV fixation is a big generational marketing gimmick. And it's especially absurd to believe that luxury EVs like Teslas come with any relatively beneficial environmental impact. \n\n> Because at the end of the day that's what those are about.\n\nAt the end of the day, lower energy consumption is what lower carbon footprint is about. It doesn't actually matter whether a car is EV or ICE, if lower consumption doesn't happen. The only way to reduce carbon footprint and reduce energy consumption is to reduce per capita consumption. Or to have fewer people living in high-consumption societies like ours. \n\nRefusing to adequately fund oil/gas/coal industry while refusing to lower consumption -- and we're even increasing consumption -- only leads to high oil prices and energy shocks. And every time energy prices get as high as they were getting in early 2022, someone invades someone in the oil producing world. You can predict Putin's internationally scandalous violent or kleptocratic episodes if you look at the chart of the price of Lukoil stock and an oil price chart. \n\nIf I were going to point the finger at any one person or thing for causing the violence this Spring, I'd point it at this generations absurdly simple, delusional belief that there's environmental benefit to starving old energy industries of capital while increasing consumption because somehow Tesla's going to make it all better, as the cause of yet another energy market disruption that, as energy shocks always do, led to an outbreak of petro state violence. Putin just happens to be the first petro state narcissist on a mission with random acts of violence in 2022 as oil prices spike. In the 2000's it was Saudis dive-bombing the World Trade Center, the rise of Al Qaeda and Putin seizing Yukos and imprisoning Mikhail Khodorkovsky. In the 2010's it was the rise of Islamic Jihad and the Islamic State and Putin seizing Crimea. It's all very predictable. Having a strategy of \"starve the beast\" to limit oil producing companies doesn't work to reduce energy consumption AND oil shortages and energy price shocks inevitably lead to chaos.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think it's fair to conflate Russian sanctions with an effort for de-globalization.

No I don't think the US is innocent in not committing similar atrocities and they were largely misguided. I think there needs to be a balance walked when we invade countries under the guise of \"Protecting democracy\". If a country has shown serious ambition to become a liberal democracy (which I believe Ukraine has) than we should make attempts to encourage that. Places like Libya, Syria and Afghanistan have not shown that to the degree that I think it's worth it to ruin a local economy for.

EV cars are the first step otherwise every new ICE car bought today that will be on the road for 10+ years is just kicking the can down the road.

EVs are the least relevant to the most people in need. It\u2019s certainly the least important energy problem we face. And it\u2019s especially ironic since American politicians have basically created the supply chain crisis in the past few years by deciding to have a trade war and engage in trade protectionism and escalating them during a pandemic, and they also created an energy crunch with their intentional policy snd capital underinvestment squeezes and then take these shortages to another level with sanctions against Russia that actually don\u2019t help the Ukrainian people and aren\u2019t effective at crippling Russia so far. And, to top off the all this \u2014 the trade war powered pandemic supply chain disruptions, energy production constrictions and sanctions that are bound to inflict the most pain on energy importing countries and the lower classes \u2014 the US federal reserve has been deliberately stoking inflation because the most reliable federal response to just about any national challenge is to immediately start inflating stocks on a massive scale and giving unlimited free money to corporations as a top priority.\n\nWe have caused all of these problems, from trade war boosted supply chain disruptions to a doctrinaire anti-energy, mismanagement-caused energy crises, to excessive, prolonged QE to pump up stocks and now the sanctions against Russia to amplify these problems. the US has been creating inflation and economic disruptions intentionally and by choice, and by finding ways to enforce sanctions globally and involve other nations we are now finding new ways to export the recipe for increasing poverty, hunger and inequality to other countries. Our leadership has created these problems - all of them, from trade wars to turbo charge pandemic supply chain breakdowns to restrictive energy policies to amplify simple pandemic demand fluctuations into global energy shocks to stock-pumping federal reserve QE inflation and a president intent on battering Russia with sanctions that don\u2019t actually have much effect except to triple the impact of the economic disruptions created by the US' ongoing trade war v China. Our leaders created these problems with their conscious, intentional policy-making and decision-making. The Russian sanctions are a way to export the inflation and shortages to other countries.\n\nSome booster program for EV batteries is a straight up meaningless pander to attempt to show a naive base that the president is on top of their concerns.\n\nI invest in basics, and right now I\u2019m investing in seeds, fertilizers, materials and energy societies need for basic *subsistence*. When you have actual energy, seed and fertilizer shortages, that\u2019s bad for marginal economies. The odds are high that in a few months time at least several hundred million people will be more poor, hungry and maybe even starving, and their societies undeveloping on account of all of these problems our poor leadership has been busy creating out of thin air and exporting to other countries. Imagine the suffering of millions of starving people that will be quietly tuned out by our public\u2019s social media, entertainment industry and video game driven attention span. And new wars breaking out in poor countries battling over scarce resources. We will have instigated the initial conditions to cause all that. \n\nAll of this ceases to be abstract for me when I buy seed and fertilizer stocks, because I have to contemplate world hunger in order to choose those stocks. There\u2019s a high chance that the next few years will be terrible for millions of people.\n\nInvesting, finance and economic policy aren\u2019t just abstract activities. They are how the world works and how societies function. When the US creates an energy crisis, inflation, profound supply chain disorder worldwide, and actual shortages of basic resources, we\u2019re forcing deconstruction of economic activity onto other nations, forcing the world into deglobalization by disrupting how money works and how other societies can function at the subsistence level.

From the the source I quoted: \n\n> The recognition of these negative aspects of globalization has now caused the pendulum to swing back to local sourcing. Rather than the cheapest, easiest and greenest sources, there\u2019ll probably be more of a premium put on the safest and surest.\n\nClean energy efforts will mostly fall apart in most of the world.

EV's are obviously not going to solve climate change when the grid is not running on clean energy, but they will still emit way less than gas (accounting for mineral extraction, daily driving, and everything in between).\n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/electric-vehicle-myths", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I\u2019ll trust the epa..Do your own research sheep.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I think you are actually the sheep because even when you are faced with research that refutes your beliefs, you still respond in denial.
