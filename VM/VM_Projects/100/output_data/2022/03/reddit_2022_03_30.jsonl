Personally I think that averaging down on a spec stock, micro cap, with no revenue yet is the dumbest thing that you can do. In my opinion averaging down on a spec pre revenue stock is SUPER RETARDATION on steroids.\n\nYes I know that the spec stock you are invested in is super special and will be the next Amazon and may even develop warp drive.
