{"title": "Barclay's Suspended VXX ETN Share Creation - Implications and Trades?", "selftext": "Yesterday Barclay's announced that they are suspending any further sales from inventory/issuance of VXX shares.  This is the ETN that holds the front two months of /VX VIX futures contracts.  Since the announcement, VXX has become decoupled from the VX futures prices, and is trading at a massive premium over NAV.   \n    \nVXX implied volatility also spiked to >200%, as there is anticipation of a short squeeze.  However, there is some historical precedence of this occurring to TVIX and once share issuance was resumed the price cratered.   \n   \nAnyone considering trading this ticker?  Lots of premium on the table to sell calls; however, if they go ITM I don't know what share availability will be to short VXX.  There also seems like there is an arbitrage opportunity here, by going long the front month(s) VX futures contracts and shorting VXX.  Again if a squeeze occurs and the share HTB rate skyrockets or becomes not available to borrow, that could be problematic.  \n   \nWould love to hear others thoughts on this situation.  \n  \n**Update: VXX trading halted multiple times on circuit breaker.**\n    \n    \n\n\nHere is a link to the article: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220314005483/en/Barclays-Suspends-Until-Further-Notice-Further-Sales-and-Issuances-of-Two-Series-of-iPath%C2%AE-ETNs-the-%E2%80%9CETNs%E2%80%9D", "id": "telo0o", "created_utc": 1647339164.0, "score": 164, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "\nBarclays Suspends Creation Units for VXX   \nBill Luby   \nVIX and more blog     \nhttps://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2022/03/barclays-suspends-creation-units-for-vxx.html  \n\nQuotations:  \n\n>As for VXX, the reasons for the halt in creation units are not exactly clear.  Barclays says in their press release: \n\n>>\u201cThis suspension is being imposed because Barclays does not currently have sufficient issuance capacity to support further sales from inventory and any further issuances of the ETNs. These actions are not the result of the crisis in Ukraine or any issue with the market dynamics in the underlying index components. Barclays expects to reopen sales and issuances of the ETNs as soon as it can accommodate additional capacity for future issuances.\u201d\n\n> The underlying cause of the issuance capacity issue may be a number of factors, including the cost of hedging the position, exchange position limits or other factors.

Saudi officials have said they were shocked by the precipitous [U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-u-s-troops-leave-afghanistan-after-nearly-20-years-11630355853?mod=article_inline) last year.\n\nChina buys more than 25% of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports. If priced in yuan, those sales would boost the standing of China\u2019s currency. The Saudis are also considering including yuan-denominated futures contracts, known as the petroyuan, in the pricing model of [Saudi Arabian Oil Co](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SA/XSAU/2222). , known as Aramco.\n\nIt would be a profound shift for Saudi Arabia to price even some of its roughly 6.2 million barrels of day of crude exports in anything other than dollars. The majority of [global oil sales](https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-update-03-15-2022-11647333255?mod=article_inline)\u2014around 80%\u2014are done in dollars, and the Saudis have traded oil exclusively in dollars since 1974, in a deal with the Nixon administration that included security guarantees for the kingdom. \n\nChina [introduced yuan-priced oil contracts in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-attempts-to-supplant-dollar-face-historic-difficulties-1522063947?mod=article_inline) as part of its efforts to make its currency tradable across the world, but they haven\u2019t made a dent in the dollar\u2019s dominance of the oil market. For China, using dollars has become a hazard highlighted by U.S. sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program and on Russia in response to [the Ukraine invasion](https://wsj.com/livecoverage/latest-updates/russia-ukraine-latest-news).\n\nChina has stepped up its courtship of the Saudi kingdom. In recent years, China has helped Saudi Arabia [build its own ballistic missiles](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-begin-making-ballistic-missiles-with-chinese-help-11640294886?mod=article_inline), consulted on a nuclear program and begun investing in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s pet projects, [such as Neom](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-crown-princes-vision-for-neom-a-desert-city-state-tests-his-builders-11619870401?mod=article_inline), a futuristic new city. Saudi Arabia has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping [to visit later this year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-invites-chinas-xi-to-visit-kingdom-amid-strained-u-s-relations-11647284211?reflink=mobilewebshare_twitter&mod=article_inline).\n\nMeanwhile the Saudi relationship with the U.S. has deteriorated under President Biden, who said in the 2020 campaign that [the kingdom should be a \u201cpariah](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-urged-to-penalize-saudi-crown-prince-over-khashoggi-killing-11614546231?mod=article_inline)\u201d for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Prince Mohammed, who U.S. intelligence authorities say ordered Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing, refused to sit in on a call between Mr. Biden and the Saudi ruler, King Salman, last month.\n\nIt also comes as the U.S. economic relationship with the Saudis is diminishing. The U.S. is now among the top oil producers in the world. It once imported 2 million barrels of Saudi crude a day in the early 1990s but those numbers have fallen to less than 500,000 barrels a day in December 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nBy contrast, China\u2019s oil imports have swelled over the last three decades, in line with its expanding economy. Saudi Arabia was China\u2019s top crude supplier in 2021, selling at 1.76 million barrels a day, followed by Russia at 1.6 million barrels a day, according to data from China\u2019s General Administration of Customs.\n\n\u201cThe dynamics have dramatically changed. The U.S. relationship with the Saudis has changed, China is the world\u2019s biggest crude importer and they are offering many lucrative incentives to the kingdom,\u201d said a Saudi official familiar with the talks.\n\n\u201cChina has been offering everything you could possibly imagine to the kingdom,\u201d the official said.", "id": "terrhf", "created_utc": 1647358609.0, "score": 238, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Gaddafi is like wtf bro", "score": 109, "replies": [{"body": "The US saw an united African bank and currency future and were like *eagle screech* \u201cFreedom Time\u201d", "score": 52, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22568784654140472}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19324126839637756}, {"body": "Looks like someone one is in need of some democracy", "score": 186, "replies": [{"body": "Yep like everyone else in the middle east that thinks about dropping the dollar", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Saudis may have just saved yemen", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Ya the USA might suddenly start caring about that", "score": 18, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3583490252494812}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27204862236976624}, {"body": "> Yep like everyone else in the middle east that thinks about dropping the dollar\n\nThat happens when you try to remove 200 million people from the dollar economy :)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.9056145548820496}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25485721230506897}, {"body": "Made me laugh out loud!

In all cases, the bottom was when people took worst-case scenarios as given.  They all thought it was obvious things would go lower, and even if they were buyers, they prefaced comments with statements like \"I'm just going to keep buying all the way to the bottom.\"  No one thought things were about to go up.\n\nSomehow, we're at that point right now.  It is somehow clear to everyone that things are bad and are going to get much, much worse.  That sort of sentiment makes me think we are in for a rally.  When markets have been on the edge of an actual cliff before, the prevailing view was things wouldn't get that bad, valuations weren't too crazy, known risks were less serious than some thought, etc.\n\nMy view: The economy is stronger than some people believe, we don't have a recession, oil prices won't go as high as some think and the sell off will be viewed as a buying opportunity in retrospect.  There are still some stocks that I think will fall further (no- or low-earnings tech), but significant parts of the market are not particularly expensive relative to earnings, especially when interest rates are accounted for.

Methods vary greatly, and different technical analysts can sometimes make contradictory predictions from the same data. Many investors claim that they experience positive returns, but academic appraisals often find that it has little predictive power.\\[48\\] Of 95 modern studies, 56 concluded that technical analysis had positive results, although data-snooping bias and other problems make the analysis difficult.\\[6\\]*\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical\\_analysis#Empirical\\_evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis#Empirical_evidence)\n\nI think it's possible that there is some positive predictive value simply due to the number of traders who *believe* it will work and therefore use it.  But, as shown in even the studies that found technical analysis to have some value, the effect of this is rather small.\n\nOn the second paragraph: I disagree that the only way to keep the market going up is to create more inflation.

But there are also parts that I think are looking somewhat cheap.  There's a lot of fear present, and sentiment is rather low.

The reason that the FED is doing very small rate increases is so people don't get scared shitless and sell all their assets. They have to do everything super gently and allow the market to see what's coming a mile off to avoid any irrational buying or selling which is absolutely deadly to the economy. There was a quote from Powell during the pandemic when the FED was still pumping money into the economy which explains the idea quite nicely: \"We aren't even thinking about thinking about raising interest rates.\" People are always trying to guess what everyone else is going to do so that they can be the first ones to react. Steady as she goes is probably Jerome Powell's motto at the moment as he tries to balance rising inflation with investors' fears. This small increase kinda wets the whistle of investors as it were, and gently lets us know that more rate increases are coming at a nice steady pace so that we don't lose our shit. There will be more rate increases soon, but it has to be nice and slow.
