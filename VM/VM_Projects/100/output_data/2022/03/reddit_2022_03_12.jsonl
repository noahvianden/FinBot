Can be attractive for e.g. pension funds or other institutional investors to diversify their portfolio with more bonds. But here comes the clue: With QE the FED usually bought up all US treasury bonds, which raises the question, were inst. investors able to get any bonds in their portfolio the last couple of years? The US treasury's are considered as a safe haven so when their bonds get available more, I can imagine that their will be a run on those.\n\nStock market: Theoretically when bond yields go up, stock market goes down. Makes sense, because inst. investors have to have a low risk strategy (sharp ratio, you prefer lower risk instead of higher returns). Interesting point here is a lot of liquidity exited the stock market the last 2-3 months, question is where did all the money go? My assumption is they partially held in a cash position and are going into the bond market, unfortunately I couldn't get a chart with the liquidity of the bond market (would need a bloomberg terminal). But with interest rate on saving accounts being high enough cash can be indeed an attractive position for inst. investors. \n\nBanks: They would start to increase the mortgage rate, credit card interest rate, loan rate etc. The question here is will the mortgage rate increase be enough that demand for mortgages will shrink? Personally I have some doubts, if the person has to pay now $1000-2000 more per year for their house/flat. In the US people do live mostly on credit card, but mortgages is usually the big factor, since when a mortgage has been sold all of the money goes into the construction/restoration material and labor money. (Just gave me the idea to buy some puts on homedepot while typing that shit lol)\n\nCurrency: USD would (theoretically) appreciate since a higher interest rate would make foreign investment more attractive. Potentially it would make imports cheaper but their export would decrease. However the US already has since a long time a negative net export number, so I doubt a decrease in export would have a significant impact on GDP.

Merton, who three years later in 1997 shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for having developed the Black\u2013Scholes model of financial dynamics.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5025653839111328}, {"body": "They didn't manage capital for very long I see", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3747505247592926}, {"body": "Blackrock is highly leverage?

Since the pandemic started, the trend has been that people are leaving HCOL (high cost of living) areas like DC, NY, SFO, LA for cheaper areas like Las Vegas, Florida, Texas, really anywhere else that has major cities and isn't too rural. I can speak to Florida and Las Vegas because I live in one and was seriously looking in the other. These days, $300k doesn't get you much in either, and the locals (who don't already own a home) are upset, and hoping for a correction or a crash, but the problem with that theory is that people who are moving to Florida and Vegas are coming from much more expensive places to live and have the salary to afford houses much more expensive than $300-400k. There will come a point of equilibrium where housing stops increasing 20% YoY in those areas, however when a 3/2 in DC costs $800k, and a 3/2 in Florida runs $350-400k, know that there is probably still growth ahead. I don't see a 3/2 in FL ever costing as much as a 3/2 in DC, DC is and always will be a high-demand area, same as SFO, LA, Seattle, etc. but the trend is FL TX NV UT real estate moving towards real estate prices in those HCOL cities. Nobody knows where it will stop. It will probably stop at different points for different cities. Nevada for example is a literal desert so I'm skeptical that Las Vegas would continue to match the price growth of Tampa, FL. Still, for all we know we could see a relatively-average home in Vegas go for $500k in the next couple of years.\n\nPersonally I think Florida real estate is approaching equilibrium (the point at which YoY growth returns to \\~4% as it usually has been) when the average 3/2 is $500k. Vegas I see being somewhat lower, maybe $400k. Austin, TX I also see being somewhat lower, $350-400k.\n\nSo really you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. I am \"bullish\" on FL and NV real estate for the next 2 years, but it does seem like we should see an equal and opposite reduction in demand for New England real estate. I personally would not buy DC/DMV real estate or NJ real estate right now. I still see under $300k all day long for houses in NJ where I am looking (northern NJ) but they are usually very old, outdated and small houses.\n\nUltimately, I think the money will be coming from the same place it always has- the paychecks of high-earners. You still make a boat load more working for a DC-based company than you ever would working for a FL-based company. Very few people would be selling stocks to move from DC or NY to FL I would think.\n\nTLDR: There are areas in the US where I would not buy real estate right now that are probably overvalued, but for the areas where people have been flocking to I see no reason why that growth would slow or come to a halt in 2022, and I am optimistic about 2023. Some are saying there will be a recession by 2024-2025, and at that point I do see a bit of a housing pullback nationwide.

I was told it's a bull run and with covid recovery and everything that a second large drop was \"near improbable\" so soon after, etc. Now they're saying we are in a recession and this is just the beginning. I'm bullish long term (EOY), bearish short term. I knew inflation would catch up with the wallets of Americans, especially as wages have stagnated or went up at a lesser rate than inflation for a large majority of Americans. Furthermore, I knew stimulus money was running out, so as Govt stopped buying bonds AND civilians run out of their stim money, foot traffic of retail would go down. I honestly thought unemployment would be more of an issue due to wage demand as businesses have endured a lot of cost increases on top of, so I figured hiring would slow or stop, as managers can't afford workers they desperately need. Businesses have done a good job at trying to reach an equilibrium of passing costs off to consumers to allow for some wage hikes, taking profit cuts, but still maintaining margins. Now that inflation and wages are more directly impacting everyday Americans, they've began to modify their budgets. This is why Feb. retail foot traffic was down a lot. As others have said, we will see a quarter or two of misses from big companies like HD, LOWE, WMT, MCD, AMZN, etc. as analysts re-adjust their forecasts and companies review their forward looking earnings. Also, supply chain issues. Now that inflation is being reeled in, supply chains issues should ease more and more, covid is ending and life is returning to a sense of normalcy, I would say we are near the peak of our economic struggles. The peak could last a while, but I'd say we're there. \n\nI originally identified mid-year/June area as a pivot point. I assumed it would be the start of the pullback, now I'm thinking it could pose as the potential bottom for us. I could see Russia finishing up it's Ukraine invasion by then, and at this point we would have our first rate hike and be looking at the second one coming soon after. A catalyst like war ending, lowering inflation, and baked in rates could be a good formula for a strong reversal. \n\nIve identified 2 major support trend lines on the monthly chart; A 4000 retest on S&P is what I'm hoping for/currently predicting for the bottom, but max pain would be 3000 retest. If it bounces off 4000, bullish again long as this used to be a resistance line, so confirming it as new support would be strong. 3000 support would be riding the TL that was respected by the 2020 crash, which this area is a zone of consolidation, and i find it hard to believe it would not act like a demand zone. Even moreso considering 3k is -60% from ATH now. 4000 is -20% from ATH, which seems more likely. COVID crash was -35% from ATH. Only thing is now we'd have a resistance line again, and S&P would be stuck in a range.  Still bullish, but less so. I also like that these TLs show psych levels as possible levels of reversal. Worst I'm seeing is the possibility we go relatively sideways rest of year, bottom out at 3000 next year, then reversal (looking at yearly chart)\n\nJust like people told me it was a bull run, I was wrong and a doomsdayer, etc , now they're the ones crying \"recession, recession!\" meanwhile I'm becoming more bullish again. \"Buy when there's blood in the streets\" \n\nThis was my TED talk, thank you.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "The hive mind changed quickly.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09970557689666748}], "tickers": ["wmt", "recession", "recovery", "inflation", "crash", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Fuck the noise, buy companies you have absolute faith in and don\u2019t check your portfolio.
