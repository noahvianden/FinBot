Can be attractive for e.g. pension funds or other institutional investors to diversify their portfolio with more bonds. But here comes the clue: With QE the FED usually bought up all US treasury bonds, which raises the question, were inst. investors able to get any bonds in their portfolio the last couple of years? The US treasury's are considered as a safe haven so when their bonds get available more, I can imagine that their will be a run on those.\n\nStock market: Theoretically when bond yields go up, stock market goes down. Makes sense, because inst. investors have to have a low risk strategy (sharp ratio, you prefer lower risk instead of higher returns). Interesting point here is a lot of liquidity exited the stock market the last 2-3 months, question is where did all the money go? My assumption is they partially held in a cash position and are going into the bond market, unfortunately I couldn't get a chart with the liquidity of the bond market (would need a bloomberg terminal). But with interest rate on saving accounts being high enough cash can be indeed an attractive position for inst. investors. \n\nBanks: They would start to increase the mortgage rate, credit card interest rate, loan rate etc. The question here is will the mortgage rate increase be enough that demand for mortgages will shrink? Personally I have some doubts, if the person has to pay now $1000-2000 more per year for their house/flat. In the US people do live mostly on credit card, but mortgages is usually the big factor, since when a mortgage has been sold all of the money goes into the construction/restoration material and labor money. (Just gave me the idea to buy some puts on homedepot while typing that shit lol)\n\nCurrency: USD would (theoretically) appreciate since a higher interest rate would make foreign investment more attractive. Potentially it would make imports cheaper but their export would decrease. However the US already has since a long time a negative net export number, so I doubt a decrease in export would have a significant impact on GDP.
