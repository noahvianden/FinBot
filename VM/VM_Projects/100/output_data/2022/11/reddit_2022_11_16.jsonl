But one thing that's very revealing is that if you set that data to all time, then look at price per MWh, it was mostly flat for the last 10 years, and then since 2020 it's gone up 5x.\n\nJust one observation there, still 40% of our electricity is from gas most of the time, and gas prices have gone up as we know.

And one observation I can make is that Germany uses a lot more hard coal and lignite (brown coal) than the UK, especially compared to their natural gas usage. And those are both much cheaper. They've got around 30% of their output from coal (hard and soft), and only around 15% from gas.\n\nThe point is, although it was very stupid of the government to cut gas storage at the same time as having more dependence on gas, there's a hell of a lot involved in international energy markets.

One project is to store gas in man made caverns beneath the Irish sea. It sounds very sci fi, but basically they mine beneath the surface of the sea to create hollow caverns, fill it with gas, and then pipe it out later.

The rules and regulations from the EU can really kill the economy and take away from sovereignty. A lot of regulations have made it extremely hard for small or medium businesses as they can't afford the bureaucracy and the financial burden of living up to all the requirements. Regulation is a killer. I live in Denmark and my experience is that it hurts on all levels, i only really have deep knowledge in the energy sector and from business administration related university classes. Let me give an example from it, you know the GDPR nonsense right? for energy this is a major issue because no smart network solutions that rely on sharing data could ever be attractive since any company would have so many data hoops that make it impossible. (my source: the ceo of Ewii who had a meeting with me and a handful of other college students, Ewii is a energy company in DK) \n\nIf a business were to collect data with consent from the user they still wouldn't be able to pass it on to the other involved companies that need it as well for the grid to function. A real killer for all smart systems that want to regulate for example when electric cars charge. Another example are energy labels. You can't produce items without a label in many categories. If you can't get it you can't produce, if you can't afford the regulation and certification you can't produce. Similarly all the DIN ISO etc standards that are imposed, they are sometimes helpful but often they serve to create a competitive advantage for one particular company. See if one particular company is ahead of others in some ESG areas, they can then push for their own standards to become regulation, instantly hurting all the competitors who quickly have to invest big to catch up. (source: risk management classes, classes on sustainability)\n\nAt my work GDPR and other rules also pose a problem. I administer subsidies and we in Denmark are forced to do illogical things and do unhelpful things because we can't legally change our own laws due to the EU. So EU regulations make administration more costly and less effective. And gdpr also hinder us because again we need inefficient processes to prevent data sharing with third parties that we need to cooperate with or even across our own departments.\n\nIf they could have kept open trade with the EU following the EUs demands for trade but getting rid of all the other EU top down approach interference, then it would probably have been a big win to Brexit.\nI have more examples of how the EU hurts its strongest countries massively but those aren't Brexit related.

It's embarrassing for both you and the host that you can't do something so basic. There are less than a million interest-only mortgages in the UK and the proportion that are ARM's resetting in January will be even smaller. The claim that they make up 40% of the mortgage market is so outlandish that it is hard to take seriously even as a conversation starter. 4% is a more credible figure.\n\n[https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/number-interest-only-mortgages-falls-13-cent-2018](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/number-interest-only-mortgages-falls-13-cent-2018)\n\n[https://www.mpamag.com/uk/mortgage-industry/market-trends/uk-finance-reveals-latest-data-on-interest-only-mortgages/407045](https://www.mpamag.com/uk/mortgage-industry/market-trends/uk-finance-reveals-latest-data-on-interest-only-mortgages/407045)\n\nEdit - Ask for sources; downvote sources when they don't say what you want ...", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I didn't even read your comment yet, so don't accuse me of downvoting you.\n\nI did some further research based on your sources, and you seem to be completely off the mark.

That's 1.8 million in total that will have to refinance in January. Way more than the 1 million you suggested. Whether all of those reset in January is unclear to me, but the article does seem to suggest it. Which would be easily enough to crash the entire market. \n\nFor comparison, [only 1 in 54 Americans lost their home in 2008](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062515/how-was-american-dream-impacted-housing-market-collapse-2008.asp#:~:text=The%20Crash,homes%2C%20according%20to%20CNN%20Money.).

You are now working backwards to justify your initial take, but there is no reason to think that 2% of mortgages are going to default in January - that's a figure you plucked from the air. You started off claiming 'millions of people' won't be able to pay their mortgages, and now you're scrambling to try to salvage something from that nonsense.\n\nEdit - To add a couple of points:\n\n1) Tracker mortgages tend to update every month in the UK - there is no big annual reset, so what changes in January are just December's rate rises.\n\n2) The whole argument in your source only works for interest only mortgages. On a regular mortgage, the bulk of the payments are capital repayments, so a doubling of interest rates does not mean a doubling of repayments, it means a doubling of repayments on the small portion of the monthly bill that is interest rather than capital. That would be about a 20% increase in mortgage costs. Even if it happened overnight, that would not lead to 10% of mortgage holders defaulting.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Did you listen to your source?
