{"title": "Why tomorrow will be the greenest day in history", "selftext": "So everyone thinks PPI will set shit straight, will rug pull the bulls. And that\u2019s why it won\u2019t. Instead with 5 day options we will gamma ladder into oblivion. Some bears are thinking 400, some said 405 others 410, then the 415 and the bravest of them said 420. Which is why exactly we will fly to 430 before turning around. Until every bear is liquidated the market will run green. Only when that hopeium tank is dry will the tide change. Cramer was bearish on internet coins which means they can only go up from here. It\u2019s at least a 20% ride until resistance. That won\u2019t happen unless PPI tomorrow is green cuz it\u2019ll fly with stocks just like on CPI. Some people think pull back then moon some think crash but no one is thinking just keep mooning parabolic non stop which is why that is what will happen tomorrow.\n\n\nEdit: to set the record straight. I was in full blown shorts and now I am homeless. Lost 20k almost and had 1.4K into shorts going into this. I realized that every time, regardless of day or if there were any catalysts or not that whenever I post bearish DD or a chart the day after is super green. So I thought. What if I posted bullish DD and went short. Welp. Now we know the answer. If y\u2019all wanna mail me some ramen I\u2019d gladly accept it.", "id": "yvir9x", "created_utc": 1668475228.0, "score": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 124, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|2286|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xaqcj1/why_cpi_will_miss_using_oil_prices_a_conformers/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r6h73h/dnut_rocket_is_leaving_soon_no_shares_left_to_buy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qppy14/dnut_why_the_downgrades_are_manipulative/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvkefn/rkt_to_the_moon_the_company_is_intentionally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xtuyoh/the_freezing_cold_cpi_a_bulls_saving_grace/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yvir9x)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yvir9x)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \nHey /u/ErectoPeentrounus, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22765184938907623}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.40622755885124207}, {"body": "I\u2019m not sure who are all the gay bears out there.
