What is her life expectancy?\n\n*Err on the side of caution.* You don't want mom to be 90 and have to make the decision of working a second job or signing mom up to be a Walmart greeter.\n\nYou can take general health and family history into consideration. Health costs tend to go up as you age. Some people have a family history of living to 100+. Others the women tend to live 20 years longer than the men, etc. Others everybody tends to have strokes or heart attacks or cancers, diabetes, etc.\n\nOnce you have a basic cost of living and a life expectancy, you can setup a table to see what kind of cash flow is going to be necessary to continue that lifestyle for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.\n\nIf you are looking at less than 10 years, the stock market is a risky bet. Bonds would be a far safer option. 15 years, the stock market gets pretty darn safe about beating bonds. 20 years or more, the stock market is a no-brainer and kicks the snot out of bonds.\n\nIf the goal is to live frugally (significantly below her means) and leave a sizeable inheritance to children/grandchildren, all equities makes sense. Just be certain to setup a will and revocable trust with a lawyer so as to avoid probate and contested claims on the inheritance from your absentee aunt or 2nd cousin, twice removed.\n\nA DCA into an index fund with the lowest fees you can find for the equities portion is the intelligent investment for someone who is ignorant about investing. Bonds can also be dollar cost averaged into, and US Treasuries are a sensible option.\n\nThe weighting is up to you, but partly it would depend on how much principal is available and how much income is needed from that principal to cover living expenses each year.\n\nThe US stock market will historically return about 7% per year, in a mixture of dividends & growth. The next 100 years are not guaranteed to look like the last 200, but history is all we have.\n\n***Avoid managed funds.*** Pay a ***flat fee*** and buy an hours time with a reputable fiduciary financial planner.

Think of your mother's current house... is it an asset... no, it is not. \n\nA house only becomes an asset when profit is generated (run a business out of it, rent it, Air BnB, etc).

You could buy a house cash that makes sense for the amount of money generated passively OR mortgage a home where the expenses are less than the passive income generated from the cash. \n\n$250k makes $12,500 a year at 5% or $1,041 a month... long term capitol gains tax for a single filer makes this money nearly tax free.... so you could mortgage a $175,000 home and essentially have the home for free WITHOUT spending your principle. \n\nAll I am saying is you need to be VERY careful and well versed in this situation (by hiring a financial advisor, CPA, etc.).
