{"title": "Thoughts on selling all current positions and starting fresh?", "selftext": "\nA few years ago, I started investing in stocks as a beginner, but as covid hit and tanked a lot of my positions, I starting getting disinterested about it. Checking today, I\u2019m down about 47%, with most stock losing money, and some being the biggest losers (lost significantly after buying high on coin base, Robinhood, etc). I really want to get back into trading now, but it\u2019s really demotivating to see my current positions and how low they are. For some of my stock, I don\u2019t think there is a chance for them to go back to the price that I bought them for. Does anyone have any thoughts on me selling my entire portfolio and re-investing in stocks I think will trend upward (Amazon, Disney)? Is this a good idea if I want to start fresh and want to get back to my initial investment level? What are some cons to selling all my positions now?\n\nSince a few people were asking for my positions, I\u2019ll list a few here for a better perspective:\n(Stock | price bought at):\nCoinbase | $341\nRobinhood | $36.5\nVirgin Galactic Holdings | $26\nRCL| $84", "id": "yn9xun", "created_utc": 1667690664.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nPlease direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
