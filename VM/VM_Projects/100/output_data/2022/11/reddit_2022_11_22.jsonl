Facebook was doomed years ago. How do you grow a company that nearly everyone already uses, and it\u2019s only revenue depends on ad revenue? Short answer: you can\u2019t. You need to find new business models and products, but for social media your products cannibalize eachother. People only have so much attention to give per day and so much patience for ads. If you have the ONLY social media platform people that currently use (think 5 years ago), then all you can do is go down as more competition (Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter) takes your customers attention away. Cheap money and passive 401k investors and pipe dreams let them carry on for five years longer than they should have. \n\nThey did they only thing they could do - slap a device (oculus) on their social media platform to try and extract more dollars than ad revenue from each user, and expand their platform so that more people could use it more often (at work, when you shouldn\u2019t be on social media). \n\nAmazon is similar. If they didn\u2019t have AWS now they would be wholly fucked. If they don\u2019t find another thing like AWS that can scale immensely, that everyone uses (think healthcare sized), they are also fucked. To hit these growth targets when your company is worth TRILLIONS of dollars is insane. 10% growth ($100M) on a billon dollar company is a lot easier than 10% growth on a $1T company ($100B).

You can get your stock prices up temporarily with fancy wizbang press releases on what you\u2019re -going- to do and how great it -will- be, but eventually you have to deliver. \n\nPS: where\u2019s the Cyber Truck and Roadster?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Zuckerberg resigning will skyrocket the company.

The its P/E ratio is 53. \nThats just slightly lower than Tesla. Love or hate Tesla, their upside potential feels a lot higher than a company that's been shitting out creatively bankrupt sequels and remakes for the last decade. Which brings me to #2...\n\n2. The IP is tired. \nThe Marvel cinematic universe was a brilliant innovation, but that trains running out of steam, Star Wars hasn't recovered since the sequel trilogy and we're running out of classic Disney movies to remake.\n\n3. Streaming Services ain't what they used to be.\nTake a look at the Netflix ticker or Disney's losses in the streaming sector and it should be obvious to everyone that streaming services require more than ho-hum original content to survive. \n\nDisney made the mistake of thinking that because people like Disney content, they'll pay for a DVD player that only plays Disney content. A large number of people will, but making and maintaining that line of DVD players isn't easy or free.\n\n4. Political BS\nWhether you think Disney's gone too woke or conservative parents are hypersensitive bigots, it doesn't matter. The fact is there is a segment of the population that doesn't trust Disney to provide safe content to their children... which is like the whole reason Disney exists.\n\n5. Bob Iger is a genius. He's also one guy and largely responsible for issues 1-4.\n\nI have a huge amount of respect for Bob Iger, I even read his book!

Just before Corona and just after Avengers End Game. I have no doubt that his perfectly timed exit might be causing some people to view his tenure with rose colored glasses and ignore the fact that most of the rot we've seen over the last 2 years during Chapeks tenure, almost certainly didn't start there.\n\nIf you have any questions I'll be behind the dumpster giving out handies.", "id": "z1jecb", "created_utc": 1669088525.0, "score": 179, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|18|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z1jecb)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z1jecb)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: Disney's in big trouble and I have no idea why you're still here reading this.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0666843056678772}, {"body": "When does your put expire,OP ?![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

{"title": "VIX is Broken -> What comes next.....................", "selftext": "Anyone who has been following the VIX knows that it's not acting normal right now.\n\nSince markets bottomed in March 2009, the S&P 500 and the VIX have consistently maintained an inverse correlation, with the volatility index typically drifting steadily lower as equities powered to new highs (think 2017, when the VIX fell into single digits amid steady stock market gains) while bouts of volatility and short-lived selloffs in the stock market saw the VIX spike higher. Digging into this relationship deeper, when stocks made new meaningful lows below exceptional support levels, the VIX would almost always rise to new highs beyond those that corresponded with the previous lows in stocks.\u00a0\n\nFor example, as the S&P 500 (SPX) dropped below the lows from late 2018 (2,346) during the Q1 \u201920 Covid-19 crash, which carried the index down to 2,191, the VIX blasted through the late-2018 high of 36.20 and peaked at a staggering 85.47. The uncertainty associated with the first pandemic in 100 years certainly amplified the move higher in the VIX in that example, but it does illustrate the point of the traditional inverse correlation between stocks and the VIX very well.\n\nNow, the actual formula and process used to calculate the VIX is very complex and involves some high-level math, but in the simplest terms, the index measures price activity, mainly demand, in the options market. That is why in normal market conditions, the VIX rises amid increasing demand for puts as the broader stock market declines, and this is also the reason it is often referred to as the market's \u201cfear gauge.\u201d\n\nBut at both of the most recent major market peaks that occurred in 2000 and then again in 2007/2008, that historically consistent inverse correlation between the stock market and the VIX broke down as new meaningful lows in the S&P 500 were not met with new highs in the VIX. And it has happened again this year.\u00a0\n\n**The logical question to ask here is: why would this happen?**\n\nAs stocks make new meaningful lows, as they first did in February, then again in May and June of this year, sophisticated investors were actually liquidating long-term, long equity positions as opposed to holding those positions and just adding hedges to manage risk and downside exposure.\n\nSo, what we are seeing in the VIX and the S&P 500 right now is the same thing we saw in both 2000/2001 and 2007/2008 in the early stages of those respective bear markets. And the bad news is that this dynamic only persists during the \u201cdistribution phase\u201d of market cycles when sophisticated investors are liquidating to retail investors attempting to \u201cbuy one more dip.\u201d Once the VIX finally breaks the downtrend of \u201clower highs\u201d and begins to move meaningfully higher, the real breakdown and capitulation in stocks begin.\n\nLooking at the dot-com bubble, the downtrend in the VIX was broken in September 2001, and the S&P 500 proceeded to decline another 30% or so, as the VIX ripped higher, finally bottoming in late 2002. During the financial crisis, the VIX downtrend was not broken until September 2008, and the S&P 500 fell another 47% to the March 2009 lows (of course, the VIX ripped higher as well).\n\n**Algorithm Data:**\n\n**Set to start buying at 4247**\n\n**Set to start dumping at 3857**\n\n**That does NOT seem bullish to me.**\n\nEDIT: I'd also like to note that the SOFR rate was higher than the 10 year treasury rate today.  That is weird!  Banks are getting a higher rate to park their money overnight with the Fed than buying 10 year treasuries?  Last time this happened was January 2020.\n\nTL;DR: The bottom isn't in, and this bear market is just getting started.  Institutional investors have liquidated their long equity positions to retail so they aren't buying puts as a hedge which means the VIX isn't properly gauging the fear in the market.\n\n[Not a perfect downtrend but we're still in the process of making lower highs since the start of the year.](https://preview.redd.it/t46vm8ulji1a1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=33636cbd067e48ef414fc8db525df18551393dfa)", "id": "z1ukr9", "created_utc": 1669126305.0, "score": 362, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|219|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z1ukr9)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z1ukr9)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: The VIX isn't acting normal right now because institutional investors are selling their long positions in stocks, instead of just hedging them.

With all the companies laying people off, where is the demand going to go for business and pleasure travel if there is no one who needs to fly? No one has money to go to Disney world right now, hence the reason their numbers are so bad.

Having said that, I priced tickets to go see my sister recently and they were three times what they were pre-covid.  Same for every time I have gone to get my medical renewed out in Colorado.  So based on my antidotal single person experience, I would expect prices to have gone up at least two to three times what they were.  Which makes sense.\n\nWe lost a lot of pilots over covid due to early retirements who are not coming back.  We were already short pilots before covid and this just made it worse.  Cost for employees have gone up significantly as well.  Some regionals are not offering higher first year pay than the legacies 1st year pay and offering a year salary as a sign on bonus.  So that is driving ticket prices up as well.  Then add in the increased cost of fuel and the difficulties getting parts due to supply chain issues and its just bad all around. \n\nAnd there are fewer seats to go around.  There are still a lot of planes sitting around without crews to operate them.  We just don't have enough pilots.  So that causes flights to sell out quickly.  The people you are referring to purchasing tickets earlier are only doing so because they suspect the flights will be sold out.  Which they often are due to management making a choice to over sell flights in the hopes that some people just won't show up.  \n\nThe holidays are an odd time to use as a basis for forecasting.

It's using a lack of evidence to the contrary of a notion to presume the notion is thus true. All this rumor mongering about these hidden, supposedly uber-billionaires worth depends on no one being able to definitely prove they *don't* have all that money. But no one has to. Anyone who believes they *do* needs to prove it.\n\n>Recently a bunch of Russian oligarchs had yachts seized we didn\u2019t even know who owned some of them that cost up to $600~b~\n\nFTFY. \n\n>Swiss banks seized billions of their cash that no one else knew about previously.\n\n[Swiss national bank data showed that Russian companies and individuals held assets worth more than $11 billion in Swiss banks in 2020.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/world/europe/switzerland-russian-assets-freeze.html)\n\nThat's not a secret, nor is it nearly enough to make any of them the wealthiest person in the world. Not even close, even if it was held by one person. \n\n>Is it considered ignorant to assume someone owned that $750m yacht?\n\nMy point is it's a logical fallacy to assume people like Vladimir Putin is the wealthiest person in the world because no one can prove he isn't. You would do well to actually read the page I linked to instead of confusing a fallacy with semantics. \n\n>I think it\u2019s more ignorant to believe that Kanye was ever worth over $1b but Forbes pretended he was. They did it for years until announcing last month that his worth dropped $1.5b (over 75%) because he never actually had the money and they had been inflating his net worth the whole time based on flawed projections.\n\nNow you're misusing \"ignorant\" since that means to be unaware or not to know something. You could argue Forbes was presumptuous, even fantastical in their estimations, but there weren't really any facts they were overlooking. \n\nForbes never contended he actually had liquid money or assets, they were assessing his net worth based on the calculated worth of the endorsement deals he lost post antisemitic insanity. You can argue the difficulty in assessing the value of such deals but ignoring them would have been foolish, since they were obviously worth something.\n\n>Edit: to be clear, is anyone else worth more than $200b?

I'm going to continue explaining the points I make about logical flaws. If you don't like it, that's your problem. \n\n> You claim we can\u2019t prove a negative,\n\nNo, I didn't. Again, reading comprehension.\n\n>you\u2019re wrong.\n\nAs I explained above, you are. \n\n>Someone owned that yacht and has not claimed it, that proves the negative.\n\nThat doesn't prove anything other than someone owned a yacht and didn't claim it. You don't even know what this \"negative\" you erroneously believe I said can't be proven is. \n\nAt first I thought you were a bit confused, but now I'm convinced you're either arguing in bad faith or are just obtuse. And I'm not sure which is worse. \n\n>This makes it a proven fact that we are unable to account for $750m of someone\u2019s net worth.\n\nIt doesn't mean what you think it does, that it's some sort of unaccounted for secret. We could know the owner's have such a yacht, just not that it's the same one seized in the article. Which you clearly didn't read. Only two yachts mentioned in it have unidentified owners, one of which was $50M and linked to a Russian owner, and the other was $600M.\n\nThe only time any yacht is mentioned being worth $750M is the first one, and that's the high end of an estimate range the lowest of which is $600M and, according to the article, is owned by Alisher Usmanov. How many times do you need to be reminded you actually have to *understand* what it is you read? At this point I'm starting to think literacy itself is what you struggle with.\n\n> And that is just a single asset.\n\nEven if it is what you think it is, that doesn't mean there are more. Again, argument from ignorance. \n\n>I never implied they did. My point was that \u201cNet worth\u201d is an ill defined and illusory term.\n\nYou all but said they were arbitrarily calculating Kanye's net worth, and I was pointing out you're wrong. \n\n> Which you prove below:\n\nYou can think I \"proved you right\" by interpreting \"you can argue something\" as \"what you're arguing is correct\", which is foolish or narcissistic, so still no clarity on if you're obtuse or arguing in bad faith.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">This was a statement, nothing to do with you personally.

You're not only unqualified to do so, you're also clearly a liar. \n\n>This is a strawman. I never said Forbes was ignorant, I said the people who buy into their calculation of net worth without understanding the liberties they take when labeling it net worth.\n\nNo, it isn't. You said it was ignorant to believe Kanye was worth $1B+, which Forbes clearly did based on its calculations. If that's not what you meant, you should have conveyed your meaning more appropriately, but more likely, it is what you meant and you're backpedaling. \n\n>Choosing to not acknowledge the personal attacks (ad hominem) this still does not address the point being made.\n\nSince you mentioned \"personal attacks\" you are in fact acknowledging them. You're also wrong because ad hom is meant to undermine an argument using personal attacks, which I didn't do, I attacked your argument on its lack of merit. \n\nI addressed the point being made over and over again. Now, I'm addressing the fact you don't even understand the very sources you use to make your point, meaning your argument sucks for even more reasons. \n\n>Why are you arguing the amount or other yachts? (Red herrings) Both figures are listed, can you explain why you believe this is significant to the conversation we are having?\n\nNot a red herring. It's important to know the facts germane to your argument? Why are you so insistent in glossing over them? Because you know you've made a serious error. \n\n>My point is the principle, we do not know who owns this asset worth $X. We don\u2019t though, the list of owners of $500m+ yachts isn\u2019t very long and would be very easy to cross reference. If journalists and governments could not identify the owner using this information, it is safe to say it was unaccounted for previously. Unless you have information that they do not, in which case you should present it at this time.\n\nNo, it isn't, because we could certainly know whoever the owner is has such a yacht without knowing it's specifically the one seized. \n\nI have plenty of sound logic you do not, but that's nothing new. \n\n>There are, I just didn\u2019t think I would need to point out every example. Plenty of non-western billionaires have undisclosed assets look at China\u2019s political party members and business tycoons or unknown cryptocurrency wallets. There is nothing new or novel about untraced assets. There is plenty of documentation of this happening for centuries.\n\nThe existence of such undisclosed assets is not proof of other such assets. That's basic logic. If there are, it is not proven by having located these assets. If you want to contend Alisher Usmanov, or any other particular oligarch, dictator, whatever, has anything else hidden, you would need proof of that ownership, which has been the point the whole time. If you don't have it, you're in no position to confidently say any such person has a Forbes list-topping fortune. It's just conjecture. \n\n>I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t news to you, rendering this a bad faith argument.\n\nMy whole point is that I, nor you for that matter, know to what extent, if any, there are other hidden assets, hence why speculation about obscene hidden riches is pointless, which you've agreed to, so more \"I know you are but what am I?\" is even more idiotic\n\n>Ad hom\n\nNope, see above. \n\n>Your entire tirade only included one valid argument and it\u2019s been rebutted.\n\nYour entire rant include not one single rebuttal or effective argument. You've clearly misunderstood the argument from ignorance fallacy and don't have the decency to admit you confused the fallacy with the dictionary definition of ignorance.\n\nYou created straw men such as \"you said you can't prove a negative\" which I never did, and conveniently forgot to mention those asides again after I pointed out what you misunderstood. \n\nYou failed to demonstrate why anyone should speculate about other hidden assets based on uncovered hidden assets, and you shifted the goal posts on what you were contending, such as the ignorance inherent in Forbes' calculations when called out.\n\n>Everything else was an ad hominem, red herring, or strawman. \n\nNope, explained why you're wrong several times. See above. \n\n>You present yourself to be an expert on logical fallacies\n\nNo, I pointed out where the argument was committing logical fallacies. I don't need to be an expert to do that.
