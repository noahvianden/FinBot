Facebook was doomed years ago. How do you grow a company that nearly everyone already uses, and it\u2019s only revenue depends on ad revenue? Short answer: you can\u2019t. You need to find new business models and products, but for social media your products cannibalize eachother. People only have so much attention to give per day and so much patience for ads. If you have the ONLY social media platform people that currently use (think 5 years ago), then all you can do is go down as more competition (Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter) takes your customers attention away. Cheap money and passive 401k investors and pipe dreams let them carry on for five years longer than they should have. \n\nThey did they only thing they could do - slap a device (oculus) on their social media platform to try and extract more dollars than ad revenue from each user, and expand their platform so that more people could use it more often (at work, when you shouldn\u2019t be on social media). \n\nAmazon is similar. If they didn\u2019t have AWS now they would be wholly fucked. If they don\u2019t find another thing like AWS that can scale immensely, that everyone uses (think healthcare sized), they are also fucked. To hit these growth targets when your company is worth TRILLIONS of dollars is insane. 10% growth ($100M) on a billon dollar company is a lot easier than 10% growth on a $1T company ($100B).

You can get your stock prices up temporarily with fancy wizbang press releases on what you\u2019re -going- to do and how great it -will- be, but eventually you have to deliver. \n\nPS: where\u2019s the Cyber Truck and Roadster?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Zuckerberg resigning will skyrocket the company.

The its P/E ratio is 53. \nThats just slightly lower than Tesla. Love or hate Tesla, their upside potential feels a lot higher than a company that's been shitting out creatively bankrupt sequels and remakes for the last decade. Which brings me to #2...\n\n2. The IP is tired. \nThe Marvel cinematic universe was a brilliant innovation, but that trains running out of steam, Star Wars hasn't recovered since the sequel trilogy and we're running out of classic Disney movies to remake.\n\n3. Streaming Services ain't what they used to be.\nTake a look at the Netflix ticker or Disney's losses in the streaming sector and it should be obvious to everyone that streaming services require more than ho-hum original content to survive. \n\nDisney made the mistake of thinking that because people like Disney content, they'll pay for a DVD player that only plays Disney content. A large number of people will, but making and maintaining that line of DVD players isn't easy or free.\n\n4. Political BS\nWhether you think Disney's gone too woke or conservative parents are hypersensitive bigots, it doesn't matter. The fact is there is a segment of the population that doesn't trust Disney to provide safe content to their children... which is like the whole reason Disney exists.\n\n5. Bob Iger is a genius. He's also one guy and largely responsible for issues 1-4.\n\nI have a huge amount of respect for Bob Iger, I even read his book!

Just before Corona and just after Avengers End Game. I have no doubt that his perfectly timed exit might be causing some people to view his tenure with rose colored glasses and ignore the fact that most of the rot we've seen over the last 2 years during Chapeks tenure, almost certainly didn't start there.\n\nIf you have any questions I'll be behind the dumpster giving out handies.", "id": "z1jecb", "created_utc": 1669088525.0, "score": 179, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|18|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z1jecb)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z1jecb)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: Disney's in big trouble and I have no idea why you're still here reading this.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0666843056678772}, {"body": "When does your put expire,OP ?![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

{"title": "VIX is Broken -> What comes next.....................", "selftext": "Anyone who has been following the VIX knows that it's not acting normal right now.\n\nSince markets bottomed in March 2009, the S&P 500 and the VIX have consistently maintained an inverse correlation, with the volatility index typically drifting steadily lower as equities powered to new highs (think 2017, when the VIX fell into single digits amid steady stock market gains) while bouts of volatility and short-lived selloffs in the stock market saw the VIX spike higher. Digging into this relationship deeper, when stocks made new meaningful lows below exceptional support levels, the VIX would almost always rise to new highs beyond those that corresponded with the previous lows in stocks.\u00a0\n\nFor example, as the S&P 500 (SPX) dropped below the lows from late 2018 (2,346) during the Q1 \u201920 Covid-19 crash, which carried the index down to 2,191, the VIX blasted through the late-2018 high of 36.20 and peaked at a staggering 85.47. The uncertainty associated with the first pandemic in 100 years certainly amplified the move higher in the VIX in that example, but it does illustrate the point of the traditional inverse correlation between stocks and the VIX very well.\n\nNow, the actual formula and process used to calculate the VIX is very complex and involves some high-level math, but in the simplest terms, the index measures price activity, mainly demand, in the options market. That is why in normal market conditions, the VIX rises amid increasing demand for puts as the broader stock market declines, and this is also the reason it is often referred to as the market's \u201cfear gauge.\u201d\n\nBut at both of the most recent major market peaks that occurred in 2000 and then again in 2007/2008, that historically consistent inverse correlation between the stock market and the VIX broke down as new meaningful lows in the S&P 500 were not met with new highs in the VIX. And it has happened again this year.\u00a0\n\n**The logical question to ask here is: why would this happen?**\n\nAs stocks make new meaningful lows, as they first did in February, then again in May and June of this year, sophisticated investors were actually liquidating long-term, long equity positions as opposed to holding those positions and just adding hedges to manage risk and downside exposure.\n\nSo, what we are seeing in the VIX and the S&P 500 right now is the same thing we saw in both 2000/2001 and 2007/2008 in the early stages of those respective bear markets. And the bad news is that this dynamic only persists during the \u201cdistribution phase\u201d of market cycles when sophisticated investors are liquidating to retail investors attempting to \u201cbuy one more dip.\u201d Once the VIX finally breaks the downtrend of \u201clower highs\u201d and begins to move meaningfully higher, the real breakdown and capitulation in stocks begin.\n\nLooking at the dot-com bubble, the downtrend in the VIX was broken in September 2001, and the S&P 500 proceeded to decline another 30% or so, as the VIX ripped higher, finally bottoming in late 2002. During the financial crisis, the VIX downtrend was not broken until September 2008, and the S&P 500 fell another 47% to the March 2009 lows (of course, the VIX ripped higher as well).\n\n**Algorithm Data:**\n\n**Set to start buying at 4247**\n\n**Set to start dumping at 3857**\n\n**That does NOT seem bullish to me.**\n\nEDIT: I'd also like to note that the SOFR rate was higher than the 10 year treasury rate today.  That is weird!  Banks are getting a higher rate to park their money overnight with the Fed than buying 10 year treasuries?  Last time this happened was January 2020.\n\nTL;DR: The bottom isn't in, and this bear market is just getting started.  Institutional investors have liquidated their long equity positions to retail so they aren't buying puts as a hedge which means the VIX isn't properly gauging the fear in the market.\n\n[Not a perfect downtrend but we're still in the process of making lower highs since the start of the year.](https://preview.redd.it/t46vm8ulji1a1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=33636cbd067e48ef414fc8db525df18551393dfa)", "id": "z1ukr9", "created_utc": 1669126305.0, "score": 362, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|219|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z1ukr9)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z1ukr9)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: The VIX isn't acting normal right now because institutional investors are selling their long positions in stocks, instead of just hedging them.

With all the companies laying people off, where is the demand going to go for business and pleasure travel if there is no one who needs to fly? No one has money to go to Disney world right now, hence the reason their numbers are so bad.

Having said that, I priced tickets to go see my sister recently and they were three times what they were pre-covid.  Same for every time I have gone to get my medical renewed out in Colorado.  So based on my antidotal single person experience, I would expect prices to have gone up at least two to three times what they were.  Which makes sense.\n\nWe lost a lot of pilots over covid due to early retirements who are not coming back.  We were already short pilots before covid and this just made it worse.  Cost for employees have gone up significantly as well.  Some regionals are not offering higher first year pay than the legacies 1st year pay and offering a year salary as a sign on bonus.  So that is driving ticket prices up as well.  Then add in the increased cost of fuel and the difficulties getting parts due to supply chain issues and its just bad all around. \n\nAnd there are fewer seats to go around.  There are still a lot of planes sitting around without crews to operate them.  We just don't have enough pilots.  So that causes flights to sell out quickly.  The people you are referring to purchasing tickets earlier are only doing so because they suspect the flights will be sold out.  Which they often are due to management making a choice to over sell flights in the hopes that some people just won't show up.  \n\nThe holidays are an odd time to use as a basis for forecasting.
