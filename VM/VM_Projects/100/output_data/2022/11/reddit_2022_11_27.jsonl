The current drought is resulting in 30%+ drops in yields, and for some crops like tomatoes they're just tilling plants back into the ground or letting them rot because they can't get water.  For some crops,ike strawberries, it's a short term price hike.  Anything that grows on a tree in a drought area, like almonds, is at serious risk of a much longer spike.  It will take 10+ years to recover crops grown on trees.  Almond farms in California are a very real risk that no one is paying attention to.  In the Midwest it's worse, because drought is going to fuck with soil salinity.  Farmers dropped fertilizer on the ground that then didn't get proper absorption.  It's going to require several rounds of crop rotations to rebalance the soil chemistry and will impact their ability to use fertilizers on the next couple of rounds, reducing yields even more.\n\n2.  Animal husbandry is severely fucked.  Right now beef prices are on the drop.  Everyone thinks it's great, but the real reason is that there's excessive slaughter going on because ranchers know they can't afford to feed cattle through winter.  Cows are being slaughtered at record numbers too, which means we're 3-4 years out on getting steers back to slaughter to make up the demand.  Similar issues for pork, except that china is the real pork problem.  They're consuming so much pork that they're building 20+ story slaughterhouses and will continue to keep very high pressure on pork, particularly pork belly prices.\n\n3.  Bird flu what?  The last round of avian flu killed over 50 MILLION poultry animals.  It's the largest outbreak in history.  In the past the infection rates were only about 1/4 from interaction with wild foul.  Now they're estimating as much as 80% of the infection is coming from wild foul, which would seem to indicate a much more infectious and pervasive avian flu is making the rounds.  Compounded with the increased demand for eggs for vaccine production and the poultry pressure isn't going away anytime soon.  Another round of avian flu and poultry might make beef look affordable.  Wait for the Audubon society next round of wild bird survey to see how it's playing out in nature too.\n\nI could go on and on there's at least another half dozen major influences including diesel price, Ukraine, worker shortage etc that are also more minor influences.  Crazy part is all of them compounding at the exact same time.

It's not to say that fiscal policy doesn't matter, but you know it's, it's in first and foremost, it's our job.**  \n>  \n>By the way, when Milton Friedman wrote that-- wrote that and when I was in college, I graduated from college in 1975, you know, it was the heyday of monetarism, so people were looking at monetary aggregates, and thinking that the quantity of money, you know there's it's, money it's, it's the amount of money and the amount of goods, and inflation is too much money chasing too much goods.  \n>  \n>So that kind of stopped working about 40 years ago, it stopped work-- and it never really worked great **\\[I nervously chuckle\\]**, but it worked okay, and to-- to the point where were a lot of monetarists, and, and um including here at the Fed, and it was, you know, we were looking at monetary aggregates.  \n>  \n>Paul Volcker thinks that targeting the monetary aggregates, during that period when he was, you know, choking inflation to death... um but for, for whatever reason, the relationship between monetary growth and economic activity just got, just got completely, it was like this, there was no, signific-- you know, significant relationship for a while.  \n>  \n>Now that's not to say that that can't change, that the struc--  structure of the economy is ever evolving, and there-- there may be a place for money creation, when people look back at this inflation, they may look back, **money creation is very very high, with fiscal policy really, um during the um, we-- we don't actually affect monetary sup-- money supply when we, we create reserves and we buy assets, so we're not actually changing the supply of money, just the reserves of money.**  \n>  \n>So, but, uh, anyways, so that's the story with-- with Milton Friedman, who of course was a fun guy to read, and still is.\n\n(I went through several rounds of edits to the formatting of the text so it wasn't just one blob of text.)", "id": "z65h5e", "created_utc": 1669566516.0, "score": 384, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|36|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z65h5e)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z65h5e)\n\n^^WSB ^^[Stats](https://www.twitch.tv/wsbzjz/) ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: I asked Jerome Powell about inflation and the Federal Reserve's role in reducing it.
