Think golf carts with a little more power and a cab or like electric equipment. There's really nothing to them. They don't need to be fast or have a lot of torque, they just need to drive and stop. They're not gonna pull a trailer they're gonna pick up groceries, get people to work and the kids to soccer. And they don't need huge range.

And you want it to be as comfortable and safe as possible but again it doesn't need to be perfect, it needs to be practical. Maybe using a kerosene heater instead of using the batteries to warm the cab. Things like that, simple and functional.
