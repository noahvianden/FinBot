Here's the TL;DR: Financing remains healthy despite high mortgage rates; consumer spending on remodeling is high and balance sheets are strong; supply is limited as is new construction; banking system is more robust; defaults are low. And not mentioned, but most Americans locked in low interest rates / refinanced and aren't actually paying 7% mortgage rates. So we could see housing prices weaken and fall, but it's not as likely as 2008 to translate into a severe recession, or financial meltdown.\n\nPoint 1:\n\n> Today, as in 2008, sales are declining from exceptionally strong levels. But the sudden stop in financing and sustained shift in credit standards that undermined housing transactions in 2008 are unlikely this time. Mortgage rates have shot up, shrinking how much house the same payment will buy, but financing remains available\n\nPoint 2:\n\n> Next, spending on residential remodeling is running at a 60-year high. This speaks not only to the pandemic-induced need for more home office space. It also speaks to households\u2019 strong balance sheets, where wealth has grown across the income distribution with pandemic stimulus and the inability to spend freely. Though household wealth is coming under pressure\u2014just think about the drawdown in equity markets\u2014balance sheets are unlikely to be structurally impaired this time around. \n\nPoint 3:\n\n> in a critical difference to the mid-2000s, there just isn\u2019t enough housing supply today. Today\u2019s low housing inventories are consistent with continued building activity even against a backdrop of higher rates, because the risk of being unable to sell homes when there are few on the market is lower\n\nPoint 4:\n\n> Today credit quality, access, and financing costs look different. Unlike 2008, defaults are low, nonperforming loans are rare, and the banking system is in robust health with high levels of capital and profits. This has helped keep credit accessible, after a brief tightening at the beginning of the COVID crisis, for the same type of borrowers that had access before COVID struck\u2014even if that credit is now more expensive. \n\nSummary:\n\n> Households\u2019 balance sheets are extremely strong, and housing leverage is modest; credit standards have been healthy and there are few signs of credit stress; and banks are profitable and strongly capitalized.

I\u2019m looking in the tri-state area of New York and Connecticut New Jersey and people just spit up home prices to ridiculous level all at once when everybody left New York City when interest rates are zero and they needed to get the hell out of New York City. But both of those huge market movers don\u2019t exist anymore. So now everything is just sitting. I would argue that some of these inflated prices weren\u2019t real and the sense that a few houses sold at these inflated levels for the aforementioned reasons, but there wasn\u2019t enough sustained activity at these prices to make them \u201creal\u201d\n\nOf course sellers seem to think they should anchor their asking price based on 2021, which is why hundreds of houses I\u2019m looking at I\u2019ve been watching are sitting for like four or six months and keep getting relisted like they\u2019re new\n\nMy only problem with the synopsis hear that everything is great is that everybody is a general fighting the past war. Yes, strippers are buying five houses but no documented income now. But that doesn\u2019t mean this isn\u2019t a recipe for an economic disaster at some point. This time you have all these 45 year olds at the peak of their career living paycheck to paycheck with a big monthly payment. As if nobody ever got laid off.  Just cause these people are at the higher end of middle-class doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t have money problems at some point. I don\u2019t know why everyone\u2019s acting like these people will be able to make these big monthly payments for 30 years straight.\n\nIn the past we relied on inflation to eventually shrink the size of the monthly payments compared to the cost of living.  But with some of these ridiculous monthly payments people have, it\u2019s going to take like 20 years of inflation for the monthly payment to appear small.Considering a lot of people I see buying are in their 40s, I have no clue what they\u2019re thinking. So they think they\u2019re going to keep their high pay high stress corporate job until they\u2019re 70?
