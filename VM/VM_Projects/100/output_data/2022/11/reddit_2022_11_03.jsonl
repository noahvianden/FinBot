Their prepared statements literally read \"inflation high, rates go higher\" except from last year when it was \"inflation high, rate stay low\". I mean this is high school level decision making we're seeing so it's no surprise they're making mistakes constantly.\n\nAnd outside the meetings the communication is even worse. Some of the FOMC members now seem to be making comparisons to the 70s when there is next to no parallels to be made there. Again, the logic is something like, \"inflation high in 70s, inflation high today. Must be same\". It's literally this stupid.\n\nI mean I see better theories for why inflation is high posted on this sub. That's how bad it is.\n\nThe Fed has already caused havoc around the world with excessively loose policy followed by excessively tight policy, and we probably haven't even seen the worst of it yet. There are people are literally starving right now because of the FX volatility they've caused. If this was the central bank of some irrelevant European country then whatever, but this is the central bank to the world's reserve currency.

That's half the problem. If they were just being vague, I could at least hope they know what they're doing. My problem is that they're saying conflicting things. Not just about the path of monetary policy, but even about their own models.\n\nObviously I could point to the comments Powell made earlier this year about being near the neutral rate only to change his mind the next time he spoke, causing a massive market swing in markets. But for me it's things like him saying the 2s-10s spread isn't important earlier this year, then specifically commenting on how they watch the near-term forward spread, only to then take that back now that it's also inverting. Was he lying or is he clueless - which would give you the greatest sense of trust in his decision making?\n\nThe reason I think this is important is because the predictability of monetary policy is far more important than the predictability of inflation for economic growth. If the path of policy can't be predictable then the Fed at the very least should do what they can to reduce volatility in market expectations. Eg, treasuries gradually selling off may be necessary, but huge swings in the treasury market is never necessary and caused purely by poor guidance from the Fed.\n\nAs an example, if you're going to take out a loan, while the rate of interest might be a consideration, inflation jumping from 2% to 10% is much less of a threat (and might actually be positive) when compared to interest rates jumping from 2% to 5%. Similarly if you're going to take risk and make an investment in the stock market, while the inflation rate matters, it doesn't matter anywhere near as much as the risk free rate set by monetary policy.\n\nWe saw this in 2021. Despite inflation being very high, people were willing to take risk, investing in the market, buying homes, starting businesses, etc. However today that's changed and it has nothing to do with inflation and everything to do with monetary policy. What people got wrong about investing in 2021 wasn't inflation, but that they thought they could trust the Fed when they said that they wouldn't raise rates and that inflation was transitory. Now because of this treasury market pump and dump that Powell orchestrated over the last couple of years a significant number of people will literally never invest in the stock market again because they no longer trust the central bank will not rug pull them. These people couldn't really care if core CPI was 2% or 5%, what they care about is their investment portfolio just lost 50% and their house just dropped 20% in value. We have plenty of data that supports what I'm saying here, that higher inflation doesn't necessary led to slower real growth until it starts getting above 10%. And again, we saw this in 2021 and plenty of over recoveries where inflation can be high along aside real economic growth.\n\nWhat Powell is doing with these yearly switcheroos in monetary policy is fundamentally eroding confidence in the US economy and US markets. And these are not small pivots he's making. It's stuff like \"QT is on autopilot\" only to pivot and restart QE. Or the \"not thinking about thinking about raising rates\" actually being multiple 75bps hikes in 2023. He keep's talking about the threat of inflation, but the real threat here is that we have a lunatic in charge of the most important central bank in the world eroding investor confidence (in many cases permanently) by injecting huge amounts of volatility into global markets.\n\nSo no, the problem isn't that he is vague.

Instead, the Fed needs to convince the market that they\u2019re driving a freight train and won\u2019t hit the brakes until headline inflation is back at 2% - and if you look at the yield curve, this strategy appears to be working.\n\nIn reality, an inflation cooldown and an eventual interest rate decrease to a more sustainable level (far below 5%) is inevitable, probably within the next 12-18 months.

It puts them in negative equity. When combined with unaffordable remortgage rate it can mean bankruptcy.\n\nIf history is any marker for the future then we will soon see the return of a lot of interest only mortgages for people who can\u2019t afford their remortgage.\n\nIf you buy a home on a 95% mortgage and it drops in value by 10% then your mortgage is more than your house is worth. That\u2019s a huge problem when rates rise because most people on 95% mortgages have also borrowed every penny they can possibly afford. So when rates go from <2% borrowing costs to >6% borrowing cost you can\u2019t afford the remortgage. If people can\u2019t get approved for the remortgage they end up on a standard variable rate which will probably be an even higher percentage. Pretty soon they can\u2019t pay it and they are faced with selling the house (which is worth less than their loan \u2014-> bankrupt) or go on an interest only product after intervention from the bank. Interest only means you aren\u2019t paying down the capital at all which means you can\u2019t stop working. Which leads to an even greater issue\u2026 if unemployment doubles and people can\u2019t afford to pay even the interest on their mortgage (due to being unemployed) then they lose their house.\n\nUltimately, the unfortunate truth is that people will have their houses repossessed in hugely increased numbers over the next 2-3 years and the people who are most likely to suffer that fate are people who bought a house during the last year or so with a high LtV and agreed a price well over the lender valuation. \n\nI can\u2019t agree with the Redditor above who seems to think that it\u2019s their own fault for not thinking of the risks but there is some truth in the statement. No matter how crazy the market is, ignoring the lender\u2019s valuation and people well above asking price is what will end up being the crucial error for a lot of people.
