A voting member on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, Bullard delivered remarks centered on a rules-based approach to policymaking. Using standards set by Stanford economics professor John Taylor, Bullard insisted that the moves the Fed has made so far are insufficient. Even using assumptions he characterized as \u201cgenerous\u201d regarding the progress the Fed has made so far in its inflation fight, he noted in a series of slides that \u201cthe policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.\u201d \u201cTo attain a sufficiently restrictive level, the policy rate will need to be increased further,\u201d he added in the presentation.\n\nThere\u2019s little if any dissent on the Fed over whether rates need to continue to rise. Most members have suggested a few more increases over the next several months that will take the central bank\u2019s benchmark overnight borrowing rate to around 5% from its current target range of 3.75%-4%. However, Bullard\u2019s presentation argued that 5% could serve as the low range for the where the funds rate needs to be, and that upper bound could be closer to 7%. That is well out of sync with current market pricing, which also sees the fed funds rate topping out around 5%. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/feds-bullard-says-rate-hikes-have-had-only-limited-effects-on-inflation-so-far.html", "id": "yxqd7u", "created_utc": 1668691943.0, "score": 1418, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 319, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m not sure what growth you\u2019re referring, but economic growth is often deflationary. Population growth and increased demand is inflationary and can drive a lot of economic growth, but at the same time, there were a lot of breakthroughs in technology and economies of scale that were offsetting that upward price pressure. \n\n2. There\u2019s a lot more in common between the inflation today and the inflation following WW2 then you realize, and in my opinion, more so than the inflation of the 70s/80s. To finance WW2, the government had to raise an insane amount of debt, and on a relative scale was much more than during the pandemic. They did this by issuing bonds with the help of the Fed. The Fed bought up a lot of these bonds and held rates at near zero to make this cheaper for the Treasury. While the Fed was increasing the money supply, wartime policies were suppressing a lot of consumer demand. The war destroyed a lot of critical infrastructure and supply chains, so that when the war ended, you had the perfect storm of pent up demand being released from the soldiers returning home and restrictions being lifted (similar to the world reopening following Covid), supply chains severely distrusted (like Covid), and easy monetary policy to fund the war/stimulate the economy.
