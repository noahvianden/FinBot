{"title": "$ASTS DUE DILIGENCE | HUGE LONG TERM POTENTIAL | DECENT SHORT TERM POTENTIAL", "selftext": "Hello everyone.  \n\n\nI'll cut to the chase.  \n100x by 2030.  \n2x by May 2023.  \n\n\nLets start.\n\n# BREAKDOWN\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WHO \u2013** Avellan Space Technology and Science.  \n \n\n**WHAT \u2013** Building satellites that can connect to unmodified cellphones and other IoT devices.  \n \n\n**WHERE \u2013** Technology is being developed in Midland Texas but services will be available all over the world where regulators permit.  \n \n\n**WHY \u2013** Cell towers are profitable for population-dense areas, many places do not have enough population density or infrastructure for cell towers.  \n \n\n**HOW \u2013** ASTS satellites will operate as relays or cell towers in space.  \n\n\n# RISKS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Technology does not work - If ASTS Blue Walker 3 (BW3) final demonstration satellite fails to unfurl or connect to devices on the ground then the company will be in deep trouble because they wont be able to test their technology.\n2. Unfurling of the satellite - Expected to unfurl around the 10th of November. If the satellite fails to unfurl then the technology cannot be tested.\n3. Backhaul antennas do not work as intended - Technology cannot be tested.\n4. Funding runs out - I'll get into this later.\n5. Low level competitors - Oneweb, Project Kuiper, Iridium etc. They all need dishes or special equipment and will not be able to provide the level of service ASTS will be capable off and therefore they are not a concern.\n6. High level competitors - Starlink (NOT SPACEX), Apple, lynk etc. They are planning to do something somewhat similar but they claim that their technology will only be capable of doing text messages and perhaps voice calls in the future.\n7. Regulatory risks - Sorted out by ASTS partners, the MNOs (Mobile Network Operators).\n8. Legal battle risks - ASTS has a patent moat and there's been an increase in the amount of competitors joining the race. Patents are insured by lloyds of london.\n9. Newly signed MNOs do not have exclusive MoUs.  \n\n\n# STRENTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. First mover advantage.\n2. 2400 patent and patent claim moat.\n3. Expert Board of Directors.\n4. Cult-like investor following.\n5. 1.8B+ potential subscribers under MNO MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding).\n6. High margin business - Expected margins expected to be 90-95%.\n7. No need to own spectrum - Spectrum is super expensive.\n8. Bigger satellites than the competition - Physics dictate that better = better if you want to connect to normal phones on the groun.\n9. \\~25 MNO partners - Competitors dont have this.\n10. Classified mission upon completion of commercial testing of BW3 (Private DD suggests defense use case).\n11. 50/50 Revenue split - MNOs do the billing, customer acquisition etc. ASTS just sells bandwidth with a wholesaler model. \n\n   10. BW3/ BB1-5/ BB6+/Starlink Gen 2 sizes in meters.  \n7x9/7x9/20x17.8/5x5  \n\nOkay so we've got facts, now lets get some analysis done.  \n\n\nIf the technology doesnt work then ASTS should have enough funds to launch its Blue Bird satellite and conduct some testing on that.  \n\n\nThe satellite is partially unfurled already and that unfurling happened when some very specific factors all happened at the same time. Namely a spy satellite within range of the BW3 satellite, over a gateway among some other factors.  \n\n\nBackhaul antennas look like they use a motor or servo so there shouldn't be any issue with them.  \n\n\nFunding runs out - I WILL GET TO THIS LATER I PROMISE.  \n\n\nThe competitors - Starlink is a competitor to traditional MNOs which makes it unlikely for them to receive many partnerships, they need partnerships for the spectrum.  \nApple has a deal with GSAT for an emergency text service but apple can't face MNOs head on because the MNOs will promote android instead.  \nLynk - poor and crap but their satellites connected to phones on the ground. They wont be able to compete against ASTS once ASTS is up.  \n\n\nASTS has a first mover advantage in this space. Their satellite is in space.  \nHuge patent and patent claim moat, this is a roadblock to those competitors.\n\nTheir board of directors, I cant post images but there is an infographic that really shows it well.\n\nCult like investors - Check your twitter and the ASTS subreddit if you dont believe me.\n\nLots of **potential** subscribers under the MoUs. Important thing to note is that a lot of potential customers aren't subscribers because there is no coverage where they live. It will take time to get those customers signed up and using the service.   \nNot all potential subscribers will sign up for the service, primarily those that live in cities.\n\nMNOs have to buy spectrum so ASTS wont need to.\n\n  \n\n\n# FUNDING\n\nASTS has around 200m in cash, is burning around 40m per quarter and expects to pay \\~16m per satellite.  \nThey need 20 satellites to finish their phase 1 constellation.  \nI estimate that they need 400-500m in financing.  \n\n\nBelow is separate DD I conducted into ASTS financing which was specifically written for people currently invested in ASTS  \nQ2 ER part of a transcript below.\n\n*Griffin, Scott here. I'll take that one. So I think first off,* ***we continue to believe that we qualify under a prospective 5G for America FCC fund****. Details on that have not been released, but still in process, but we continue to believe that we qualify for that based on the rule making from a little while ago, and that's an opportunity for us for sure.* ***And globally, there are similar types of funding available****. We haven't talked about those specifically. But generally speaking, I'd say our message and our story has been pretty well received. And there are -- apart from grants, there's also* ***government-supported debt that's available.*** *And so I think* ***our story continues to resonate well with governments, with regulators.*** *And importantly, as we get closer and closer to a launch, and we delivered a satellite to Cape Canaveral, seeing that satellite,* ***seeing the tangible milestone has been very powerful with a lot of different audiences.*** *But we continue to believe we qualify for that prospective FCC fund, but we're in a wait mode there.*  \n\n\n 1. Management believes they qualify for the FCC rural 5G fund. I'm not sure when we will receive information whether ASTS will be awarded any funds from that.   \n 2. Globally there are similar types of funding and interestingly enough ASTS has offices all around the world including within the EU. I'll be nice though and assume we dont win any funding or grants.  \n\n3. Government supported debt. There is debt available.  My guess is as good as yours but I assume this debt depending on the interest rate will be available if BW3 is a success. \n\n 4. ASTS story resonates well with governments and regulators (plural). Remember this is cutting/bleeding edge technology. ASTS needs to prove themselves.\n\n 5. Stakeholders want to see BW3 work, they want tangible results. Why bother with more risk when you can get less risk? Why help ASTS when they still have to prove their tech works when you can just wait to see the tech working. \n\n 6. Updated S-3. If ASTS was planning on diluting to finance the first phase of their constellation then why bother filing a new S-3 which gives the company significantly more flexibility when it comes to funding? \n\n 7. Dilution hurts Abel more than anyone. Dilution hurts the CFO making these decisions re: financing. Nobody in the company wants dilution.  \n\n8. Strategic investors/MNOs. AT&T's CEO has stated that they believe they're ahead of all competitors. I'm not sure if he meant  Whether it is just the technology that is taking them ahead or if they're completely ahead in the sense that they believe they will be first to market but it is still important. \n\n 9. Multiple ASTS MNO partners have started selling of tower assets. Perhaps this is being used to pay down their own debts or perhaps some of it will be available to ASTS. Remember that those companies have to do what is best for their investors. \n\n 10. It is in the best interests of the MNOs partnered with ASTS to ensure that ASTS survives. If ASTS is making 5B then that means the MNOs are also making 5B, this is not chump change.   \n\n11. Some MNOs have great views on how the technology is progressing.  If those MNOs who have engineers helping ASTS, those same MNOs that will be conducting testing WITH ASTS dont believe the tech will work then it was all a pipe dream. But we don't believe that because we have no reason to. \n\nSo my message to all those who are worried about dilution, take a chill pill. If the company does dilute, my estimates put dilution at 15-50% of the current float.  50% of a 100x is a 66.67x. Does that sound like a good deal to you? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is honestly so much more information but I cant fit it all in here.  \nI have a link to much more comprehensive DD.  \n\n\nAlternatively feel free to simply ask a question and I'll do my best to answer it.  \n\n\nTo those who think it's too risky to invest in ASTS.  \nCome back in April, by then testing should be complete and financing secured.  \n\n\nPositions:  \n85x 2024 25C.  \n554 Warrants.  \n0 Commons.", "id": "ynm4yx", "created_utc": 1667729002.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "I stopped reading after \u201c100x by 2030\u201d", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "That's 100x more than I read", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.554129958152771}, {"body": "Same.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16484421491622925}, {"body": "I bet something like AAPL scares you?

{"title": "Meta stock analysis and valuation - Is Michael Burry right?", "selftext": "This week's casual valuation is Meta (formerly known as Facebook), a company that's down almost 50% over the last 5 years and over 75% since its all-time high back in September 2021.\n\nAs always, this post is not financial/investment advice, it is purely for educational/entertainment purposes. It is divided into a few segments:\n\n1. What is Meta?\n2. How to value Meta?\n3. Historical financial performance and assumptions about the future\n4. Valuation\n5. Is Reality Labs that bad?\n6. The different scenarios\n\n**What is Meta?**\n\nMeta doesn't really need any introduction, everyone knows their main products (Facebook/Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp), but what caused the decline in recent years is the change of their vision from these apps (that are known as \"Family of Apps\") to the metaverse idea (known as \"Reality Labs\").\n\n**How to value Meta?**\n\nSince one of the goals of this post is to value Meta, the question is, how to value these two operating segments?\n\nThe \"Family of Apps\" is the cash-generating machine, and there's a decade of financial data available to understand how it has performed when it comes to revenue and operating margin.\n\nHowever, the second part is what brings the uncertainty in here. Regardless of the model used to value the \"Reality Labs\", the inputs/variables are too uncertain to create anything that's reasonable.\n\nFor that reason, I decided to take a different approach. I'll value the mature segment, the \"Family of Apps\" and compare that with the current market cap to understand what the market thinks of the metaverse and how much it prices it at.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, let's get started!\n\n**Historical financial performance & assumptions about the future**\n\nOver the last 5 years, the \"Family of Apps\" grew revenue over 100% to over $115b for the last twelve months (ending September 2022). The operating margin of over 40% has been nothing but impressive.\n\nLooking at the analysts' forecasts, they're expecting the revenue to grow around 5% during 2023 and over 10% during 2024. I find these numbers a bit optimistic taking into account the environment in which the company operates today with the economic uncertainty. As a business that makes money from advertising, it is difficult to expect that the advertising budgets of the companies will not be cut during this period.\n\nHowever, looking 10 years ahead, I can also not imagine that this segment isn't generating more cash than it is today. So, in my assumptions, I'm using a growth rate of 3%, which leads to 34% revenue growth 10 years from now, which I don't think is too high.\n\nWhen it comes to the margins, I'm using the 40% operating margin. Of course, the operating margin of Meta today won't match with the 40% margin as the reality labs segment is a money-losing segment with lots of R&D being poured in.\n\nUsing a discount rate of 11.5% today (decreasing to 10.6% over time), the intrinsic value of \"Family of Apps\" is around **$417b**.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nNow, what's on the balance sheet (cash/debt) together with the outstanding equity options is worth -$1b, which brings the value of Meta to **$416b** if all they had was the cash-generating machine \"Family of Apps\".\n\nBut there's one more thing to consider. Having two classes of shares gives Mark Zuckerberg the majority voting rights (close to 60%), hence, a discount for lack of control should be applied.\n\nIf the discount is 15%, then the intrinsic value decreases to **$354b**.\n\nThe current market cap is $240b, so basically, the market believes the metaverse is going to destroy over $100b of value over time and doesn't believe Zuckerberg's big idea.\n\nIs something going to change, is he going to change the path? I'll share a tweet from Professor Damodaran:\n\n\"If you invest in a company with dual-class shares, be a realist about what you can and cannot change. Investing in Facebook & complaining that Zuckerberg won't listen to you is like marrying a Kardashian & whining about your privacy being invaded.\"\n\n**So, what can be done?**\n\nWell, the significant share price decline provides an answer that the option always available to the shareholders is to sell their Meta shares, and many of them did exercise this option.\n\n**Is Reality labs that bad?**\n\nThis is a question that will be answered a decade from now.\n\nMark Zuckerberg has said that this segment would contribute a lot to the company's profits in the 2030s. That's a decade from now. Until then, it will consume a significant portion of the cash generated by the \"Family of Apps\".\n\nSo, the company has been reclassified from a cash-generating machine to a company that pours lots of money into something that might work in the next decade. This uncertainty combined with the power of Zuckerberg to steer the company pushed the price down significantly.\n\nSince 2019, **over $36b** have been invested in this new segment.\n\n**The Michael Burry tweet**\n\nThe great big short investor has been right on many occasions, and wrong on probably just as many.\n\nOne of his tweets was, \"Seems Meta has a New Coke problem.\". As always, soon after the tweet was posted, it was deleted.\n\nI wasn't familiar with this, but after some research, I stumbled upon an article that helped me understand what this means.\n\nBack in April 23rd, 1985, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola stepped before the press introducing a new formula, which was \"smoother, rounder, yet bolder - a more harmonious flavour\". Turns out, this new formula tasted more like Pepsi.\n\nWhat followed was 5,000 angry phone calls  per day within weeks, increasing to over 8,000 by June the same year.\n\nThis means Michael Burry believes that Meta's new vision/strategy is not the best way forward. If it ain't broken, don't fix it.\n\nCould he be wrong? Absolutely!\n\nThere's no certainty when it comes to the value of Reality Labs. The question is, is the \"Reality Labs\" fairly priced today at negative $100b or not.\n\n**The different scenarios**\n\nWhat if Michael Burry is right? - If he is right, the question is how long it would take before Mark Zuckerberg pulls the plug. Is the \"Reality Labs\" going to destroy $100b or maybe even more? If the company raises funds to pour even more into the metaverse and turns out to be a failure, Meta could go down significantly even from this low point.\n\nWhat if Mark Zuckerberg is right? - If he's right and Reality Labs is contributing a significant portion of the profits a decade from now, that means Meta is undervalued today.\n\nAs for me, I have 1 share in Meta, just to be entertained by what's coming next.", "id": "ynuo2k", "created_utc": 1667751807.0, "score": 387, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 345, "comments": [{"body": "I think the \"Metaverse\" sentiment is whats killing the stock.

As OP pointed out, the FoA segment is -by all metrics- deeply undervalued. But, If Zuckerberg wants to keep spending on Reality labs, there\u2019s nothing an activist -or any common shareholder- can do about it.
