Improved the architecture for better accuracy and latency, higher recall of far away vehicles, lower velocity error of crossing vehicles by 20%, and improved VRU precision by 20%.\n-\tConverted the VRU Velocity network to a two-stage network, which reduced latency and improved crossing pedestrian velocity error by 6%.\n-\tConverted the NonVRU Attributes network to a two-stage network, which reduced latency, reduced incorrect lane assignment of crossing vehicles by 45%, and reduced incorrect parked predictions by 15%.\n-\tReformulated the autoregressive Vector Lanes grammar to improve precision of lanes by 9.2%, recall of lanes by 18.7%, and recall of forks by 51.1%. Includes a full network update where all components were re-trained with 3.8x the amount of data.\n-\tAdded a new \u201croad markings\u201d module to the Vector Lanes neural network which improves lane topology error at intersections by 38.9%.\n-\tUpgraded the Occupancy Network to align with road surface instead of ego for improved detection stability and improved recall at hill crest.\n-\tReduced runtime of candidate trajectory generation by approximately 80% and improved smoothness by distilling an expensive trajectory optimization procedure into a lightweight planner neural network.\n-\tImproved decision making for short deadline lane changes around gores by richer modeling of the trade-off between going off-route vs trajectory required to drive through the gore region\n-\tReduced false slowdowns for pedestrians near crosswalk by using a better model for the kinematics of the pedestrian\n-\tAdded control for more precise object geometry as detected by general occupancy network.\n-\tImproved control for vehicles cutting out of our desired path by better modeling of their turning / lateral maneuvers thus avoiding unnatural slowdowns\n-\tImproved longitudinal control while offsetting around static obstacles by searching over feasible vehicle motion profiles\n-\tImproved longitudinal control smoothness for in-lane vehicles during high relative velocity scenarios by also considering relative acceleration in the trajectory optimization\n-\tReduced best case object photon-to-control system latency by 26% through adaptive planner scheduling, restructuring of trajectory selection, and parallelizing perception compute.

I don\u2019t see why they couldn\u2019t simply skip the demosaicing part of the ISP on the camera module and therefore providing an additional clear sub pixel to their neural network instead of compressing it down to RGB.\n\nIn fact they specifically mention this in the 2022 AI day talk: https://youtu.be/ODSJsviD_SU @ 1:14:00.\n\nI only have a very limited knowledge on the cameras, image sensors, and image processing.

So this type of release notes looks very amateur.\n\n1) It's not photon count. Each detector (pixel) converts a photon to an electron, but it has a certain efficiency. For most cases and wavelengths this is below 70% efficiency. So it's not photo count. It's electron count, and only a fraction of the photons. Not only that, each pixel has a color filter on top, so it's electron count  for that wavelength\n\n2) To simplify further discussion, Bayer patterns or RCCG or any others are called CFA, Color Filter Array.\n\n3) They don't need to demosaic. But at least have an algorithm which is CFA-sensitive! We do that often for defective pixel detection. We don't need to demosaic, but we need to be aware of the CFA\n\n4) If you don't demosaic, a green pixel targeting a green car will have lots of signal, while the nearby red pixel will have almost none. How can you combine them? The image would look like a car full of holes! That's not good for the NN!\n\nAnd when the car moves relative to the camera, those \"holes\" move around!\n\n5) Demosaic is still needed for color-aware NN, like traffic lights\n\n6) They know what they are doing, but my criticism is that they probably didn't, a year ago, until Elon started talking about \"photon count\"\n\n7) imaging and NN scientists work with the images from datasets. Never met one that directly calibrates raw images. Therefore it's quite possible most of them just accepted the 10bit RGB images from the camera and never questioned it. Until latency became an issue and they tried to tackle the bottleneck. We actually did this with a camera manufacturer many years ago, we had our own custom calibration on camera, to skip the demosaic, to increase FPS for a very specific use case.\n\nRAW bandwidth @ 10bit = 10 bit per pixel\n\nRGB bandwidth @ 10bit = 30 bit per pixel\n\nSo you can save on bandwidth, increase the FPS, at the expense of more processing power.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Join the Tesla team.
