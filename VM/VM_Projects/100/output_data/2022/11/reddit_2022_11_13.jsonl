{"title": "I\u2019m I disconnected? Quick $TSLA DD", "selftext": "TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, they are an outlier within the auto manufacturers and with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.\n\n*Short term noise*\n\n$TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. \n\nThe twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it\u2019s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. Yes the stock would suffer, but the company would only be effected by Elon not being in the picture as a major shareholder. \n\nElon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it\u2019s stress maybe he\u2019s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I\u2019ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that\u2019s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m debating here. \n\n*\u201dDD\u201d*\n\nTesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. \n\nSo Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I\u2019m sure some of you could say otherwise. \n\nTesla is a car company, but it\u2019s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That\u2019s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don\u2019t look like a car maker. \n\nPeople love to talk about build quality. Clearly it\u2019s not effecting sales but regardless it\u2019s getting better and it\u2019s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you\u2019re delusional, it\u2019s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. \n\nCheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from \u201cluxury\u201d but it\u2019s durable and practical. For $50k it\u2019s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it\u2019s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don\u2019t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. \n\nFord has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. \n\nVW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They\u2019re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we\u2019ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. \n\nTesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. \u201cSome years will be a little less some will be a little more.\u201d Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. \n\nSo the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. \n\nThe economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don\u2019t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won\u2019t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it\u2019s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who\u2019s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.\n\nChina is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They\u2019re moving into Europe, I don\u2019t see them moving to North American markets soon. It\u2019s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they\u2019re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I\u2019d buy their stock if they weren\u2019t IOUs from the CCP. \n\nI haven\u2019t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn\u2019t include  FSD because it\u2019s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don\u2019t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. \n\nI feel that people are overly negative towards the stock now specifically because it\u2019s down. There\u2019s blood in the streets and people are panicking, and blaming the stock when to me it seems to just be short term noise. I could see the stock hitting ~$150 but I couldn\u2019t see it falling much more than that in the near term, the company is just doing to well for that imo. \n\nPosition 33.69 shares (ik I\u2019m poor).\n\n$TSLA @ $180 as of today", "id": "yuijvd", "created_utc": 1668382508.0, "score": 201, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "You've summed up my thoughts very well.

Superb job.\n\nI'll add my own insight:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Short-term, Twitter is annoying. Long-term, Tesla's financials will be too difficult to ignore and Twitter will be just a side hustle for Musk. Who really cares about Twitter if Tesla is cashing in on $15 billion in non-GAAP net income next year? I personally do believe Musk can flip Twitter around and eventually be profitable. If properly executed, there is massive potential with Twitter. \n2. Tesla is in good hands. Tesla needed Musk during the Model 3 ramp. Now? Not so much. He's going to be there to make the big decisions but in terms of the day-to-day operations, there's not much Musk can do. Spending more time doesn't necessarily mean it will lead to positive change. Tesla can operate with/without Musk being involved with every part of the business. \n3. Tesla is prime to be the #1 most profitable automaker in the U.S. by the end of this fiscal year. Next year, I give them a high likelihood of being the #1 profitable automaker in the world. Pretty impressive stuff when you consider that just five years ago, they were on the verge of bankruptcy. How many companies go from near bankruptcy to being the most profitable in their respective industry within 5-6 years?\n4. Tesla Cybertruck will spark Tesla's brand value once again. IMO, a new vehicle will spice things up and bring that excitement again. Cybertruck, if we are to believe the expected specs, will be a monstrous debut and prove that Tesla is just on another level. Some will hate it, but that's fine. IMO, the Cybertruck will be the most interesting vehicle in quite some time.\n5. The IRA tax credit will help Tesla significantly because they are the only auto company in the U.S. that can create enough vehicles to match the demand and maximize those credits. Since they've long exceeded the original EV tax credit, it is back on the books for Tesla and should be positive news. I do think GM/Ford pressured the U.S. government to help subsidize their losses in regard to this EV credit but at least it helps boost U.S. auto-manufacturing and battery factories.\n6. If FSD ever gets released fully, it's checkmate! I'm still skeptical it can be done without government approval constantly shooting them down but seriously, the average American drives around 90 minutes per day. That's 630 minutes per week. I'm pretty sure there are a ton of people who would gladly pay for FSD to save 630 minutes of their time every week. Some probably drive two hours per day stuck in traffic. The amount of value they can get with FSD and being more productive instead of sitting in traffic is way worth the cost. \n7. Tesla energy has huge potential but I don't think we'll be seeing huge growth and profitability in the short-term because EV's are their #1 focus and it makes more sense to prioritize your strengths at this point for Tesla. \n8. BYD is no doubt a huge player in this EV equation. People will try to downplay it here but they are quickly growing and are not afraid to take Tesla head-on.

I wonder where Tesla's new EV factory will be in. If they announce it soon, it will be a huge boost for Tesla shares as it will signal that Tesla sees continued demand and want to capture that ASAP. If no new factories are announced soon, it could mean Tesla expects some whirlwinds and might want to pause on a new factory. Which new locations are we thinking?\n10. With Tesla opening up their supercharging network by planning to be the standard connector, the U.S. government should quickly adopt this if they actually cared about expanding EV adoption. $7.5 billion is going towards charging stations and they want them to be standardized. Tesla dominates the charging network and their charging stations actually work. Other automakers fell asleep and let Tesla get the first-mover advantage with their supercharging network. The U.S. government should mandate it. Never mind the fact that Tesla's ultimate goal is to energize the majority of their supercharging stations with solar power on battery packs, they were the only automaker willing to take EV's seriously.
