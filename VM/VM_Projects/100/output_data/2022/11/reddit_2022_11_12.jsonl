The only notice change for insurance is this:\n\n>Health insurance retained earnings source changes Starting with April 2021 data, the health insurance index will stop using data from a national nonprofit health insurance carrier as part of its retained earnings calculation. Instead, the retained earnings will be calculated using data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and the California Department of Managed Healthcare only.

{"title": "Tesla officially makes its charging standard available to other companies in the U.S.", "selftext": "Tesla is sharing its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America.\n\nTesla said in a blog post Friday that its design and specification files are available for download. The company said it is \u201cactively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Tesla\u2019s charging connector as a public standard.\u201d\n\nThe charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.\n\nTesla claims that its charging connector and charge port \u2014 which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS) \u2014 is the most common charging standard in North America. It\u2019s a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger stations in the United States. Each station has an average of nine chargers.\n\nTesla didn\u2019t name any automakers or charging infrastructure companies as converts. In this highly competitive environment, in which virtually every automaker is now using the CCS, it\u2019s hard to see GM, Ford and Stellantis switching to Tesla\u2019s technology.\n\nHowever, at least one company \u2014 EV startup Aptera \u2014 supports the move. Earlier this year, Aptera called for the U.S. government to adopt Tesla\u2019s Supercharger technology as the standard for all EV charging in the country. And EVGo has added Tesla connectors to some of its charging stations in the United States.\n\nThe company said in the blog post that network operators \u201calready have plans in motion\u201d to incorporate NACS at their chargers. If network providers like ChargePoint, EVConnect or Electrify America add NACS, it would allow Tesla owners to charge at these stations without a need for an adapter.\n\nIf automakers switch to NACS on its EVs, it would give owners of those vehicles access to Tesla\u2019s North American Supercharging and destination charging networks. \n\nSource:  https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/tesla-opens-its-ev-connector-design-to-other-automakers/", "id": "ytlgev", "created_utc": 1668295064.0, "score": 2082, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 311, "comments": [{"body": "If the past is any indication the entire world will settle in a standard and the US will have a totally different, incompatible one.", "score": 892, "replies": [{"body": "They already have.

I see you guys posting some serious gains a lot of the time and wanted to know what everyone thinks. I was reading an article this morning about META being at a historically low price in terms of value. I just want to know, do you guys think its time to start looking to deploy capital into some of these great stocks that are down 80-90%? Or do you think that things will keep on falling.\n\nI'm making this post to try and have a \"civil\" discussion on where we think the overall market is headed in the near term. Lets say one years time. Is it too early to start looking for these potential great opportunities in the market or is the time now. I know last week the inflation report came out lower then expected, but Its still very high compared to the historic average. That got me wondering if it was just a rally because we havent seen any form of good news in so long that even half good half bad news is enough to cause a significant rally? Anyways when im talking about opportunities, im referring to stuff like they outlined in this article I read this morning, basically it was showing that some stocks are at ridiculously low levels compared to value. The example used was META, its trading at the same price as in 2015 but now its doing $27B in revenue compared to $4B and the EPS in like 5X or 6X higher. I can drop the link to the article I guess, but im really here to discuss the future of the market.

Both companies had a little negative sentiment, but have turned it around. They operate in a growing industry. Sometimes, growth is more important then value. I look at a variety of things before investing in a company, but you should ask plenty of questions. If a stock is trading at a discount there\u2019s probably a good reason for this and you should tread with caution. Investing in a company that looses money may seem crazy, but that\u2019s where the returns are. Do they operate in a growing industry? Do they have physical assets to sell in emergency? How\u2019s there management team? How competent are they? When\u2019s the company expected to be profitable? Is there insider buying taking place? How\u2019s cash flow? What\u2019s the future of the industry? Who\u2019s their competitors? How does inflation impact their business model? Are they efficient? Are they maximizing equipment, employees and time? Do they have lawsuits? How long do employees work for the company? What\u2019s the industry average? What\u2019s their debt to equity ratio? What\u2019s their EV/EBITDA. Do they have a history of dilution? What\u2019s their corporate debt rating? If you can answer questions like these you can become a value/growth investor.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0036204494535923004}], "tickers": ["meta", "inflation"]}
