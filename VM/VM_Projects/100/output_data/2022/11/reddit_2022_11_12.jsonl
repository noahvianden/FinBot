The only notice change for insurance is this:\n\n>Health insurance retained earnings source changes Starting with April 2021 data, the health insurance index will stop using data from a national nonprofit health insurance carrier as part of its retained earnings calculation. Instead, the retained earnings will be calculated using data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and the California Department of Managed Healthcare only.
