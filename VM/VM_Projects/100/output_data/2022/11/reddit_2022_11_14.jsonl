Love you all, and wish you all the best. For everyone asking what my next moves are here it is:\n\nAs of right now, I believe the bear market rally is coming to an end. Maybe there is a bit more upside, but I don't want to miss the downside. I personally like the risk-to-reward here.\n\nTA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200 day SMA SPY,  FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \\~3490, sentiment etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally. Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on.\n\nI am short \n\nNFLX\n\nCMG\n\nGS\n\nMy only long position is $ASTS right now, which I trimmed today bigly.\n\n**But be aware, I will scale in and out of these short positions on a whim.

Your losses can be infinite, while your gains are capped at 100% (unless using leverage). Good luck my fellow brethren.\n\n[Largest accounts 1 & 2. Took profits like I said I would on $ASTS.

{"title": "Amazon Is Said to Plan to Lay Off Thousands of Employees this week", "selftext": "The job cuts of approximately 10,000, which would start as soon as this week, would focus on the company\u2019s devices organization, retail division and human resources.\n\nAmazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, people with knowledge of the matter said, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company\u2019s history.\n\nThe cuts will focus on Amazon\u2019s devices organization, including the voice-assistant Alexa, as well as at its retail division and in human resources, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe total number of layoffs remains fluid. But if it stays around 10,000, that would represent roughly 3 percent of Amazon\u2019s corporate employees and less than 1 percent of its global work force of more than 1.5 million, which is primarily composed of hourly workers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s planned retrenchment during the critical holiday shopping season \u2014 when the company typically has valued stability \u2014 shows how quickly the souring global economy has put pressure on it to trim businesses that have been overstaffed or underdelivering for years.\n\nAmazon would also become the latest technology company to lay off workers, which only recently it had been fighting to retain. Earlier this year, the e-commerce giant more than doubled the cap on cash compensation for its tech workers, citing \u201ca particularly competitive labor market.\u201d\n\nChanging business models and the precarious economy have set off layoffs across the tech industry. Elon Musk halved Twitter\u2019s head count this month after buying the company, and last week, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced it was laying off 11,000 employees, about 13 percent of its work force. Lyft, Stripe, Snap and other tech firms have also laid off workers in recent months.\n\nBrad Glasser, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nThe pandemic produced Amazon\u2019s most profitable era on record, as consumers flocked to online shopping and companies to its cloud computing services. Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.\n\nBut earlier this year, Amazon\u2019s growth slowed to the lowest rate in two decades, as the bullwhip of the pandemic snapped. The company faced high costs from decisions to overinvest and rapidly expand, while changes in shopping habits and high inflation dented sales.\n\nAmazon experienced a slight rebound in its latest quarter. But it has cautioned investors that growth could weaken again, possibly falling to its lowest pace since 2001.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nWhat We Learned From Week 10 in the N.F.L.\n\nThe Anatomy of a Panic Attack\n\nGiorgia Meloni and the Politics of Power Dressing\nThe company has told Wall Street that it has tightened its belt in the past and can do so again. Last week, Amazon executives met with institutional investors, according to three people, just as its stock sank to its lowest level since the early days of the pandemic, erasing $1 trillion in value since Andy Jassy took over as chief executive last year.\n\nMr. Jassy, who previously ran Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business, has been closely scrutinizing businesses to trim costs quickly. He initially pulled back on a warehouse expansion that was supercharged during the pandemic, then moved to other parts of the company.\n\nIn recent months, Amazon has also closed or pared back a smattering of initiatives, including Amazon Care, its service providing primary and urgent health care that failed to find enough customers; Scout, the cooler-size home delivery robot, that employed 400 people, according to Bloomberg; and Fabric.com, a subsidiary that sold sewing supplies for three decades.\n\nFrom April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.\n\nAmazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.\n\nThat news came so suddenly that recruiters did not receive talking points for job candidates until almost a week later, according to a copy of the talking points seen by The New York Times.\n\nDevices and Alexa have long been seen internally as at risk for cuts. Alexa and related devices rocketed to a top company priority as Amazon raced to create the leading voice assistant, which leaders thought could succeed mobile phones as the next essential consumer interface. From 2017 to 2018, Amazon doubled staff on Alexa and Echo devices to 10,000 engineers. At one point, any engineer getting a job offer for other Amazon roles was supposed to also get an offer from Alexa.\n\nThe company has sold hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices. But Amazon has said the products are often low margin and other potential revenue sources such as voice shopping have not caught on.\n\nIn 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.\n\nAmazon\u2019s retail business, which covers its physical and online retail business and its logistics operations, has been under strain after the surge of demand and breakneck expansion during the pandemic. The company has said it has pulled back expansion plans, and has told investors it sees uncertainty with consumers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re realistic that there\u2019s various factors weighing on people\u2019s wallets,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the finance chief, told investors last month. He said the company was unsure where spending was heading, but \u201cwe\u2019re ready for a variety of outcomes.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/technology/amazon-layoffs.html", "id": "yv3n9a", "created_utc": 1668441635.0, "score": 1113, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 271, "comments": [{"body": "10000 is 3% of corporate workforce? 3%?", "score": 351, "replies": [{"body": "The headcount may be small as a %, but most of these roles look like higher paid \"corporate\" heads so the savings will be much larger.", "score": 230, "replies": [{"body": "Because the minimum wage jobs are plenty and they can bring those in almost in a week or two.", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "People already quit the low paying jobs quickly enough, they would just need to not re-post openings.", "score": 29, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5134752988815308}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28001824021339417}, {"body": "Calm down.
