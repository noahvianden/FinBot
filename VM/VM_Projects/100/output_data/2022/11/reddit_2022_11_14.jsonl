Love you all, and wish you all the best. For everyone asking what my next moves are here it is:\n\nAs of right now, I believe the bear market rally is coming to an end. Maybe there is a bit more upside, but I don't want to miss the downside. I personally like the risk-to-reward here.\n\nTA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200 day SMA SPY,  FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \\~3490, sentiment etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally. Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on.\n\nI am short \n\nNFLX\n\nCMG\n\nGS\n\nMy only long position is $ASTS right now, which I trimmed today bigly.\n\n**But be aware, I will scale in and out of these short positions on a whim.

Your losses can be infinite, while your gains are capped at 100% (unless using leverage). Good luck my fellow brethren.\n\n[Largest accounts 1 & 2. Took profits like I said I would on $ASTS.
