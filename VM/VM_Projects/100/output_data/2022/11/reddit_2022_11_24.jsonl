{"title": "There won't be any big decline", "selftext": "It's been months that people are forecasting a big decline in the stock market but it hasn't happened and it won't happen in the future with the FED slowing the hiking of interest rates.\n\nIn the last 6 months the Dow Jones is up over 7%, the S&P is up 1,35% and the Nasdaq is down 2%. All this amid one of the fastest interest rates increase in the last century, trade war with China and lockdowns, war in Ukraine, energy crisis, quantitative tightening, crypto crash, inflation crisis and strong dollar that caused headwinds for almost all companies. If all that didn't tank the market in the last 6 months, nothing will. If you think a mild recession in the US will cause the stock market to drop hugely from this level you're delusional because we already know a recession will happen and it will be counterbalanced by the FED pausing the hiking of interest rates and maybe China reopening.\n\nWe're seeing that the job market is still strong and as long as people are getting paid and have a job the demand won't collapse. The job market will cool a bit, enough to reduce inflation but we won't have massive layoffs...only some companies in the tech industry saw some big layoffs but that's because they hired way too much in the first place when the times were good. \n\nEnergy and commodities prices are also down a lot and that was the biggest contributor to inflation, the CPI will decline every month and in 2023 it will be helped by favorable comps with last (this) year.\n\nFrom now until the next quarter results I see nothing going on for the bears. The next big announcement will be the CPI in December and it will be favorable given how energy prices have collapsed. Then the FED in December will hike either 50bps or 25bps and the market will cheer by the slowing down on the increases.\n\nThis is a great time to buy if you are a long term investor", "id": "z3q1oz", "created_utc": 1669311779.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "I don't really see a big move to the upside or the downside any time soon.

Regulatory credits nowadays represents less than 10% of their profit, and it's getting smaller every quarter. It's pretty much irrelevant to their value now, although it does help their cashflow a bit. \n\n>  Maybe Tesla will be the main EV producer for the next 20 years if they bring a middle class car to market but I think they'll end up being a high end vehicle manufacturer\n\nTheir entire business model is to continue to make cheaper cars. They are currently designing a new car that will be $25-$30k, something they can mass produce for the masses. They have no intention of having expensive vehicles forever. That's an unsustainable business model. \n\nSo how is Tesla worth $500b? \n\nFirst off, to be only worth $500b, you have to assume FSD is non-existent. FSD alone is probably worth $2-$4T. It would literally change the entire world. So let's put FSD aside and assume it will literally never happen - but keep in mind, if you only give FSD a 10% chance of success, that should add $200-$400b to Tesla's valuation. \n\nA big reason why they are valued so high is their high likelihood of future profits continuing to grow at the rate they have been. \n\nTesla has literally every advantage imaginable when compared to competition. The technology, the factory, the manufacturing process, the actual tech, the vertical integration, a better supply chain. \n\nBut most importantly is they can scale faster than anyone else, and it's not even close. Conservatively, their estimated P/E for 2023 at current stock price would be in the 20s. This is extremely low. \n\nAlso keep in mind their energy business which is growing massively and is even easier to scale than their car business. \n\nThey have the highest margins in the industry. Even if they cut their prices by 10% next year - they will still make a shitload of money, since they are reducing costs significantly as they scale existing factories. \n\nCompanies like Ford won't be profitable until mid 2025 - by their own estimates. That's their base case scenario. \n\nTheir Cybertruck will make them billions and billions. Ford being 'first' is completely irrelevant. There was a battery shortage due to war/covid, so Tesla focused on their existing product. But more than that Cybertruck is designed to be made in a way where they can make them cheaply and quickly. No manufacturer will be able to make a pickup truck anywhere even close to the same price as Tesla's Cybertruck. If you look at last quarter, Tesla made $5b. That's $20b per year.

Your numbers are quite off. \n\n> Tesla energy is worth more like $2-$3 billion\n\nThat would be a P/E of 5 - 7.5... for a business that will grow even faster than their car division. This valuation makes absolutely no sense. Copy pasta below of how I got to $50b. \n\nhey had $100M in profit last quarter. They are scaling their battery production massively, and they have literally zero competition, no one is even attempting to do what they are with Megapacks and Powerwalls. They will be scaling their battery production even faster than their cars (which scale at 50% per year). Moreover, demand for their megapacks and powerwalls will remain high for years to come. They are a big part future national grid. They are a massive value for any municipality.\n\nBased on that, I give them a 100x multiple based on current revenue (again, this is because of massive exponential growth in megapack/powerwall production).\n\n$100M * 4 * 100 = $40b, ok so $40b, not $50b. But wait, they will be getting $35/kwh produced as a direct subsidy. For that, I tack on another 20%, so that's $50b.
