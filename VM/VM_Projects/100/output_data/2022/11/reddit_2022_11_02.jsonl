{"title": "Why aren\u2019t more companies give retail shareholders perks?", "selftext": "I know 3M gives giftboxes, but wonder why wouldn\u2019t Netflix gives subscription discount for say, someone who has 100 shares or more Netflix? Is this more of a tracking / verification issue or more of a SEC regulatory issue? It seems like a no brainer for companies to do this to make their share holder feel special.\n\nEdit: Okay, so I've read a few things about why the heck a company should consider this, so hear me out. \n\nFirst of all, employees are humans and they have emotions, companies give all sort of perks, t-shirts, special discounts to employees, and they also give shares to employees, to keep them motivated, feel part of a group and community and retained in the company, and hopefully they perform and deliver increase in your share prices. And if they don't, the employee doesn't directly get punished, they could be still earning a high salary, keeping the perks but the investor suffer. META is a clear example of this. \n\nRetail investors are human beings, they have feelings, and when they support a stock they want to feel special, feel part of a community as well, so gestures that make investor, especially those who has a bigger shares or have been holding shares for a long period feels special doesn't need to cost a lot of money, but can positively affect the investor relationship, images for the company, boosting sentiment, and that goes back to the employees who's taking RSUs, so it's a win win. \n\nMy thoughts is more of a regulatory concerns, but then I looked up an found GME is basically already doing this so it's not really a concern, more of just a investor relationship strategy, and dealing with retail simply won't scale, but for big big stake holders, inviting them to investor conference and pay for their drinks and meal is probably more common than not.", "id": "yjvye2", "created_utc": 1667365029.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Ford used to offer employee pricing to shareholders with 100 shares but unfortunately ended it this year.", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "I'm wondering if Ford is having issues supplying dealerships.

I went to a Ford dealership to test drive a new white F-150 with the 4cylinder Turbo, and that damned thing was vibrating at stupidly low speeds (like maybe 1 MPH - I was just sorta mimicking what I do when driving slowly looking for potential clients).   The salesman was like \"well, that's because you're driving it too slowly.\"\n\nI told him alright, the next test was up on the highway.  He said that was not allowed, that the dealership wanted people to drive on a specific route (which were 35/45MPH roads).  I told him that if I didn't drive it on a highway at highway speeds, that I wasn't going to buy it.  He allowed me to get it up on the highway.  The damned thing vibrated even more at 55 and 65 MPH.

The issue is that the majority of consumers haven't needed to borrow much this year because of elevated savings built up during the pandemic, and on top of this over the last couple of years consumers in the US have been locking in cheap 30-year fixed-term mortgages so disposable income is also higher. Even after all these hikes consumer debt servicing ratios are still very low, [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CDSP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CDSP) and anyone with a mortgage is having a great time, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDSP\n\nSo you have a consumer with high savings, cheap fixed mortgages and next to no debt sensitivity. So in terms of the US consumer there's no meaningful direct path for rate hikes to have an effect on demand. It's not just that it takes time, I'd argue the hikes are doing practically nothing right now. Powell could raise rates to 50% tomorrow but everyone has a fixed mortgage and no other debts who cares?\n\nWhat we probably need to happen is for businesses to start to feel the pitch of rate hikes and to begin laying people off, but with the US being a consumer economy that isn't likely to happen while consumer demand is so strong. So my guess right now is that maybe early next year once we're done with the holiday season consumers might have run down their savings enough that demand will begin to slow and perhaps then we might see more job loses.\n\nMy concern in regards to rates though is that this is all artificial. It's not like demand is high because Covid and lockdowns were great for the economy. It's high because of the temporary effects of stimulus.\n\nI guess the way I'm thinking about this is that in a normal rate hiking cycle the consumer is generally strong enough to endure the increases in interest rates. Or put another way, underlying economic strength is supporting the consumer enough that they can afford to borrow at higher rates. So in theory if these rate hikes are being supported by underlying economic strength then consumers should be fine to do things like remortgage at 7% because the economy is booming, right? But of course the idea that the economy could support that is almost laughable today. Yet in the past this is exactly what would have happened - rates would go up and people would borrow at those higher rates. But no ones borrowing at these new rates today because everyone has savings and fixed mortgages.\n\nSo I guess to answer your question, sure, eventually rate hikes will quell inflation. After all some people will eventually have to move house and borrow at higher rates. Savings will eventually drop and some people might have to borrow to fix their car or pay off some other unexpected expense. Businesses will slowly burn down cash levels and have to start borrowing at higher rates. The issue today is that literally one can afford it because underlying economy isn't that strong. So when rates do eventually matter, they're probably not going to act like a speed break for demand as they normally would, they're going to act like a brick wall. It's not that people can't afford to borrow as much, they can't afford to borrow at all - and that's your hard landing.\n\nSorry this comment is really long. I just think it's interesting that the Fed isn't talking about this and is now even hinting that they think the terminal rate might need to be higher still. I don't know if they believe the economy is strong enough to support 7% mortgage rates or if at this point just want to be overly restrictive to bring inflation down at any cost, but it seems to me the rate hikes are having so little impact they probably should consider a trade off here. At least if I were Powell I'd probably be less aggressive on hikes and allow core inflation to average 3-4% for a year or two because they literally have no tools to address the underlying problem.

All further rate will do is risk breaking something in financial markets, it's not going to hurt anyone with a mortgage or the average consumer with savings to fall back on. Rates are high enough to bring down demand already imo, it's just going to take time.\n\nI think Powell needs to urge some kind of fiscal response now so he take the pressure off a bit. It would appear higher taxes would be far more effective at bringing down the current drivers of inflation, but I don't see that happening with mid-terms coming up -  especially if republicans do well.\n\nI'm also not convinced that a hard landing is any better than moderately high inflation, and increasingly this seems to be the only two options we have. I think this is even less debatable if you look beyond the US. People will quite literally die in developing countries if Powell continues to be this aggressive.\n\nPowell needs to comment on this and explain why the Fed believes further rate hikes will do anything meaningful to demand.

More in comments.", "selftext": "[Velocity of M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)\n\nJust a quick edit: [M2 Money Stock over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)\n\nu/Infamous_Sympathy_91 's [post on credit card debt and personal savings from earlier today](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yjowp1/us_personal_savings_near_historic_lows/)\n\n\nIn 2020 money stopped moving. I wrote this in some of my previous posts and comments. In order to prop up economic activity, central banks increased money supply with almost 0 interest a.k.a Brrrrrr.\n\nSo ideally fresh minted money is distributed in the real economy and moves up and trickles down and so forth. As you can see in the chart above, money hasn't been moving as much in the economy since the peak in 2000; It's in constant decline with a hard fall in 2020.\n\nToday central banks are trying to battle inflation. As you can see in the chart above, money isn't moving as much, so it's not that there is too much money in the real economy. Whatever they printed in the last 2 years went up to the big black void of finance. All the derivatives market, swaps, trenches and all sorts of made up bullshit has sucked up money faster than your wife sucking her boyfriend's cock.\n\nInflation is a product of price gauging and artificial crises, such as cutting down oil production, slowing down logistics around the globe, lagging or harsh response to the pandemic by governments etc.\n\nWhat you're seeing with the interest rate increases will only hit small businesses and working people. Casino always wins. Banks will own everything. You will own nothing at the end of this.\n\nIn the next two years, you will lose your jobs, you will lose your homes if you have debt. You will start selling your assets until capitalism owns your ass. We had reached a point of multi-generational wealth with too many high net worth individuals. Those who are pulling the strings are actively sabotaging the economy and are robbing you.\n\nThe interest rates will once again go down, when most people lose everything and you can't borrow anymore. This isn't about bringing the inflation down by decreasing money spent in real economy. The chart in the link clearly shows you that there is no increased activity which would increase velocity of money.\n\nSo tomorrow or in the next year don't get your hopes up too much. Your average working class ape is in more debt than before and savings are at an all time low. The latest surge in house prices also guaranteed that banks and through them the central banks owns you.\n\nThis is the final stage of capitalism. Good luck to you all.\n\nYour uncle gay bear.", "id": "yjtunv", "created_utc": 1667358564.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|930|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yjtunv)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yjtunv)\n    \n>TL;DR: Banks are intentionally destroying the economy to rob you.

With the velocity of money slowing down, Central Banks increased money supply to create an illusion of stability in economic growth. \"If money doesn't change hands enough times, we're just going to have more money in the system to have the same volume of transactions in a given time\" was their solution.\n\n> In a healthy economy you need diversity. As a consumer, making 50 small transactions of $20 in the real economy, usually has a greater impact than having one single $1000 transaction to pay for a car loan directly to the bank. The idea behind it is that there will be more transactions made in the real economy before that same dollar reaches the blackhole at the top of finance, where it just becomes a number to use for some made-up derivative bullshit asset. This is where I start to think we've past the point of no-return in our financial timeline.\n\n> As a banker, your top goal is to lend out as much money as possible with a reasonable amount of risk. The bigger the loan, the bigger the paycheck for everyone involved in that transactions - that's everyone from the loan officer to the manager of the branch and higher up execs and shareholders.\n\n> The bank must not compete with the Main Street for your dollar. At the end of the day, banks need more volume of daily transactions to sustain as a business apart from low interest long term loans. But this is exactly what happened in 2008 and it is what happened in the last year. Going back to my previous point, money is not moving. And it will not help how much money federal reserve prints. We have been in a recession - for all intense and purposes - for more than 2 years, which is only shortened by increased money supply.\n\n> As of October 14, 2022, CPI is over 8% for 7 months now. That's the fake under-reported number government pushes you to justify federal reserve's low interest rates. As demand for many products and services decreased, supply has been artificially limited to increase the prices of commodities and goods in order to increase profit margin on a single unit. Corporations with lower revenues are able to post higher profits due to decrease in cost of production and about one trillion dollars in loans from the government.\n\n> We are screwed by every single entity we do business with. As workers, we have to compete with banks to purchase a home! We have to pay more in taxes to pay for our jobs?! due to all the loans that were given out and forgiven so far and in the future! We have to pay more for products we don't need as much. A simple supply and demand curve would explain to you how price lowers as demand decreases. Price gauging is 100% kosher in 2022.\n\n> TL:DR - government must not buy banks' debt anymore on tax-payers' behalf. That's our money going to the financial system that's there to facilitate economic activity and not make an unreasonable amount of profit from the very people that actually make this world turn. Without a worker you have nothing. We are not at a level of automation, where corporations and governments can disregard the needs of the working people! let the banks and federal reserve fail.
