On top of that, algos are set to jump at the slightest hint of any \"doveish\" comment by the Fed. Remember, the Fed giveth and taketh, so the stock and bond markets have learned to follow the Fed.\n\nBut the entire reason the Fed is raising rates to far and so fast is because of excessive inflation. Therefore, at the slightest hint of \"peaking inflation\", markets pop. This has been happening since spring / summer 2021. Inflation is worse than thought, market tanks; inflation is better, market surges; inflation is better but Powell says something scary, oh gosh, up down up down up down.\n\nKeep in mind, money has to go somewhere. In most market downturns before, the money left stocks and went into bonds, housing, or something. But this time has been different. Bonds and stocks have been selling off bad since the beginning of the year. That is now in cash or money market funds ready to rush into stocks. Some of it is also in \"safe\" or \"defensive\" stocks like healthcare, which is why those went down some today (frankly, they're way overpriced).\n\nHere's what I'm looking at. The Fed projects overnight rates in the mid to upper 4s throughout 2023. The rate is 4.0 now. December will push to 4.5. Bond yields fell yesterday to start the day, which investors view as bullish for stocks (unless it means recession). In fact, the sharp bond yield crash yesterday morning may have been what really triggered to stock algos to go nuts. But now the 20 year is below 4.3. There is no way 20 year bonds can stay below 4.5 if the overnight rate is going to get above 4.5 this December. So that means TLT (etf that tracks 20-year bonds) must come back to 90 (it's presently at 98). And if bonds sell off again, and yields rise, I expect stocks will fall, as well. The only way this doesn't happen is if the Fed gives clear indication that they will drop rates starting next year, or they see a lower terminal rate. If that happens at the December meeting, stocks to the moon. It will be interesting to see.\n\nWill SPY / QQQ hit a new low? In a recession, yes. With more surprise inflation upside, definitely yes. Otherwise, probably not. Will they get lower than they are today? I think SPY will, but QQQ may have bottomed. TLT is definitely going lower.

I work for a company very similar to Nestle and we sell the same type of goods.  \n\nHere are a few specific examples.  Each example has different drivers.\n\n- Our labor cost have gone way up.  Two yrs ago we were paying $15/hr for box packers.  Today we are paying $19/hr plus up to $400 month bonus.  We can\u2019t find enough good workers so we have to offer higher wages.  20$/hr and all you need is a pulse.   If you speak English, can read and write, and show up to work - You can make $25/hr cooking food.\n- logistics/trucking.  Diesel is 6$ a gallon and we can\u2019t find enough truck drivers so trucking companies and 3pls have a ton of leverage and pricing power\n- urea and diesel costs have increased significantly which increases the cost of farming and crops.  Urea and diesel challenges are a direct result of the Ukraine war\n- grain/beans/corn supply chain is jacked up because of the Ukraine war.  Ukraine/Russia are grain/corn power houses.  If there are supply disruptions prices increase.\n- oil prices are elevated.
