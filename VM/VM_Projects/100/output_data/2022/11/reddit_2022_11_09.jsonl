If tesla continued to develope the budget line, they'd probably be able to throw down with BBYD and Hyundai and everyone else in the budget EV sector, which is the ideal place to be in a slowing economy but still strong EV demand like everyone is expecting for next year, but they are not. Chose to go with the cybertruck, open new factory for that, still isn't going to ramp up until end of next year. \n\nBefore, being a little slow on new veichle releases wasn't an issue for tesla, nobody could do what they did, nothing was close to the range or the price.

So yeah, price to equity of 25, or about double other automakers, is in fact pretty good, and reasonable for tesla.
