If QQQ stays above 308, your short put will expire worthless, and you will keep the premium.\n\n>Now if the price goes down below my strike, at expiration I understand I should choose to exercise this call and sell at $308 when the price is e.g $300 and take home a profit for each share sold. But what happens to my premium at this point?\n\nWhere is the mention of a call coming from?  You were talking about a put.  Assuming you still mean put, you have a short put and you can't choose to exercise it.  You can get assigned, which is not your choice and which you have no control over.  If QQQ is at 300 at expiration, you will be assigned.  Your brokerage will deduct $30,800 cash from your account and place 100 shares of QQQ in your account.\n\n>Alternatively I could chose (and apparently more commonly) to sell before the expiration date, but how does this make a profit? is it because the closer the strike price is to being ITM the more the cost of the premiums increase?\n\nYou can choose to buy, not sell, before the expiration date.  You have a short position and thus you buy to close it, not sell.  If time has passed, and/or volatility has gone down, and/or the underlying has moved up making the put farther OTM, it will be cheaper than when you sold it, and thus you can buy it back for less than you sold it for, keeping the difference between your initial credit and the amount you pay to buy it back.\n\n>\\--Now here's the other part I don't get related to trading puts. Generally the idea is insurance is overpriced and buying OTM puts especially on e.g QQQ you can benefit from the premiums as its unlikely to see drastic movements in price.

Here's why:\n\n> Does the fact that the 20 dollar contracts control 500 shares and the 100 dollar contract only controls 100 shares even make a difference?\n\nYes, of course it does. For example, the exercise results of the first position are radically different from the second. The market understands that difference and factors the difference into pricing.\n\n> My assumption is In both situations 20% is 20%.

If both trades happen to coincide at 20% at a moment in time, big deal, it's a coincidence. What happens next is more important.\n\nThe calls will have different deltas. Your 1 call will have  higher delta then your 5, since higher delta means higher cost. So in the next tick of the market clock, if the underlying goes up $1, your 1 call will gain more value than you 5 calls added together, unless the 5 calls have exactly 1/5th the delta of the 1 call, which is unlikely, even if you start them out that way.\n\nNow that said, it could be that the 5 calls have higher IV than the 1 call, so it's possible the 5 calls *gain more* than the 1 call, even though the 1 call has higher delta.\n\nBottom line being that once the 20% coincidence is over, it's unlikely to repeat itself.

I don't even know what I'm going to have for dinner tomorrow, let alone what price AAPL will be in 2024.\n\nIf your tax situation allows it, you could consider using 60 day calls and rolling them every 30 days for a perpetual position on some underlying.

You can even DCA, by buying more contracts when AAPL is down and fewer when AAPL is up.\n\n> does buying ITM LEAPS protect you from theta decay in the event of a rise in share price?\n\nI'm not sure what a rise in share price has to do with it. If anything, a sufficiently large rise in share price will wipe out any risk of theta decay.\n\nBut to answer your question about ITM vs. theta decay, no in the absolute, but better than OTM in the relative sense.

The contract is nearly worthless but still open in that scenario.  It may be a situation where the ask is $0.01 and there's no bid, meaning no buyer.  A buyer could appear, though--so, it's not exactly worthless.  In your scenario, you've bought the OTM contract, and you can let it expire worthless.  Had you sold the option, you'd want to try to close your position (by re-buying it) before expiration -- that ties it off just in case the unexpected happens.  \n2. Historical volatility is the annualized standard deviation of the historical stock price.  Many try to read the tea leaves by comparing that to IV, which is the market's implicit prediction, as reflected in options prices, of how volatile a stock price will be in future.  However, this analysis helps you only so far.  You can argue there's always good reason to believe volatility will be different from that which history portends.  Both macro- and firm-specific factors will have changed.  So, this exercise will still reduce to your projections for the future and how that compares to the market's view as reflected in options prices.  I suppose some prefer to start from historical variability and adjust from there.  \n3. Looking at both open interest and volume is good.  I learned this long long ago:   \n Investing, and perhaps even moreso trading, is a game of exclusion.  \"I'm not going to do this unless all of my conditions are met.\"  If there's anything you don't like / understand about a deal, let it go by.  And, if you find something you're interested in where the only drawback is some quirk like low open interest but high volume, you can ask about that specifically (include the details) on these boards, a great resource, before pulling the trigger.\n4. Thousands of books have been written on this.  You might want to review some of the basics (gross profit, btw, doesn't appear on the balance sheet) and then reflect on what you're investing style is, then choose a book from that school of thought.  For example, if you're a value investor, a la Warren Buffett, the major standard bearer in that school is Benjamin Graham's classic book The Intelligent Investor.  Continuing this example: When Graham studied a balance sheet, he'd weigh heavily the price to book ratio (book value excludes intangible assets; Graham's dream scenario was buying the stock of great, long-track-record companies when P-B ratio was well under 1).

Anyways, in 5 years let\u2019s say the market rebounds all of its losses and another 5%. If you bought the s&p right now and got those returns, that would be a 20% return. Now let\u2019s say you bought $SPXL right now instead of $SPY. Now in the same 5 year period when $SPY has returned 20%, $SPXL returned 60% because it multiplied the spy\u2019s gains by 3x.

I said several things.\n\nPerhaps I should be more clear since you seem to be well-intentioned.\n\nCovid is a flu-like cold.  It was a novel virus, and thus was able to kill a shit-ton of people in the world.  That is precisely what colds do.  The flu also used to kill a shit-ton of people.  Vaccination has helped, but it still does.\n\nThe original covid strain primarily killed the morbidly obese and people with comorbidities.  This is partially due to their lung-function dynamics.  It also resulted in a coagulopathy which killed most of the people that died.\n\nThe world responded with Draconian measures to \"lock down.\"  Anyone that has a scientific education or medical degree can tell you that \"locking down\" will not stop an infectious disease from spreading.  It would be intellectually dishonest to say anything else.  \n\nOne country that did not lock down was Sweden.  They had a ton of deaths immediately in retirement homes, and changed their practice of how they cared for their sick.  They had much improved results thereafter.  Nevertheless, the rest of the world argued that they were doing the wrong thing by not locking down, masking up, etc.  This is despite the fact that Sweden did much better than many countries that did lock down.\n\nMy final point was that Covid was weaponized in the United States by the left to make sure that Trump was not re-elected.  There was 24 hour news coverage that has convinced people that covid was as dangerous as ebola.  It is not.  Additionally, the sites that control information sensor physicians like myself from actually commenting with facts about covid.  It doesn't fit the narrative.\n\nI'm sorry, my final final point was that Trump decided to run the printing press.  Completely disastrous.  He can own that.  However, he was pushed into that call (this is where it becomes my opinion instead of facts) by Democrats using covid as a weapon and treating the pandemic in an unbelievably draconian way.\n\n/ There done posting.
