{"title": "Investing is not like cheering for a sports team.", "selftext": "\nThis is a long read but 100% worth it and necessary for today\u2019s investing climate.\n\n\nPeople become sports fans mainly to support the home team. Whether the team is good or bad they watch, go to games, buy memorabilia. And the majority of times they stick with one team their entire lives through ups and downs.\n\nInvesting is not like that at all whatsoever. This message is mainly for the newer younger investors, those that started during the meme stock craze. What I\u2019ve been seeing is people treating stock investing the same way they treat sports teams. They pick a stock, stick with it no matter what, join echo chambers that promote the stock and then reconfigure their reality to see the stock in a positive light no matter what. I can\u2019t even begin to explain how dangerous that is in the markets. It\u2019s like that\u2019s their team and damn anyone who will convince them otherwise.\n\nThings change with time. New information arises that can contradict what was once true. This is especially true in the markets. What was once a sure fire trade might no longer be in a few months. Pay attention to macro world wide events for clues of changing trends. For example Zoom: an obscure video conference service that no one heard of until the pandemic when it was propelled into the forefront of every household and became its own noun. But now it\u2019s cratering hard because the pandemic is ending and less people are using it. Zoom doesn\u2019t have its own stock specific subreddit (or does it ? Im not sure) but if it did you would be hearing about crime and hedgies creating synthetic shares to crash the stock on purpose and how a short squeeze is imminent\u2026. Any day now. When in reality large scale macro events are causing the stock to crash.\n\nStay the fuck away from every single stock specific subreddit. They are ALL toxic, riddled with lies/misinformation/half truths/gas lighting/misdirection. They take information and exaggerate it if it\u2019s positive and minimize it or just outright ignore it if it\u2019s negative. This is not the place or mindset you want to be getting your data from. You want people who are going to tell you the truth, bad or good, no matter what it is. This allows you the investor to make choices on your own. These echo chamber hive minds are relying on the mob for information. You constantly see people saying things like: \u201ctell me what to think of this\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure what this means can you explain for a sm00th brain.\u201d Imagine relying on random people you\u2019ve never met to make personal decisions on how to invest your hard earned money. It absurd and just dangerous. But the worst part is how any dissenting opinion is absolutely smothered by the moderators and the mob. I\u2019m seeing desperate people who need cash to pay for serious life altering things such as car repairs, medical appointments, their dogs treatment who are being ridiculed, attacked, insulted by the mob for wanting to sell their shares to pay for those things. Being called a sell out, a shill. The one of the dog was extra painful to watch as some dude let his dog die instead of selling his shares to pay for its medical treatment. And then the mob came and applauded him for \u201cstaying the course\u201d don\u2019t believe me? It\u2019s there in that one stock specific subreddit that rhymes with duperbonk. \n\n\nSome of the most basic principles of investing have gone out of the window. For example never put all your eggs in one basket. Don\u2019t invest money you can\u2019t afford to lose. Don\u2019t take out loans on your 401k, max out your credit cards with cash advances, sell your only car (yes these things are actually happening in meme stock subreddits). This behavior is so irrational, so toxic. Everyday I am flabbergasted by what I am seeing and when I think it can\u2019t get worse it does. \n\nTLDR stock trading is not a group activity. Stock specific subreddits are extremely toxic and destructive to developing proper investing skills.

Amazon for years used debt to finance its rise to the top. Healthy companies use debt in low rate environments.

Yea for the past year they have had a billion in the bank because they have absolutely no clue what to do with it. A billion that was acquired through diluting their shares on the backs of GME investors. Share dilution is an indicator of weak business because they can\u2019t afford to get the money through profit and have to sell more shares for cash. A billion in inventory wonderful now sell it. Esports and NFTS are NOT 2 of the largest growing sectors. Gaming is. NFT sales are down 99% since it\u2019s peak. Esports has a lot of potential but twitch(Amazon), Microsoft are light years ahead of GME and I really don\u2019t understand the connection between web3 and esports. How do they monetize this? And that is what it\u2019s all about the money. GME has to be able to monetize and then convince people to spend money on these things which they just haven\u2019t. They completely blew it with the digital change of gaming and online sales.

You should know the team, the players, and understand their tactics, and their future strategy.  You should be engaging with the community.\n\nStocks like Apple, Disney, Google, Nike and even Brk-A (Buffet is like the Brady/LeBron of investing world) have cult-like followings in their community.  If you had consistently bought and held from 12+ years ago; you would have done really well.  You wouldn't need to research other companies and wouldn't need to follow market news.   \n\n2 Wisdom of the crowds\n\nWise crowds usually beats out the experts.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Wisdom\\_of\\_Crowds\n\n5 elements that form a wise:\n\n* Diversity of Opinion\n* Independence\n* Decentralization\n* Aggregation mechanism\n* Trust (each person trusts the collective group to be fair)\n\nWhile there are issues with bots/schills, as a whole, the aggregation mechanism does work.   For robust and resilient single stock/coin/brand subreddit communities; it is actually where you want to go for the real analysis.  Examples of this are Apple, Disney, Gamestop, Google (google home, android, developer, etc.), Nike (sneakers), Tesla.

How can you even mention things like diversity of opinion, independence in connection with those subreddits? There is no independence when ALL dissenting opinion is immediately shut down and the person then banned. \n\nThe stocks you picked are winners. But the majority of stocks aren\u2019t. Only a few stocks go on to make returns like AMZN or AAPL. It\u2019s why the market as an aggregate only averages 6%-8% a year. Because for every AAPL there are multiple tickers in the red. So following your mindset people should just hold this forever and cheer on? No things change with time and rebalancing, dumping losers and upping winners is something you must do in your portfolio. Also those stocks don\u2019t have cult like followings. The moment the companies turn sour and crash the investors will dump their shares. \n\nFinancial analysts know ten times more than a bunch of random college students who started investing because they saw people making millions on wall street bets off of options and a once in a lifetime short squeeze. Jim Cramer is a cable news personality and the fact that you picked him for your example shows how little you know. Anybody with a basic knowledge of the market knows not to listen to a word he says. Sorry but the sources i read from like the economist and Bloomberg are in themselves crowd sourced information.

Once you learn how to sort through legacy media it\u2019s actually the best information you\u2019re gonna find. But anytime someone mentions Bloomberg theres this visceral reaction about how mainstream media is garbage and it\u2019s all corrupt! Some of it definitely (Cramer) but not all of it. And the new investors are selling themselves short by not doing their own research and instead reading DD by a Pomeranian who didn\u2019t even actually own any shares of the company he was shilling. Haven\u2019t you noticed how all the GME DD writers disappear after a few months?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "First off, I mostly disagree with you, but I appreciate the discussion because I  think it makes the community better.\n\nIn regards to the stocks I picked that are winners.  They are winners because they have a fanatical fanbase, the management sees where the puck is going and they do listen to customers.   This is one of my investment criteria for a heavy %portion of my portfolio.  Community + utility/story = value.  I've been an Apple user since Mac OS9 and the first titanium Macbook.  I've always been a sneaker-head, so I have a good idea where Nike/Adidas is heading without looking at financial reports.  Activision/Blizzard is a good example where people loved the products, but when the company seems to not listen to their community fanbase--- their stock takes a hit.  To me, engaging a company's investors and customers, and then looking at the unit economics is much more valuable than Financial writer article and even earnings report top-line numbers.\n\nFinancial analysts and writers; they are helpful but only to a limited scope.   I have a few good friends and writers (for Bloomberg, Forbes, Nikkei and others); so I don't want to devalue what they do.  But as somebody who has worked in Venture Capital and written investment memos; I would never put too much weight on what they say.   Their KPIs are based on click-throughs, page views, and articles per month.Their money is not on the line.   They are also not business operators.   \n\nIn regards to Superstonk.   They are a subset group of GME individual retail investors.  While they can get mobbish at times,  again in aggregate the best ideas do emerge and have been mostly correct (you may disagree with me on this point).   The principle idea that there is market manipulation  (though dark pools, total transfer swaps, long/short mismarking, etc) is correct.  The dates (wen squeeze) have been wrong; but that's okay if you understand and believe the market is manipulated.  The sentiment of buying options was mobbish and did flip-flop a few times.   The prediction of the NFT marketplace was correct.  So was the prediction of a stock dividend.   Whether a squeeze happens now or later; the squeeze is only part of story.  A good % of company are perfectly happy investing without a squeeze.  For myself, I'm very bullish that they are really the first publicly-traded company to implement zero-knowledge proofs technology and I believe online marketplace platforms tend to be winner takes all.  So GME is in the position to win it.  And just like in the VC world-- I look at individual investments with a 7 year investment horizon.   \n\nBut I can totally see why you would find that community is off-putting and not want to be engaged.  I like special edition designer collaboration Nike sneakers, but I absolutely detest the sneaker investment and reseller community.   They post things I occasionally like, but I think hyping sneakers up to 5x their retail price is dumb and off-putting.  But my annoyance with them, doesn't stop me from liking and buying and wearing the sneakers that we both like.\n\nUltimately, people will like what they like.  They will have different investment criteria and strategies different from mine.  That's fine, because what they do, doesn't really affect me.

The majority of superstinkers are people looking for a get rich quick scheme who bought in during the January 2021 squeeze and got burned. They didn\u2019t sell when they should have it they bought at or near the top. You really think sneaker heads are buying up Nike shares ? No man the majority dont own a single share. \n\nI disagree 100% with your description of financial writers. Your engaging in multiple fallacies and just plain false statements. A lot of them do own shares, a lot of them are business owners or former business owners. I\u2019ve seen CEO\u2019s write articles on Bloomberg.\n\nI can got banned from superstonk for telling them to DFV Used Bloomberg to formulate his original squeeze thesis. He used it because he trusted it. And today the numbers show below 20% SI. The numbers were accurate then and they are accurate today. They didn\u2019t predict and NFT marketplace. GME announced one and they just copy and pasted the announcement. The stock dividend also is inaccurate. They predicted a crypto dividend like overstock did and for months they speculated about it and even contacted fidelity about it. And for you to say that a good percentage of happy without the squeeze is complete bullshit. They obsess about the squeeze, how they will spend their billions, how they will take down the world financial system.

Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 8.3 percent before seasonal adjustment.\n\n Increases in the indexes for shelter, food, airline fares, and new vehicles were the largest contributors to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index rose 0.9 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 1.0 percent. The energy index declined in April after rising in recent months. The index for gasoline fell 6.1 percent over the month, offsetting increases in the indexes for natural gas and electricity.   \n\nThe index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in April following a 0.3-percent advance in March. Along with indexes for shelter, airline fares, and new vehicles, the indexes for medical care, recreation, and household furnishings and operations all increased in April.

In theory the Fed should have an easier time controlling inflation so long as they're proactive.\n\nTo Powell's credit he's been extremely clear that the Fed will do whatever it takes to bring inflation under control, and 50 bps hikes are no joke. They may have been a bit late, but they're moving pretty fast at this point.\n\nYou mentioned that there are 2 jobs for every 1 applicant, but this isn't a good thing.  Having a historically tight labour market just gives the fed more room to hike and a tight labour market increases inflationary pressures as employees have more bargaining power.\n\nIf inflation doesn't moderate soon Powell may have to shock the market like Volcker did in the 70s.

Inflation is up big month over month. I posted this before the numbers came out. \n\nApril YoY CPI is expected to come in at 8.1%. March was 8.5% YoY. The only reason this month is expected to come in lower YoY is simply because the increase in inflation from March to April this year is expected to be lower than the same period last year. Even so, an 8.1% increase YoY in April still represents quite a large unsustainable jump. Last years March to April jump was 1.6% leading to a CPI of 4.2%. The 8.1% estimate represents a YoY increase of 8.1% higher than prices were AFTER the 4.2% a year ago (That\u2019s roughly 12.5% price increases over a 24 month period). In order to hit the Feds target rate of inflation of 2% YoY, we should expect an average jump of 0.17 month to month. So, in order for inflation to be increasing at sustainable rates, we should look for 8.5%+0.17%-1.6%= roughly 7.07% (I say \u201croughly\u201d because when we\u2019re talking about a rate of increase we should factor in the compounding nature of inflation) . Therefore the consensus of 8.1% actually represents a jump of 1.03% month to month higher than sustainable levels. What we want is inflation to be increasing at a rate lower on average than experienced in the trailing 12 months. Last months 8.5% increase in YoY inflation assumes an 0.71% increase on average month to month while this month is expected to be an increase of 1.03% month to month. So what I would like to see is the CPI coming in lower than 7.61% for April 2022, although current April consensus is 0.49% higher. So to get the true feel of how bad inflation is, look at the MoM numbers \u2026 not the YoY numbers. Now \u2026 I don\u2019t know how the hell analyst came up with that 8.1% consensus. I was expecting much lower given the 1.6% month to month jump last year. But understanding these numbers is important. We don\u2019t want to get lost in the assumption that YoY inflation coming in lower in the latter month than the previous represents a decline in the rate inflation is actually increasing month to month.", "score": 167, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the explanation.", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09362568706274033}, {"body": "This.
