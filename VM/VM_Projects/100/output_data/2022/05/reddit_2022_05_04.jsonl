When it comes to my long-term portfolio I am a value investor and I believe another great buying opportunity is upon us. I can tell you 80% of the gains I've made in the last 5 years were from buying during the two aforementioned market corrections.  I encourage all the newer investors that have entered the market these last two years to look at this market correction as a great buying opportunity as well.

At $20 they will be trading at 6x price to sales and for a company growing revenue at 80% Q/Q I am willing to take that risk even though they're not profitable yet. \n\nI don't know how metaverse and all that hype will turn out and my experience is purely anecdotal. But for the last two years I swear literally every kid in my life, both boys and girls in the 4 to 12 age group has asked me to buy them Robux for their birthday/Christmas presents. Roblox isn't a static game, it's an ecosystem of hundreds of mini-games and because of this I think they are more than a trend and will be here to stay for a long time. Brands have started partnering with them and kids are eating it up. \n\nAgain this is the riskiest pick on my list for all the reasons you mentioned which is why it needs to fall another 40% before I'm willing to take that risk. But sometimes these speculative plays are the ones that really pay off. I put less than $5k in TSLA and SHOP 4 years ago before they were profitable when everyone was shitting on them and ended up making life-changing money.

Technically, we already had a recession in 2020. And central banks around the world basically wished it away by printing more money. But now we've already printed a lotttttt of money. And maybe we shouldn't print more.\n\nSee, here's the problem. When you pump money into an economy, it needs to work itself through the system and increase economic output. In a way, you expect people and businesses to spend their money, and hopefully, some of it goes towards improving efficiencies and growth. But that didn't happen proportionate to the amount of money pumped in. Because the Stimulus wasn't distributed equally between suppliers and consumers.\n\nWhy? Because the global economy is intertwined in a very convoluted fashion. And a lot of money across the world exchanges hands multiple times for me to get an iphone in my hand. And the world is screwed.\n\nChina, the defaco factory of the modern world is reeling from another COVID outbreak. It could last a few weeks or a few months or a year. Who knows?\n\nRussia, perhaps the most natural resource rich country in the world is embattled in a war, and the west is collectively attempting to ban / sanction Russian products.\n\nAlso, China might decide to re-assert itself on Taiwan.\n\nFurther, during COVID, when we got the stimulus money, and spent most of it, the world was still reeling. And the traditional way businesses ran broke. Inventories dried up almost instantly, and soon we started facing shortages. And when we start facing shortages, economics kick in and manufacturers started charging more.\n\nThis isn't necessarily wrong. Because when COVID hit, essentially everyone stopped placing orders. This forced manufacturers to slow down, lay off staff and even shutter factories.\n\nIt all started with the great TP shortage of 2020. It's essentially the same story, though different products are affected by different factors. The balance of supply and demand skewed heavily in favor of demand. With Supply having zero hope of keeping up.  And so we saw inflation seeping into the economy.\n\nRampant inflation and supply chain issues have made the price of grain and raw materials so expensive that the financially less secure countries are predicting they won't be able to afford food. Sri Lanka is in financial default, and is in the process of restructuring their debt.\n\nThe Fed has to skew the balance of Supply and demand back towards supply. And the way it does this, is by reducing demand. They achieve this through increasing interest rates. But now, USA also has a massive debt problem. The Fed needs to reduce it's balance sheet. When the Fed sent everyone stimulus checks, and wrote egregious bailouts for businesses, they also backstopped the stock market. Essentially, the bought Mortgage backed securities and Equities ( through some complex financial instruments) and now they're going to have to sell this.\n\nThe Fed owns almost 30% of all MBS in existence, and will now have to find a buyer for it. On one hand they're increasing interest rates, which will reduce demand. But they're also going to be selling MBS and Equities, which will increase supply.\n\nThe BEST case scenario-they do this precisely, they will turn the scales in the direction of supply. Intuitively, this seems good. If there's more supply, prices should go down, or atleast moderate. Which would be great !\n\nThe BAD Scenario - They are too slow\n\nIf they are too slow, then prices continue to rise and the people suffer immensely. Supply chain woes are not fixed because demand keeps outpacing supply. Till the point that supply catches up. This may take a while, and we go through stagflation. - Slow economic growth due to high inflation\n\nThe WORST Case Scenario - They are too fast\n\nIf they are too fast, demand gets destroyed. The shock of high interest rates and balance sheet run off leads to a crash in asset prices. As Stock prices fall, businesses prioritize capital and Unemployment starts to creep up. This leads to a vicious cycle where people can't afford things because they do not have money. And then we have negative economic growth. This is a recession.\n\nThe ARMAGEDDON Scenario - they do nothing. Supply chains keep breaking. And one leading cause of inflation is replaced by another. Prices keep rising, and we get to hyperinflation, wherein a loaf of bread costs a ton of money.\n\nThink of these 4 cases as a continuous distribution and not absolute outcomes, and it might make more sense.

There is still too much inflation in the pipeline, as reflected by the leading indicators including PPI, and factory orders.\n\nA recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of reduction in GDP.

{"title": "Daddy Pow Pow Just FUCKED us all and here is why", "selftext": "# Summary:\n\nThe .5bp rate hike, though high for what we have seen in recent years, isn't enough to effect that change that Daddy Pow Pow wants to occur. \n\n# Daddy Pow Pows plan:\n\nDaddy Pow Pow hopes that by giving a .5bp increase that it will slow down consumer demand by slightly increasing prices of consumer goods. For many who have surplus income this will have little to no impact on how they live, for others this may cause them to decrease the quality of product that they buy or simply to buy less. For most, this will negatively impact household savings. \n\nIn doing this, Daddy Pow Pow admits that he has no significant ability to impact supply chain issues. Most of the problems we are seeing with prices of consumer goods relate to supply chain issues so aside from potential decreasing supply chain demand, there will be little to no impact on that front. Supply chain issues will still fuck us. \n\nIn the end, Daddy Pow Pow hopes that this increase in prices will get persons who are currently not working to go back to work. These persons include: retired persons, teenagers, college students, persons collecting unemployment, persons living on government stipends / welfare, etc. If nothing else changed over the next 12 months except for what Daddy Pow Pow did, then this may likely cause more persons to work and thus increase our economic stability / growth. However, what Daddy Pow Pow didn't account for in this plan are the things that will happen which he knows he can't prevent. \n\n# Things to come that Daddy Pow Pow didn't bake into the .5bp hike:\n\n**There are so many things that Daddy Pow Pow didn't consider that I will list some out here:** \n\n* When costs go up, students can borrow more money for college. Universities will forecast expected costs of college and students will be able to borrow up to that amount. This may actually lead to less college students working part time jobs as it becomes easier for them to get more money and then spend it on booze, beans, and rice. \n* Legislators are already finding solutions to keep their indentured voters indentured to vote for their party and these solutions will completely debunk what Daddy Pow Pow is attempting to do. For example, if we were to see UBI even at a level of $200 / month it would completely override any changes Daddy Pow Pow was hoping to create. Just think of all the ways our government buys their voters by keeping people from being productive citizens - any legislation pushing such ideologies will negate the intended effect of what Daddy Pow Pow is trying to achieve. \n* Supply Chain Issues may be heightened with decreased demand. If I'm a vendor who ships dog food and it costs me $100 to ship the dog food regardless of if it's 20 bags or 50 bags then I would ideally want to ship in batches close to 50 bags. High demand supports cost savings for the supply chain. What happens though when my price per unit to ship goes up because my batch size decreases? Well someone has to swallow those costs which means I lose some money and I also pass some losses onto my consumers in the form of a higher price. Now businesses are slowing down and prices go up even more. we might suggest that this could be like pseudo inflation. \n* We're just barely starting to watch this whole war shit show. a .5bp rate hike with possibility of war suggests that Daddy Pow Pow thinks the whole war shindig is a complete joke and that there is no reason to address the inflation in an urgent manner. We can address it slowly over 2 - 4 years with his plan however if we see increase in war then his plan goes flying out the window. Basically Daddy is saying war is a joke and all the virtue signaling retards are exactly that: regards. What if though, we do see more war? What if China does indeed invade Taiwan? Weelll shiiiiit. We fucked good because at that point our efforts to address inflation wouldn't have been aggressive enough. \n* Daddy Pow Pow chose to implement a slow plan that takes several years but Daddy Pow Pow has no clue what the future holds. Do we? IDK maybe one of you apes does but I sure as frickles don't. That being said, I believe it would have been a stronger more effective move to go ahead and push out a .75bp or 1.0 bp rate hike as that would force more change now which would leave us in a better position the next time shit hits the fan. (Can you smell it? the shit blowing form the fan?)\n\n# What this means for us: \n\nThis actually means increased uncertainty. Daddy Pow Pow took a weak decision which leaves us vulnerable to new events, if Daddy Pow Pow had taken a strong fist stance at a higher rate then we would have less uncertainty about future events. \n\nUncertainty = Bad apes we all know. Green today - Red in some day coming soon. \n\nBasically Daddy Pow Pow just took those swinging arms he talks with and did the whole \"Pow Pow get fisted\" where we all walk away feeling relieved at first but then a few days later when our assholes are still bleeding we start to realize all the damage he did.", "id": "uig1j4", "created_utc": 1651696836.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|401|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/udekgq/okay_apes_i_have_the_plan_to_make_us_all_winners/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uig1j4)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uig1j4)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06556125730276108}, {"body": "You led off with .5 bp, which is 0.005% then proceeded to write a 5,000 word essay and expect anyone to read it", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02029779739677906}, {"body": "That\u2019s what I was thinking.

{"title": "$66,000 LOSS....what do you think of this plan?", "selftext": "Greetings fellow investors.\n\n As you can see in the title, I have amassed a 66k realized loss. This has been bugging me for a few days now and I haven't been sleeping much. My first plan to get out of this loss was to invest in $ROPE and a youtube search history of noose tying instructional videos but I think I found a better way and I'm looking for advise. Obviously you can see where I started trading options. Now, clearly I haven't done well with options overall, but I do understand them and their power and have had great success at times. So now say I had an exta 100k sitting in the bank just being brutally eroding by inflation. Instead of watching it do absolutely nothing for me, what if I were to transfer it to my broker and buy some 10-20dte SPY options and go for a 66% return? I have made numerous 100-1000% returns prior, in fact I had 2 contracts go over 100% today, so I don't think a 66% return is very far fetched and pretty achievable especially in this market environment.

No, because Bill's entry price has nothing to do with Tom or the stock.  Tom does not even know about Bill.  Likewise, your own past entry price has nothing to do with the stock's current or future performance.  You are Bill, and the rest of the world is Tom.\n\nLet's now say you never bought at $150, and you first discover the stock at $100, would you come fresh and buy today and say, \"I will sell at $150\".

As they say, if you liked it at $150, then you really like it at $100.But, if you do not like it anymore, you still still \"buying\" it at $100, simply by still holding it.  Every day.  Also, what if the stock goes to $125?  Do you sell now?  Or is the $150 past affecting your decision making?   What if you never bought it at $150?  Now $100 to $125 is treated differently than $150 to $100 to $125.  Yet, it's the same move from $100 to $125.You also miss out on other opportunities while waiting to hit a totally arbitrary personal target that only matters to your brain only.
