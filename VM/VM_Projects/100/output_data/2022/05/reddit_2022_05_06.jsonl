{"title": "RIVN about to poo the bed...", "selftext": "I know they are down 80% from their ATH ($172 on 11-16-21) just after IPO...and have lost 50% over the past 3 months.  So much FOMO from people that feel like they missed out on TSLA.  Insanity.\n\n  \nAnyways, can they really keep falling?  The answer is Yes.  About 30 more dollars to go.  The hits are about to really start landing.  \n\nThe biggest catalysts for a short term drop: \n\n1) end of lockup period on 05-09-22.  Ford alone owns 100M shares (about 11% of RIVN) and has already scrapped their plans to build an EV with them thinking they can go it alone.  I'm not sure why they would keep their investment in what is now the only real truck EV competitor around.  They want to see Rivian fail.  The only way they stay involved is if they stage a takeover.  But I don't think they have deep enough pockets to pull it off (not to mention F's mountain of debt and their own ambitious EV plans that are very capital intensive)\n\n2) earnings report next week.  They are going to show horrible delivery numbers for Q1 and the forecast will also be terrible.  Supply chain, competition, yadda yadda, macro environment, covid, war, whatever.  The worst part is that they have also committed to honoring initial reservation prices for all the people that have pre-ordered...at their very modest run rate, this effectively guarantees they will be selling EVs at a loss for at least the next 3 years of production.  AT LEAST.  Like they said previously, they may never be profitable.  Amen brother.\n\n3) I'm just waiting for Cramer to be giddy about them and then the nail is really in the coffin.  \n\n\nThe only thing that will save them in my not so humble opinion is if AMZN decides to buy them.  That's the only thing that keeps me from not going balls deep\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: 20 x $30p Exp 12-16-22  \n\n\nYes, yes, I know it's not a weekly YOLO.
