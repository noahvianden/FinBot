{"title": "Is the market too bearish on Intel $INTC?", "selftext": " \n\nDisclosure: I do have a small position (Less than $2,000) in Intel but am looking for some insight from others before I invest more.\n\nIntel has made numerous missteps in the past few years (Intel Optane while a great product ended up only being used in datacenter environments, 10nm slipped for years, until recently their CPU microarchitecture was arguably inferior to AMD's Zen 2) and the list goes on. However they have a new CEO with an engineering background who to me seems to be taking the company in the right direction over the long term. Intel is investing heavily in building new fabs and they claim their 18A node is ahead of schedule, while TSMC has delayed their N3 node. Intel Alder lake is very competitive with AMD's latest offerings and Intel Arc could eventually capture a large part of the GPU market.\n\nThe market cap of Intel is currently \\~182 billion, with a P/E Ratio of 7.41, and a dividend yield of 3.28%. The stock has been relatively flat since 2018.\n\nBy comparison, TSMC who only fabs chips has a market cap of \\~468 billion, a P/E ratio of 20.59 and a dividend yield of 1.62.\n\nAMD which designs chips but owns no fabs has a market cap of \\~165 billion, a P/E Ratio of 38.14, and no dividend.\n\nIntel has both fabs and designs their own chips yet is only valued slightly higher than AMD? Intel has the dominant market share in Servers, Desktop, and Mobile (laptop) processors, although AMD has been gaining ground. Intel will soon be competing directly with TSMC by fabricating third party chips in Intel's fabs. My question, does the market's bearish sentiment on Intel make any sense? Provided Intel doesn't delay their roadmaps I am finding it very difficult to believe that Intel should be valued at only 182 billion.\n\nThank you for your insights ahead of time!", "id": "v1oyl1", "created_utc": 1653999493.0, "score": 187, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "All the ratios on Intel say undervalued/fairly valued, but the issue for me (even though I have a small position in INTC also) is that you really have to believe in the fab plans to want to buy in right now.

Intel is running at capacity, ergo it makes sense that having more capacity would increase revenues all else being equal. \n\nThe Semi market is growing and although AMD is getting a bigger slice of the pie than they used to, the pie is getting larger and AMD doesn't even make their own pie just the recipe. So they have to compete for fab space. Intel is going to take a huge chunk of TSMC's 3nm so AMD will have to content with both Intel and Apple for space reducing how many chips they can even make, superior product or not there's huge demand.\n\nThen there's lots of geopolitical issues with worries about Taiwan leading to investments in the US and Europe to get fabs built out. Intel stands to benefit the most from these initiatives.\n\nIntel has huge profits and can afford all this, they're also going to IPO Mobileye at a rumored $50billion valuation.\n\nAs for innovation Intel has been failing hard at manufacturing. How is it possible Intel's 14nm chips were able to even compete with AMD's 10nm if not for good design? Despite having shitty manufacturing Intel hasn't been that far behind AMD and in latest consumer CPUs is actually ahead I believe.  But that's not AMD beating Intel, that's TSMC beating them, and TSMC is selling Intel lots of fab space which will erode much of AMD's advantage regardless of how intel's fabs do.\n\nAs for the the specific $40 mark, their forward PE is like 12 I believe. How are they not worth at least $40 lol. Why don't you use actual logic to tell me why Intel should be valued at less $40/share, use actual numbers and not wishy washy \"AMD good, Intel Bad\" logic.

Yes, the question is whether or not Intel can turn things around.  Maybe they can, maybe they cannot.\n\nPersonally I have about 10% in Intel, was 15% at one point, which I reduced when it got a little to ahead of itself.  I also own 6% in AMD and a chunk of TSMC and ASML.  I bought AMD via Xilinx, since the 15% arbitrage looked like a reasonable risk to me.\n\nI like Intel because I think it's got good fundamentals, and it's in an industry I think I understand better than most.  I also think it's a good defensive stock, and it returns a dividend.  So that makes it a good long term play for a tax deferred retirement account.\n\nGenerally speaking over the past couple of decades there has been a back and forth with Intel and AMD.  Every 5 years or so they change places as each makes a mistep.  Intel made the last mistep with their approach to EUV for making chips.  However, it was exactly that a mistep, and not a fundament cut in R&D.  They have the cash flow and resources to recover, and likely will.  Right now they are first in line for ASML's next set of EUV machines, which means they'll be ahead of TSMC for a while on that front.  There have also been rumors of a TSMC mistep at 3 nm, which could be nothing, could be a delay.\n\nSo overtime I expect Intel to regain dominance in the field, and AMD to shift back again.  When that will happen is hard to say, AMD has been doing very well of late.  I also don't know when Intel will start to regain the ground.  What I do know is that Intel outspends AMD and Nvidia in R&D, even accounting for the inefficencies of a massive company like Intel.  They also have a oligarchy on fabs with only TSMC and Samsung being able to compete.  Further the number of fabs on the bleeding edge has been going down to the point that I expect that to provide Intel with a nice moat.  \n\nI also like some of the internal bits of Intel that don't get as much discussion.  I think MobilEye is most likely to win the autonomous car race, with their advantage in data.  Intel also has nice plays in AI, Internet of Things, photonics, and a wide range of other cutting edge tech.  They're more than just their processors, a lot more.\n\nSince I'm a retail trader I don't have access to a lot of insider info, nor which makes it difficult to know.  I'm assuming that whenever the transformation happens it will likely be pretty quick, likely afterhours when I cannot trade, with bots soaking up a lot of the sudden spike.
