{"title": "Sharing a 100% risk-free but relatively low-return strategy", "selftext": "*Update: I received many comments on the strategy is equivalent to buying a CD or worse than selling naked puts or covered calls. I wish to highlight that this strategy can net a risk-free 4% to 5% relatively easily in this kind of stock market with some tech and penny stocks via selling ITM calls and buying OTM puts. The 2.68% annual return is an example using SPY via ATM calls and puts, which is much easier to understand for sharing purpose, but this strategy can surely do better. If you are looking for a risk-free 10% return, no, I do not identify any such strategy yet, and I will not share it if I found it.*\n\nThe strategy is:\n\n1. Buy 100 shares of SPY (e.g., at $415/share)\n2. Sell ATM call leap with same strike (e.g., Dec 2024 $415C nets $6,300)\n3. Buy ATM put leap with same strike (e.g., Dec 2024 $415P costs $5,000)\n4. Collect dividends (e.g., \\~$1,400 for 2.5 years when not including Q4 2024's dividend)\n\nAll the numbers above are by market close on 5/27/2022. This nets us a risk-free $2,700 using $38,800 (\\~6.96% over 2.6 years, or \\~2.68% per year). Due to stock market crash, call leaps now worth more than put leaps.\n\n**Yes, 2.68% is not a good return. Try this strategy with some big tech or penny stocks (those with no dividends) by selling ITM call leaps and buying OTM put leaps. 5% (may be even up to 8%) is achievable, but we need to wait for the limit price transaction to go through. Patience is the key.**\n\nTip 1: This is a high volatility strategy. You want SPY at lower price as much as possible (like $380 last week, not $415 yesterday). Deploy it during a big red day to maximize profits.\n\nTip 2: The best moment has sailed, so this tip doesn't apply anymore to \"high\" interest rate environment for next few years. Around a year ago, we could borrow multiple years of money at rate < 1% via selling SPX options box spreads (note: SPX options will not get exercised before due date) and use them to deploy this strategy to big tech stocks *now*. Assuming 5% risk-free return, this will net us a risk-free 4% for every 1x borrowing. Not recommending borrowing a lot (no risk on paper doesn't mean no risk in practice), but we can tune our leverage based on our risk appetite. For example, 2x leverage means a risk free 9% return for deploying this strategy to the tech and penny stocks.\n\nTip 3: This strategy doesn't work on some (not all) meme stocks like GME, AMC, UPST etc. due to the put leaps costing more than the call leaps.", "id": "uztia7", "created_utc": 1653763443.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Terrific!

Tesla succeeding means his own startups are less likely to succeed. So his short position is essentially him clapping back at Elon by saying without saying that he's wrong and that batteries are the wrong way forward. I disagree, independent of having a vested interest in Tesla's stock that I own potentially coloring my view here, in that while hydrogen will eventually dominate how we manage energy at scale (fusion when we figure that out, and then graphene tech for a variety of applications which have a net positive on hydrogen tech too), but the current means of dealing with hydrogen from an energy standpoint is not a good one.  \n\n\nIt's true, hydrogen's energy density and efficiency curve is better than batteries. It's also the most abundant element in the entire universe and you can convert water through electrolysis into component hydrogen and oxygen; and with so much of the world being water, the supply is practically limitless. But hydrogen has a huge upstream cost and a downstream cost, so for a consumer, its a pretty bad technology. For corporations and big industry, arguably its not. Also, Elon has stated in the past that he'd be interested in doing an electric plane but has since opted not to. I would imagine that his statements about this are roughly around the time Bill/Bezos were looking at hydrogen and planes and other mobility options, and saw him as a massive threat to their interests because Musk's companies are disruptive as all heck. Thus, Gates then opening a short position against Tesla makes, in a way, sense. Bezos is a different brand of petty, but I think he's smart enough to at least understand that opening up negative investment positions against Musk's companies is a stupid play and seems to have avoided that entirely as far as we know (which is pretty damn smart of him, considering how dumb BlOrgin can be).", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Most of the words hydrogen comes from  Methane gas (natural gas).

The fact that they plan a huge stock buyback is also a good sign of its health, in my opinion.\n\nYes, a couple of bad quarters could be bad for the company.
