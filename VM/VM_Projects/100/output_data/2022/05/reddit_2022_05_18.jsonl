Suggesting that institutional investors are doing worse than retail because they're younger doesn't make sense - someone who has done it 60 hours per week for 10 years is going to know more than someone who looks at their investments for 30mins every two weeks for 20 years. \n\nLike I said, an analyst's quarterly accuracy =/= an analyst's performance, and retail should not be taking reports out of context anyway. If an analyst publishes a note that's the 15th chapter of a complex topic but someone didn't read the other 14, of course it's going to come off as incomplete, and there are a lot of nuances one must be aware of to fully grasp it.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not concatenating. Not sure where you're getting that from. It seems like a word with a lot of letters that has nothing to do with what I said. \n\nAnalysts have been really wrong/off-base during any bubble related to evolving market conditions. Look at all the A-rated mortgage backed securities in the financial meltdown of late 2000's. \n\nAnalysts have been way off base & trying to play catch up since the pandemic began. They were behind the curve and many investment pros, funds & analysts were underperforming retail investors in 2020 & 2021. Then, they tried to catch up to retail by developing adjustment factors for their models in \"ESG\" & \"social sentiment\" factors, reading WSB & scraping reddit for ticker mentions. Now, they're following retail off a cliff because they can't stop talking about tech/growth stocks almost all day, every day, even though most of the retail community they follow & try to factor in don't care whether their stocks go down 50% if they expect the stocks will be higher in the next 25 years from now. \n\nThe most recent example of analysts being out of touch and off in the wrong direction was WMT's big market shock yesterday, where for some reason many are just now figuring out that margins matter, because that's how inflation will begin to force its way through the economy. If retail cannot keep its margins up, it will have to raise prices even more, and wages will have to go up if spending is constricted due to prices, and the inflationary spiral will become entrenched. That's the WMT surprise shock that's currently caught analysts by surprise, that is taking down the market today.\n\nI'm not sure who would listen to analysts right now, if you don't understand their model and their strengths and weaknesses. This is exactly the kind of market where Buffett's saying about how you can tell who's been swimming naked when the tide goes out is true.

Analysts working off models that actually don't fit the current unusual pandemic & post-pandemic market & monetary environments aren't likely to be the most perspicacious forecasters.\n\nFew analysts that were piling into WMT seem to have anticipated that margins are hit during inflationary periods. So this week, a lot of miscalculations seem to be due to analysts just learning for the first time that inflation appears in hits to profit margins. In the past couple of years, whether or not you could maintain a supply chain counted, for example. Then, retail traders made social media likability a big deal, so that some companies became focused on new ESG campaigns. Now, the ability of a company's leadership to keep up operating margins during a period of inflation is where you're seeing a divergence between expectation & performance. Analysts in a way are just now (re)learning that margins matter, and a company's inability to keep up the E in their P/E during inflation might be more important than being likable on social media. \n\nCompanies like Walmart are faced with raising prices way more than Dollar Generals or keeping up a standard of hires, wages & benefits that are historically high for them. In general, whether or not inflation is durable and how bad it gets, depends upon whether wages increase/stay higher or prices increase/stay high.

If you trade enough you get them but the problem is when you trade a lot you also lose a lot.\n\nWhat I would recommend to start is look at SPY (link below) and/or QQQ daily to get an idea of gains and losses. Basically when the market is flat both calls and puts lose money but if market moves in either direction (1-2%) and if you time it correctly you can end up with a quick 100 - 400% gain. Granted timing is very hard so if you trade this way you will have many more losers than winners when you first start.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/options?p=SPY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/options?p=SPY)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1111249104142189}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05758912116289139}], "tickers": ["tgt"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.008435915224254131}, {"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|108|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=usgil1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=usgil1)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2847757935523987}, {"body": "Nice", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21313367784023285}, {"body": "Time to plug in your f**king phone.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13096944987773895}, {"body": "Made a killing off TGT and WMT puts.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tgt", "wmt"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": " Nice", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21313367784023285}, {"body": "How u celebrating?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019m not yet my goal is 100k I\u2019m 19 and grinding my ass off for it..we celebrate with apple juice then", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "How are you 19 with 4k in cash??", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I worked a lot when I was 18", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s what\u2019s up brother.
