Under his (and Ballmer's) leadership, Microsoft was a hostile giant that used its vast resources to undercut and crush competition unethically- and even illegally in some cases. Netscape, Stac (Stacker disk compression), Ichitaro, AIM, IBM's OS/2 and Lotus 1-2-3- these were all innovative products that were killed by Microsoft's underhanded tactics and not simply because consumers preferred them- FUD, bundling, blatant copying, or in some cases adding in obfuscated hacks that would break compatibility or crash with DOS/Windows. They even helped fund SCO's infamous lawsuits against Linux *users*- not just Linux software vendors, but actual customers (and even nonprofits) using Linux. Microsoft had a [notoriously hostile relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) with both open source and open standards back in its early days- they tried to kill Java's portability (J/Direct), open web (ActiveX, HTML and CSS extensions, plus Internet Explorer \"quirks\"), email protocols, office file format extensions that add little value to the end user but just break compatibility with 3rd party and older MS Office versions, etc.\n\nNeedless to say Microsoft of the 90s and 2000s was a very destructive company and competed primarily by using scorched earth tactics and poisoning the well- instead of providing the optimal choice for consumers. Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft rarely innovated or helped move the industry forward. (Worth noting that Microsoft under Nadella has pulled a complete 180 in terms of friendliness towards open source and standards and they make much, much better products overall)\n\nWhen Gates retired, he took these same tactics and applied it to his foundation, and employed them against competitors or obstacles of investment interests. The Gates Foundation isn't just his tax haven and goodwill PR, but also a means to exert influence and power as it often mixes \"contributions\" and \"investments\" without any concern for conflicts of interest- such as lobbying to strengthen patent laws while investing in big pharma.
