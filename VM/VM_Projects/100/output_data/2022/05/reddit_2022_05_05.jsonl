Under his (and Ballmer's) leadership, Microsoft was a hostile giant that used its vast resources to undercut and crush competition unethically- and even illegally in some cases. Netscape, Stac (Stacker disk compression), Ichitaro, AIM, IBM's OS/2 and Lotus 1-2-3- these were all innovative products that were killed by Microsoft's underhanded tactics and not simply because consumers preferred them- FUD, bundling, blatant copying, or in some cases adding in obfuscated hacks that would break compatibility or crash with DOS/Windows. They even helped fund SCO's infamous lawsuits against Linux *users*- not just Linux software vendors, but actual customers (and even nonprofits) using Linux. Microsoft had a [notoriously hostile relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) with both open source and open standards back in its early days- they tried to kill Java's portability (J/Direct), open web (ActiveX, HTML and CSS extensions, plus Internet Explorer \"quirks\"), email protocols, office file format extensions that add little value to the end user but just break compatibility with 3rd party and older MS Office versions, etc.\n\nNeedless to say Microsoft of the 90s and 2000s was a very destructive company and competed primarily by using scorched earth tactics and poisoning the well- instead of providing the optimal choice for consumers. Under Gates' leadership, Microsoft rarely innovated or helped move the industry forward. (Worth noting that Microsoft under Nadella has pulled a complete 180 in terms of friendliness towards open source and standards and they make much, much better products overall)\n\nWhen Gates retired, he took these same tactics and applied it to his foundation, and employed them against competitors or obstacles of investment interests. The Gates Foundation isn't just his tax haven and goodwill PR, but also a means to exert influence and power as it often mixes \"contributions\" and \"investments\" without any concern for conflicts of interest- such as lobbying to strengthen patent laws while investing in big pharma.

Sardinia is a bit remote, with a sea and beaches that can be compared to tropical islands. The northern mountains offer plenty of skiing or mountaineering options in a very relaxing environment. Sicily and the south in general are packed with millennia old relics of Greek and Roman ruins. We're the country with the highest count of castles. You can eat amazing food everywhere and they are really distinctive of the place you're in. We've been a divided country for centuries, so each region (that are often smaller than an average US city) has its culture, food, landscape, habits, dialect. I think that Italy is one of the most diverse countries in the world. We are in the middle of Mediterranean sea so the climate is usually good or very good. Not too hot, not too cold. I would just advice to visit big cities but to live far from them. Rome, Naples, Venice, Florence, Milan, all of them are beautiful and unique, but we're also a very busy country and when things become too big they become chaotic and they lose the best part of being italian: the \"small factor\".

At least this is both what I hear from friends and what I experienced in my life. Places that are less friendly to strangers are Sardinia (they're really jelous of their gem homeland), Veneto, Lombardia, Liguria, Trentino. The shouther you go, the friendlier people is. As I said, people is people and you can find really friendly people everywhere as much as assholes everywhere. I think that Emilia Romagna (and Marche) are both more relaxed and richer, so they are the perfect balance. The north is richer but less friendly. The south is friendlied but more rural.

Tesla is projecting to sell 20million cars/year by 2030. let's say they miss this target by a LARGE amount and only do 5million cars. that's about 250billion in revenue (50k ASP per car). if they maintain their 20% operating margin (which they will probably exceed), that's about 50billion in profit.
