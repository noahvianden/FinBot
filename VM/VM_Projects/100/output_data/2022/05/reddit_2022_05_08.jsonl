But I honestly think that at the end of the day the Apple car project will be nothing but a giant waste of money that will probably never return any kind of profit. I mean, consider this:\n\n* There's a lot of new EV companies out there, but only 1 of them has ever achieved consistent profitability, Tesla, and it took them well over 10+ years to do that. \n\n* Apple is jumping into the EV market very late. They don't even have a single car factory, they haven't even announced a car model that they'll bring to the market in the distant future. The competition meanwhile that previously ignored EV's is collectively throwing in tens of billions of dollars into EV/battery research each year. Point being by the time Apple is finally ready to bring an EV to market there will be a ton more competition in the space then there is today.\n\n* Apple's brand is realistically not going to help them much at selling cars. Tesla's brand is already basically the Apple of the car space, in that they get a ton of free advertising in social media, and people see them as the #1 premium EV automaker. If the average person wants the best EV they'll probably look at Tesla, just as if someone wants the best smartphone they'll probably look at Apple because of their reputation in that space. This point goes back to the 2nd point somewhat, in that Apple's brand would have been a lot more helpful at selling cars if they hadn't given Tesla such a huge head start now that they're selling several hundred thousand cars a quarter.\n\nAbout the only way I can see the Apple car division ever returning a profit for investors in a reasonable time period is if Apple can solve level 5 self driving multiple years before anyone else.

I just think FSD is a long time away. What's more possible is if the external environment is modified to a standard for ML to recognize. \n\nfor example, roads were built to facilitate the modern car. now electronic signals or visual cues can be built on top of roads and in future cars to allow autonomous driving to happen, which also means autonomous driving can only happen in defined regions like cities and not in the wild.\n\nI think that's one way autonomous driving can happen.

Whenever the market grinded higher, despite whatever had caused it to go down initially, people would say \"Don't fight the Fed.\"\n\nNow, the Fed is reversing its easy money policy, raising interest rates, and starting QT. So if the logic remains the same, should we not fight the Fed? Instead of buy the dips, it seems like we should sell the rips.\n\nThe market environment is completely different from the past decade+. For the first time in a long, long time, we have inflation that isn't going away.\n\n1. The war in Ukraine is exacerbating food and fuel inflation. Even if the war stops tomorrow, inflation won't just magically go down. It will take months to play out.\n2. Supply chains are still messed up. China has locked down major cities like Shanghai, and their 0 tolerance policy on Covid doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. This is also worsening the inflation issue.\n3. The Fed has no choice but to raise interest rates. The economy is still \"strong\" and unemployment is low, so they will keep raising until something changes.\n4. Beyond raising interest rates, they are also starting QT, effectively sucking money out of the system (the opposite of QE).\n\nWe haven't had a situation like this before. \"This time is different\". The fear is palpable, and I know many people don't know what to do right now. I'm not sure how this situation reverses itself any time soon. There's too much contagion in financial markets.\n\nIs this the start of a secular bear market like we saw from 1966 - 1982, or 2000 - 2009? How does this situation get better from here? I'm just not seeing it.\n\n**EDIT:** I would also like to add, I am a firm believer that the stock market has an intrinsic value, and it can go up without the Fed printing money or setting interest rates lower. The problem is, without Fed intervention, I don't see why P/E ratio's should be higher than 15x on the S&P (Assuming interest rates above 3% - which the 10Y is already at). This is the historical average. \n\nFor 2022, EPS estimates for the S&P this year are around 240. So 240 x 15 P/E = S&P 3600. This is assuming no recession.

This tendency is already ingrained in the US education system and it takes several months of training to shake it of on new recruits. This is particularly bad in R&D, my  secondary field, because of its intrinsic nature nobody can brake up an unknown solution in \"tasks\", nor really develop a solution in a vacuum without other aspects of the problem, outside the proper area of expertise,   the guys popping up in your office with random product related questions... \n\n2) Greatly reduces team cohesion, empathy and overall team efficiency, basically having a lot, a mean one order of magnitude more, integration issues. Everybody hides behind  \"I have done my task\" but nobody takes ownership of the product not working or not even progressing.\n\n3) Pro activity and leadership in the team has basically disappeared, the collective power of many minds working together has been replaced by a loosely define \"common direction\" with nobody really buying in a collective solution for the product.\n\n4) Mentoring is GONE! we specifically required all our more senior and brilliant people to engage in mentoring much younger, out of school, employees. Pretty much the answer from  teleworking has been the preparation of some standard package, once and for all, from the mentor and the same package been fed to any different trainee. This does not work for so many reasons, starting from imposing mentor bias on the new minds (we hire them because we bet on their own innovation capability not to curb or mold their innovation to the mentor one), to not recognizing very faint voices of brilliant solutions from , yes, introvert new hires.\n\n5)  Introvert excuse. I am sick and tired of association between being introvert and the advantage of working from remote. I have been dealing with introvert brilliant people for 40 years, to the point that we consider it as a clear sign of great potentials. We protect and nurse this IN THE OFFICE, with proper spaces and arrangements of the workspaces by \" attitude\" and gently encouraging the most introvert to recognize their own empowerment during meeting and discussions. We value power of ideas and solutions not laud voices or quirk jokes, establish that once and for all and introvert people will bloom.\n\n6) I know that my case may not be the standard for big corporate, but is surely the MOST common in all the R&D I have been exposed to or interacted with. After reading the title, my fist reaction was calling apple director of AI excuse for leaving BS\\^3. You do not get to that position without the capability of leading a team of brilliant introverts, without focusing on product instead of tasks, and without a good understanding of the need to interact with your team through multiple levels, including personal.  \n\nMost likely the Work-Life balance for the person went on a different direction after starting teleworking, and he/she recognized a shift in priorities. Fine and good but has nothing to do with the telework issue in general.  Just to be clear, telework is a TOOL a very good tool to balance a team and make it more efficient, BUT IS NOT, by a long shot the path to greater company productivity.

How many mentors are not overwhelmed with other deliverables and meetings and never available? How many companies assign mentees *without removing any other deliverable* from the mentor?

There has been a long tradition of remote software development that has built great tools for remote collaboration, but the idea of remote collaboration on hardware design is new. \n\nThat being said, there are tools that can accommodate remote mechanical design just as easily as software. Since the pandemic I have been a product owner for a team of fully remote engineers developing consumer electronics products, with most team members being straight from school or coming from other industries. No one has ever met each other in person. We use a cloud based parametric modeling platform that lets every team member see changes in the assembly as they occur in realtime. We use cloud based design notebooks with engineering mathematics plugins that let the whole team check the work and reference the results of a teammate's work in their own calculations. When our PCB designer wanted to move the SoC to allow for some better component placement, it took less than an hour for the team to confirm the change could be accommodated in the thermal design by moving some vent slots and mounting bosses... No one involved was in the same time zone.\n\nIt sounds to me like there are a lot of investments your teams could make in improving their remote productivity.

We are doing the full stack, but the GUI is all in a mobile app, which is a different team, so our firmware subteam interfaces with the mechanical design through myself and the PCB designer, and follow a pretty traditional remote agile workflow.\n\nThe team has been through two product inception processes. In both cases the concept existed already and the question was \"what would it take to make something that can do X?\". Both products were step-change improvements on already existing solutions, so most of the functional requirements were well understood, but there was a clean sheet for architecture and design. \n\nAs for price point, costing is something that is baked into the product design from the beginning... Manufacturing cost estimates are pulled from the model and update my costing estimates in real time, and we do design competitions between various manufacturing methods for every component in the design that score on sustainability as well as manufacturing cost. With so much of the BOM cost being PCB components, there is also a strong emphasis on making the design around the PCB highly parametric, so that when we inevitably find a component is suddenly skyrocketing in price, we can quickly reevaluate the mechanical, thermal, and EMI design around a new power regulator, or capacitor form factor, or microprocessor. Currently, our physical design is pretty much done unless changes are needed, so  the mechanical engineers are spending time researching component datasheets for the PCB designer, with the goal of prequalifying drop-in replacement alternative components\ud83d\ude02 \n\nAs for training, initial training is job shadowing over video call with screen sharing. All the tools we use have good tutorials, and most of the team has already run though them before they started. After that, it is realtime mentorship and coaching.  I think the most important aspect for us has been having everyone working in shared environments, where both the process and results of everyone's work is visible to the rest of the team... A poorly parametrized model that breaks as soon as the design around it changes is immediately obvious to everyone, but at the same time, a new team member trying to ensure their model doesn't break has lots of examples to look at for reference of how to do it right.

TQQQ won't reverse split for no reason at $30. It will reverse split when TQQQ is approaching $0 to prevent liquidation of the fund. In my example the 1k shares after a reverse split COULD end up worth $30k, which is $30/share, meaning that the reverse split share price would have been 1/5 of $30 or $6. $6 x 5k shares = $30k. Reverse splitting at 1 share for every 5 shares currently in existence will get you 1k shares. 1k shares at $30 = $30k. 10 contracts are less than 50 contracts. Therefore, even if the share price is $30 after a reverse split they will only be able to write 1/5 the number of calls as they originally could meaning 1/5 the amount of premium collected.

The people looking at AI really know what the fuck they\u2019re taking about. \n\nThe only ones here who doesn\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about is you. \n\nBitch and moan about how \u201cher funds are 7,0000000% down from ATH\u201d. True. Because her fund was up 150% when S&P was up 15%. The signature fund ARKK is up more in 5 years than VTI or SPY. And, this bear market has more to with how stupid the accelerated market growth was in the last several years, the logistics nightmare the COVID pandemic caused, and goddamned Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine than it does Cathie being good or bad at her job. \n\nBut but but \u201cshe got lucky with Tesla! If it wasn\u2019t for TSLA she wouldn\u2019t have anything!\u201d \n\nShut the fuck up already dude. We\u2019re all looking for that one magic stock to pop. That\u2019s why we have YOLO flair. She YOLO\u2019d into Tesla and she was right. Good. P.S. You can\u2019t bitch about Cathie AND Elon. Choose one. \n\nShe\u2019s also said since day one that these were tech, growth companies. Both tech and growth are inherently highly volatile. That\u2019s the deal. \n\nSo, I\u2019m summary, you\u2019re either an ignorant asshole who doesn\u2019t know a goddamned thing about how this shit works, or you\u2019re a sexist prick who never gets laid without your fleshlight, or you\u2019re just a curmudgeonly misanthrope who will never be happy as long as someone is living the life you were too cowardly or dumb to live yourself.\n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t like her. But I really don\u2019t like you either, and at least she\u2019s rich.\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards, whoever you generous bastards are!\n\nEdit: this was written before the epic dumpster fire of this week.

{"title": "The Current State of the Market", "selftext": "Three ingredients required for a bear market according to Marty Zweig- extreme overvaluation of equities, an inverted yield curve, and extreme deflation.\n\nClearly we had (and still to an extent have) 1, but this still looks like a valuation reset and not a precursor to a major recession. \n\nObviously this has been one hell of a correction but the idea that a correction is always 5-10% was always idiotic in the first place.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t subscribe to the standard \u201ca bear market is any decline over 20%\u201d thinking. A real bear market precedes a recession. A correction brings multiples inline with earnings and sentiment to a normalized level while the economy remains in tact. To me that\u2019s the difference.\n\nBoth multiples and sentiment tend to overshoot to the downside in a correction. A major clue that we hadn\u2019t bottomed in January on that initial 1,000 point down day on the Dow was that people were smugly saying things like \u201c this is what capitulation looks like.\u201d No. True capitulation isn\u2019t recognizable because it\u2019s not just irrational people panicking, it\u2019s you panicking.\n\nEvery correction is different. Given the insane run of the prior two years this one had to be much larger in magnitude to get people bearish and actually reset valuations.\n\nI\u2019m still not convinced hiking rates from 0 to 1.5-2% is going to be enough to sink the economy at least in the near term and the bond market seems to agree.\n\nCould the correction continue? Sure. Like I said previously, stocks in some areas are still very expensive. As many have noted, the historic trailing P/E on the S&P is close to 15 and it currently stands at close to 23. There are no iron clad rules, though, and the fact that most of the megacap tech stocks still trade well above this level and comprise an outsized percentage of the S&P will distort that figure.\n\nBut whether you believe this is going to be an extended bear market a la 1929 or 1973-74 or just a giant, scary correction a la 1962 or 1987 depends entirely upon whether you think a major recession is imminent and I just don\u2019t see compelling evidence that that\u2019s the case.\n\nNo, simply saying the fed is hiking rates and inflation is going to continue to rage at 8%+ and we are definitely going into recession isn\u2019t enough. That\u2019s just speculation based on Zero Hedge articles. You\u2019ve got to look at the short end of the yield curve which continues to track the fed perfectly and has not signaled any alarms yet.\n\nAs for the market and all of the volatility\nwe saw last week. That is sometimes what a bottom looks like after a major decline. Check a chart of October-December of 1987 as the market tested and retested the lows until it finally bounced. A very similar thing happened after the 1962 crash as well when the market crashed around June but didn\u2019t bottom right around the June lows until October. That\u2019s very likely where we are. A major crash from these levels seems highly improbable and some stocks look very cheap.\n\nAfter the covid crash all anybody talked about was the imminent \u201cretest of the lows.\u201d Rest assured when everyone is looking for the same technical level It\u2019s not going to happen. Now? I haven\u2019t heard a single person call this merely a retest of the lows. Most everyone I read buys into the runaway inflation/recession narrative hook, line and sinker and assumes we\u2019re going a lot lower before we go back up. But if you pull back a chart of most indices a retest is exactly what this looks like.\n\nMake no mistake- despite what the S&P and Dow look like we\u2019ve already experienced a crash far worse than most others in many areas. The way the bottom opened up for the most loved and most over inflated growth stocks over the past three months cannot be overstated. Facebook went from $320 to $180 in six weeks. Stop talking about the impending crash.

Well of course raise interest rates, that should cool things down nicely. However if your poor like me then your probably renting from a much wealthier person. When I look at the numbers buying a house is an easy way to cut costs, a mortgage is half what I pay on rent, add in some maintenance and its still an easy choice. But banks are raising rates you say, we are in a bubble you say, thats what everyone says. Except there are a whole generation of renters waiting for a dip in prices to buy a first home, combined with instiutional landlords buying up anything they can. Just my stupid opinion but I think we are in a similar situation (price wize) to when the term \"irrational exuberance\" was coined. They would need to at least match inflation rate to tame inflation and that wouldnt go down well at the polls so thats not an option.

This is the value of final investment minus the cost of rent.\n\n\\- Calculated rent cost for 14 years: $160,092.00\n\n\\- Total difference invested over buying for the 14 years: $57,355.38\n\n\\- Calculated final investment: $205,047.66\n\nHomeowner comes out with $32,172.62 profit.  This involves selling the home and is the cost of home at time of sale minus remaining mortgage and total cost paid thus far.\n\n\\- Cost of home: $300,000\n\n\\- Remainder of Mortgage: $50,480.00\n\n\\- Cost of owning: $217,347.38\n\nNow lets take a look at a scenario where the maintenance cost is more realistic.  I own two homes, and my maintenance cost is $165 per month for one, and the other is $185 per month.  This monthly contribution basically calculates the monthly cost of all appliances, floors, roofs, paint, etc. based on their life expectancy.  For example, a fridge cost $1,600, has a life expectancy of 12 years, so the monthly contribution to maintenance would be $11.  Dryer costs $1,000, has a life expectancy of 13 years, so the monthly contribution to maintenance would be $6.41.  I do a lot of the maintenance myself, like installing vinyl flooring, so my numbers are a bit cheaper than average.  To account for this, i'll double the $185 value and estimate a $370 maintenance cost per month.  Which is still overkill because it doesn't cost $1,600 to install a fridge.\n\n*Buying home vs renting single bedroom apartment ($370 maint fee):*\n\nRenter is now negative $26,488.46. This is the value of final investment minus the cost of rent.\n\n\\- Calculated rent cost for 14 years: $160,092.00  \n\\- Total difference invested over buying for the 14 years: $35,415.38  \n\\- Calculated final investment: $133,603.54\n\n  \nHomeowner comes out with $54,012.62 profit.  This involves selling the home and is the cost of home at time of sale minus remaining mortgage and total cost paid thus far.\n\n\\- Cost of home: $300,000  \n\\- Remainder of Mortgage: $50,480.00  \n\\- Cost of owning: $195,507.38\n\nA parametric evaluation of this scenario changing only the maintenance cost finds that the break even between owning and renting is a maintenance cost of $482.19 per month.  At that cost, both the homeowner and renter come out with $35,166.20 each.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nObviously, this is comparing two extreme examples. $70,000-$300,000 is not normal.  My parents bought their house in 1991 for $110,000, and it's now $340,000.  That's less of an increase over 31 years than this home saw in 14. But also, it is not always feasible to live in a one bedroom apartment.  Obviously there is a middle ground where renting is financially more responsible than buying, but there are too many variables to flat out state one is better than the other in all situations. It might just be the case that it's better for you right now.  \n\nLastly, I think your estimated maintenance of $500-$800 per month is not based off anything.  Using that value, I could buy all new appliances every five years, new floors and paint every ten years, a new roof every fifteen years, a yard crew every other weekend, repair my foundation every fifteen years, and rewire my whole house every fifteen years.
