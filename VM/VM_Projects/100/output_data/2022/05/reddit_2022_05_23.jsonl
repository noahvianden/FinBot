{"title": "Why Lululemon will tank on earnings (june 2nd) and how you can profit (puts)", "selftext": "This is not financial advice, but do exactly as I say and you will get very rich, I pinky-promise.\n\nPosition: 10 puts with 270 strike price and june 3 expiry.\n\n**\u2018Athleisure\u2019 is not a moat**\n\nLululemon sells yoga pants. Fashion media widely credits Lululemon with inventing, and then commendably exploiting, \u2018athleisure\u2019: combining yoga pants and other workout apparel with a vest or jacket so you can look as hot as you think you do in the gym while doing non-sports related activities. You might recognize this trend as something you have furiously masturbated to. Athleisure might be the single biggest fashion trend of the last five years and it got an extra boom with pandemic lockdowns, because who wants to wear tight jeans while binging on Ozark and mayonnaise.\n\nHowever, inventing the idea that Hailey Baldwin can combine expensive yoga pants with a Balenciaga jacket for a fresh look is not a moat. Over the last few years countless brands have jumped on this trend. Each with their own little subcategory that they\u2019re catering to, for instance, really fat people who should probably refrain from wearing sportswear altogether.\n\n**Unless you work behind the dumpster at Wendy\u2019s, you\u2019re not wearing yoga pants to work**\n\nAlso, athleisure is probably a thing of the past anyway. In fashion blogs, return to the office is the single most discussed topic these days. Because what will we wear? Not the same stuff as pre-covid, because we have gotten fat, even fatter than before. Also, we have grown accustomed to the idea that track pants, joggers and slippers are things that are perfectly suited for pretty much any activity. Most fashion blogs recognize this and are anticipating that work clothes will be a lot more relaxed from now on, dress will be a little less formal and conservative and more relaxed and creative. Retailers say demand backs this up.\n\nHowever, that is not the same thing as wearing yoga pants while walking the dog, which is what made Lululemon great.\n\nLululemon seems to recognize the days of overpriced yoga pants selling like hotcakes are over, so now they\u2019re trying to do something else: fit into this new trend by trying to get us to wear sportswear to the office. Their site now is full of pants that look formal but are actually jogging pants, or button down shirts made from a breathable fabric with tiny holes in them.\n\nI don\u2019t think it will take off. What I think will happen is a continuation of the trend that brands will create a lot more casual blazers and pants with elastic bands and what not. What I don\u2019t think will happen is people wearing jogging pants and golf shirts to work.\n\n**Men want to fuck, not wear, Lululemon**\n\nThat brings me to the bigger problem. One of the big pillars of LLL\u2019s growth strategy is that they want to quadruple sales in the men\u2019s category. The problem with that is the LLL logo is either a woman doing down dog, or a vagina, depending on how you look at it. Furthermore this brand is and will forever be associated with tight asses in yoga pants. Just go to their website right now and tell me the first thing you see. This is a brand that heterosexual men want to fuck, not wear. I don\u2019t think they can pull it off and I think we will see the first signs of that this quarter.\n\n**Mirror is the dumbest thing since Peloton. Remember Peloton?**\n\nLululemon forked over a half billion in cold hard cash to acquire mirror, a magic mirror that screams at you to do another round of pushups. It\u2019s the most ridiculous thing you have ever seen, it is literally a giant mirror that displays fitness video\u2019s. It is also 1400 dollars with a 40 dollar monthly subscription attached to it. The proposition was preposterous to begin with but with lockdowns being a thing of the past not to mention the recent sweltering heat or, I don\u2019t know, a recession on the way, this is just ridiculousnesses all around. Already sales forecasts are being adjusted, meaning, shredded. It\u2019s not even that this mistake will hurt the company that bad, it\u2019s more of a sign that the people running the company have no idea how to sustain this incredible growth that they have been promising at every earnings call.\n\n**Their running shoes will almost certainly flop**\n\nWhich brings me to another new product, running shoes. Lululemon made a big stink about their new running shoe, the \u2018blissfeel\u2019, a name that will certainly appeal to the coveted male demographic haha not. Some analyst recently claimed the shoes received \u2018generally good reviews\u2019 and \u2018key colors and sizes were sold out, which is a good sign\u2019.\n\nHowever, those claims do not hold up to scrutiny. For one, the shoes being sold out probably just means they\u2019re having supply chain issues, which they already told us about. Also, it\u2019s 2022. Everything receives good reviews, because whoever is doing the reviewing is most likely trying to sell you the stuff as well. With that being said, Blissfeel reviews were middling at best. For instance, Runners World wrote: \u2018The shoe\u2019s lack of a \u2018pop\u2019 is a bit of a bugbear: they don\u2019t feel \u2018dead\u2019 when your foot hits the ground \u2013 far from it \u2013 but with just a little more bounciness from the midsole foam, you\u2019d have a shoe that would potentially make your long runs feel easier \u2013 and your speed sessions faster. To be realistic though \u2013 no one gets it perfect first time and, as Lululemon\u2019s first foray into the running shoe market, we\u2019re genuinely impressed.\u2019\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing \u2013 the consumer does not care at all that this is your first foray into this market. Au contraire mon fr\u00e8re, people want something tried and true from a running shoe. Like Asics. Tom\u2019s guide wrote:\n\n\u2018In today\u2019s world of carbon fiber plates and technical midsole foams, the Lululemon Blissfeel is a pretty basic running shoe, but it\u2019s not pretending to be anything more than this. It\u2019s a solid workhorse, designed for Lululemon fans who want to head out for a run a few times a week, while repping their favorite brand.\u2019\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a roaring endorsement to me.\n\nSo who is this shoe for? Women \u2013certainly not men- who don\u2019t really care about an optimal fit (interestingly, Lululemon actually tries to sell this lack of options as \u2018diversity\u2019, as in, this shoe is for everyone), running technology (see reviews above), a trustworthy brand, or looks, as they look incredibly basic. I am guessing that\u2019s a small market. Then there\u2019s the fact that there\u2019s a lot of shoes out there, especially in the $150 range. Nike Pegasus, Adidas Ultraboost, Hoka\u2019s, Asics.\n\nAlso, who\u2019s running anymore, we did that during the pandemic, now we\u2019re back doing crossfit or whatever. This Q will give us a first glimpse at how these shoes have sold and I\u2019m guessing it won\u2019t be very good.\n\n**Breaking into other continents is hard when you\u2019re not a virus**\n\nAnother part of the LLL strategy is incredible growth in other continents. Which is harder than it sounds. See you can go to Brazil, go into the woods, walk for 50 miles through the rainforest and arrive at a hidden village of 20 people, and you might spot someone wearing a Nike swoosh, or at the very least, they will know what Nike is. I\u2019m not sure that is the case with Lululemon. It is not easy to break into new markets. In my not to be named European country, there is only a single store. Besides a few die hard yogis, the brand awareness is virtually non-existent. LLL\u2019s plan so far just seems to be \u2018expand into Europe? Let\u2019s just do it\u2019 which is a Nike slogan by the way but for a sports brand that\u2019s just not as easy as it is for let\u2019s say a virus from China or Nigeria.\n\n**Nike and Adidas will run them out of their hood**\n\nLululemon is planning to branch out to a bunch of different sports, like tennis and golf. But those sports already have brands. Nike is paying Naomi Osaka $10 million a year, just so you might be persuaded to think that your tennis shorts should have a swoosh on them. These markets are kind of like certain neighborhoods in that you can\u2019t just show up there one day and say hey you know what I like what you guys got going on here let me get a piece of this action, because you might get, you know, yourself killed.\n\n**Freight costs and other supply chain issues**\n\nLast quarter, Lululemon was complaining a bit about how freight costs and supply chain issues were hurting their bottom line. All of their stuff is made in countries like Vietnam and China. This quarter, they will likely complain a lot more.\n\n**American budgets are tighter than yoga pants**\n\nDid you know that a recent Gallup poll has shown that, during an economic downturn, 86% of American families say $120 yoga pants are among the first expenses they might cut back on?\n\n**China lockdowns**\n\nLululemon\u2019s biggest market besides the US is China, where they operate 86 stores (of 500 total) with of course a whole bunch of them in the Shanghai area. China did not have a great quarter this quarter. After more or less inventing covid, they are now the last country on earth to figure out how to deal with it. There were a bunch of lockdowns and consumer confidence isn\u2019t doing so well. I doubt they bought very many overpriced yoga pants this quarter. Maybe some people got a mirror though. I hope the classes are available in Chinese. Also, from what I heard the Chinese attitude towards work is decidedly un-relaxed, so wearing joggers to work is probably out of the question as well.\n\n**Retail will get 'punched in the face'**\n\n\u201cA lot of CEOs have come on TV and said \u2018oh I have lots of pricing power and I can do whatever I want and make a lot of money\u2019,\u201d Bullard said Friday, [in an interview on the Fox Business Network.](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/feds-bullard-says-recession-will-only-come-if-theres-a-large-shock-to-economy)\n\n\u201cBut I think some of them are going to get punched in the face here with the fact that consumers have to react\u201d to higher inflation, he said.\n\nEarlier on yahoo, analyst ADRIENNE YIH: \"Yeah, they have extreme pricing power. The pants run anywhere between $118 up to $128. And so that is, that is an extraordinarily high price for arguably a legging.\"\n\n**P/E ratio 36**\n\nJefferies analyst Randal Konik wrote in a note to clients that Lululemon\u2019s plans \u2018will require an added level of execution prowess, as well as stability in the broader macroeconomic environment, that may be difficult to attain\u2019. As your portfolio might have noticed, that stability has indeed proven rather difficult. Even though Lulu has already fallen a lot, it is still priced for enormous growth. Expectations are incredibly high. If the numbers are good, not great, the market will rightfully judge it as \u2018terrible\u2019 and it will tank. Which is why you might consider getting puts.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nLululemon apparel is too expensive at a time where people are cutting back on consumer discretionary and are shifting expenses from \u2018at home\u2019 to \u2018at the office\u2019. There are plenty of cheaper alternatives, their shoes are terrible, Mirror is preposterous, men don\u2019t want to wear vagina\u2019s, joggers will not be worn to the office, supply chain issues and freight costs will weigh heavily on the bottom line, and China is not buying anything, all while the stock is (still) priced for enormous growth. Like a girl with a big ass in yoga pants in one of the many BangBros videos about yoga class, Lululemon earnings will get their back blown out.\n\nPosition: 10 puts with 270 strike price and june 3rd expiry, 5 puts 270 expiry june 17th", "id": "uw1jbn", "created_utc": 1653316255.0, "score": 138, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|494|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uw1jbn)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uw1jbn)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09322915226221085}, {"body": "Not disputing that it will tank and that mirror is fully retarded but you are dead wrong about their mens clothes.

Yeah, it's more than I'd like to pay for a pair of leggings but they're tailored in a way that just fit different and make you look better.\n\nMy gym pants are Lulu and I've had them for like 12 years now wearing them 3-5x times a week and they fit and look just as good as the day I bought them. Lulu items tend to retain their shape and stretch where as I haven't found that with other brands. They may look great (or even better) after the first few wears but after a bit they lose their shape.\n\nMy 5+ year old shorts look brand new and I've worn them at least 100 times.\n\nI've gotten a few duds but the majority of the stuff I've gotten there has been near perfect.\n\nThe only time I need to replace my pants is when I stain them or sit in tree sap or something. \n\nIt also has great resale value on community marketplaces.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This^", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.043231893330812454}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3531123101711273}, {"body": "If it\u2019s tanking why are you buying ITM puts?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41296908259391785}, {"body": "I\u2019m not surprised this sub has so many men purchasing \u201cABC\u201d pants for their wife\u2019s boyfriends.
