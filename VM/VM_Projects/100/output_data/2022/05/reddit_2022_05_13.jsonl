I opened my first Etrade account in 2000, so there was relatively cheap trading ($10 or so if I recall) back then, and we still had a bust.\n\nSecond, I don't think we should assume that more people investing should lead to higher prices.  There are enough alternatives for our money that it isn't clear to me why more people would equal a lower rate of return being accepted by investors.  This isn't analogous to something like the housing market, where we all need a roof over our heads and supply and demand is at work.  Stocks are investments, not consumption purchases.  The fact that I'm competing against 10 people instead of 5 doesn't mean I'm okay with a 7% return instead of 10%.

Like I said, Trump absolutely has his issues, but to be so blind to history to not see the issues that have festered in the economy due to Democrat policies and just say \"Republicans wreck economy because bad thing happens during presidency\" is so ahistorical it hurts. The current student loan crisis is a consequence of government backed student loans, pushed by democrats. Our deficit has accelerated massively due to the \"war on poverty\", a \"war\" that created a stagnant poverty rate where the poverty rate previously was declining at a more rapid pace than anywhere else in the world. This \"war\", by the way, was brought on by... wait for it... democrats. More recently, the American economy through 2019 had become the strongest it's been in most peoples' lifetimes, and it got bad when Trump caved to the lockdowns and pushed stimulus and bad monetary policy on us to make up for the lockdown stuff. At first, lockdowns were relatively universal. In a month, they were primarily if not exclusively democrat.

I'm not defending that in any capacity, I called the war on poverty a \"war\" because it was not a war in the traditional sense of the word. Obama had the slowest economic recovery in the last 50 years, and it accelerated under Trump, along with the revival of manufacturing in the US (a dead industry under Obama) and US energy independence, destroyed under Biden. The optimal tax rate is difficult to accurately determine, but economists on both sides have some compelling arguments. I tend to not only respect the Laffer Curve, but I also am of the mind that since the Government is the most inefficient capital dispensary of all, the lower the tax rate the better (within reason, allowing for infrastructure and defense to remain fully funded, but forcing these areas to deploy capital more efficiently). The market inflation situation was created under Trump in response to a situation primarily created by Democrat governors, mayors and members of Congress. The response was too large, but the situation that caused it requires at least equal blame for the current inflation crisis. I can't tell you for sure what Trump did behind closed doors, but before Covid he publicly wanted more restrictive monetary policy so that point is certainly debatable. I just don't have enough information to have a solid POV. If you buy into the identity politics bullshit, then tell me, why are an increasing number of black, hispanic, hmong, and other voters going red while the only group that has remained stagnant are white suburban women? The \"Republicans are all racist homophobes\" line of attack shows not only a lack of critical thought but pure vitriolic behavior. The appeal of the Republican Party is simple: they're not as batshit crazy as the Democrat Party. If I were being honest, I'd vote for Joe Manchin before Mitt Romney any day. I don't like political parties, but the Republican Party far more closely allies itself with my views than the Democrat Party because the official platform is shrinking Government (even tho establishment retards don't do that), lowering taxes, reducing red tape, maintaining a strong military, not tolerating laws being flagrantly disrespected whether at our borders or in our cities, not wanting children to be taught about sex in young grades, etc. Can you name a single positive thing Joe has done since 2021 began? I don't ask that to be obtuse, I just don't think there's much he really has fulfilled his campaign promises in any good way.
