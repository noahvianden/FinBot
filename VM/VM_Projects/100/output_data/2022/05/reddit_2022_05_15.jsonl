Their EPS should increase If they can keep the profit margins, which is likely unless demand drops for retail (recession). \n\nNegatives I can think of:\n1-  Competition in cloud gets tougher, AWS loses market share\n\n2- Overinvestment in warehouses causes margins to drop\n\n3- Amazon ceases to be more convenient than other retailers.

You're talking entirely about growth of various metrics: assets, revenues etc\n\nI guess that's fine if the growth resumes AND the market continues to prefer growth and mostly ignore profitability, but what if it doesn't?\n\nBased on what's happening to other stocks, it seems that the market has become skeptical about growth, so multiples are shrinking. That's bad for growth stocks and especially bad for very large ones like AMZN. Big companies are harder to grow, eventually and the pandemic that goosed AMZN sales is now mostly over, making comps tougher.\n\nThe reason value investors focus on profitability is that growth is both hard to sustain and hard to predict. Some folks here and on Wall Street take comfort in the supposed rigour of DCF analysis, but those are inevitably just a big stack of assumptions about growth.\n\nAmazon is huge and dominant, but outside AWS, it's never been very profitable. CEO Bezos is famous for insisting that just getting bigger was the answer and for a long time, he looked right, because AMZN was taking over the world and anybody who balked about its profitability ratios missed the giant run up that made him the world's richest man.\n\nUltimately, making money should matter, as expressed by things like net earnings margin, ROE,  ROA etc. \n\nThe good news is that there isn't too much net debt relative to cash flow, but net profit margin is under 5%, slightly better than a grocery store.

I'm not saying AMZN should trade like a grocery stock, just that it's still super expensive.\n\nPeter Lynch would say five year earnings growth should be about equal to PE at fair value, yielding a PEG of 1, and recommends finding PEGs below 1.\n\n PEG is imperfect because, like DCF, it depends on estimated growth,  but AMZN's PEG is between 1.3 and 2.7, according to Yahoo Finance and Finviz, who obviously assume different growth rates. Again, not cheap.\n\nROE is decent at over 15% but not stellar.

So whether you hold or not depends on your conviction and what your time window is. \n\nAbout timing: While tech is likely to continue to drop more as the fed makes the next few rate hikes, you have to start looking at whether best of breed tech stocks are going to start bottoming out (which they will before the sector as a whole bottoms out). So one way to approach the decision might be to consider whether you think tech stocks as a whole are close/not close to bottoming.

{"title": "Zoom is fucked.", "selftext": " \n\nIntroduction: \n\nGreetings again fellow crayon munching friends. I have decided that I will be doing one due diligence at least every two weeks. That being said, feel free to follow me or whatever if you want to make sure to see my short due diligences that are founded upon sleep deprivation, amateur investing knowledge, and way too many energy drinks. In the prior weeks I did Coinbase and Occidental Petroleum so feel free to check those out if you have not seen them. This week I will be conducting due diligence on Zoom. I think Zoom is and has been playing on house money for a while and I hope to give a decent picture of why through many munched paint chips and crayons. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 1: Zoom Financials\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gb773316kz81.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=c805b9389b1ba5db0d4a5aa6e080eb8df833ea84\n\nTruthfully, at first glance Zoom\u2019s financials appear pretty solid. Revenues, Net income, operating income, and gross profit all appear healthy, with solid growth the last few years. Revenue\u2019s YoY growth for zoom is 55% from 2021-2022. Gross Profit\u2019s YoY growth for zoom is 66% from 2021-2022. Operating income\u2019s YoY growth is 61% for the same years and net income\u2019s YoY growth is 105%. This appears to be explosive growth on Zoom\u2019s part but I believe these numbers are misleading.\n\nOne reason is that despite the explosive YoY growth for the above financials, Zoom\u2019s Operating Expenses for sales, general, and administrative expenses, also grew at 61% YoY. Simply put, how good is that 61% YoY growth for operating income given that sales, general, and administrative expenses grew by the same percentage YoY. I could certainly be wrong here but in my opinion, a company like Zoom should be able to post lower YoY growth for sales, general, and administrative expenses. It is Zoom after all, their business model involves far fewer physical assets and variable costs. Therefore, I am skeptical of this massive growth in sales, general, and administrative expenses, I do not think it bodes well for their long (or short) term business prospects. \n\nHow does Zoom make money anyone may ask, after all I did not really know, so after a brief Google search using my hairy ape hands, I found out how. \n\nEssentially, all of Zoom\u2019s cash flows come from subscription fees, hardware sales, advertising, and investments into other startups. This is important to note as I transition into my next point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 2: Loss of market share\n\nZoom has made a killing financially by the stranglehold they had on the video conference market as the world was sent into a tailspin from COVID-19. However, this market dominance has dwindled as time has passed as Google Meets has taken over.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rdeyx4l46kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a3b1fb70c1ec4843cf61178331889d794a60129\n\nGoogle Meets currently has 2,747,358 total customers compared to Zoom\u2019s 168,892. Google Meets has a market share of 84.82% of the total video conference market compared to Zoom\u2019s paltry 5.21%. One thing that should be noted with these metrics (assuming they are accurate), is that they do not show the customer list themselves. For example, if Zoom manages to build strong customer relationships, and large companies with thousands of meetings a month choose Zoom over Google, it is okay for Zoom to have far less customers and therefore market share so long as they can keep them. However, I do not see why this would be the case. \n\nAfter all, pull out the orange crayon and take a bite, talk to your wife, your wife\u2019s boyfriend, some random college kid on enough caffeine to kill a horse and ponder what could possibly cause such a thing. Nothing. The answer is nothing. Zoom\u2019s success spawned from a video conference service that offered better ease of use, as well as high quality audio and video output. In the beginning this was lovely as everyone else, including Google, was late to the party. Unfortunately for Zoom though consumers have become more educated and are now flocking to the better products. On top of that more competitors have entered the market and Google Meets puts Zoom to shame. Zoom\u2019s competitive advantage disappeared quicker than the fifth of whiskey in my hand watching the markets last week. Zoom will continue to lose market share to the superior product offered by Google as Google has more talent and money than Zoom. Google will continue to come out on top in this market and will crush Zoom\u2019s share price in the process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ca3yju66kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbb9dfd571fb06e8f86be0a8008b6a8ffb42d662\n\nSource: \n\n[https://www.slintel.com/tech/video-conferencing/g-suite-market-share](https://www.slintel.com/tech/video-conferencing/g-suite-market-share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 3: COVID Caused Conferences are becoming less frequent\n\nAs time goes on and the world continues to emerge from the pandemic, the need for the very service Zoom provides will continue to decline. This tends to be a big deal when the entirety of Zoom\u2019s cash flows come from subscription fees, hardware sales, advertising, as well as investments into startups. Nearly all of Zoom\u2019s cash flows are tied to people using their platform. Cash flows are going to continue to decrease and this will spell disaster for Zoom\u2019s financials in the future thereby crushing the stock price in the process. Personally, I go to a university that went full red coat, commie, CCP, North Korea on all of us students and even at my university we are now completely transitioning back to in person courses next semester. While my personal experience is not statistically significant and is by no means an end all be all predictor for this stuff, I do believe it matters when speaking to friends from other colleges who also are completely back in person full time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 4: Earnings will be a disaster (May 23, after market close)\n\nFor all of the things listed above, I believe that earnings will be an abysmal shitshow. Like the first time we all were rejected by the girl of our dreams, Zoom shareholders are in for a ride on the pain train. The loss of market share from Google and the emergence of the global economies from the pandemic will cause earnings to miss by a wide margin, causing one of those glorious (for us gay bears) massive red dildos in after hours. Then we can sell our puts May 24th and make some easy money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwt47g796kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f0287cfb6eb2c8ad3da29c7dc4dd174c319901a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 5: ARKK is bullish on it\n\nThis is mostly a joke\u2026 mostly. Seriously though Cathie has 8.09% of ARKK in Zoom and that is good enough for me to dislike the stock. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6bvzpjva6kz81.png?width=299&format=png&auto=webp&s=336177a4bd5cc300f53bf5190627e8c80a6af1ea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 6: Cramer likes the stock.\n\nI am going to repeat myself here. Cramer. Likes. The. Stock. This may be my strongest point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5tvpr2c6kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=643ba70a64a1c66c09e61d64cd05c4ee13408a3f\n\nYes this article is from January 26, 2022, but as much of a joke as this is, Cramer really has been a solid leading indicator for what not to do. \n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/26/jim-cramer-these-hard-hit-stocks-now-look-cheap-enough-to-buy.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/26/jim-cramer-these-hard-hit-stocks-now-look-cheap-enough-to-buy.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 7: Jerome Powell grows a pair\n\nSeriously though, if Powell raises interest rates by 75 basis points (or more), the entirety of the stock market will take a massive shit. After all, look at what happened when the Fed announced a 50 bps increase that was already expected by the markets. We have been crushed in equity markets in the weeks since. Where does a high growth technology company like Zoom stand if this happens? I of course do not have the exact answer but I think it is worth noting that this is a possibility and a more likely one now given the horrid CPI data that still came in hotter than expected. Powell reiterated in a recent interview to Marketplace that half-point hikes are likely in June and July. This is not all that surprising but what is chilling to me is that he also stated \u201cwe\u2019re prepared to do more if needed\u201d in that same interview. That is ominous and clearly shows while it may be unlikely, higher than forecasted rate hikes are on the table. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wab087gd6kz81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=30750816d9f9cf501363b1ea3f40f42c50ed371f\n\nSource: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/powell-reiterates-half-point-hikes-are-likely-in-june-and-july](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-12/powell-reiterates-half-point-hikes-are-likely-in-june-and-july)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere I can be wrong:\n\n1. It is entirely possible that the Fed does not raise rates in June and July which would create some serious headwinds for my bearish position.\n2. Zoom creates or adapts their software in such a way that consumers transition back to it.\n3. I am flat out wrong about earnings. Conversely, I am correct but it does not matter and for some god forsaken reason Zoom rips harder than a college kid on their dab pen.\n4. The demand for Zoom conferences remains constant at its current place, or increases.\n5. Any other incredible occurrence occurs, \\*insert famous fuck here\\* buys a 10% stake in Zoom, Covid variant sigma causes a shutdown for much of the economy, etc\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL; DR \n\nZoom makes money from people utilizing their platform. As we emerge from COVID that need declines which will crush cash flows leading to a massive earnings miss on May 23rd. Cathie and Cramer like the stock. Powell raises rates (more than expected) causing a recession that makes Volcker\u2019s rate increases and subsequent recession look like peanuts. All of this considered, Zoom share price will be curb stomped harder than me when I am just trying to enjoy a casual match of Warzone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition: \n\n2 ZM $95 P 6/17", "id": "upx6v7", "created_utc": 1652585151.0, "score": 447, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 329, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|103|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ug4yda/coinbase_is_going_into_the_toilet/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upx05n/zoom_is_fucked/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upx6v7/zoom_is_fucked/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=upx6v7)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=upx6v7)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "as someone in saas sales from nvidia. zoom will never leave the business world / software & tech industry. partnered w/ some of them too\u2026 but hey, this is a bear market it\u2019s prolly going down anyway\ud83d\ude01", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31686559319496155}, {"body": "I don\u2019t buy that Google Meets has that much usage.
