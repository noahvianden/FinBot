Some say P/E is not the right measure to compare these companies, but I am not sure why not\n\n2. It is spending heavily on infrastructure (warehouses and cloud).

They might be the first to electrify their fleet, which would reduce gas and maintenance expenses. \n\nNot sure how inflation impacts Amazon. For retail, I would think they have pricing power. Their EPS should increase If they can keep the profit margins, which is likely unless demand drops for retail (recession). \n\nNegatives I can think of:\n1-  Competition in cloud gets tougher, AWS loses market share\n\n2- Overinvestment in warehouses causes margins to drop\n\n3- Amazon ceases to be more convenient than other retailers.

You're talking entirely about growth of various metrics: assets, revenues etc\n\nI guess that's fine if the growth resumes AND the market continues to prefer growth and mostly ignore profitability, but what if it doesn't?\n\nBased on what's happening to other stocks, it seems that the market has become skeptical about growth, so multiples are shrinking. That's bad for growth stocks and especially bad for very large ones like AMZN. Big companies are harder to grow, eventually and the pandemic that goosed AMZN sales is now mostly over, making comps tougher.\n\nThe reason value investors focus on profitability is that growth is both hard to sustain and hard to predict. Some folks here and on Wall Street take comfort in the supposed rigour of DCF analysis, but those are inevitably just a big stack of assumptions about growth.\n\nAmazon is huge and dominant, but outside AWS, it's never been very profitable. CEO Bezos is famous for insisting that just getting bigger was the answer and for a long time, he looked right, because AMZN was taking over the world and anybody who balked about its profitability ratios missed the giant run up that made him the world's richest man.\n\nUltimately, making money should matter, as expressed by things like net earnings margin, ROE,  ROA etc. \n\nThe good news is that there isn't too much net debt relative to cash flow, but net profit margin is under 5%, slightly better than a grocery store.

I'm not saying AMZN should trade like a grocery stock, just that it's still super expensive.\n\nPeter Lynch would say five year earnings growth should be about equal to PE at fair value, yielding a PEG of 1, and recommends finding PEGs below 1.\n\n PEG is imperfect because, like DCF, it depends on estimated growth,  but AMZN's PEG is between 1.3 and 2.7, according to Yahoo Finance and Finviz, who obviously assume different growth rates. Again, not cheap.\n\nROE is decent at over 15% but not stellar.

So whether you hold or not depends on your conviction and what your time window is. \n\nAbout timing: While tech is likely to continue to drop more as the fed makes the next few rate hikes, you have to start looking at whether best of breed tech stocks are going to start bottoming out (which they will before the sector as a whole bottoms out). So one way to approach the decision might be to consider whether you think tech stocks as a whole are close/not close to bottoming.
