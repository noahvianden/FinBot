I will list the FAANG first and will add more if you can let me know stocks in other sectors, like TGT and WMT?

There are few stocks still holding strong (less than 15% discount), such as WM, KO, ABBV and MCD.

There are about a million reasons... here are some in no particular order\n\n\\#1 - I know this seems really silly, but it has a cool brand. Companies with uncool brands often have a harder time recruiting the best engineering talent. The best engineers make the best products and work hard because they believe in the company/brand. \n\n\\#2 - I think most people think battery charging tech is going to somehow become better, but they don't realize that it can also become worse if the battery chemistry changes. If Samsung, BYD, QS, whoever, builds a battery that can last 2x-3x as long vs current battery tech, NIO can implement this new tech because the have swapping, but others cannot.\n\n\\#3 - I think most people think there is growing competition in the EV industry, which there is, but the majority of the upcoming \"Legacy Auto\" EVs can only go like 300 miles... The vast majority are not going to pay $30k for a car with a range of 300 miles, when a $15k ICE car can go 500+ miles (my car goes 500 miles and that's still not enough for the occasional road trip if I don't want to stop). The NIO ET7 has a 620 mile range and if battery tech improves, it will be a lot easier for Nio to roll out new tech vs competitors who have to do a different cost/benefit analysis... Battery swapping offer a lot more flexibility than people give it credit for.\n\n\\#4 - I think China wants to become a manufacturing/export powerhouse for EVs similar to how they're a manufacturing powerhouse for lots of other goods like consumer electronics. They just cut their borrowing rates today while the rest of the world is increasing rates... China is just starting their growth stimulation while the US is tapering. \n\n\\#5 - From a fundamentals perspective, their stock price is in-line with Legacy Auto (Nio trading around 3x P/S while Tesla trades around 30x). By almost all metrics, the stock market says they're no more likely to succeed than a traditional ICE automaker. \n\nI could probably go on for days... \"Click here to subscribe to my newsletter for my number 1 most important reason... and it's not one of the reasons above!\"", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting analysis!

To offset this decline, and to maintain societal stability, there was a significant transition towards funding the American lifestyle by increasing amounts of debt. Education debt increased. Medical debt increased. Housing debt increased. The Federal debt increased to maintain our military and retirement social programs.\n\nBut obviously, because wages stagnated, it was merely a matter of time before debt alone could not sustain our lifestyles. This status quo finally broke in 2008 with the great financial crisis and the housing market crash revealed the house of cards. This should have been the wake up call moment...but it wasn't. We instituted QE measures and dropped interests rates to try and encourage the recovery....and then when just didn't stop. Why? Because low interest rates, make it more appealing to ....you guessed it....take on debt.\n\nThis worked, which is why we saw a bull market throughout the 2010s. At least, it worked until we face another crisis, and we used up the last of our tools.\n\nNow the chickens are finally coming home to roost.
