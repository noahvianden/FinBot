{"title": "Fear & Greed Index is at 14 or \"extreme fear.\" Investors with a long term time horizon should be buying at these prices.", "selftext": "This is more so a post for the newbies and/or investors with a long term time horizon. The Fear & Greed Index registers investor sentiment as [extreme fear](https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed). With the S&P treading bear market territory, the majority of investors, those with a long term time horizon, should be buying at these prices.  Over the course of a decade these kinds of steep price declines, beyond a correction, happen maybe 2-3 times at best. Sure, it's possible that the market keeps dropping for the next 6-8 months or so, but headlines and markets have a way of turning relatively quickly. The majority of people should be trying to increase their positions in index funds right now and should continue to do so if the market keeps falling.\n\nHere's how quickly a news cycle can turn:\n\n\"Russia & Ukraine announce a 2 week cease fire, the western world begins buying Russian oil again, bringing gas prices down.\"\n\n\"Heading into the summer months, China announces that it has a lid on COVID outbreaks and begins opening up locked down cities. This should alleviate some supply chain issues, helping to control inflation.\"\n\n\"With inflation slowing, the Fed announces a rollback to .25% rate hikes, and estimates a moratorium on rate hikes within 6 months.\"\n\n\"Biden announces a $20,000 student loan forgiveness package, freeing up the millennial and gen z consumer base.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\nWe're a herd. We all get anal retentive and get incredibly bearish at once. Then we all turn bullish and start having orgies at our goat yoga sessions. We're anal retentive right now, but you don't have to be. Take advantage of this opportunity. Buy more index funds, i.e. VTI, SPY, etc. etc., right now while the market is down, and go enjoy your goat yoga.", "id": "uxxftl", "created_utc": 1653532158.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "The Fear and Greed index has little predictive power with markets, though.

{"title": "INCREDIBLE GRAPHIC OF WEIGHT OF INTEREST RATES", "selftext": "Interest rates are going to continue to rise for the foreseeable future.  Historically, interest rates have had to rise above the rate of inflation to lower said inflation.  This would imply a Fed Funds Rate of about 10% today, not the 0.75% we have currently.  The Fed and others will insist that inflation is going to subside, just as they already have with their \"inflation is transitory\" argument.\n\nThe reason the market hit all time peak valuations is that money was cheaper than ever up until the last few months.  The cost to borrow with interest rates so low allowed investors, corporations, consumers, and governments to borrow an unfathomable amount of money, \"promoting\" economic growth.  The issue now is that with rates rising, expansion is over.  Businesses are already slashing forecasts and projecting slowdowns. \n\nBut what is the real weight of the interest rates increasing?  Let's take a look at what a house buyer would have paid 1.5 years ago, and what one would pay today.  \n\nA key issue here is that rates are much more elastic than housing prices.  Housing prices will only drop once there is mass foreclosure such as the Financial Crisis.  The issue today is that, with significant inflation pressures, the prices are unlikely to come down.\n\nSo if you are in the market for a new house, I suggest you get moving quickly.  It will only get worse.\n\nOh I forgot, you apes have all your money tied up in $GME and $AMC.

{"title": "WHY STOCKS WILL CONTINUE TO TANK LONG TERM", "selftext": "First, I would like to say I am more of a bull than a bear, just with a realistic perspective.\n\nThe Federal Reserve historically has had to raise the Fed Funds Rate above the inflation rate to lower inflation.  The reason is consumers need to be able to put their money in money market accounts that return more than the inflation rate to keep purchasing power.\n\nThe Fed has blown this epic bubble and now is dealing with inflation that will be higher than in the 1970s, which is the last time we saw inflation similar to today.  The issue is that we went through 30 years of globalization, making China a superpower, which now controls the front end of a significant portion of the world's supply chains.  By outsourcing most of our manufacturing, we put the leverage in our opposition's hands.  \n\nFor forty years, the Fed was able to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.  By making debt cheaper, consumers and corporations spent more.  Rates next to 0 was the highest value stocks and bonds were going to get - it was when money was the cheapest.  It is only getting more expensive now.  The Fed now is faced with the dilemma of a lifetime: raise rates quickly, crash the market in a way that would make the Great Depression look like a good time, and slow inflation, or raise rates slowly, submit to hyperinflation that can be blamed on geopolitical challenges for a few years, until consumers revolt.  \n\nThe issue is that it is easier to do the second option, and the Fed has historically taken the path of least resistance.  Their dual mandate is price stability and moderate inflation, and they are dropping the ball significantly on both, and would rather sweep the issue under the rug than actually handle it.  This is why base case is extreme inflation that lasts a decade (inflationary periods typically last this long), while rates move up and down in an upwards trend, slowly destroying everything and everyone aside from people who hold hard assets.\n\nWhen I say hard assets, I am mainly referring to housing, as house prices are much more inelastic than interest rates.  This will not be a Financial Crisis type of crash where house prices come down significantly because we are in such a high inflationary period.  I also suspect the government launches forbearance programs similar to during Covid, prolonging these economic issues.  The path to hell is paved with good intentions, and the government thrives on the path to hell.\n\n**What that means for you crazy apes out there is that this is the opportunity of a lifetime.**  First, we will be able to buy high tech stocks for next to nothing in a few years, and second, we can short the hell out of the market on the way down, as institutions will be in a position where they cannot: its against their business model for the most part to do so.\n\nDon't fight the trend; indices are heading down.  That does not mean individual stocks will all follow, some will thrive during this time.  When you short the market and make money, you are making money when everyone else is losing money.  It's a glorious thing as your net worth goes up two times as fast compared to the rest.  Tough times ahead for a lot of people - make sure you are not one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s371uyt2zu191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e1afaed67c28a3a0a08333020ccc8ea19913ab", "id": "uydapc", "created_utc": 1653587499.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|23|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uydapc)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uydapc)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Comparing oranges and apples.\n\nWe have been hit by many unlucky inflation causing events in a row.

I believe we'll see something similar over the coming days.\n\nThe Fed is doing the right thing here.  They need to take inflation seriously, and they need to be willing to possibly even move to a restrictive rate.  I am not criticizing the message.  But the market got the interpretation wrong.  **If the Fed has to hike to a restrictive rate, or even if they have to hike more than has been presumed, we will have a more profound recession.**  This is indisputable.\n\nThe market is cheering the Fed doing what it needs to do, but the harsh reality is that correct action will result in much lower corporate earnings, layoffs and generally slower economic growth.  Stocks will be worth less in this environment.\n\nThe Fed wouldn't be discussing the possibility of more hikes or a higher, possibly even restrictive, terminal rate if they didn't feel inflation might be harder to tame than many believe.  I'm personally glad the Fed is willing to do what needs to be done, but this isn't good news for stocks.\n\nThis is sort of like going to a doctor for a skinned up knee and him telling you that he's willing to amputate if there's significant infection that spreads.

The leaders just take credit and extract a salary from union dues. \n\nAnd the salary is the tiniest part of the benefit. The real value is in corruption. I'm not just talking old school Jimmy Hoffa corruption, [I'm talking about how many of the the presidents and other leaders of the United Auto Workers went to prison last year.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/second-uaw-president-sentenced-to-prison-in-union-corruption-probe.html) The funny part was that all the other union leaders in the US didn't call out the UAW as bad eggs. They just covered it up to the point where all the pro-union folks on Reddit don't even know what happened. The heads of the National Rifle Association, Black Lives Matter, and many other extreme ideological organizations similarly were able to steal from their members by claiming any criticism of them was an attack on their movement overall. \n\nUltimately, union leaders are no different from fund managers that charge you a 2% expense ratio to invest in the S&P 500. If they could give you great returns when the market plunges like a hedge fund, maybe it's worth it (but I'm still skeptical). But if the union doesn't protect jobs when the market forces of supply and demand moves away from workers, then they're worthless. And again, over a century of evidence from a wide variety of countries demonstrates this.\n\nIf you want to help the lower classes or workers or humanity or whatever, you'd be far better served with a UBI program where the money goes directly from a total world index of companies to individuals with stocks without union leaders, politicians, money managers, and others to claim the lion's share first.

That included high school dropouts working in the factory up to MIT engineers designing the cars. As you can imagine, the UAW and the conventional auto industry (the ones that conspired to kill electric cars in the first place, according to Who Killed the Electric Car) are particularly furious about this. \n\nAgain, I don't know your circumstances, but American universities have been raising wages across the board, regardless of union involvement.

Lastly, if it was a one time 2% payment off one check, that's not a bad deal. But if you're paying 2% out of every single check in perpetuity in the form of union dues, that's the best scam I've ever heard. The union leader just has to do a little upfront negotiating about something the employer was planning to do anyways, and provide a feel good narrative/social circle for members. Then they can collect 2% per check for decades.

It basically means owning stock in the company where you work. A company like Tesla where everyone is paid primarily in stock options is highly threatening to union leaders because it aligns the interests of owners and employees (by turning employees into owners), thereby cutting the union leaders out.\n\nOne corollary is corporate executives and corporate board members that get high cash salaries, but own comparatively little stock in the companies. The goal is to extract safe cash in the short term, rather than bear the risk and return of the company in the long term.\n\n* If you get a cash salary, you're only invested in your own labor. You're fine with the company crashing as long as you continue to benefit. \n* If you own stock a single company, you're both literally and figuratively invested in the outcome of that single company. You're fine with dirty tricks (e.g., creating a monopoly, bribing politicians) to take out better competitors though. \n* If you own the S&P 500, you're invested in the outcome of all large American businesses.

Everyone's incentive would be to compete in a win-win way that creates value and makes the pie bigger, rather than compete in a win-lose way that simply involves taking a bigger slice.\n\nThe catch to owning stock in a company rather than getting a cash wage is that you can choose to slack off knowing others are there to handle the workload. When this happens, the market shifts back towards higher cash wages/salaries for individuals. Ultimately, the best place is where everyone's investments are aligned with their roles as individual workers, owners of a business, citizens of a country, and humans on Earth. We can allocate percentages of our money to each of these buckets to match. A $1 salary and 100% stock ownership of a single company might be good for one person. A  salary plus investments in a company, country, and UBI representing the whole planet might be good for someone else.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7264498472213745}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5579824447631836}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22375023365020752}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34008124470710754}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5075893998146057}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7817537188529968}, {"body": "oooooorr they understand that overpaying employees will increase work ethic and productivity", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Overpaying employees runs you out of business.
