{"title": "Fear & Greed Index is at 14 or \"extreme fear.\" Investors with a long term time horizon should be buying at these prices.", "selftext": "This is more so a post for the newbies and/or investors with a long term time horizon. The Fear & Greed Index registers investor sentiment as [extreme fear](https://www.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed). With the S&P treading bear market territory, the majority of investors, those with a long term time horizon, should be buying at these prices.  Over the course of a decade these kinds of steep price declines, beyond a correction, happen maybe 2-3 times at best. Sure, it's possible that the market keeps dropping for the next 6-8 months or so, but headlines and markets have a way of turning relatively quickly. The majority of people should be trying to increase their positions in index funds right now and should continue to do so if the market keeps falling.\n\nHere's how quickly a news cycle can turn:\n\n\"Russia & Ukraine announce a 2 week cease fire, the western world begins buying Russian oil again, bringing gas prices down.\"\n\n\"Heading into the summer months, China announces that it has a lid on COVID outbreaks and begins opening up locked down cities. This should alleviate some supply chain issues, helping to control inflation.\"\n\n\"With inflation slowing, the Fed announces a rollback to .25% rate hikes, and estimates a moratorium on rate hikes within 6 months.\"\n\n\"Biden announces a $20,000 student loan forgiveness package, freeing up the millennial and gen z consumer base.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\nWe're a herd. We all get anal retentive and get incredibly bearish at once. Then we all turn bullish and start having orgies at our goat yoga sessions. We're anal retentive right now, but you don't have to be. Take advantage of this opportunity. Buy more index funds, i.e. VTI, SPY, etc. etc., right now while the market is down, and go enjoy your goat yoga.", "id": "uxxftl", "created_utc": 1653532158.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "The Fear and Greed index has little predictive power with markets, though.

{"title": "INCREDIBLE GRAPHIC OF WEIGHT OF INTEREST RATES", "selftext": "Interest rates are going to continue to rise for the foreseeable future.  Historically, interest rates have had to rise above the rate of inflation to lower said inflation.  This would imply a Fed Funds Rate of about 10% today, not the 0.75% we have currently.  The Fed and others will insist that inflation is going to subside, just as they already have with their \"inflation is transitory\" argument.\n\nThe reason the market hit all time peak valuations is that money was cheaper than ever up until the last few months.  The cost to borrow with interest rates so low allowed investors, corporations, consumers, and governments to borrow an unfathomable amount of money, \"promoting\" economic growth.  The issue now is that with rates rising, expansion is over.  Businesses are already slashing forecasts and projecting slowdowns. \n\nBut what is the real weight of the interest rates increasing?  Let's take a look at what a house buyer would have paid 1.5 years ago, and what one would pay today.  \n\nA key issue here is that rates are much more elastic than housing prices.  Housing prices will only drop once there is mass foreclosure such as the Financial Crisis.  The issue today is that, with significant inflation pressures, the prices are unlikely to come down.\n\nSo if you are in the market for a new house, I suggest you get moving quickly.  It will only get worse.\n\nOh I forgot, you apes have all your money tied up in $GME and $AMC.

{"title": "WHY STOCKS WILL CONTINUE TO TANK LONG TERM", "selftext": "First, I would like to say I am more of a bull than a bear, just with a realistic perspective.\n\nThe Federal Reserve historically has had to raise the Fed Funds Rate above the inflation rate to lower inflation.  The reason is consumers need to be able to put their money in money market accounts that return more than the inflation rate to keep purchasing power.\n\nThe Fed has blown this epic bubble and now is dealing with inflation that will be higher than in the 1970s, which is the last time we saw inflation similar to today.  The issue is that we went through 30 years of globalization, making China a superpower, which now controls the front end of a significant portion of the world's supply chains.  By outsourcing most of our manufacturing, we put the leverage in our opposition's hands.  \n\nFor forty years, the Fed was able to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.  By making debt cheaper, consumers and corporations spent more.  Rates next to 0 was the highest value stocks and bonds were going to get - it was when money was the cheapest.  It is only getting more expensive now.  The Fed now is faced with the dilemma of a lifetime: raise rates quickly, crash the market in a way that would make the Great Depression look like a good time, and slow inflation, or raise rates slowly, submit to hyperinflation that can be blamed on geopolitical challenges for a few years, until consumers revolt.  \n\nThe issue is that it is easier to do the second option, and the Fed has historically taken the path of least resistance.  Their dual mandate is price stability and moderate inflation, and they are dropping the ball significantly on both, and would rather sweep the issue under the rug than actually handle it.  This is why base case is extreme inflation that lasts a decade (inflationary periods typically last this long), while rates move up and down in an upwards trend, slowly destroying everything and everyone aside from people who hold hard assets.\n\nWhen I say hard assets, I am mainly referring to housing, as house prices are much more inelastic than interest rates.  This will not be a Financial Crisis type of crash where house prices come down significantly because we are in such a high inflationary period.  I also suspect the government launches forbearance programs similar to during Covid, prolonging these economic issues.  The path to hell is paved with good intentions, and the government thrives on the path to hell.\n\n**What that means for you crazy apes out there is that this is the opportunity of a lifetime.**  First, we will be able to buy high tech stocks for next to nothing in a few years, and second, we can short the hell out of the market on the way down, as institutions will be in a position where they cannot: its against their business model for the most part to do so.\n\nDon't fight the trend; indices are heading down.  That does not mean individual stocks will all follow, some will thrive during this time.  When you short the market and make money, you are making money when everyone else is losing money.  It's a glorious thing as your net worth goes up two times as fast compared to the rest.  Tough times ahead for a lot of people - make sure you are not one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s371uyt2zu191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=03e1afaed67c28a3a0a08333020ccc8ea19913ab", "id": "uydapc", "created_utc": 1653587499.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|23|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uydapc)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uydapc)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Comparing oranges and apples.\n\nWe have been hit by many unlucky inflation causing events in a row.
