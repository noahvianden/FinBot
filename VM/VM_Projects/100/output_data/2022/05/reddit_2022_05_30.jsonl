The reality is a lot of tech companies in their growth stage don't want free cash flow and have historically been punished for prioritising it (for good reason) by investors.\n\nThe nuance being missed right now is that it's sometimes its smart for tech companies in their growth stage to operate unprofitability because that's what allows them to build their moat and capture the largest share of TAM.

You might have thought you were being smart betting on the profitable company in this scenario, but in the long-run you probably want to bet on the unprofitable company growing rapidly at a loss.\n\nThat's not to say all growth companies should be expected to be unprofitable or that there isn't risks investing in companies utilising this strategy. It's important to try to identify companies with legitimate businesses models which have the potential to operate profitably in the future. For example there are a lot of crappy direct to consumer companies out there right now which investors have been giving a free pass for operating unprofitability for years which I'm sceptical of, but high-quality software companies like NET or SNOW shouldn't be criticised simply for having negative free cash flow.\n\nJust some thoughts anyway.

For the most part these are huge companies with massive gross profits, they're only unprofitable because they spend a massive amount on sales and marketing for growth. That spend can be cut if needed, but as I explained it typically wouldn't make sense for a growth company to do that.\n\nBut secondly companies and consumers actually use and rely on these companies today. In the dotcom bubble revenues for dotcoms tanked when the bubble burst. The dotcom bubble was full of PTON type companies with deeply flawed business models that basically just survived on easy capital fuelled by dotcom investment hype.\n\nCompare that with today. Do you see companies cancelling their relationship with U, NET, or CRWD if a recession were to happen? No obviously not. If anything the technology provided by companies like this will become more important as companies seek innovation as solution to the economic challenges they face.\n\nWhat might happen is that as the cost of capital increases growth companies will see slightly slower growth as it becomes more expensive to buy growth. It's possible some companies with exposure to the consumer will also see revenues hit, so companies like SHOP and SQ, but companies like PLTR or SNOW should be fine.\n\nFinally the cost of capital hasn't meaningfully increased. The 10y yield is sitting around 3% which isn't even the highest it's been over the last decade.\n\nThe risk lies in the very early stage tech startups which are pre-revenue or those which don't have self-sustainable business models.

It reported that Goldman's traders were known in the Big Apple as the Bandits of Broad Street. The former New York governor Eliot Spitzer hit the nail on the head during a Bloomberg television interview. Observing that, after an infusion of billions of taxpayer dollars to keep Wall Street banks afloat, Goldman has gone on to make a \"bloody fortune.\"\r  \nIndeed, the idea of Goldman Sachs as the blood-sucking vampire squid of the investment banking world, was created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Leading Bloomberg to claim: \u2018People hate Goldman Sachs more than oil spills.\u2019 But it\u2019s much worse than that. The \u2018level of animosity\u2019 directed at Goldman is much higher than its peers. So where to start? Well, eyebrows were certainly raised in 2008 when the US treasury secretary Henry \u2018Hank\u2019 Paulson, and former CEO of Goldman Sachs, signed off on the $85 billion bailout of the insurance giant AIG.\r  \nAIG immediately repaid Goldman $13 billion, which AIG owed to them. Then, flush with a cash windfall, Goldman now met the cash holdings criterion to become a bank holding company at the height of the crisis (and thus able to access liquidity support directly from the Federal Reserve).\r  \nDan Awrey, professor of financial regulation at Oxford University, notes that the Paulson-Goldman connection \u2018aggravated the public\u2019s sense that the game was rigged\u2019. Then there have been the plain PR blunders, like when Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, claimed that Goldman was \u2018doing God\u2019s work\u2019, says Awrey.\r  \nThen there was the time that the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud suit against Goldman in 2010, accusing it of defrauding investors in a sale of securities tied to $1 billion worth of subprime mortgages, termed toxic debt. The New York Times called it \u2018one of the darkest chapters in the company\u2019s 150-year history\u2019. The company settled, agreeing to pay $550 million without admitting or denying guilt.\r  \nThe lawsuit alleged that, \u201cGoldman structured portfolios for their investors that were designed to lose money.\u201d\r  \nThe lawsuit put Goldman CEO Blankfein further on the defensive, after he told the federal Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that the bank packaged complex debt, while also betting against this same debt, which was purchased by its clients, \u201cbecause our clients had the appetite for this debt.

Equities are 100% money supply neutral, even with fees, dividends, deposits and withdrawals, its's all shifting money around.\n\nJust to make it clear an example: on the stock market. Say A has $0, B has $100 and C $150, in total $250 cash and there are no stocks. A buys AAPL at $0 at IPO, sells to $B at $100, $B sells to C at $150. A has now $100, B $150 and C $0, and C has the AAPL stock bought at $150. So $250 in cash, $150 in stock.
