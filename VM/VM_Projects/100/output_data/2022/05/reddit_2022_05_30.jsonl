The reality is a lot of tech companies in their growth stage don't want free cash flow and have historically been punished for prioritising it (for good reason) by investors.\n\nThe nuance being missed right now is that it's sometimes its smart for tech companies in their growth stage to operate unprofitability because that's what allows them to build their moat and capture the largest share of TAM.

You might have thought you were being smart betting on the profitable company in this scenario, but in the long-run you probably want to bet on the unprofitable company growing rapidly at a loss.\n\nThat's not to say all growth companies should be expected to be unprofitable or that there isn't risks investing in companies utilising this strategy. It's important to try to identify companies with legitimate businesses models which have the potential to operate profitably in the future. For example there are a lot of crappy direct to consumer companies out there right now which investors have been giving a free pass for operating unprofitability for years which I'm sceptical of, but high-quality software companies like NET or SNOW shouldn't be criticised simply for having negative free cash flow.\n\nJust some thoughts anyway.

Unless those highly unprofitable high-growth companies have a lot of cash on hand (which they usually don't) and debt-free (which they usually are not) then most of them will go bust. Also, in a recession there are no cheap loans to keep them afloat. I have companies that dropped 80% plus and I'd say that most of them are down that much because of real reasons, not overreaction. Sure, if a recession doesn't happen they might shoot up into the same levels, but the possibility still have to be priced in.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's an overreaction in the sense that growth stocks are indiscriminately sold.\n\nThe difference between today and when the dotcom bubble burst is that for the most part these are legit businesses with large revenues.\n\nFirstly, growth companies today are unprofitable because of sales and marketing spend, not because of flawed business models or because they're pre-revenue. For the most part these are huge companies with massive gross profits, they're only unprofitable because they spend a massive amount on sales and marketing for growth. That spend can be cut if needed, but as I explained it typically wouldn't make sense for a growth company to do that.\n\nBut secondly companies and consumers actually use and rely on these companies today. In the dotcom bubble revenues for dotcoms tanked when the bubble burst. The dotcom bubble was full of PTON type companies with deeply flawed business models that basically just survived on easy capital fuelled by dotcom investment hype.\n\nCompare that with today. Do you see companies cancelling their relationship with U, NET, or CRWD if a recession were to happen? No obviously not. If anything the technology provided by companies like this will become more important as companies seek innovation as solution to the economic challenges they face.\n\nWhat might happen is that as the cost of capital increases growth companies will see slightly slower growth as it becomes more expensive to buy growth. It's possible some companies with exposure to the consumer will also see revenues hit, so companies like SHOP and SQ, but companies like PLTR or SNOW should be fine.\n\nFinally the cost of capital hasn't meaningfully increased. The 10y yield is sitting around 3% which isn't even the highest it's been over the last decade.\n\nThe risk lies in the very early stage tech startups which are pre-revenue or those which don't have self-sustainable business models. This is where I'm seeing some panic in tech right now. Delivery companies for example have questionable business models and I suspect a lot of these will go bust. Most larger growth companies that are publicly listed will be fine.
