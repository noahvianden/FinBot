It doesn't give you much in the way of diversity across sectors, but it does give you diversity within growth. Growth will come back sooner than people think IMO. I'd say there is plenty in the ARKK profile which is severely undervalued (30-100%, let's say).\n\nThe downside is that ARKK has not shown to be very good at trading. They buy too high, sell at times when things are looking near bottom. I think they've rushed to conserve what value they can by making trades instead of holding, and it hasn't really paid off. That said, it looks to me as though they are making some good purchases at the moment if we are looking beyond a 6 month or year long time horizon.\n\nDo as you wish.

Below is an excerpt from the post I wrote back then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Inflation Station 1](https://preview.redd.it/e0jsi2iffi091.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab4a50f95f44a68dea6ace1a75bed8c26e5094e)\n\n# Recapping our thoughts.\n\nWe expected some big moves in inflation, which we are getting now. The Fed has unequivocally stated that \u201cWe don\u2019t care about your stocks, We need to kill inflation\u201d (I\u2019m paraphrasing) and so interest rates have begun to rise!\n\nI think the meme below provides an adequate solution to the problem we find ourselves in as investors. But we need a more nuanced look as well\u2026obviously\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Unfortunately most of us sit in the middle](https://preview.redd.it/zv297ahifi091.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad314d55b013eec4eb68d19fd9c62a8354fb02c6)\n\n# What happens next\n\nIt\u2019s ***literally*** all dependent on the data we get from inflation. J-Powell said that they will be completely data-dependent on assessing where interest rates need to go. So all that matters now to the broader market is inflation data.\n\nYou can sort of get a read for inflation data before it comes out if you watch the right things, let\u2019s take a look:\n\n* Commodity prices -high\n* Energy -high af\n* Food - high af\n* Rent - increasing\n* Wages - increasing (labor market is super tight - means lots of competition for labor).\n\nThese things are all increasing. A lot. Inflation \u201crisks\u201d are still tilted to the upside, the war, China lockdowns, and high energy prices- which make literally everything more expensive, are still looming.\n\nBut we are seeing healing in some corners of the market:\n\n* Housing prices are crashing (thanks to high mortgage rates)\n* Freight costs are getting lower (also thanks to demand destruction).\n* Shitcoins are bubble-bursting\n* Shitcos (shit companies) are bursting too. Once Tesla finally hits $60 per share nature will be healed.\n\nThere is also a psychological cycle to inflation. Businesses increase prices, employees fight for increases, and in a circular fashion, inflation can become \u201cembedded\u201d like a habit. This happens in lots of third-world \u201cemerging markets\u201d and is well documented throughout history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kophczdlfi091.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=3baf872a294258c5f39ca5d4f4baa385a906e7ac\n\nNot a good look.
