{"title": "Leaps options for TSLA", "selftext": "Wrote about this in a comment on another thread. \n\nBuying some TSLA $550 calls this week with a Nov 18th expiration and selling calls against them until the share price recovers or corrects for the long term. In my estimation the current share price is not necessarily the floor, especially considering the Twitter deal, and [Elon\u2019s margin loan linked to TSLA](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musk-looks-scrap-tesla-margin-loan-with-new-twitter-funding-bloomberg-law-2022-05-12/). However, now that he\u2019s reduced the margin loan by 50% (6.5B) there should be less downside speculation. \n\nConsidering that whenever TSLA breaks out it happens relatively quickly, long term ITM calls have a higher potential upside than puts and premium prices are still quite good.\n\nI saw some analysis here about taking quick puts and going in and out, but not much about long term leaps or puts. I\u2019m still bullish on TSLA long term even though it was severely overbought and see this recent fiasco with Twitter and Elon as a solid profit opportunity.\n\nIf anyone is going bearish long term I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on why and vice versa.\n\nEDIT 1: I listed this in a comment below but I\u2019ll put it here as well. After assessing my plan again and zooming out to look at the broader market, I decided to change plans. Below I\u2019ll list how and why.\n\n\u201cHowever after running potential scenarios using IV vs HV, evaluating the current financial climate around Tesla, and creating a cost benefit analysis using the Greeks, I\u2019ve decided to use this same strategy with a different stock. I\u2019d be able to make the same profit in the short term (1-3 months) while giving up some potential upside in the long term. \n\nThe reason for this was as somebody else mentioned in this thread, Twitter is a very big unknown and I don\u2019t feel secure risking so much money on something as volatile as Tesla when I could be making similar profit with significantly less risk on multiple contracts in a stock like AMD or AAPL.

Language please.\n\nThe facts I illustrated are fully verifiable and support what I'm saying. \n\nGo look. Clearly, you haven't. It's some pretty basic bitch investor shit that is remarkably self evident just by zooming in on different periods of the stock market.\n\nIt is incredibly easy to find decades where negative or zero returns were generated.\n\n>The big chunks of market recovery often don't happen gradually, they happen inside of a day, and if you miss a couple of those you'll have missed out on a big part of the gains.    \n\nSource? \n\nYou don't have one. Because that's completely wrong.\n\nThe market does not recover in one or two big days. That's as ridiculous a fallacy as the idea that a stock crash happens in a day.\n\nTo illustrate: \n\nIf you held, as you are doing, through the entirety of the stock market crash in 2008-2009, you would have gotten to break even in April of 2011.\n\nIf you sold when the crash happened, like a person who thinks for themselves, and bought back in, you'd be further head. You don't need to even find the bottom (another fallacy). You don't even have to sell exactly before the crash.\n\nIf anyone sold and reinvested anywhere from the bottom on Feb. 2009 up until April 2011, they would be ahead of the \"I buy and hold because I don't think for myself\" investor. By a long shot.\n\nYou could miss the bottom by almost 2 years and still come out better than a \"I hold because people say to\" investor.\n\nAnd we can't forget that hedging in cash pre-crash and then buying when the market was down means more shares than the \"hold\" investor.\n\nFor example:\n\nYou have 100 shares at $100. You hold.\n\nI have 100 shares at $100. I sell and get $10,000\n\nShares fall to $50. I buy and get 200 shares.\n\nWhen the share price returns to $100, you have a portfolio worth $10,000. Sweet. You held and broke even 3 years later.\n\nI have a portfolio worth $20,000\n\nI didn't say we're in a 1929 situation. Don't engage in straw man arguments. You're better than that.\n\nThe war has very little to do with the situation in the stock market. Go do some research. \n\nTypically, the outset of a war causes a panic dip and then recovery isn't long after. \n\nIt's low on the list of concerns cited by institutional investors.\n\nI'm just going to go ahead and guess that you've never actually tried to see if your investment strategy is sound or not. Because you haven't and it's not.\n\n[Here's a well researched, thoughtful article that provides facts that demonstrate what you're doing is the worst investment strategy during a crash.](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/buying-the-dip?s=r)\n\nDon't be so touchy about being wrong.

Basically, we come to a point in the discussion where we couldn't figure out if the circuit breakers used during this time period saved the economy or not. For context, the circuit breaker is almost like the Hail Mary of damage control in the stock market; a circuit breaker pauses stocks for 15-minute intervals. The circuit breaker was created in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash where the Dow dropped over 20% and since then has only been used five times. Once in 1997, and FOUR TIMES in March 2020. **Sooooooo... what would have happened if we didn't use a circuit breaker back in March 2020?**\n\nEdit: Some of you are confused and Im sorry for using grammar that caused this confusion. Im asking directly about the effects the circuit breaker had on the stock market. I understand the economy and stock market are not the same\n\nEdit 2: So basically the answer is it is hard to tell how much the market would have dipped if not for the circuit breaker. This does not mean a market collapse/crash would have happened if the circuit breakers never went off, but instead kept people from losing money due to market algorithms \"panicking\" and \"driving stock price down\" (also people from getting margin called)", "id": "ux82gj", "created_utc": 1653448302.0, "score": 350, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "The circuit breakers are mostly for brokers to catch up to prevent arbitrage and slippage from getting out of hand.

He couldn\u2019t get the fact that I can only pay what I have and if I pay more than what I get then I lose money and eventually everyone loses their jobs. If you want a pay raise the best way to get it is to perform in a way that results in higher than expected earning/profit than was expected, especially if it\u2019s sustained.

{"title": "Fed minutes show strong commitment to 0.50% rate hikes in June, July", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve made a strong commitment to 0.50% moves in June and July, according to minutes from the central bank\u2019s May meeting released Wednesday afternoon.\n\nOn May 4, policymakers [r](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-may-2022-142723148.html)aised short-term interest rates by 0.50% to a target range between 0.75% and 1.00% in a bid to lower inflation. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, which should in theory depress the consumption that is enabling companies to raise prices.\n\nBut the meeting minutes outline a strong agreement among Fed officials for further 0.50% moves after at least the next two meetings, which are scheduled for June 14-15 and July 26-27.\n\n\u201cMost participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings,\u201d read the minutes from the May 3-4 meeting.\n\nThe Fed is not often so direct about what it will do in future meetings, as the institution often prioritizes flexibility to alter the course of its policy as data changes. But with inflation currently at levels not seen since the early 1980s, the Fed has been more willing to offer public guidance on its intentions to further raise rates.\n\nFollowing the May 4 rate hike, Fed Chairman Jay Powell told the press that there was a \u201cbroad sense\u201d on the committee that further 0.50% moves \u201cshould be on the table\u201d for the next two meetings.\n\nFed presidents that spoke to Yahoo Finance earlier this month appeared to be part of that \u201cbroad\u201d support.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Yahoo Finance on May 10 she would be \"comfortable\" with that strategy, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the same day he could  see 0.50% moves for the \u201cnext two, or perhaps three, meetings.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard \u2014 who once entertained the possibility of a 0.75% move \u2014 told Yahoo Finance May 11 that his colleagues had \"coalesced\" around that plan for two 0.50% moves.\n\nThe Fed minutes note that Fed officials would have to continue raising rates beyond estimates for the neutral rate of interest, defined as the level of interest rates economists feel is neither stimulative nor restrictive to economic growth. This estimate implies rates will rise above 2.5% at some point during this cycle.\n\n\u201cParticipants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions should be data dependent,\u201d the Fed minutes added as a caveat.\n\nInflation remained the pressing concern for Fed officials, which was complicated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related shutdowns in China. Both events are leading to disruptions in the global supply chain that have, in part, boosted prices. Fed officials said that those pressures could ease at some point, but the timing and magnitude would be \u201cuncertain.\u201d\n\nThe minutes note that all policymakers on the committee supported the 0.50% move in May, in addition to the plan to begin shrinking the Fed\u2019s $9 trillion balance sheet beginning June 1.\n\nSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-minutes-show-strong-commitment-to-rate-hikes-june-july-182429216.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-minutes-show-strong-commitment-to-rate-hikes-june-july-182429216.html)", "id": "uxo44z", "created_utc": 1653504330.0, "score": 316, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "The market seems to be responding reasonably well 1 hour later...", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "There\u2019ll be blood in the streets tomorrow", "score": 135, "replies": [{"body": "as usual", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18530720472335815}, {"body": "\u201cBlood in the streets\u201d LMFAO", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6072622537612915}, {"body": "!RemindMe 1 day", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 1 day on [**2022-05-27 05:12:07 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-05-27%2005:12:07%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uxo44z/fed_minutes_show_strong_commitment_to_050_rate/ia14qfu/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fstocks%2Fcomments%2Fuxo44z%2Ffed_minutes_show_strong_commitment_to_050_rate%2Fia14qfu%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202022-05-27%2005%3A12%3A07%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20uxo44z)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24180923402309418}, {"body": "The upside to you being wrong is that maybe its the proof of concept of something *actually being priced in.* Like, for real this time.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1229071095585823}, {"body": "Hopefully you didn\u2019t buy any short term puts yesterday", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I would never lol.

{"title": "BBBY (Bed Bath & Beyond) - What Gives?", "selftext": "**Disclosure**: I hold a modest long position in this ticker, currently underwater by about 25%, no biggie.\n\nI opened my BBBY position in March 2022 when Ryan Cohen (he of Chewy and GameStop fame) bought his 9.5M BBBY shares for a \\~10% stake in the company and then engaged in a very aggressive social media campaign against the company's executives and its \"over price consultants\". Ultimately, Cohen was able to secure 3 Board seats on the company for his hand-picked associates, and now has quite a bit of sway regarding the company's future:\n\n* [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/bed-bath-beyond-strikes-deal-with-activist-investor-ryan-cohen.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/bed-bath-beyond-strikes-deal-with-activist-investor-ryan-cohen.html)\n\nBBBY is now trading at about a **0.11x** price-to-sales ratio, and Ryan Cohen has announced that he thinks the profitable **BuybuyBaby** chain should be sold off (for several times more than the company's current market cap) in order to erase BBBY's debt and narrow the parent company's scope. This idea has some merit to it, and has been discussed before:\n\n* [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/buybuy-baby-may-be-worth-more-than-all-of-bed-bath-beyond-bank-of-america-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/buybuy-baby-may-be-worth-more-than-all-of-bed-bath-beyond-bank-of-america-says.html)\n* [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyonds-baby-business-isnt-worth-multiple-billions-analysts-say-contradicting-ryan-cohen-letter-11646676679](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyonds-baby-business-isnt-worth-multiple-billions-analysts-say-contradicting-ryan-cohen-letter-11646676679)\n\nCurrently, BBBY is trading at around $8, with a paltry $650M market cap, against annual revenues of approx. $8bn in 2021. It historically has traded as high as $80 (2013-2015) and even $44 in 2021 (June 2, 2021). BBBY has also bought back $1bn worth of its shares in recent years, and clearly considers its own share price to be very undervalued:\n\n* [https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-advances-1-billion-three-year-share](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-advances-1-billion-three-year-share)\n\nIn addition to buying 9.5M shares between $13-17 (\\~$150,000,000), Cohen also purchased a ton of Jan 2023 Calls (16,701 contracts) with $60-$80 strike prices:\n\n* [https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/other-memes/bbby-stock-ryan-cohen-steps-in-short-sellers-scramble](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/other-memes/bbby-stock-ryan-cohen-steps-in-short-sellers-scramble)\n\nRyan Cohen has been very vocal on his Twitter account since the New Year regarding inflation, monetary policy, and the Fed. He clearly has more than a passing knowledge of, and interest in, the current state of the economy. Of course, no mention of BBBY and Ryan Cohen would be complete without mentioning the short interest in the ticker ([20M shares publicly reported short, or 25% of total shares outstanding. But somehow 84% of the float according to Yahoo Finance??!](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY/key-statistics?p=BBBY)) and the stock's weird trading correlation with other so-called \"meme stocks\" like GME, AMC. For example, BBBY had a huge price and volume spike on June 2, 2021, the same day that GME and other meme stocks also experienced massive price spikes and trading. However, I will leave aside speculation as to what that correlation might be caused by, or what it imply for the future of the share price.\n\nI keep struggling to think of any reason why a successful activist investor like Ryan Cohen would drop that kind of dough without a very serious plan to turn the company around, even in this difficult economic climate.\n\nIs anyone else fascinated with this stock's future and curious to see how it all shakes out?

What I've read from analysts is that TSLA has a cost advantage in manufacturing due to their vertical integration and innovative manufacturing techniques, while it is unknown whether the other major auto mfg's can turn a profit with EV's, and TSLA should be in a better position, compared to their competition, to lower their prices when competition requires it.

I can tell you the the enterprise value of TSLA is >4x that of Ford, and they have much higher profit margins, and they are growing much faster (much less growing at all), and TSLA has essentially no debt compared to a mountain of debt for Ford, and they don't have to cannibalize their core business to compete in the EV space... with all that considered, I think TSLA should be worth many multples of Ford, much more than 4x... does 12x seem unreasonable?
