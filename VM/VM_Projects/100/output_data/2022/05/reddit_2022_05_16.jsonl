{"title": "3x levered ETFs are horrible long-term investments.", "selftext": "There have been several posts about buying 3x levered ETF as long term investment. However that is not a great idea. Here is why:\n\nAssume we have an index at 100$ and a 3x levered ETF.\n\nIf the index gains 3%, they would close at 103 and the 3xETF at 109. Easy until now.\n\nLets then assume that the index declines for 5%. So it closes at 97.85. The 3xETF returns 3x the daily performance, so it would close at 87.55.\n\nThe next day, the index gains 2.2%, so it closes at 100. The 3x deliveres 3x the performance which is 6.6%, so it would close at $93.32.\n\nAs we can see, with a choppy markets we will lose a bunch of performance. The reason for it are simple margin requirements.\n\nThe company providing the 3x levered ETFs does not want to go bankrupt. So when the market goes up, in order to deliver the daily returns the company buys more shares. If it goes down, it sells the shares. That reduces the returns.\n\nThat is why the QQQ returned 119,05% , and the TQQQ the 3x levered ETF delivered 284,33% - which is 2.4x the return not 3x.\n\nThis 2.4x return is in a historic bull market. If the market is choppier - the 3x ETF returns would decline and might even close below the underlying index.\n\nAdd the risk that the 3x levered Index can go to 0 if the Nasaq closes down 33.3%. It is unlikely and we have never seen it, but the market is unpredictable.\n\n3x levered ETFs are a great for short term investments, but can be horrible for the long run.

The banks print out real estate loans more than Jpow is printing out singles.\n\nThis happened in dubai as well, I'm not sure on current affairs but i remember all the sports cars like Ferrari and Mclarens left abandoned in parking lots and the desert after they defaulted and left country before they got their heads chopped off. (Serious arab law)\n\nToday you can explore abandoned high rises in china, some half constructed abandoned.\n\nIn 2021 Q4 484 chinese businesses defaulted on their major real estate payments. (This should be double digits)\n\nOn top of all of this, covid has run absolutely rampant to the point they are locking people in \ud83c\udf4e factories and can't leave.  This may be what pops the bubble but I would not put a nickel of my burger king check into any China owned companies. Have you all tried to buy a car lately?  You cant.  China and all of the nafta companies aren't producing near enough goods.  If you can't sell you cant make tendies.\n\nIf and when the bubble burst it will shake up an already rattled global economy with the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 war.   I think this year possibly next the united states will enter into the war. \n\nAlready ships like the USS Kearsarge are in route to the Baltic Sea arrived 24hours ago\n\nI would guess a 5-10 trillion dollar loss on NASDAQ overnight is possible could be this year if announce of the war, I'm sure it will start with a russian attack that hits american troops, a plane or an embassy.  The moment this happens (it will) you need to start shorting before the boomers pull out of their 401k.  \n\nIf you already havent pulled out of your 401k consider it, transfer it to a roth ira or something like S&P500 on td ameriteade thats setup for retirement where you can pull out quickly. \n\nOn top of that the ticking time bomb of China we got a goold old great depression cooking.  \n\nAnyways boys\n\nPositions:\nLockheed\nRaytheon", "id": "uqlki1", "created_utc": 1652668081.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uqlki1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uqlki1)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Is this Bill Ackman's account?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20950932800769806}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13164135813713074}, {"body": "Your 401K to a Roth makes no sense.

{"title": "$aapl - 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry reveals bet against Apple stock \u2014 and built stakes in Alphabet and Meta last quarter", "selftext": "[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-portfolio-apple-alphabet-meta-2022-5](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-portfolio-apple-alphabet-meta-2022-5)\n\n \n\nMichael Burry, the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, placed a bet against [Apple](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) and loaded up on other stocks last quarter, a [Securities and Exchange Commission filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761922010747/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml) revealed on Monday.\n\nBurry's Scion Asset Management held bearish put options against 206,000 Apple shares as of March 31. The iPhone maker's stock price has roughly quadrupled since the start of 2019, but has slumped by 16% this quarter alone.\n\nScion held only six stocks at the end of December. The hedge fund exited all of those holdings except Bristol-Myers Squibb last quarter, but added the likes of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Discovery to its portfolio.\n\nThe slew of purchases helped to boost the total value of Scion's US stocks (excluding options) by 122% to $165 million.

The stock is up about %7 in after hours to almost $30. Looks like Warren was buying at much higher prices (around $37), so my gut tells me he's not done buying and will continue to buy down here. But why?\n\nEveryone knows Buffet/ Berkshire loves them some Apple and is one of the major shareholders there. I now am more positive than ever, that it will be Apple that buys PARA...and this is just a way for Warren to load up on more Apple shares. I will bet my left nut that Warren pushes Apple to do an all share deal and take out Paramount. \n\nI put my heart and soul into that DD, and some of you clowns said \"puts on PARA\". I told you put your money where your mouth is and show me. I really hope you weren't that foolish.\n\nThis reminds of a little story involving Warren that I'll share about the first time I ever bought a stock (Bank of America). Way back right after the Financial Crisis (around 2009), I had heard that it may be the best opportunity to buy stocks. I didn't know anything about stocks back then. But I did my research and felt banks were safe. So I bought Bank of America at $7. Turns out, I didn't nail the bottom and the stock dropped into the $6's. I panic sold. Not too long after, news came out that Warren bought BAC and the stock jumped to $11 within weeks. I felt like an ass...but that was what was needed to establish a bottom. I'm hoping the same thing happens here. This time, I didn't panic sell because of that lesson I learned way back. \n\nPosition: 15k shares at $28.50 (proof posted in the DD). I can sell rn and take my $20k and post some gain porn...but I'm holding on for the Apple buyout.  \n\nPrice Target is $65!! \n\nCheers!\n\n* Not financial advice.", "id": "ur8jsv", "created_utc": 1652742156.0, "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|159|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ur8jsv)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ur8jsv)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "OP did you trim any of your position above 32?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06565408408641815}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14526793360710144}, {"body": "Congrats on the position.

Is there a certain risk ratio that people use?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> I understand that with credit spreads your max profit is with the short leg of the spread. \n\nA word of caution: max profit comes with max risk. There is no need to use the max profit number for anything, you can ignore it. Instead, *manage the spread to your desired profit and loss targets*. The most the max profit tells you is the upper limit of your potential profit targets.\n\nFor example, say you have a $3 wide spread paying $1, which is max profit, but you have to hold it for 30 days to get that max, since that's the expiration (max profit is only guaranteed at expiration). Instead, you could exit the trade at $.50 profit and get your capital back in, let's say, 10 days. Do that three times sequentially and your total gain over 30 days is $1.50. You make more money and get better utilization of your capital by going for a smaller profit that pays off sooner. Not to mention avoiding all the extra risks of expiration.\n\n> How do you find these plays? \n\nThere is no one right way and many people have written about their methods (check out Option Alpha and projectoption, as just two examples). Here's a quick summary of my method:\n\n* Due diligence and screen for quality stocks (good fundamentals, good options liquidity) You want mostly boring blue chips, but not so boring that their is no action in their options contracts.\n\n* Get that screen down to below 100 candidates. Put them in a watchlist.\n\n* Every day, look at the IV of the desired contract vs. IV Percentile or IV Rank. Look for high/low IV relative to the 52-week average. If there are none, no trades opened that day.\n\n> Do people typically stick with the same tickers that they know well to run credit spreads on?\n\nI do, as should be clear from the above, but others don't. They screen the entire market every day to find the best deal, regardless of the ticker. It's not a bad strat, since emotion and loyalty to a brand can cloud your judgment. Why should you care if it is ABC or XYZ that you trade today? As long as it offers an edge, that is all that should matter (after screening for quality, of course).\n\n> For debit spreads, since you maximize your profit on the long leg of the spread, are you looking stocks with low IV?\n\nSort of. It's not just high or low that matters, it's potential to move in a favorable direction and by how much. If a low IV call stays low, the vol you paid for didn't do anything for you. Actually, it's more accurate to say that are looking for mispricing of vol. If the market is paying more for vol than actually happens (IV > HV after the fact), you want to be a seller. If the market is paying less for vol than actually happens (IV < HV after the fact), you want to be a buyer.\n\n> Finally, how do people choose the width of their spread? Is there a certain risk ratio that people use?\n\nYes.\n\nFor credit spreads, 1/3rd the width is break-even for 33ish delta, so for a $1 spread, you want *at least* $.34 in credit. That gives you a break-even risk/reward of 2/1. As long as your probability of profit is greater than 67% (on your *managed* exit targets, not max profit/loss), you'll average out as a profitable trader.\n\nEDIT: But I just said not to shoot for max profit, didn't I? That's right, I did. The $.34 lower bound on a $1 spread is about max profit. But I also said that max profit is the upper limit on your exit targets. Even though you aren't shooting for $.34 on $1, having that additional headroom gives you more room to maneuver. For example, say you wanted to exit at $.18 gain or $.36 loss, for perfect 2/1 risk/reward. That is totally do-able on a $.34 max profit $1 spread, but a lot harder to do on a $.20 max profit on $1 spread.\n\nFor debit spreads, you basically enter ATM or a couple of strikes ITM, so that implies a 1/1 risk/reward or close to. So for a $1 spread ATM, you don't want to pay more than about $.50.\n\nI stated the ratios for $1 spread, but you just scale those up if you can tolerate more risk. I generally stay under $3 widths, but some people swear that $5 width is optimal.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply. This is a lot of great info.

A BULL put credit spread will profit if the stock moves up, or stays about the same due to theta decay.

To trade these you want to find a stock where your analysis and the trend indicate it may move in a direction and then use a bullish or bearish spread strategy.  \n\nSelling credit spreads when the stock's IV is high can bring in more premium to help possibly make more profit.\n\nThe width of the spread is all about the max loss of the trade.  A $1 wide spread will have at most a $100 max loss amount, a $5 wide spread = $500, $10 wide = $1,000, and so on.  How much are you willing to risk on the trade?  How confident are you with your directional estimate?  \n\nThis is all basic stuff, so take some training and paper trade them to see how they work.

However, how the money was delivered wasn't terribly effective for reducing the risk of inflation and an eventual recession as it continued along the trend that if banks were provided capital they would seek to lend it out, however this has been shown for a long period of time as not true as they would rather seek less risky returns (investing in people/small companies who are struggling with a coming recession is generally a bad investment) and so sought out equity as a means (this also caused a rush into less and less viable equities as people chased returns over risk and it became frothy) to do this. \n\nInterest rates are still relatively low, there needs to be some pain (not just in the US but globally) as they are returned to optimal levels but it isn't necessarily worse due to the pumping of trillions into the economy and by some measures will be significantly less painful than having not done it (supply chains would have collapsed further as there would have been no capital to keep them afloat and would need to be almost completely rebuilt, housing prices would have further gone up as there would have been no means of building without supplies, and companies would have shrunk employment numbers further as there was no need when they couldn't produce a product due to no supplies).", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "A bit? sure.. but since not all of it was pumped as credit, I don't think it will worsen the recession much more..

As of April 30, 2022 that has gone up to 11.6%. It looks like they are becoming more aggressive. This is likely in response to their pension program being underfunded. This happened sometime around the great recession, and they have been working since then to catch up.\n\nBefore people rake the investment group and CEO across the coals, there is a lot of nuance to all this. First of all, CalPERs has been fighting to require public employees to increase their contributions into the program. They have not had much success with this, as employees do not want to take home less money. Further, California Taxpayers are not very receptive to helping fund the program (a minor tax increase could add significant new plan assets), but most voters do not like giving their money to help public employees. \n\nThe idea of reducing distributions to vested employees has been floated, but such a significant change is complicated and could be illegal without passing new laws. Even if they did this, there would be serious political ramifications as many of these employees carry a lot of influence with labor groups (even retirees can still have influence). Plus, sapping people of their retirement without warning could cause them serious financial harm and create a burden on society.\n\nCalPERs could also slow vesting, reduce distributions, and/or require more contributions from new employees. However, a defined benefits plan is one of the major perks of being a public employee. Guaranteed security for retirement is a valued benefit, and if you mess with this too much, it might be harder to recruit and maintain employees (which leads to future human resources costs down the line).\n\nIt should also be noted that the board of directors must approve significant changes. The CEO and investment team can only do so much. It's far easier to convince the board to adopt a different investment strategy than it is to make fundamental organizational changes. So don't be too hard on them for taking the path of least resistance. \n\nAs for the investment strategy itself, as of April 2022, only 11% of assets are invested in private equity. I imagine even fewer are invested in super risky stocks. Further, take a look at the 12/31/21 investment earnings report (link above). In 2021, private equity had a  one year return of 39.3%, and the annualized five year return was 16.5%.\n\nThose aren't bad numbers. The CEO joined 6 years ago, and CalPERs investment performance has been doing okay since she joined. Over the past five years, the investment returns have generally stayed above their benchmark targets (including private equity). They probably would have been better off putting the money in an S&P index fund, although I doubt it would have performed too much better than an annualized 16.5% five-year return. Retirement plans often try to diversify investments (including investing in more risky ventures). And again, only 11% of their assets are being allocated to this category. It's essentially gambling with money they aren't afraid to lose to hopefully hit a jackpot. \n\nMaybe some of them even read this subreddit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I remember new york teacher\u2018s retirement fund being invested in the gme craze january 2021", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5166610479354858}, {"body": "\"tricked\".
