{"title": "3x levered ETFs are horrible long-term investments.", "selftext": "There have been several posts about buying 3x levered ETF as long term investment. However that is not a great idea. Here is why:\n\nAssume we have an index at 100$ and a 3x levered ETF.\n\nIf the index gains 3%, they would close at 103 and the 3xETF at 109. Easy until now.\n\nLets then assume that the index declines for 5%. So it closes at 97.85. The 3xETF returns 3x the daily performance, so it would close at 87.55.\n\nThe next day, the index gains 2.2%, so it closes at 100. The 3x deliveres 3x the performance which is 6.6%, so it would close at $93.32.\n\nAs we can see, with a choppy markets we will lose a bunch of performance. The reason for it are simple margin requirements.\n\nThe company providing the 3x levered ETFs does not want to go bankrupt. So when the market goes up, in order to deliver the daily returns the company buys more shares. If it goes down, it sells the shares. That reduces the returns.\n\nThat is why the QQQ returned 119,05% , and the TQQQ the 3x levered ETF delivered 284,33% - which is 2.4x the return not 3x.\n\nThis 2.4x return is in a historic bull market. If the market is choppier - the 3x ETF returns would decline and might even close below the underlying index.\n\nAdd the risk that the 3x levered Index can go to 0 if the Nasaq closes down 33.3%. It is unlikely and we have never seen it, but the market is unpredictable.\n\n3x levered ETFs are a great for short term investments, but can be horrible for the long run.

The banks print out real estate loans more than Jpow is printing out singles.\n\nThis happened in dubai as well, I'm not sure on current affairs but i remember all the sports cars like Ferrari and Mclarens left abandoned in parking lots and the desert after they defaulted and left country before they got their heads chopped off. (Serious arab law)\n\nToday you can explore abandoned high rises in china, some half constructed abandoned.\n\nIn 2021 Q4 484 chinese businesses defaulted on their major real estate payments. (This should be double digits)\n\nOn top of all of this, covid has run absolutely rampant to the point they are locking people in \ud83c\udf4e factories and can't leave.  This may be what pops the bubble but I would not put a nickel of my burger king check into any China owned companies. Have you all tried to buy a car lately?  You cant.  China and all of the nafta companies aren't producing near enough goods.  If you can't sell you cant make tendies.\n\nIf and when the bubble burst it will shake up an already rattled global economy with the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 war.   I think this year possibly next the united states will enter into the war. \n\nAlready ships like the USS Kearsarge are in route to the Baltic Sea arrived 24hours ago\n\nI would guess a 5-10 trillion dollar loss on NASDAQ overnight is possible could be this year if announce of the war, I'm sure it will start with a russian attack that hits american troops, a plane or an embassy.  The moment this happens (it will) you need to start shorting before the boomers pull out of their 401k.  \n\nIf you already havent pulled out of your 401k consider it, transfer it to a roth ira or something like S&P500 on td ameriteade thats setup for retirement where you can pull out quickly. \n\nOn top of that the ticking time bomb of China we got a goold old great depression cooking.  \n\nAnyways boys\n\nPositions:\nLockheed\nRaytheon", "id": "uqlki1", "created_utc": 1652668081.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uqlki1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uqlki1)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Is this Bill Ackman's account?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20950932800769806}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13164135813713074}, {"body": "Your 401K to a Roth makes no sense.

{"title": "$aapl - 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry reveals bet against Apple stock \u2014 and built stakes in Alphabet and Meta last quarter", "selftext": "[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-portfolio-apple-alphabet-meta-2022-5](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-scion-stock-portfolio-apple-alphabet-meta-2022-5)\n\n \n\nMichael Burry, the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, placed a bet against [Apple](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_medium=ingest&utm_source=markets) and loaded up on other stocks last quarter, a [Securities and Exchange Commission filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761922010747/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml) revealed on Monday.\n\nBurry's Scion Asset Management held bearish put options against 206,000 Apple shares as of March 31. The iPhone maker's stock price has roughly quadrupled since the start of 2019, but has slumped by 16% this quarter alone.\n\nScion held only six stocks at the end of December. The hedge fund exited all of those holdings except Bristol-Myers Squibb last quarter, but added the likes of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Discovery to its portfolio.\n\nThe slew of purchases helped to boost the total value of Scion's US stocks (excluding options) by 122% to $165 million.

The stock is up about %7 in after hours to almost $30. Looks like Warren was buying at much higher prices (around $37), so my gut tells me he's not done buying and will continue to buy down here. But why?\n\nEveryone knows Buffet/ Berkshire loves them some Apple and is one of the major shareholders there. I now am more positive than ever, that it will be Apple that buys PARA...and this is just a way for Warren to load up on more Apple shares. I will bet my left nut that Warren pushes Apple to do an all share deal and take out Paramount. \n\nI put my heart and soul into that DD, and some of you clowns said \"puts on PARA\". I told you put your money where your mouth is and show me. I really hope you weren't that foolish.\n\nThis reminds of a little story involving Warren that I'll share about the first time I ever bought a stock (Bank of America). Way back right after the Financial Crisis (around 2009), I had heard that it may be the best opportunity to buy stocks. I didn't know anything about stocks back then. But I did my research and felt banks were safe. So I bought Bank of America at $7. Turns out, I didn't nail the bottom and the stock dropped into the $6's. I panic sold. Not too long after, news came out that Warren bought BAC and the stock jumped to $11 within weeks. I felt like an ass...but that was what was needed to establish a bottom. I'm hoping the same thing happens here. This time, I didn't panic sell because of that lesson I learned way back. \n\nPosition: 15k shares at $28.50 (proof posted in the DD). I can sell rn and take my $20k and post some gain porn...but I'm holding on for the Apple buyout.  \n\nPrice Target is $65!! \n\nCheers!\n\n* Not financial advice.", "id": "ur8jsv", "created_utc": 1652742156.0, "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|159|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ur8jsv)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ur8jsv)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "OP did you trim any of your position above 32?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06565408408641815}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14526793360710144}, {"body": "Congrats on the position.
