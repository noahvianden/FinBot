This has pulled a lot of money into the stocks they like (mostly tech stocks & green energy stocks) and drained liquidity/capital from the rest of the market, especially stocks they don't like. In particular, they shun & \"cancel\" old energy stocks. The inflation of companies like Tesla (which are not actually good at reducing overall energy consumption) together with the starvation of companies that produce carbon based energy, minerals and other commodities (along with most of the rest of the industrial complex) has been a big factor in the energy shocks and inability to manufacture our own products we are experiencing today. \n\nSo distortions in capital markets have real world consequences, and when they get out of hand to create a bubble, eventually those distortions damage the underlying economy and/or industrial base enough that the bubble is unsustainable and macroeconomic damage starts making the capital market unstable & break down. \n\nCapitulation is necessary because the investors who are fucking things up and trading in ways that defy reality, making the market inefficient and disconnected from market fundamentals, have to lose enough money so that they stop what they're doing and get out. That way the group of investors who are more connected to what is happening and where the real investments are in the market can take over and the economy that supports a healthier market can stabilize and grow.\n\ntldr; people who don't care about or don't know the market fundaments of an investment screw things up, causing real world problems in a market bubble, and then the bubble will start to deflate due to macroeconomic problems and that continues until the gambling investors either stop doing that thing they're doing or lose enough money to be forced out of the market so that more efficient market dynamics and more effective investors can take over.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Ever heard something called free market?

Investors should be able to invest in what they want with their money. \n\nYou have the right to put your money into cult stocks as much as you want. Did I say you weren't allowed to inflate stocks with your bets? But fake pumping stocks that lack value only works for so long before the market gets too distorted to support that. Then things in a bubble get to the point where the market will keep taking your money so long as you keep putting it in. It's like physics, it's not about what's right and what's wrong, it's about how passive investing into a bubble becomes unsustainable because at some point in a bubble, the market dynamics shift into one where it sucks up your money rather than being pumped the way you would like it to be. \n\n> People don\u2019t need to buy low pe GE stock just because it supports a certain narrative of fundamentals. \n\nPeople have to buy certain stocks because they have value and produce returns. The market bubble has sucked money away from real economy stocks because social media enabled stock pumping & excess liquidity from too much Fed QE has created a lot of wild value in buying the stocks of other, less productive but popular companies. \n\nYou would like to continue to buy vanity and cult stocks but the companies that actually have value are the ones that are delivering necessities for society and people. Starving necessary companies of too much capital leads to the inability to sustain society, e.g. our shortages, inflation & supply chain breakdowns.\n\nIf you start using capital markets for chasing pop dreams and personality cults, so much so that the companies that are needed to support society are too starved of capital, then you have what we have today: an energy crisis, shortages of materials, goods and even food inflation. Then those conditions create the need for the Fed to act to rein in the excesses. You have created the conditions that force the Fed to hike rates. \n\nThis is like physics. The laws of economics don't disappear because some online social media stock pumps are great at making you money. Any bubble lasts only for a while if it starts to impact the normal functioning of capital markets. \n\n> You thesis is incredibly narrow and faulty somehow you think retail buying tech growth stocks is causing an imbalance in the market. Retail money is nothing compared to institutional money they move the market. \n\nThe laws of economics doesn't care about your feelings, snowflake. Nor does your sense of entitlement of a \"right\" to buy whatever you want mean that the stock market can't do bad things to you in return. \n\n> Don\u2019t be so ignorant of market dynamics and if you have to point finger to someone fed is right entity\n\nThe Fed is not to blame for hiking rates. It's doing what it has to do because a bunch of investors (retail, passive, professional and institutional) have taken the pandemic liquidity it gifted us with and put it into stupid, greedy excesses and now we have distorted markets with fundamentally worthless companies' pop stocks and the cult personalities behind them inflated so badly it's disrupting the economy. You have created the conditions that force the Fed to hike rates.\n\nWhen people like you \"capitulate\" it means that there are people who are becoming aware that the game is not working for them anymore and they stop putting money into that which lacks that much value.

{"title": "Declines in physical adult entertainment discretionary spending as a leading indicator of recession", "selftext": ">When the economy expands or contracts, households re-allocate their budget across various categories of expenditures, which shows expenditure shares decrease for *positional* goods/services and increase for non-positional goods/services during recessions (Kamakura & Du, 2012) \n\nAmong the most sensitive, in my opinion, discretionary spending categories is *physical* adult entertainment services (ex: strip clubs \\[NAICS 581302\\]). A positional good/service is a good/service that conveys a high relative standing within society  (think Rolex, Superbowl tickets, status symbols, lap dances/bottle service, Veblen-pricing, etc.). With the advent of the internet, there are strong *virtual* substitute adult entertainment services, which tend to be cheaper than *physical*, that consumers can flee to when re-balancing their budgets in recessionary conditions. Basically, if a free visit to /r/boobs can fulfill a consumer's primal needs in a similar way to a $200 lap dance in a strip club, consumers will flee to /r/boobs when experiencing recessionary pressures on their budges. Therefore, monitoring changes in discretionary spending on physical adult entertainment services over time is a valuable gauge of recessionary conditions. \n\nMy [informal surve](https://twitter.com/Stephen_Geiger/status/1527740945994743811?s=20&t=t5ZO4FBVZ_pRhFdaTztbvQ)[y](https://twitter.com/Stephen_Geiger/status/1527740945994743811?s=20&t=t5ZO4FBVZ_pRhFdaTztbvQ) of the opinions of adult erotic dancers on Twitter indicates a general pessimism regarding market conditions, which mirrors the University of Michigan's overall [index of consumer sentiment](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/chicsh.pdf) (61.2 as of May 2022, testing the low of 59.7 set in Sept. 2011 and the March 2009 low of 58.3). \n\nFurther, $RICK (RCI Hospitality, owner of \\~50 strip clubs), reported in their 2022Q2 10-Q:\n\n>The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine could **have adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions which could negatively impact our business**, financial condition, and results of operations.

Stimulate the production of EPO and you get more red blood cells; get more red blood cells and you increase the blood\u2019s ability to transport oxygen around the body. An increased ability to transport oxygen may theoretically lead to an increase in athletic performance, particularly when we\u2019re talking about high endurance sports such as competitive cycling.
