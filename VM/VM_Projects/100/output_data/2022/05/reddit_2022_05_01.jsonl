I don't know where you got your real estate license but its obviously out of a box of Cracker Jacks. A cash offer is when the home is purchased in cash, there are many reasons why one would be listed as such but it is likely determined that the bank wished to absolve themselves of this in an efficient manner, perhaps it is a home off grid that doesn't meet any FHA standard, an individuals preference to GTFO as is,  doesn't matter where the individual got the money, it is still a cash deal. You are confusing two different things. I am having difficulty understanding why you cannot seem to separate the issue of what the definition of cash deal is and how much you think people out to pull out of areas that in your opinion , maybe they shouldn't. You are also making strange assumptions about where people borrow their money from. it just seems that you aren't really a serious individual , otherwise you might have taken some time to do the research before making simple vague statements that are not only meaningless, but worthless. Lets say I need 2 acres of land and a small 1930's cabin and I find one for $100K but the cabin must be purchased with cash obtained by the buyer with the equity of the home as collateral. what that required, the bank will not back , nor will any lender offering a conventional loan. They likely don't wish to go through further hassle by accepting land loans. Anyway, a buyer could in fact take the full amount of that money and roll it back into their own loan on their primary without changing monthly income whatsoever. thereby adding real estate to ones investments to assure a future for ones self and his or her children.  It means that person has now made an investment in his confidence. And god willing , if that primary residence appraises higher and higher and if he wasn't such a sore winner.

I think you should look deeper into it and really  try to understand what a lot of people who happen to have chosen their investment through real estate have endured. I know individuals that have 40 hour grinds and own 8 single family homes and cannot make a dime off of them. They are up to 7-8% loan on all of them and of course the rent is high. How else does this guy manage all of this.  he wishes he could just let it all go, it didnt work out the way it was sold to him after all and if he sold it all now, it wouldn't be enough and he is just a couple years away from retirement age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is, this has been going on for years. Often an individuals ambition would be to accumulate 2 homes in hope that one would gain enough value to sell and have some peace with a mortgage free home. This person who gave everything is also a landlord. Don't confuse landlords with idiots. some have more in common with a farmer than you might imagine. Also, some are also the farmer. This might have been the only way they could have cared for their family that they knew how to do, that is, along with that full time job.\n\nAlso, Pulte has had a bad name since hurricane Andrew. This is not news,\n\nAlso you were just telling us about the 10k jobs across the US we lost, it\u2019s probably within specification ,Doesn\u2019t sound too panicky to me the stuff happens all the time it has been for a very long time and yet we have still endured.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou need to do more research on who your enemy really is.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Initially Landlords are not going to be so forgiving until it becomes a trend.\n\nRemember, only a handful recognized the pending mortgage crisis (The Big Short).

Do they need to pay the tenant for that? or forgive the tenant, after all, this is the landlords home that he or she is entrusting another individual to live in and hopefully not cause damage to. I don't understand what you think landlords are so ignorant about.
