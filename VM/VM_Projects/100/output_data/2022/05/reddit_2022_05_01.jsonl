I don't know where you got your real estate license but its obviously out of a box of Cracker Jacks. A cash offer is when the home is purchased in cash, there are many reasons why one would be listed as such but it is likely determined that the bank wished to absolve themselves of this in an efficient manner, perhaps it is a home off grid that doesn't meet any FHA standard, an individuals preference to GTFO as is,  doesn't matter where the individual got the money, it is still a cash deal. You are confusing two different things. I am having difficulty understanding why you cannot seem to separate the issue of what the definition of cash deal is and how much you think people out to pull out of areas that in your opinion , maybe they shouldn't. You are also making strange assumptions about where people borrow their money from. it just seems that you aren't really a serious individual , otherwise you might have taken some time to do the research before making simple vague statements that are not only meaningless, but worthless. Lets say I need 2 acres of land and a small 1930's cabin and I find one for $100K but the cabin must be purchased with cash obtained by the buyer with the equity of the home as collateral. what that required, the bank will not back , nor will any lender offering a conventional loan. They likely don't wish to go through further hassle by accepting land loans. Anyway, a buyer could in fact take the full amount of that money and roll it back into their own loan on their primary without changing monthly income whatsoever. thereby adding real estate to ones investments to assure a future for ones self and his or her children.  It means that person has now made an investment in his confidence. And god willing , if that primary residence appraises higher and higher and if he wasn't such a sore winner.

How else does this guy manage all of this.  he wishes he could just let it all go, it didnt work out the way it was sold to him after all and if he sold it all now, it wouldn't be enough and he is just a couple years away from retirement age.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point is, this has been going on for years. Often an individuals ambition would be to accumulate 2 homes in hope that one would gain enough value to sell and have some peace with a mortgage free home. This person who gave everything is also a landlord. Don't confuse landlords with idiots. some have more in common with a farmer than you might imagine. Also, some are also the farmer. This might have been the only way they could have cared for their family that they knew how to do, that is, along with that full time job.\n\nAlso, Pulte has had a bad name since hurricane Andrew. This is not news,\n\nAlso you were just telling us about the 10k jobs across the US we lost, it\u2019s probably within specification ,Doesn\u2019t sound too panicky to me the stuff happens all the time it has been for a very long time and yet we have still endured.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou need to do more research on who your enemy really is.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Initially Landlords are not going to be so forgiving until it becomes a trend.\n\nRemember, only a handful recognized the pending mortgage crisis (The Big Short).

Do they need to pay the tenant for that? or forgive the tenant, after all, this is the landlords home that he or she is entrusting another individual to live in and hopefully not cause damage to. I don't understand what you think landlords are so ignorant about.

{"title": "Coinbase is going into the toilet.", "selftext": "How does Coinbase generate revenue?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\u201cCoinbase reported over $6.8 billion in transaction revenue for year-end 2021, up from just over $1 billion in 2020\u201d\r\n\u201cCoinbase charges fees of several percentage points to deposit funds and trade, which is one of the main ways the company makes money. Roughly 90% of the company's revenue, as of 2020, came from transaction fees from trading and services like storage\u201d\r\n\u201cBlockchain rewards, custodial fees, its Earn campaign program, interest income and other subscription and service fees contribute to Coinbase\u2019s revenue. In 2021, Coinbase reported total revenue of $517.4 million for these services, an increase from just under $45 million in 2020.\u201d\r\n\u201cThe final source of revenue is from the sale of crpto assets, corporate interest and other income. Coinbase reported over $484.6 million in revenue from these sources in 2021, up from just over $136.3 million in 2020.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhere is Coinbase heading? \r\nIn my opinion, I believe that Coinbase will continue to decrease in share price within 2022. \r\n\r\nMarket Reasons:\r\n\r\n \r\nAbove is a graph showing the CPI inflation rate. Currently, for the month of March inflation sat at 8.5% which is well above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2-3%. This should lead to a further loss in discretionary income for Americans which is a big deal for Coinbase as much of their overall revenue comes from retail investors. Overall Coinbase made about 7.8 billion dollars in revenue, however 6.5 billion dollars of that total 2021 revenue came from retail investors alone. Therefore, of cash inflows retail investors make up for 83% of overall revenue. Personally, I think there will be a substantial decrease in Coinbase share price as a result when Coinbase earnings come out on May 10th. I am forecasting a massive earnings miss and as a result I believe the share price will plummet following earnings. Putting things simply, I believe that Coinbase\u2019s business model is sound, especially in a more bullish environment like the one we had since the Federal Reserve began printing money in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic, but now things are changing. Growth stocks are getting hit the hardest right now and Coinbase will be no exception. Add that in with the expectation of a much more hawkish fed, and I believe investors will begin to flee from tech stocks even despite tech stocks recent drops. On March 23, 2020, the NASDAQ dropped to the lowest level since mid 2018, sitting at 7,502. The NASDAQ peaked on November 15th 2021 sitting at 16,057. Presently the NASDAQ has fallen substantially since that high and is currently at 12,334. The issue I have with this, is a simple look at the NASDAQ shows how much correlation there was between the Feds unbelievable expansionary monetary policy, coupled with our Federal Government\u2019s stimulus and other fiscal packages. As this money begins to be removed from the economy again I believe there will be a liquidity crisis. Credit has never been easier to get since COVID and interest rates had been set artificially low by the Fed for too long. A recession is inbound and many major financial institutions are even forecasting one. Investors will likely move from riskier investments such as Coinbase into less risky investments with steady cash flows such as bonds. With rates finally set to increase by 50 BPS (or more) in the next Fed meeting, bond yields should continue to rise as investors anticipate higher future interest rates. *also watch the 2 year note 10 year bond yields for a prolonged inversion* \u201cAlso, the GDP declined an annualized 1.4% on huge rise in trade deficit\u201d. Additionally, while Coinbase could not have had better earnings for the fourth quarter of 2021 I do not believe such growth is sustainable. I believe this because I think much of this growth was driven by money that was artificially pumped into the economy. Much of the money Coinbase has gathered from retail investors as revenue came from government stimulus and other forms of easy credit. While this is a gross oversimplification, and I do believe Coinbase will be solid, especially in the long term, Coinbase still has a rough road ahead with regards to its share price in my opinion. \r\n\r\nWhere I could be incorrect? (Bullish scenario)\r\n\u2022\tThe fed takes a more dovish stance, only hiking rates 25 bps in the next meeting\r\n\u2022\tCoinbase beats expectations and/ or an earnings miss was already priced into the stock as they are at all time lows since they have been public currently\r\n\u2022\tRetail investors continue to pile funds into crptocurrency at a high enough rate for Coinbase to continue their explosive growth\r\n\u2022\tThe crptomarket is more resilient than I believe it to be in the coming market downturn and recession resulting in a more resilient Coinbase share price. \r\n\nPosition: COIN $110 Put 6/17\n\nEdit: Pardon the very simplistic nature of my post, this is my first real options position, and I\u2019ve got finals next week lol. I really am open to all opinions though! The more crayons you eat per sitting, the more valuable your opinion is to me though. I personally think the orange one is the best.\n\nTL:DR - The majority of Coinbase\u2019s cash flows come from transaction trade volume, the macroeconomic pressures such as the Fed increasing interest rates and inflation will lead to a loss in retail discretionary income. Coinbase will have an earnings miss and continue to fall like a stone.\n\nEdit: 5/2/22 Market Close: Down 24% overall.\n\nEdit 2: 5/6/22 Closed Position: Up 35% at time of sale.\n\nEdit 3: Will be opening a COIN $110 P 6/24 on Monday should $COIN rebound above $110 a share before earnings. \n\nAdditionally, for anyone who sees this I made a new DD post on OXY if you\u2019re interested!", "id": "ug4yda", "created_utc": 1651426506.0, "score": 282, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 267, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ug4yda)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ug4yda)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04545177146792412}, {"body": "\u201cAbove is a graph\"\n\n/narrator: above there was no graph", "score": 173, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao he belongs here", "score": 31, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12414493411779404}, {"body": "Haha my bad!
