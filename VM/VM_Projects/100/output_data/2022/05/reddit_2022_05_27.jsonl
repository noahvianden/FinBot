The fund went on to become of the largest investors in Asian financial markets.\n\nHe preceded to operate **Archagoes Capital Management** based in New York City, New York, U.S.A.\n\nThis lasted **8 years**.

This sale was reported to be the cause of a 27% plunge in share price of Viacom, CBS and a similar fall in the price of Discovery, Inc.\n\nOn March 29, the share price of Credit Suisse was down by 14%, while Nomura Holdings shares declined by 16%. A press release from Credit Suisse said that \"the loss resulting from this exit could be highly significant and material to our first quarter results.\"\n\nAccording to *The* *Wall Street Journal*, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were able to limit their losses relating to Archegos by acting more quickly than Credit Suisse and Nomura Holdings. Other banks, such as Deutsche Bank, were able to close their substantial positions quickly and avoid any losses.\n\n# Loses Ranked By Bank\n\n|Bank|Loss \\~ \\[ USD \\]|\n|:-|:-|\n|Credit Suisse|$5,500,000,000|\n|Nomura|$2,850,000,000|\n|Morgan Stanley|$911,000,000|\n|UBS|$744,000,000|\n|Mitsubishi UFJ Financial|$300,000,000|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"How To Lose $20,000,000,000 In Two Days\\\\\" - Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/gnwlacxnqx191.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4286765a7f396742aba924e1d297321741c5cb9e)\n\n**Source Link:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhMhg97fmzE&ab\\_channel=BloombergQuicktake%3AOriginals**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhMhg97fmzE&ab_channel=BloombergQuicktake%3AOriginals)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"How Banks Helped Hwang Make Leverage Bets\\\\\" - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/86d65y6uqx191.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5de8cb74ff1c3a5a47e2403ad74a0f5b0f3cc6eb)\n\n**Source Link:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glaVAH\\_D5HU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glaVAH_D5HU)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"The $100,000,000,000 Crime\\\\\" - Wall Street Millennial](https://preview.redd.it/go9t7f42rx191.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3683f7208b171514719dfc08dc0d14d0763a24ba)\n\n**Source Link:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDqVqqFwx48&ab\\_channel=WallStreetMillennial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDqVqqFwx48&ab_channel=WallStreetMillennial)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bill Hwang Arrested](https://preview.redd.it/6kwfmodarx191.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2dfac60af1a57925347d245764bfb48468736425)\n\n**Source Link:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\\_ikPX\\_SiIE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ikPX_SiIE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"He Destroyed $20,000,000,000 In 2 Days\\\\\" - ColdFusion](https://preview.redd.it/k31qj2t8vx191.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=454ecd62cea377c6e6d01383c9bbc8a444111044)\n\n**Source Link:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtP3xT53dkU&ab\\_channel=ColdFusion**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtP3xT53dkU&ab_channel=ColdFusion)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Archegos Founder Hwang Criminally Charged](https://preview.redd.it/0iv3hwyrvx191.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7663358e491e6868b743b62358a9acc800edc68d)\n\n**Source Link:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZBVK0RAiw8&ab\\_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZBVK0RAiw8&ab_channel=BloombergMarketsandFinance)\n\n# Credit Suisse Fires Risk Management Executives After Archegos Capital Management Ends In The Loss Of $20,000,000,000 USD\n\n[Credit Suisse Takes Massive Loss](https://preview.redd.it/ecd2c8r5wx191.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e634441623092937097b20970ed7f72e5e1be2d2)\n\nHeads have rolled at Credit Suisse after the investment bank suffered massive losses in the aftermath of the blowout of US hedge fund Archegos Capital Management last week.\n\nThe bank said two top executives are leaving it. Those fired are chief risk officer Lara Warner and its investment banking chief Brian Chin. The bank also cut executive bonuses after suffering major losses.\n\nCredit Suisse, Switzerland's No. 2 bank, was among the last to take action before Archegos, a family-owned hedge fund, imploded following a billion-dollar margin call. Credit Suisse was forced to dump more than $2 billion worth of stock to seal its exposure to the investment fund controlled by Bill Hwang.\n\n# Credit Suisse Launches Probe\n\nCredit Suisse also launched an investigation into the Archegos losses. Credit Suisse shares rose 1.26 percent after the news of the drastic actions broke.\n\n**\"The significant loss in our prime services business relating to the failure of a US-based hedge fund is unacceptable.\"**\n\nIn combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders,\" Credit Suisse's chief executive Thomas Gottstein said in a statement.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the folding up of Archegos, analysts had assessed that Credit Suisse would suffer total losses around **$5 billion**.\n\nOn Tuesday, the investment banking giant said it is facing up to a **$5,500,000,000** loss from Archegos.\n\nThe crisis unfolded last week when Archegos engaged in the fire sale of about $20 billion of assets after it defaulted on a margin call by Credit Suisse and others. With the value of securities in the margin account of Archegos dropping substantially due to bets that failed, the fund was forced to sell assets in a fire sale, which then created a wave of panic that resembled the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008. The fire sale saw assets worth about $20 billion, mainly US and Chinese stocks, being sold.\n\nMajor investment banks like Deutsche Bank, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs etc have been hit by the liquidation of Archegos but they avoided or limited the losses by cutting the exposure to Archegos assets in time.\n\nCredit Suisse, which said it was expecting a $960 million loss for the first quarter, said it has cancelled a proposal for both short and long-term bonus awards for executives.\n\n# Investment Banks' Losses\n\nUBS reported an unexpected $774 million loss on Tuesday from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos, taking the total hit to global banks from the stricken family office beyond $10 billion.\n\nThe charge taken by Switzerland\u2019s biggest bank comes as the fallout from Archegos continues to ripple across the banking industry, with Nomura posting on Tuesday its biggest quarterly loss in over a decade as a result of its dealings with the stricken fund. The Japanese bank said it will book losses of around $2.9 billion this year on Archegos.\n\nMorgan Stanley lost nearly $1 billion on the family office\u2019s implosion while UBS\u2019 cross-town rival Credit Suisse has been hit the hardest with a more than $5 billion charge after Archegos defaulted on margin calls in late March, triggering a fire sale of stocks.\n\nUBS, the world\u2019s biggest wealth manager, said it was now reviewing all of its client relationships both within its prime brokerage unit, which caters to hedge funds, and within its family office business, which manages very large pools of money for wealthy individuals and families. It is also reviewing its risk management systems.\n\n**\u201cI understand you\u2019re disappointed. We are disappointed as well,\u201d** UBS Chief Executive Ralph Hamers told analysts on a call fielding queries over the loss, the extent of which had surprised investors.\n\nUBS shares fell 3.0% in morning trade.\n\n\u2033(The Archegos loss) highlights the inherent risk in its capital markets activities and presents a setback against its (UBS\u2019s) otherwise risk-averse culture,\u201d Moody\u2019s analyst Michael Rohr said in a note. \u201cThe bank\u2019s strong capital and liquidity remain key credit strengths safeguarding its financial profile and ratings.\u201d\n\nUBS, which had previously declined to comment on any fallout from Archegos, said on Tuesday the revenue hit to its prime brokerage business had reduced net profit by $434 million in the first quarter.\n\nStill, net profit of $1.82 billion for the first three months of 2021 beat the $1.59 billion median forecast from 20 analysts polled by the bank amid a bumper quarter for debt and stock deals.\n\nHamers, who took over from long-time boss Sergio Ermotti in November, was hired to help boost the bank\u2019s digitalization efforts after a successful stint doing so at ING.\n\nBut his start at UBS, widely lauded as an opportunity to prime the bank for a more tech-centered future, has been complicated by a Dutch criminal investigation into his role in money laundering failings at ING.\n\nHamers announced several strategic initiatives when he spoke to analysts on Tuesday, centered around making UBS a faster and more client-driven \u201cdigital native\u201d firm focused on sustainable investing.\n\nA simplification of its setup and new digitalization efforts should help generate approximately $1 billion in gross savings per year by 2023, the bank said.\n\nUBS has taken a back seat in financial headlines over recent months, after a slew of painful missteps at its nearest rival Credit Suisse prompted losses, sackings and probes at Switzerland\u2019s No. 2 bank.\n\nHamers on Tuesday said the bank did not feel the need to disclose the loss on Archegos earlier due to the strong first-quarter results, and had no plans to ditch its prime brokerage business following the debacle.\n\nIt had exited all remaining positions in April, leading to a further $87 million trading loss in the second quarter, Hamers said.\n\nTaking a cautious approach towards the second quarter, the bank said it expected client activity levels to come down from the highs seen in the first three months of the year, partially offset by a boost in recurring fees it generates off managing client investments due to higher asset prices.\n\n## Record client activity\n\nUBS derives the biggest chunk of its profits from advising and managing money for the world\u2019s rich, while also maintaining smaller global investment banking and asset management operations.\n\nIt conducts retail and corporate banking only in its home market.\n\nThat business model paid off in 2020, as its low-risk lending book \u2014 comprised primarily of mortgages and loans to the wealthy, as well as a smaller portion of corporate and retail credits in its prosperous Swiss home market \u2014 suffered fewer losses than many high street peers.\n\nNow, in the first three months of 2021, the bank once again overshot financial targets on the back of record activity across its client franchises.\n\nU.S. banks posted forecast-beating results for the first quarter, with Goldman Sachs boosting profits six-fold and Morgan Stanley raising profits **150%** despite disclosing a nearly **$1 billion** loss on Archegos.\n\nUBS, however, saw investment banking pre-tax profit fall **42%** on the back of the charge related to Archegos and more modest revenue growth in the rest of its trading business.\n\nWealth management saw profits rise **16%** as lending growth and high transaction levels helped cushion the impact from falling and persistently low interest rates.", "id": "uypfdq",
