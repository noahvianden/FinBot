{"title": "Inflation is a blank check against the economy. There can be no turnaround until it's controlled.", "selftext": "There have been a lot of opinions offered on when we might see the selling stop, but it really all comes down to one issue: inflation.  \n\nInflation is a blank check against the US economy.  It gives the Fed complete power to slow the economy until it can get inflation controlled.  Until investors know what that looks like, they can't possibly make any confident forecasts about the future earnings of companies.  \n\nLet me use an analogy.  You're about to click buy on a big fat engagement ring when your girlfriend texts you at 11 PM on a Monday night and says she wants to talk.  It sounds serious.  Do you buy the ring?  Of course not!  Maybe she wants to talk about something totally unrelated to you, but maybe she met someone else or maybe she has finally thought it over and realized you don't really look that much like Ryan Reynolds.  Who knows, but you can't possibly commit to a big purchase when you don't even know if the relationship is on solid ground.\n\nHow can investors possibly know how to discount future earnings if they don't know whether the terminal rate is going to be 2% or 5% or 8%?  Those three numbers would mean very, very different things for the US economy.  It's the difference between Powell's soft-ish landing and a full-on canned tuna and reusable toilet paper recession.  \n\nCompanies would make vastly different amounts of money in those three scenarios, and until investors have some idea about what will be needed in order to control inflation, things are very unlikely to turn around.  And from where I'm sitting, we have no clue whatsoever what kind of terminal rate will be needed.  Significant portions of inflation are driven by artifical forces, like oil disruption due to Ukraine or supply chain disruption due to Covid.  This makes predicting the effects of higher rates very hard.  \n\n\nMy less-convicted, armchair guess:   I think we see these 1-2% weekly bleeds until the market is given clarity one way or the other.  I don't think we see any huge one-day selloffs in the near-term unless some drastic comments from Powell drop.  The next CPI report isn't until June 10, so it's hard for me to see how we have much to make big moves on for a few weeks.  If the 1-2% bleeds continue long enough, we could end up in crash territory.  We're only several months of 1-2% weekly drops away from the S&P being down 40%.

I think it\u2019s fair to say that a wee bit more than that is required to dismantle my viewpoint. Literally any amount of elaboration and evidence regarding the theories themselves would have been a good start.\n\n> based on \u201cyour own research\u201d without divulging anything.\n\nI never said I did \u201cmy own research\u201d. The other commenter called me a \u201cdo your own research\u201d type and now you\u2019re just projecting that onto me. What I did do (and likely what yourself and the other commenter did as well) was read up on and learn about various economic theories in which to explain the world we live in. The only difference between you, I, and the other guy is that we came to different conclusions about what made more sense.\n\nAnd yes, I didn\u2019t provide any in depth elaboration or evidence in my original comment to backup my viewpoint. It was a top level comment in response to no one. My intent in sharing my opinion wasn\u2019t to prove anything to anyone, but rather to throw out another perspective for others to consider on their own if they so desire. The other commenter on the other hand responded directly to me and asserted my opinion was wrong. Standard practice when you do that is to substantiate the claim.\n\n> Great, so you know what point he is trying to use to refute your claim.\n\nNo, because he never specified anything. There are a number of points he could be making within what is considered the \u201cprevailing theories\u201d. Little good would come from me making assumptions when it\u2019s so easy for the other person to just communicate their point.\n\n> Ok, so his points are incorrect and yours aren\u2019t\n\nWhen did I say that exactly? All I said was that his prior comment assumed the prevailing theories are correct. I wasn\u2019t asserting that they are or aren\u2019t.\n\n> But where is the part where you say what the right theory is?\n\nNobody has asked me what I think the right theory is. Like I alluded to earlier, my intent in sharing my high level view on inflation was never to convince anyone to subscribe to any specific theory, it was to throw another perspective on inflation out there for people to potentially consider on their own.\n\n> From what I can see you only claim that everyone else are incorrect and you aren\u2019t, without saying what you think at all basically. Except leas inflation/deflation = good, somehow?\n\nI never claimed that everyone was wrong and I was right. All I basically said was that I thought the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target was bullshit, and then I did add what I thought (that it should be 0%). Never said anything about deflation.

Like you need to realize something, and that's that the fed really has no idea how inflation works.\n\nInflation is easy to understand when you learn it. Inflation is when prices go up. So what are prices made up of? On average, it is the price of materials + the price of infrastructure and labour + profit margins /taxes. So what causes these prices to go up?\n\nPhysical materials come from commodities. If demand exceeds supply in that market then it is going to go up in price. They could probably expand a bit before jacking prices but things like the war in Ukraine would obviously have an effect on oil. Also lockdowns and coronavirus restrictions particularly travel restrictions would have an effect on these prices. Materials also includes intermediate goods, so like semiconductors.\n\nLabour costs go up when the labour market is tight but there's tonnes of demand. This could happen when spending is really high causing a need to hire more people, or it could happen if there are coronavirus restrictions, or people are afraid to leave due to a pandemic, even just like 5% of the workforce is a pretty big amount. Infrastructure could be a range of factors maybe social distancing, commercial rent costs.\n\nReally though all these prices normally have some slack in the market. You can normally expand about 25% in the shortterm before companies need to jack prices. Unless you're in the middle of a pandemic. These monkeys printed $5 trillion and spent it in 12 months. Like the government didn't directly print it. The government went to borrow $5 trillion from the market when it was tapped out knowing the fed would backstop the market at 0% interest rates by printing USD and blew it in 12 months during a global pandemic. Obviously all these fuckin prices were going up.\n\nYour fed was shocked when they realised that was an inflationary event. They are the one organisation tasked with preventing inflation from getting out of control and they didn't realize pumping $5 trillion, 33% of M2 money, directly into the bank accounts of corporations and people, during a fucking global pandemic with old people and people with underlying health conditions scared to go outside, and global restrictions on travel, social distancing and lockdowns, would be inflationary. It is basic maths that's like 25% of GDP, normally that's max, and that money remains there and gets spent multiple times.\n\nThe people in control of the USD don't know what they're doing and idk about you but I find that kind of alarming ey given they just printed and spent many trillions of dollars and were shocked by the consequences. Upvote if you read it and think more people need to realize this.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention. Profit margin is another component of costs. That depends more on competition and pricing strategy. It's difficult to predict, but overall we would expect businesses to try to offload some of the cost at least.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["gdp", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "so next months cpi numbers are going to be a face ripper rocket to our last great blow-off top. got it.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["cpi"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "markets solidly green\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthen this fckn monkey starts running his yap\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSTFU", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2482476383447647}, {"body": "Summon the Volcker!
