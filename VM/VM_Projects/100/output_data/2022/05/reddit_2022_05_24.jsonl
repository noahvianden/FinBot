Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna\u2019s CEO and co-founder, made the announcement to his employees in a pre-recorded video message Monday. The \u201cvast majority\u201d of Klarna employees won\u2019t be affected by the measures, he said, however some \u201cwill be informed that we cannot offer you a role in the new organization.\u201d \u201cWhen we set our business plans for 2022 in the autumn of last year, it was a very different world than the one we are in today,\u201d Siemiatkowski said. \u201cSince then, we have seen a tragic and unnecessary war in Ukraine unfold, a shift in consumer sentiment, a steep increase in inflation, a highly volatile stock market and a likely recession.\u201d\n\nStaff in Europe will be offered redundancy packages with \u201can associated compensation,\u201d Klarna\u2019s boss said, while the process for other employees \u201cwill look different\u201d depending on where they work. Klarna will share more information with employees about the changes \u201cvery soon,\u201d Siemiatkowski said. The Swedish payments giant currently has more than 6,500 employees globally. Buy now, pay later companies like Klarna\u2019s, which allow shoppers to spread the cost of purchases over a series of interest-free installments, became wildly popular as online shopping accelerated during the Covid pandemic.\n\nBut investors are getting worried about the sustainability of the sector\u2019s growth as consumers tighten their purse strings amid rising inflation and an increase in borrowing costs. Affirm, the biggest BNPL provider in the U.S., has lost nearly three quarters of its stock market value since the start of the year. The layoff announcement comes after media reports last week said Klarna is set to lose a third of its market value in a new round of funding. The privately held company was last valued at $46 billion in an investment led by SoftBank. Siemiatkowski said Klarna\u2019s decision to reduce staffing numbers was one of the \u201chardest\u201d decisions in the company\u2019s history, but that it was necessary to stay \u201claser-focused on what really will make us successful going forward.\u201d \u201cWhile crucial to stay calm in stormy weather, it\u2019s also crucial not to turn a blind eye to reality,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are seeing now in the world is not temporary or short-lived, and hence we need to act.\u201d Many tech companies that flourished during the Covid pandemic are now taking steps to cut down on costs as investors sour on the sector due to concerns over rising interest rates and declining market liquidity.

{"title": "Optics vs reality in Tesla", "selftext": "Disclosure: I am long Tesla stock.\n\nI think Tesla over the next several months is going to offer an absolute masterclass in how badly optics can become disassociated with reality. \n\nI\u2019m not talking about the usual questions and debates people in the investing world have over valuation. What I\u2019m talking about is the increasing mainstream attention to the company itself as a result of Elon being Elon.\n\nWhen I first started investing in Tesla (late 2019) nobody in my life or on my normal social media ever talked about it outside the context of a political push for EVs. Now, every single day I come across leftists on all my social medias who are not part of the investing world pushing very poorly thought out talking points about why they\u2019re doomed.\n\nThe major new talking point is how Elon is alienating his consumer base by criticizing the Democratic Party. Republicans hate EVs, and now democrats won\u2019t buy them, so who is going to buy his cars now?\n\nThis is a crazy oversimplification of the issue. There is no unified Republican opposition to EVs. Republicans tend to not believe in man-made climate change and therefore do not support government mandates to electrify the auto industry based on the rationale that we have to save the world by doing so. But that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t buy EVs. If EVs can beat ICE vehicles in the market, that\u2019s totally fine. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that EVs are superior value propositions at comparable price points for most consumers. The idea that Republican consumers are going to make irrational value judgements and refuse to adopt EVs because they don\u2019t believe in climate change is just absurd. Yes, there is a small subset of the population that will resist the transition to EVs, but these are usually the motor head \u201ccar guy\u201d types whose rationale is \u201cI like to feel the engine\u201d which is a niche market in the first place and will in no way be a drag on the overall trend of mainstream adoption.\n\nThe second thing to point out is that the supposed alienation of Tesla\u2019s consumer base is likely to be greatly exaggerated. Most democratic voters are not going to base their consumer purchase decisions on what the CEO thinks of their preferred political party. The extremely loud group who swear they will never buy a Tesla because Elon is a fascist is a very small slice even of Democratic voters. It reminds me a lot of how people on the right swore that the NFL was done for because of boycotts by middle aged white people over the national anthem stuff, or when every leftist I knew was adamant that they\u2019d never eat at chick fil a again. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the issue that most of America doesn\u2019t even identify strongly with either party. This talking point assumes that America is roughly 90% either Republican or Democrat but in reality most don\u2019t even vote in the first place and most who do consider themselves moderates. \n\nFurther still, it\u2019s worth noting that Tesla\u2019s international market which will care even less about US politics is as big if not bigger than their US market. \n\nBut this idea is going to be given face-value credibility when Tesla\u2019s Q2 numbers show a decrease in deliveries quarter over quarter and every angry leftist and every Tesla bear latches onto the headlines and says \u201cSEE! Elon starts getting political and Tesla\u2019s sales drop.\u201d But they\u2019ll fail to point out (and casual observers will fail to realize) that Q2 weakness will be entirely explained by the Shanghai shutdown. So for an entire quarter the people saying that Elon is sinking the ship will appear correct. And then Q3 will come around and Tesla will resume its crazy growth trajectory as Shanghai gets back to (relative) normal and Berlin and Austin continue to ramp. Then at the end of next year when Tesla delivers like 2 million vehicles we\u2019ll look back at this and laugh at all the failed doomsday predictions.", "id": "ux1us4", "created_utc": 1653428534.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "Optics over reality is literally the Tesla business model.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "What I was going to say lol.

Morgan Stanley warns stocks could fall another 10%", "selftext": "Earnings expectations for U.S. companies are \"deteriorating rapidly,\" according to a report from Morgan Stanley, which could exacerbate the stock market's year-to-date losses.\n\n\u201cReduced earnings estimates and unexpected negative economic factors could lead to a further 5% to 10% decline in the S&P 500,\u201d Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a note on Monday. \"The U.S. now has the fastest deterioration in corporate earnings expectations of any region due to the severe 'over-earnings' of the past two years.\"\n\nU.S. stocks have tumbled this year amid high inflation, which the Federal Reserve is trying to tame by raising interest rates. The S&P 500 had fallen 16.6% this year as of Monday, and was on the verge of falling into a bear market last week.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of higher interest rates and high inflation, \"positive earnings news has played a key role in mitigating losses in U.S. stocks,\" Shalett said.\n\nIn Shalett's view, \"2022 was supposed to be a harvest year.\" Following the outbreak, U.S. stocks have had \"extraordinary\" results in 2020 and 2021 thanks to record government stimulus. But the Federal Reserve is now tightening monetary policy to cool the economy to rein in the soaring cost of living.\n\nThe \u201cre-pricing of stocks was driven by a reset of inflation expectations, Fed rate hikes and balance sheet reductions,\u201d she wrote. \"Profits and economic forecasts have to be adjusted, and forecasts based on the level of a V-shaped recovery in 2020-2021 are inaccurate because that level is unsustainable.\"\n\nThat \"revaluation\" has already begun, Shalett said. She sees last week's underperformance in the retail and tech sectors \"because of excess inventory, high costs and weakening price-related demand\" as a case in point.", "id": "uwqaeo", "created_utc": 1653397256.0, "score": 1611, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 327, "comments": [{"body": "If there was only 10% to go before the S&P started either being even or trending upward for a while I'd be pretty happy.", "score": 771, "replies": [{"body": "Same thought.

That happened like clockwork, this year.

The reason why that inflow has any impact is that volume is light in the Summer because institutional investors and professionals tend to check out for vacation. I expect to see some heavy volatility in the 3rd week of June as retail traders will have a big impact in the light volume and they will be reamed by options traders & day traders if inflows that generally lead to a small Summer rally leads to a tech/growth bear market rally in early June. \n\nThe 3rd week of June is both OP Ex week & end of quarter.
